Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station. 272 p. The Seventh World Wilderness Congress met in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 2001. The symposium on science and stewardship to protect and sustain wilderness values was one of several symposia held in conjunction with the Congress. The papers contained in this proceedings were presented at thissymposium and cover seven topics: state-of-knowledge on protected areas issues in South Africa; traditional and ecological values of nature; wilderness systems and approaches to protection; protection of coastal/marine and river/lake wilderness; spiritual benefits, religious beliefs, and new stories; personaland societal values of wilderness; and the role of science, education, and collaborative planning in wilderness protection and restoration. Keywords: biodiversity, protected areas, tourism, economics, recreation, wildlife, alien species, spiritual values Alan E. Watson is the Research Social Scientist with the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute and Executive Editor for science for the International Journal of Wilderness. The Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute is an interagency (Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey) unit administered by the USDA ForestService, Rocky Mountain Research Station. The Leopold Institute is located on the campus of the University of Montana, Missoula. Dr. Watson's research interests are primarily in understanding the values humans associate with wilderness, experience quality, and conflicts arising from divergentorientations toward wilderness resources. Besides national U.S. leadership in wilderness social science issues, as a Fulbright Scholar and a Senior Fulbright Protected Area Specialist, Dr. Watson has been most active in research in other Circumpolar North countries and in South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. Janet Sproull is a Project Coordinator at the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute. Ms. Sproull co-coordinated technical symposia for the 6 th and 7th World Wilderness Congresses (India and South Africa) and assisted with compilation of Congress proceedings. More recently, she helped with compilation of the Wilderness in the Circumpolar North proceedings. As a dedicated conservationist, Ms. Sproull donates her time and expertise to several community organizations, including local landtrust, Save Open Space (SOS); the Missoula Parks, Recreation and Urban Forestry Board; and the Mount Jumbo Advisory Committee. Grant writing efforts by Ms. Sproull have provided funding for improvements at City Wetlands Parks and for activation of an Integrated Pest Management Plan for twoSOS conservation easements. She is currently developing a series of interpretive signs featuring Watchable Wildflowers of Waterworks Hill.Science and Stewardship to Protect and Sustain Wilderness Values: Seventh World Wilderness Congress Symposium 2001 November 2-8 Port Elizabeth, South Africa Compilers: Alan Watson Janet SproullConcerning the front cover background photo of the BAOBAB tree: \"It is said, briefly, that the Great Spirit had created the Universe for reasons that nobody must endeav- our to fathom.

While the wilderness movement in South Africa is heavily connected to the KwaZulu-Natal Prov-ince, in the true spirit of the 21 st century, the Mayor and residents of Port Elizabeth, in the Nelson Mandella Municipal- ity, welcomed this world event, associated symposia, andWilderness Summit on behalf of the South African people. The papers included in this proceedings represent the knowl- edge brought together and shared at the symposium entitled\"Science and Stewardship to Protect and Sustain Wilderness Values: Seventh World Wilderness Congress Symposium on Research, Management, and Allocation.\" Every paper in thisproceedings received peer edit by at least one of the compilers and one other reviewer. All copyrights are released by contrib- uting authors except as noted on the articles.The Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute and the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station areproud to cooperate in compiling and distributing this publica- tion. We thank the International Programs Office of the Forest Service for strong support of this symposium and this proceed-ings through contributions toward travel for U.S. managers and for publication expenses. The Wild Foundation of South Africa exhibited patience and leadership in coordinating facilities andschedules. And we thank the Rocky Mountain Research Sta- tion Publishing Services Staff for an outstanding job, once again, of editing and publishing these proceedings. We hope that the knowledge compiled here will contribute to understanding the links between wilderness places and human communities around the world. Congress delegates from over40 countries will be forever changed by the presentations, heightened cultural awareness, and the friendship shared in South Africa at this World Wilderness Congress. Sustainabilityof wilderness and human communities into the next century will depend upon the spirit created here. The Compilers, August 2003 vContents Page 1.

Proc.RMRS-P-27. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014The Umfolozi Wilderness Area, one of the first wilder- ness areas in South Africa, was administratively set aside within the southern half of the Umfolozi Game Reserve in 1958, by resolution of the Natal Parks Board. Originally, it was 12,500 ha (48miles 2) in extent, and its management was not consistent with inter- nationally accepted principles. Today, the wilderness area is 32,000 ha (124 miles2) in extent, and management is aimed at preserv ing the wilderness resource by employing wilderness-sensitive programs detailed in a specific wilderness area management plan. The suc- cesses achieved in the wilderness planning and management ap-proach used for the Umfolozi Wilderness Area over the last 6 years is presented as a model that can be used to manage existing and candidate wilderness areas in other parts of Africa. This model isbeing used to draw up wilderness management plans for wilderness areas in three formally protected areas in Southern Africa and a private game reserve in the Eastern Cape. Introduction ____________________ Wilderness conservation in Africa began with the Umfolozi and St. Lucia Wilderness Areas being administrativelyzoned within the Umfolozi and St. Lucia Game Reserves in the mid-1950s by the Natal Parks Board, which legally mandated for the conservation of wildlife (nature conserva-tion) in the Province of Natal. The Umfolozi Wilderness Area was originally 12,000 ha (48 miles 2) in extent and located in the southern half of the Umfolozi Game Reserve. The wilderness did not receive any special management, which resulted in management prac- tices that were inconsistent with accepted wilderness con-cepts and management philosophy. Today, the Umfolozi Wilderness Area is 32,000 ha (124 miles 2) in extent, and management is specifically directed at preserving the wil-derness resource.Planning and Management of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: A Model for Managing African Wilderness Areas W. D. Densham A. J. Conway The Umfolozi Wilderness Area has never enjoyed legal protection and as such has been at the mercy of the reserve administrators and managers of the day. The first reservemanagement plan produced in the mid-1970s had no special management prescriptions for the wilderness area. It was not until the mid-1980s, when a combined management planfor the Hluhluwe and Umfolozi Game Reserves was devel- oped, that some reference to the wilderness was made. The section dealing with the wilderness zone was inadequateand sketchy, with little concern for preservation of the wilderness resource. The Natal Parks Board adopted the first dedicated wilder- ness plan for the Umfolozi Wilderness Area on September 29, 1995. The plan outlined the management of the area using internationally accepted management principles thatwere adapted to suit the Umfolozi Wilderness Area condi- tions. This paper discusses the approach taken in the plan- ning and management of the wilderness and proposes thatit is an excellent model to be followed for existing andcandidate wilderness areas in Africa. Location and Historical Perspectives ___________________ The Umfolozi Wilderness Area is situated in Hluhluwe- Umfolozi Park in KwaZulu-Natal of the Republic of South Africa (fig. 1). The park is 96,453 ha (372 miles2) in extent, of which the wilderness area is 32,000 ha (124 miles2) and located in the south part of the protected area (fig. 2) The Umfolozi Wilderness Area was administratively zoned in 1958, and the Eleventh Annual Report of the Natal Parks Board for the year April 1958 to March 1959 records the following: Some 12,150 ha were set aside by the Board as a wilderness area, in which all forms of motor traffic are prohibited, and only rangers, or visitors on foot accompanied by a ranger, are permitted to enter. However, the rhino capture team was allowed to continue its operations using vehicles in the wilderness area. Although several unsuccessful attempts were made, the Umfolozi Wilderness Area was never officially proclaimed wilderness, despite the fact that the Natal Nature Conserva-tion Ordinance No. 11 of 1974 was amended in the 1980s to allow for the designation of wilderness areas. Compilation of management plans for the Reserves in Natal began in the 1970s. The Umfolozi Wilderness Area4 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Densham and Conway Planning and Management of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa:... received no special attention, and the management action developed for the rest of the Reserve was also applied to thewilderness area. As a result of a general revision of management plans in the 1980s, a Combined Management Plan for the Hluhluwe and Umfolozi Game Reserves was prepared and approved by the Natal Parks Board on May 24, 1985. The wilderness areacontinued to be managed along with the rest of the Reserves with very little reference to the special management actions and uses to conserve the wilderness quality and resources ofsolitude and naturalness. Management action was confined to the following statements. In Chapter 9, Zonation, the Wilderness zone was de- scribed as: Area characterized by lack of access roads open to the public. There are two sub zones recognized: Class I: Pristine area Area characterized by essentially unmodified natural envi- ronment. No facilities for comfort or convenience of their user are provided. Spacing of groups informal and dispersed, nomarked paths permitted. Motorized use within the area not permitted. Class II: Wild area Area characterized by a predominantly unmodified natu- ral environment. Rustic facilities are provided but kept to aminimum, such as, bush camp, toilet, and campsite. Spacing of groups formalized by use of paths and designated overnight sites. Motorized transport limited to service tracks, but maybe excluded in some areas.Under t he heading, \"Implications of this visitor use zonation for management and research,\" the following wasrecorded: Wilderness Zone There are no areas that could be classed as Pristine Areas, and the category of Wilderness Class II: Wild Area applies... ...In this area, visitors will be able to enjoy a 'wilderness type' experience, and due to low visitor density that is essential forthis wilderness experience the ecosystem within this area will receive minimum human disturbance. These statements, by implication, allowed access to the wilderness area by vehicles for management purposes. This was a grave threat to the wilderness resource at the time. The rhino and game capture teams were allowed to con- tinue to use vehicles to remove surplus wildlife species from the wilderness area. In the below-average rainfall years of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the management teamgraded roads into the wilderness area to facilitate easier game capture and culling operations. It also allowed for fairly sophisticated overnight trail camps in the wildernessarea to be developed, which remain to this day. It wasn't until September 1995 that a dedicated and comprehensive wilderness management plan was approvedby the Natal Parks Board. The plan forms part of the overall management and concept development plans for the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park. The plan sets out the permissiblemanagement action of the biophysical components and visi- tor uses, with set limits of acceptable change in the differentFigure 1\u2014the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park shown in relation to South Africa. USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 5Densham and Conway Planning and Management of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa:... wilderness zones. It is interesting to note that during this exercise pristine areas were found to exist. The Umfolozi Wilderness Area still does not have legal protection. However, the new KwaZulu-Natal Nature Con-servation Management Act (No. 9 of 1997) does provide for the proclamation of wilderness areas within protected ar- eas. It is hoped that as soon as the regulations have beenpromulgated, all administratively zoned wilderness areas will be proclaimed (Densham 1999).General Approach to Wilderness Area Management _______________ The tension between the wilderness concept (an absence or minimum of human intervention) and the need for man- agement (the control of nature) has been researched by a number of authors (for example, Bainbridge 1984; Hendeeand others 1990). It is generally agreed that once wilderness areas have been proclaimed or administratively designated,Figure 2\u2014The Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park showing the Umfolozi Wilderness Area. 6 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Densham and Conway Planning and Management of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa:... they need \"formal professional management for their long term conservation.\" This will eliminate uncoordinated andhaphazard management action and will lead to long-term direction, continuity, stability, and an adaptive manage- ment style. Protected area management plans reflect thelegal aspects (where this is applicable), the management authority's policies and procedures, and the specific pro- tected area objectives and management actions in a system-atic framework (Hendee and others 1990, Chapter 8). In respect to wilderness area management plans, the same approach is required, but the focus is on the minimal humanintervention to achieve the desired outcomes of manage- ment action and uses. Generally, wilderness plans in developed countries focus on recreational use, with little specific reference to the biophysical components. In South Africa, wilderness areas are often relatively small (less than 30,000 ha [116 miles 2]) and are usually part of a larger protected area. Generally, they do not contain whole ecosystems and are biodiversity islands in a landscape heavily impacted by monocultureagriculture, peri-urban and rural community development, and other forms of land uses. It is vitally important to develop plans that address all biodiversity components (whichis the protected area's primary objective) and recreational uses if the wilderness resource is to be conserved. In drawing up management plans, a multidisciplinary team approach should be adopted involving planners, pro- tected area management and community conservation staff, and ecologists. The involvement of the public at an earlystage is an essential part of the development of the manage- ment plan in order to identify all the issues and concerns. Management plans must have clear objectives and achiev- able goals that are measurable to evaluate the success orfailure of management actions. They ought to provide a record of past and present management actions and results. Wilderness management plans should provide the followingguiding principles: Ensure that human intervention is kept to the absolute minimum. Allow natural processes to operate freely. Manage wilderness as a whole entity together with therest of the protected area. Only implement imperative management action whilepreserving the wilderness experience of solitude, sur-prise, discovery, and spirituality. Ensure that the \"minimum test\" and minimum regula-tion are employed rather than the least expensive oreasiest actions. Ensure that where exceptions have to be catered for that these do not reduce the wilderness experience signifi-cantly (Krumpe and others 1986). In addition, the \"minimum tool\" and \"leave-no-trace\" principles must also be applied to all intended programs. Umfolozi Wilderness Area Management Plan Model _________ The Umfolozi Wilderness Area Management Plan is a separate document, which guides the area's managementand use (Conway and others 2000) to protect the wilderness resource. Management needs of the wilderness area areserved well by this model. It is also being used as a reference document by planning and management teams in the draw- ing up of wilderness plans for the Greater St. Lucia WetlandPark and the Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg Mountain Park World Heritage Sites Wilderness Areas, the Waterberg Plateau Park Wilderness Area in Namibia, and a wildernessarea in the Shamwari Private Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape. The location of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area in the southern third of the park presents management chal- lenges. The wilderness area boundary follows the park boundary on the west, south, and east sides, with a narrowbuffer zone (Wilderness Support Zone) (fig. 3). External influences are extremely difficult to control or mitigate against, which impacts on the solitude. These influences arethe Vryheid-Richards Bay coal railway line, Eskom's rural electrification, and the rapid growth of rural homesteads. More recently in South Africa, the volume of air traffic overprotected areas has become a major disturbance factor. Management Plan Format The format developed for the plan addresses management needs for recreational use and biodiversity preservation of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area (table 1). Figure 3\u2014The Umfolozi Game Reserve and Wilder- ness Area Zoning. USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 7Densham and Conway Planning and Management of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa:... Aims of the Wilderness Management Plan Following are the aims of the management plan: To provide a comprehensive management plan for the effective management and sustainable utilization of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area. To refine a management philosophy that can be tested and evaluated through dialogue with wilderness man- agers and other interested parties. To gain understanding, acceptance, and support of a management philosophy by wilderness managers, us ers,and outdoor organizations that, hopefully, will extend beyond Umfolozi to other organizations that administerwilderness areas. To direct pioneering into the development of alterna- tive management methods for essential wildernessoperations. To secure, for all the people of South Africa, of thepresent and future generations, the benefits of an en-during resource of wilderness. To maintain the pristine character of the landscape andthe opportunities for solitude it provides. Objectives of Wilderness Management The management plan uses the 16 management prin- ciples developed by the United States Forest Service (Krumpe and others 1986) as guidelines for the manage- ment of recreational uses. Reserve and Wilderness Zonation Zonation of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area and adjacent areas of the park follows the U.S. Forest Service Recre- ational Opportunity Spectrum and Wilderness Opportunity Spectrum approaches. It is in keeping with the Parks Con-cept Development Plan zonation of the whole protected area. The Umfolozi Wilderness Area is zoned into three oppor- tunity classes\u2014semiprimitive, primitive, and pristine\u2014witha Wilderness Support Zone (fig. 3). It is recognized that although external (and to a lesser extent internal) influences impact on the wilderness resources of solitude and natural-ness, the area does offer a valuable wilderness experience forvisitors. The pristine areas are confined to those portions of the wilderness where the sounds and sights of man are rarely noticed (for example, in valleys). There is a \"Wilder-ness Support Zone\" that buffers the Umfolozi Wilderness Area and its resources from outside influences. It also allows for the provision of basic management infrastructures suchas Ranger outposts and the park boundary fence line and maintenance roads. Definitions of these zones are reflected in table 2. The descriptions give managers a clear statement of the in- tended characteristics for each zone so that management actions and uses can be determined. All sensitive sites or areas of biodiversity or cultural importance are taken into consideration when delineating the z ones to prevent possible conflicts with proposed recreational activities. These zonedareas are mapped so that they are protected. In the planning process, the following aspects were taken into consideration for each zone and the appropriate stan-dards set for monitoring purposes. The intention was to reduce the evidence of human intervention and control visitor use impacts on each zone. Scenery Setting This determines the intended ambiance visitors can ex- pect to experience in the area (table 3). It also places constraints on management actions in each zone to ensure that the wilderness experience is not impaired.Table 1\u2014Wilderness management plan format. 1. DEFINITIONS 2. VALUES 3.

Table 2\u2014Wilderness zone definitions (abbreviated). Zone definitions 1Pristine The purest form of wilderness possible is characterized by having absolutely no sight, as far as the eye can see, or sound of man (except for passing aircraft and trains in the distance), or visual evidence of man having manipulatedthe ecosystem and landscape in any way and at any time past or present. 2Primitive Characterized by having no evidence of past or present human manipulation of the immediate ecosystem and landscape although views of human habitation, etc., are visible in the distance (that is, more than 10 km [6.2 mi] away). 3Semiprimitive Intervention by man in terms of past nonwilderness manipulation is present in forms such as old tracks and settlements. Present evidence of wilderness recreation facilities and users that are nonpermanent and wilderness compatible. 4a Wilderness This, and the following zone, forms a support zone transitional buffer between Semiprimitivenonwilderness (nonmotorized) and Roaded Natural. The influence of man's activities is becoming evident. This is limited to the minimum requirements to effectively administer and provide law enforcement to the wilderness area. Only such structures, infrastructure, and ecological management activities as deemed essential are permitted. Area is characterized by a predominantly natural or natural- appearing environment. Interaction between users is low, but there is often evidence of other users. The area is managed in such a way that minimum onsite controlsand restrictions may be present, but are subtle. Motorized use is not permitted. The zone includes all the area 500 m (547 yd) from both banks of the White Umfolozi River and the southern bank of the BlackUmfolozi River. Evidence of pollution from inhabitants upstream is low to moderate.Impact of adjacent land use is moderate.Table 3\u2014Wilderness scenery settings (abbreviated).

No motorized vehicles are permitted to enter into the wilderness except for emergency \"casevac\" operations, whenit is necessary to remove black or white rhino (fig. 4). Helicopters are used to immobilize and airlift the animals out of the wilderness area (fig. 5). This is considered to be the\"minimum tool\" for this program, as the use of vehicles on the ground can leave visible tracks for several years thus detracting from the wilderness resource. While the captureoperations are being conducted, the trail operations are con- ducted in sectors well away from the capture areas (table 7).Management of Fauna and Flora Management of the park's fauna and flora is natural- process based. These processes are allowed to operate withminimum intervention. The impaired or absent processes are simulated by appropriate management action and by using the \"minimum tool\" principle. The plan sets out how management of the important fauna and flora components will be implemented. To illustrate this, the methods of game censuring and removals, alienplant eradication, fire management, and other conservation related programs are described in detail. The results of all these programs are evaluated at biannual wilderness man-agement steering committee meetings. Should changes to any of the programs be necessary, these are made to the appropriate section soon after the meetings. In this way, theplan is kept alive and relevant. It is accepted that these actions will take longer to com- plete and be more expensive, and results from the monitor-ing programs will not have the desired confidence limits. Since the inception of the wilderness management plan these aspects have not resulted in any serious concerns. Public Involvement At the time when the plan was initially drawn up, it was required to involve the public in the process. However, the plan is now steered by a Wilderness Management Steering Committee that meets biannually. The committee member-ship is comprised of the relevant regional and park manage- ment staff, as well as members from the public. With the recent formation of a Local Board for the Park, a member ofthis Board will also sit on the Committee. The task of this committee is to ensure that management and visitor use of the Umfolozi Wilderness Area is in accor- dance with the plan and that the wilderness experience forthe visitor is maintained. Conclusions____________________ The Umfolozi Wilderness Management Plan is the first dedicated document that clearly sets out management phi-losophy and procedures. Since its inception in September 1995, it has been successfully used to conserve the wilder- ness resource in the Umfolozi Wilderness Area. This modelis being used as a reference document in the drawing up of wilderness management plans for the wilderness areas in the Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park and the Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg Mountain Park World Heritage Sites, the Namibian Waterberg Plateau Park, and the proposed wil- derness area in the Shamwari Private Game Reserve. It willalso serve as a useful model for the preparation of similar plans for other existing and candidate wilderness areas in South Africa and other African States.Figure 4\u2014Preparing an immobilized white rhino for airlift out of the Wilderness Area.

Besides containing the majority of the Cape Floral Kingdom (CFK), it also includes significant portionsof the Karoo Succulent and the Thicket Biomes. The primary goal of nature conservation is the maintenance of biodiversity. This can only be achieved through collaborative holistic planning and coop-eration. The Cape Action Plan for the Environment is in the process of achieving this. This plan is supported by several other initiatives including nomination for World Heritage Site status for the CFK. Due to ever-increasing development pressures it is essential to have the necessary planning principles and plans in place to prevent unwise utilization of resources. The Western Cape Nature Conser-vation Board's wilderness policy revision is part of the broad planning initiative to balance wilderness and infrastructure. The various aspects that relate to wilderness qualities are discussed andplaced in context with the overall objective to protect the core conser- vation areas by encouraging appropriate peripheral development. Introduction ____________________ The Western Cape Province of South Africa is extremely rich in terrestrial and marine biodiversity and contains the greater part of the Cape Floral Kingdom (CFK), one of sixfloral kingdoms in the world. Covering less than 0.04 percent of the Earth's land surface, the CFK, for its size, is unrivaled in global terms for its extraordinary diversity of species.Some 9,000 species of plants occur here. Of these, 6,000 are endemic (Goldblatt and Manning 2000). The invertebrates, although at this stage not as well studied, appear to rival theplants when it comes to levels of endemism. The CFK has been identified by Mittermeier and others (1998) as one of 25 global biodiversity hotspots. The adjacent Succulent KarooWilderness Conservation in the Western Cape Province, South Africa: Where WeAre Going N. Guy Palmer Maretha E. ShroyerNigel Wessels is also identified by these authors as a biodiversity hotspot of global importance. The organisms inhabiting the oceans (Atlantic to the west and Indian to the south and east) are as important from a biological perspective as the terrestrial plants and animals.The presence and interaction of cold and warm sea masses have brought about a high degree of marine biological diversity and endemism; for example, 11,000 marine ani-mals have been recorded along the South African shores, with 3,500 being endemic (Griffiths and Prochazka 2000). Threats to the future of this unique area come from the spread of invasive alien plants and fish, expanding agricul- ture and urbanization, pollution and overextraction of wa- ter, overexploitation of specific marine and terrestrial spe-cies, and soil erosion. As a consequence of these threats, over 1,400 Western Cape plant species are listed in the Red Data Book, the highest known concentration of such species in theworld (Cowling and Hilton-Taylor 1994). Several heavilyexploited marine species, such as linefish and abalone, have declined to dangerously low levels (Griffiths and Prochazka 2000). Of the 19 freshwater fish species indigenous to theCFK, 14 are threatened, including 12 which are endangered. As with the flora, there is high level of endemicity in the fish fauna, 16 of the 19 species being reliant on effective conser-vation of the region for their survival (Impson and others 1999). Protected Areas and Major Conservation Planning Initiatives ______________________ The Western Cape Nature Conservation Board (WCNCB) manages an area of 677,000 hectares (1.6729e+06 acres), comprising \u00c5 100 properties/land \"parcels,\" forming theprovincial nature reserves, plus 38,000 ha (93,900 acres) comprising marine reserves. This includes four Wilderness Areas with a total area of 116,000 hectares (286,642 acres).These are Cederberg, Groot Winterhoek, Boosmanbos, and Doringrivier. In the Western Cape, there are also six na- tional parks managed by South African National Parks(SANParks), with a total area of 87,000 hectares (214,982 acres), plus 53,000 hectares (130,966 acres) represented by marine reserves. T here are nine marine reserves with a combined area of 91,000 hectares (224,866 acres). The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry is also respon- sible for nearly 40,000 hectares (98,842 acres) of Indig-enous Forest Reserves in the Southern Cape. In addition to14 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Palmer, Shroyer, and Wessels Wilderness Conservation in the Western Cape Province, South Africa: Where We Are Going conser vation-worthy land managed by national and provin- cial authorities, there are also private and local authoritynature reserves comprising 138,000 hectares (341,005 acres). There are also several initiatives that enhance the conserva- tion status of mainly private land. These are, among others,two proclaimed biosphere reserves, and many conservan- cies, declared mountain catchment areas, and natural heri- tage sites. The area involved in these initiatives is over1,074,000 hectares (2.65391e+06 acres), and is increasing steadily. The combined total for formally and informally protected areas, within the Western Cape, stands at themoment at over two million hectares (4.94211e+06 acres), approximately 15 percent of the land surface. Cape Action Plan for the Environment ___________________ During 1999, the Cape Action Plan for the Environment (CAPE) was initiated with funding supplied by the GlobalEnvironment Facility. Through a participatory process, CAPE has produced a strategy and action plan. The overall objective of the strategy is to secure the conservation of thebiodiversity of the Cape Floral Kingdom, and through this to deliver economic benefits. The strategy comprises three components: (1) conserving biodiversity, (2) promoting sus-tainable use, and (3) strengthening institutions. Specific objectives include: The establishment of an effective reserve network, theenhancement of offreserve conservation, and support for bioregional planning. The development of methods to ensure sustainableyields, the promotion of compliance with laws, the integration of biodiversity concerns with catchment management, and the promotion of sustainable nature-based tourism. The strengthening of institutions, policies, and laws;the enhancement of cooperative governance and com-munity participation; and the support of continued research. These components are integrated into a single, compre- hensive, multifaceted action plan, with priorities clearly identified. The CAPE strategy is aligned with the prioritiesof the South African government, which has committed significant counterpart funding to the program. The key executing agencies that will be responsible for the imple-mentation have drawn up an agreement to ensure effective coordination of the program, and have identified the WCNCB as the lead agency for CAPE (Younge and Ashwell 2000).During the process, many projects were identified that are essential to the realization of the aims of CAPE. One that is central to the achievement of these objectives is the Conser-vation Planning Unit (CPU). This unit will develop an accessible, current, and reliable decision-support system, which will make inputs into bioregional planning and Inte-grated Development Planning. Using Pressey's (1999) Con- servation Plan, it will also have the ability to assist in the decisionmaking process when evaluating options relating toland use or acquisition. Some of the other projects identifiedthat will feed information into the CPU are those looking at remnants of formerly extensive and diverse vegetation types.There is also a program looking specifically at the rivers, their functioning, and associated organisms. A charismatic concept that was given an identity during the CAPE process, when the term was coined, is the estab- lishment of mega reserves. The process had already been initiated several years previously; the original concept,however, having been put forward by Burgers (1990) with the objective being to create conservation areas large enough to ensure that ecological, biological, and evolutionary pro-cesses can continue. The three areas involved are (1) the Olifants River, Cederberg, Tankwa Karoo Klein Karoo region, the greater Baviaanskloof conservation a rea. The lead agent for the first two areas is WCNCB, and the Eastern Cape Department of EconomicAffairs, Environment and Tourism (ECDEAET) is the lead agent for the third. The proposed Cederberg Tankwa Karoo mega reserve lies primarily in the winter rainfall zone of the CFK, spans a west-east gradient from coastal lowlands through moist mountain fynbos to semidesert conditions, and is drained bythe Olifants River system. It also includes the northern extremity of the CFK. The process whereby WCNCB has facilitated the creation of a series of conservancies surround-ing the wilderness area is well advanced. An additional provincial nature reserve, the Matjies River Nature Re- serve, has been created with the financial assistance of theWorld Wildlife Fund of South Africa (WWFSA). Several private nature reserves and a natural heritage site have been declared, which has led to the proposal to create abiosphere reserve, with the Cederberg Wilderness Area (WA) forming the core. The planning for this is well advanced. The proposed Gouritz mega reserve spans a long north- south environmental gradient from the arid Nama Karooover the mountains to the moist coastal lowlands in the south, including representative portions of 14 of the 120 Broad Habitat Units (Cowling and Heijnis 2000). Substan-tial portions of land, especially in the foothills and valley basins of this area, are privately owned, and currently there is a danger that inappropriate land use options could com-promise both conservation and tourism. WCNCB initiatives in this area include the extension of two of the provincial nature reserves (Anysberg and Rooiberg Nature Reserves)\u2014again with the financial assistance of WWF SA, the creation of conservancies, and the proclamation of private nature reserves. The essential process of \"selling\" the idea to thelocal communities is well underway. The proposed Baviaanskloof mega reserve, with ECDEAET as the lead agency, represents the eastern portion of the CFKand includes important moisture, altitudinal, and longitudi- nal gradients. This area has of late received much attention (Boshoff and others 2000) that mirrors the objectives ofCAPE. This has resulted in the drafting of a Memorandum of Understanding to be entered into by the relevant national and Eastern Cape provincial departments. The object of thisexercise is to facilitate cooperation to ensure wise develop- ment and utilization of this vast and relatively unspoiled area.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 15Wilderness Conservation in the Western Cape Province, South Africa: Where We Are Going Palmer, Shroyer, and Wessels World Heritage Site Nomination The WCNCB and SanParks are at present in the final stages of the preparation of a nomination to be submitted tothe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for World Heritage Site status for a series of sites representing the CFK. This process has beendivided into two phases. The first is the responsibility of SanParks and deals with the Cape Peninsula National Park nomination. The second phase is managed by WCNCB andcomprises seven nominated sites. Three of these sites are formally proclaimed wilderness areas, namely, Cederberg (64,000 ha or 158,147 acres), Grootwinterhoek (26,000 ha or64,247 acres), and Boosmansbos (15,000 ha or 37,066 acres) Wilderness Areas. De Hoop Nature Reserve (32,000 ha or 79,074 acres) and Swartberg (112,000 ha or 276,758 acres),consisting of Gamkaskloof Nature Reserve, and Groot Swartberg and Swartberg East State Forests, represent the fourth and fifth sites. The sixth site is referred to as theHottentots Holland Complex (113,000 ha or 279,229 acres) and is made up of four management areas, namely, Limiet- berg, Jonkershoek, Hottentots Holland, and Kogelberg Na-ture Reserves, mostly representing State Forests. The latter forms the core of the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, the first to be proclaimed in South Africa. These six sites are allmanaged by WCNCB. The seventh site is the Baviaanskloof, the majority of which falls in the Eastern Cape, and is effectively theresponsibility of the ECDEAET. These sites were selected and nominated because their attributes complied with two of the four criteria laid down by UNESCO for natural sites,namely: Outstanding example representing significant ongoingecological and biological processes and evolution. The most important and significant natural habitats for the in situ conservation of biological diversity. These nominations have several objectives, of which the first is to secure an enhanced status and international recognition for some of our prime conservation areas. Thisenhanced status will assist the various current initiatives taking place around these sites. These initiatives take many forms, including the establishment of conservancies, privatenature reserves, and biosphere reserves, which act as buff- ers and corridors, or improve the conservation status of altitudinal gradients and, in some cases, rectify impracticalor ecologically inappropriate reserve boundaries. It is be- lieved that these efforts will lead to the increased awareness and appreciation of the value of the biodiversity and thebenefits of being associated with core nature conservation areas. Current Position Regarding WCNCB's Management of Wilderness_____________________ The Western Cape Nature Conservation Board (WCNCB) manages the only four officially designated wilderness areas in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The wilder-ness areas were proclaimed under the Forest Act of 1971,and the management policy for these areas has remained unchanged since its formulation in 1972. Wilderness man-agement, although not a key focus area, forms part of the overall management strategy of WCNCB within the follow- ing parameters\u2014namely the mission statement: The conservation of the Western Cape's unique natural heritage in partnership with all its people, for the welfare, advantage and enjoyment of present and future generations and the so-called vision statement: We strive to become a world leader in conservation. We aim to instill in all our people a deep sense of ownership and pride in our unique natural heritage and a realisation of its intrin- sic and economic value. Nature-based tourism has been identified as one of the key economic activities that can be developed (Younge andAshwell 2000), and the WCNCB is constantly being pres- sured to provide recreational opportunities that correspond with the goals of biodiversity conservation, while also gener-ating economic returns and creating jobs. If not well planned, managed, and monitored, a \"push factor\" for sustainable development in conservation areas could have detrimentaleffects for proclaimed and candidate wilderness areas. The management challenges that the WCNCB faces include the following needs: To undertake an audit of reserves and adjacent land(where relevant) to identify and map areas with highwilderness qualities that could be proclaimed as wilder- ness areas. To decide what recreational activities may be allowed in proclaimed and candidate wilderness areas, both onland and sea. To manage diverse types of adventure and ecotourismactivities over large geographical areas. To obtain adequate funding for the maintenance of wilderness qualities in wilderness areas;. To involve communities in wilderness management with tangible benefits to local people. To promote the wilderness concept among local land-owners whose lands include protection-worthy wilder-ness, particularly where nonwilderness activities rep- resent potentially higher financial returns. To promote the wilderness concept with the public, drawing attention to, among others, the importance of wilderness areas as primary water catchments. Key Questions__________________ The WCNCB needs to evaluate, candidly, its present contribution to the wilderness cause. In this respect, the following questions are relevant: Are our officially proclaimed wilderness areas (WAs) offering genuine high quality wilderness experiences? At present, the answer would generally be negative. This is because our management has not been sufficiently dynamicand because some of the wilderness areas, or portions thereof, did not f ully qualify as wilderness at the time of proclamation. The vast majority of people visiting the wilder-ness areas come a way still not understanding the difference between wilderness areas and other conservation areas. This is mainly because of a lack of effective marketing and16 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Palmer, Shroyer, and Wessels Wilderness Conservation in the Western Cape Province, South Africa: Where We Are Going education and very little difference between the manage- ment of WAs and other reserves. This should not be seen as an entirely negative factor, since the levels of manipulative management and development are generally low. What are our moral obligations to the public with regard to providing opportunities to enjoy wilder- ness experiences? The implication that our wilderness areas should generate more income by marketing them as normal hiking trails, where the overnight shelters are up- graded, where the routes are more regulated, and wheregroup sizes and numbers are increased, could mean that any ability to offer wilderness experiences would effectively be impinged upon. Although it can be argued that we may notbe doing the wilderness cause justice at present, we still have an enormous moral responsibility to provide the people with the opportunity to enjoy genuine wilderness experi-ences. At present, the public may be relatively \"spoilt\" in respect of opportunities for wilderness recreation, but future generations, in a progressively more sophisticated techno- logical society, will proba bly not be as fortunate. One only needs to consider the demand for wilderness and profession- alism in wilderness managem ent in North America to realize how important wilderness areas have become in more devel- oped countries. How then are we, as a management organization, going to do justice to the wilderness movement? A more professional and dynamic approach to wilderness management needs to be adopted. The Way Forward for Wilderness in the Western Cape _______________ We see the way forward as being a three-step process. First, an inventory of the remaining wilderness resources inthe Western Cape, including those areas officially pro- claimed and those having such potential, is needed. The existing wilderness areas must be zoned according to theLimits of Acceptable Change (LAC) and the Wilderness Opportunity Spectrum (WOS), and the candidate areas should, where feasible, be given formal status. Secondly,certain decisions that have yet to be taken after more than two decades (with regard to, for example, the roads and huts) must be taken and implemented. Thirdly, we need to edu-cate the public and market the wilderness experience, not only as a means of generating income, but as a means of fostering support for the conservation of wilderness areas inperpetuity. Step 1: Inventory of Wilderness Quality in the Western Cape An inventory of the wilderness resource in the Western Cape is the first step that needs to be taken in the process of bringing the WCNCB's wilderness management up to the highest possible standard. This exercise could be similar to the approach taken by the Australian Heritage Commission(The National Wilderness Inventory Prog ramme), and by the U.S. Forest Service (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation) (Roggenbuck and others 1990), where wilderness qual ity acrosseach of these countries was mapped using wilderness \"indi- cators,\" such as the following: Remoteness from settlements \u2014how remote an area is from the nearest house, hamlet, or town. Remoteness from access \u2014how remote an area is from established roads or tracks. Apparent naturalness \u2014the degree to which an area is free of all human modifications, including fences, power lines, telephone lines, and radio towers. This indicator must also include visual isolation from anylandscape that has been modified by humans. Biophysical naturalness \u2014the degree to which an area's original plant and animal communities havebeen disturbed by humans. These inventories are used primarily to identify whether areas should be given formal wilderness status, as well as to predict the potential effects on the wilderness resource of proposed peripheral developments. The benefits of a similarinventory for WCNCB are obvious. All conservation areas managed by the WCNCB, including private mountain catch- ment areas, should be evaluated and mapped using a Geo-graphic Information System. The database must not only be regional in nature, but must incorporate fine-scale mapping of the potential zones (according to WOS) within each wil-derness area and potential wilderness areas. Many of the WCNCB existing conservation areas contain potential wilderness areas. Most of these reserves havewilderness zones that are clearly demarcated in their man- agement plans. There have, however, been no efforts to identify further candidate wilderness areas, and there is therisk that they may be lost, due to inappropriate develop-ments, before this exercise is undertaken. As an example, Burgers (1990) pointed out that the De Hoop Nature Reserve has probably the only coastal wilderness area in the south-western Cape, but should tourist facilities be developed in this area, then the wilderness character would be lost\u2014a prediction that has sadly come true. Step 2: Addressing the Current Conflict Points in Our Wilderness Areas Several issues need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Set limits of acceptable impacts through spatial and temporal zonation \u2014Prescriptions in respect to recreational use in the wilderness areas managed by the WCNCB, number of visitors per day, maximum groupsize, and zonation were laid down at the time of the proclamation of these wilderness areas. These prescrip- tions were based on the intuition of managers involvedin the management of these areas at that time. The usage patterns and intensity have, however, increased, and the appropriateness of these prescriptions withregard to their impact on the wilderness resource ur- gently needs to be reassessed. While accepting that recreational impacts are inevitable, we neverthelessneed to assess whether the wilderness experience is being unacceptably detracted from. We therefore need to incorporate elements of the LAC process into themanagement of our wildernesses. This is particularly relevant in the Cederberg Wilderness Area where thereUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 17Wilderness Conservation in the Western Cape Province, South Africa: Where We Are Going Palmer, Shroyer, and Wessels are areas that experience excessive visitation by day and weekend hikers. At present, 50 persons per blockper day are allowed, but this use is concentrated in specific areas. Somehow we need to dissipate use, to lessen intergroup contact, as well as to relieve pressureson popular overnight areas. This obviously has to be done without being too restrictive. The WOS zoning concept should therefore be implemented. The objectiveshould be to rehabilitate degraded areas as well as to preserve the remaining pristine zones. Closure and rehabilitation of management roads \u2014 There are management roads in all four of the WCNCB wilderness areas. Although these roads prove useful to management for fighting wildfires, alien invasive con-trol operations, footpath maintenance, and other man- agement tasks, these tracks compromise the integrity of our wilderness areas. The decision should be taken toclose them off and to rehabilitate if necessary and where feasible. Overnight shelters \u2014The old huts in the Cederberg, Boosmansbos, and Groot Winterhoek Wilderness Areas are not only a contradiction of the wilderness concept, but it is their presence that has led to certain routesbeing marketed as \"weekend trails\" in popular hiking books. This has led to the concentration of users along certain routes and at the sites of the huts, resulting inexcessive intergroup contact and to impacts such as trampling of vegetation and much evidence of human waste. The naturalness and solitude of the wilderness isseverely impinged upon, and the wilderness experience subsequently lost. The argument that these huts are useful for emergencies, such as during storms andsevere cold, is not compelling because personal risk andchallenge associated with adverse weather conditions are appropriate features of the wilderness setting, and it is neither practical nor desirable to eliminate suchrisks. Footpaths \u2014Four issues need to be discussed under this subject: (1) existing, poorly planned, or constructedfootpaths; (2) footpaths that are seldom used; (3) the existence of impromptu footpaths along strong desire lines; and (4) the need for new paths. Surveys, in theform of a mapping exercise, should therefore be con- ducted in each wilderness area to determine the status of existing footpaths in terms of their ecological andvisual impacts, popularity of individual routes, pres- ence of impromptu footpaths, and \"unexplored\" areas. This exercise could be seen as part of the LAC process. Define permissible activities in wilderness ar- eas\u2014Wilderness Areas in the United States generally only allow hiking, horseback riding, climbing, canoeing,and overnight camping. However, \"nonconforming uses\" are also allowed, such as mining, grazing of livestock, hunting, and fishing. These activities, especially min-ing and grazing, from a South African viewpoint appear to be a comp lete contradiction of the wilderness concept, but the issue is unique to the United States (Hendee 1990).Wilderness uses have been defined as ranging back- packing, traditional rockclimbing, canoeing, primi- opportunities, scientific observation, and uses\u2014short day hikes, sport-climbing, and scenery. -Wilderness-independent uses\u2014mining, grazing of livestock, competitive events, and fishing forstocked fish. The demands on the wilderness resource in the Western Cape will undoubtedly intensify over time, and there are likely to be requests for types of recreation that may be incompatible with the wilderness concept. Whattypes of recreation must we then define as wilderness dependent? What will our argument against horses, hunting, and fishing be, for example, when these activi-ties are allowed in American Wilderness Areas? An example of such a request has been made from the sport- climbing fraternity that asked for the designation of asport-climbing area in the Rocklands area of the Cederberg Wilderness Area. Potentially, this activity could generate much income because the area is inter-nationally renowned. How puristic can we afford to be when the area in question is not visually isolated from roads and agricultural landscapes? Toilets \u2014There are valid arguments for and against the provision of toilets in our wilderness areas, especially atpopular overnight sites. They have the advantage of discouraging users from defecating over a wide area. This is problematic because toilet paper is often notproperly covered and, consequently, because of the large number of visitors, there is often much evidence of previous visitation. There is also the risk of waterpollution, with the provision of water being one of themore important social benefits frequently attributed to Western Cape Wilderness Areas. Toilets, however, no matter how primitive, are manmade structures andtherefore represent a civilizing influence. They are also usually obtrusive and have a limited life span. Degraded areas \u2014Here the minimum tool approach must be used with respect to the equipment, material, and techniques used in the rehabilitation process, as well as the control of visitor use\u2014by way of restrictingnumbers or dissipating use, to the closure of routes and campsites. Every proposed rehabilitation project must first be scrutinized to determine its necessity beforeimplementation. The use of natural materials instead of artificial products such as cement, net, and gabions,must be preferred where practical. Degraded areas includeold quarries and sites of gully erosion along footpaths and jeep tracks. Fire management \u2014This is another complicating is- sue, but ideally a natural ignition fire management strategy should be implemented in wilderness areas, or at the very least, a strategy of adaptive interference.The basic objective is to maintain the natural role of fire in the wilderness ecosystem consistent with the safety of persons, property, and other resources. The use offirebelts and block burns in wilderness areas should be avoided. Exotic trees \u2014All exotic trees, even those deemed to have sentimental value, should be removed, as they are incompatible with the wilderness concept. In addition, priority should be given to the control of alien, invasive18 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Palmer, Shroyer, and Wessels Wilderness Conservation in the Western Cape Province, South Africa: Where We Are Going trees in wilderness areas above those in areas of lesser conservation status. Step 3: Education and Communication The Leave No Trace (LNT) concept revolves around edu- cating wilderness visitors, prior to their entering wilderness areas, in outdoor skills and ethics. The emphasis is on low- impact or no-trace hiking and camping skills that reducetrampling, multiple trailing, shortcutting across switchbacks, littering, and other physical impacts. The principles of \"pack it in, pack it out\" and \"properly dispose of what you cannotpack out\" are central to the concept. It also addresses social impacts related to trail etiquette and consideration of other users seeking silence and solitude. The motivation for the appointment of a wilderness officer is to appoint a person who is dedicated to leading wilderness trails, educating the public, monitoring ecological and socialconditions within wilderness areas, acting as a liaison with other wilderness authorities and NGO's, keeping abreast of international wilderness management trends, and trainingstaff. As a means of fostering and encouraging public support for our wilderness areas, as well as generating income, trailssimilar to those run by the Wilderness Leadership School, the South African National Parks Board, and the KwaZulu- Natal Nature Conservation Services should be organized inour wilderness areas. It will be important to accommodate political and community leaders as a means of lobbying for the wilderness cause, while also targeting corporate leadersfor financial support. The wilderness officer will be respon-sible for organizing and leading these trails. Our communications section could mount a \"Wilderness Appreciation\" campaign, which would educate the public inrespect to what wil derness is; what its social benefits are; the principles of the LNT concept; as well as marketing our wilderness areas as pl aces where personal risks and challenges associated wi th remote, isolated landscapes, rough terrain, and adverse weather conditions can still be experienced. Proposed Policy for Managing Wilderness Resources ___________ The Western Cape Nature Conservation Board, recog- nizing that: Wilderness is the most remote and pristine setting on the continuum of landscape settings. The wilderness experience is a distinct psychological resource, which offers incomparable opportunities for character build ing, stress therapy, and spiritual communion. Naturalness and solitude are the two key conditions oftrue wilderness. and realizing that: Freedom of movement and spontaneity, together with personal risk and challenge associated with remote, isolated landscapes, adverse weather conditions, andphysical features, are appropriate features of the wil- derness setting.There is an enormous moral obligation to provide the people of South Africa with the opportunity to benefitfrom a true wilderness experience. undertakes to: Actively seek to identify the de facto remaining wilder- ness areas in the Western Cape and pursue statutoryprotection for them. Incorporate the fundamental principles of the wilder-ness concept into the management of all our wildernessareas. Involve the public in the development and implementa-tion of wilderness management plans. Base the management of our wilderness areas on the Limits of Acceptable Change planning framework. Remove all infrastructure, where possible, from the wilderness areas. Only permit wilderness-dependent recreation in thewilderness areas. Use the minimum tool approach in respect to manage- ment activities and visitor control. Where practical, practice the natural ignition fire man- agement system in the wilderness areas. Remove all exotic trees from wilderness areas. Educate the public in terms of the principles associatedwith the \"Leave No Trace\" concept. Promote support for wilderness through the organiza-tion of trails for political and corporate leaders. Conclusion_____________________ The primary objective of all these initiatives is the main- tenance of the biodiversity in the Western Cape Province, including the CFK, succulent Karoo, and thicket biomes.There are, however, several other extremely important reasons for these plans. Due to ever-increasing development pressures, it is essential to have the necessary planningprinciples and plans in place to prevent unwise utilization of resources. For these plans to be effective, they have to be the product of a collaborative process; CAPE is such a process,where all interested and affected parties have participated and political support has been obtained. The conservation bodies are, however, under continual pressure to generatefunds, and the temptation to undertake inappropriate devel- opment, for the sake of fund generation, must be guarded against. It is believed that the CAPE process, along with theplanning and legislation already in place, will go a long way toward the achievement of these goals. It is felt, however, that the revised wilderness policy will contribute signifi-cantly toward the maintenance and enhancement of not only proclaimed wilderness areas, but all conservation areas for the simple reason that the principles and guidelines set outin the policy will be equally applicable to these areas. These principles and guidelines must be used to ensure that the wide diversity of nature-based opportunities are recognized and wisely exploited. The objectives are numerous, but possibly the most important would be to raise the level of awareness of the diversity of the area, and its value, if wisely managed, to the local communities. The underlying principle guiding wilderness management should always be to protect the core conservation areas by encouraging appro priateUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 19Wilderness Conservation in the Western Cape Province, South Africa: Where We Are Going Palmer, Shroyer, and Wessels peripheral development. The LAC process will be critical to the achievement of the desired state of the environment. Finally, the answer to the question on where we are going is that the WCNCB supports wilderness. We are involved in a range of projects, have formed various partnerships to-ward expanding conservation land, and have also revised our wilderness policy. Hopefully, we will contribute to the concept of \"Keeping Wilderness Wild\" in the Western Cape,one of the most biodiverse places on earth.

It consists of four designated wilderness areas (including the first wilderness area to be legally designated in the country), which makeup about 48 percent of the park's total area. The park was recently added to the World Heritage List, as both a Natural and a Cultural Site. The KwaZulu-Natal Town and Regional Planning Commissionhas implemented an investigation to determine whether there is a need to protect the natural beauty and high scenic values in private and communal land in the peripheries of the park, in view of itsvalue for present and potential future tourism development. A planning project was undertaken that recommended a zoning sys- tem, based on the Seville Strategy of the United Nations Educa-tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which makes provision for a gradation of intensity of development away from the eastern boundary of the park. The system includes twoprimary zones, including a Buffer Zone immediately adjacent to the park. A further planning project has recently been undertaken to more precisely define the extent and functions of the Buffer Zone.This is the first such initiative to formally establish a zoning system, which will be entrenched in legislation and regional plans. This paper discusses the expected benefits that will be provided by theproposed Buffer Zone for the protection of the integrity of the park and its inner wilderness system, as well as benefits for landowners and communities resident within or adjacent to the zone by theprovision of tourism development opportunities immediately adja- cent to the park. Control measures will be put in place to limit the scale and location of such development, promote retention of envi-ronmental quality, and limit negative impacts on the park and wilderness system. Also discussed are measures to be implemented to promote collaboration between park authorities and private andcommunal landowners. The eventual outcome of this initiative could be the formation of a system of Biosphere Reserves in the entire peripheries of the park.Establishment of Buffer Zone in the Peripheries of Wilderness Areas in theUkhahlamba-Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site, KwaZulu-Natal Province, Republic of South Africa William R. Bainbridge Introduction ____________________ The Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg Park is one of the most important high altitude protected areas in Southern Africa.It is 242,813 ha (600,000 acres) in extent, and protects a sig- nificant proportion of the upper reaches of the Drakensberg Mountains in KwaZulu-Natal Province, along the interna-tional border between Lesotho and South Africa. The border lies along the watershed between the west-flowing Orange or Senqu River system, and the east-flowing rivers ofKwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The park conserves important biodi- versity resources in the most extensive portions within the country in two of the seven floristic regions of Africa south ofthe Sahara\u2014the Afro-alpine and Afro-montane regions. The park also protects the watersheds of the most important rivers of the province, as well as valuable archaeologicalheritage and natural resources. In addition, the DrakensbergMountains have an international reputation for their spec- tacular natural beauty, and the park preserves some of the Drakensberg's most scenic portions. The Drakensberg isregarded as the most important inland tourism destination in the province, and the park is the center of this attraction (KwaZulu-Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission2001a). The park is in the custody of Enzemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, the organization responsible for protected area man-agement in the province. It comprises four wilderness areas proclaimed under national legislation: Mdedelelo, Mlambonja, Mkhomazi, and Mzimkulu, as well as a number of naturereserves proclaimed under a provincial statute. The four wilderness areas include the first wilderness to be legally proclaimed in South Africa. They have a total area of 117,765ha (291,000 acres), or about 48.5 percent of the park (Bainbridge 2001). The park (and its component wildernesses) was recently accorded World Heritage status under both natural and cultural criteria. The natural criteria of outstanding univer- sal value recognized by the World Heritage Bureau ofUNESCO were: Superlative natural phenomena or natural beauty and aesthetic importance. The presence of significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity and, in particular, outstanding species richness\u2014it is a recognized Cen-tre of Plant Diversity and Endemism, and a globally im- portant endemic bird area.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 21Establishment of Buffer Zone in the Peripheries of Wilderness Areas... Bainbridge The cultural criteria refer to the important San (Bush- man) rock art and other archaeological deposits present inthe park. Threats to the Park and Its Wilderness Areas _______________ As indicated above, the park and its wilderness areas enjoy secure protection in law. However, while the park is relatively large in local terms, it is relatively narrow inwidth, and thus is vulnerable to unsympathetic develop- ment in the immediate peripheries. The wilderness areas are protected by an internal buffer area, but this, conse-quently, is also of relatively narrow proportions, and thus the wildernesses are also vulnerable to disturbance and nonconforming physical development in the peripheries. Asan example, lights in some of the settlements and small villages in the approaches to the park, although distant from the park boundary, may be seen at night even from the topof the main escarpment, and are certainly visible from many vantage points in the wilderness areas. Specific policies were formulated over a decade ago by the provincial government for the control of nonconforming physical development such as large-scale tourism facilities on private land immediately adjacent to the park (Martin1990). However, these policies lacked legal sanction and did not apply to a number of land uses, such as commercial timber plantations of alien tree species, which have recentlybeen responsible for significant landscape transformation in the area. It was for these reasons that the study described below was commissioned (KwaZulu-Natal Town and Re-gional Planning Commission 2001a). Initiative to Prepare a Special Case Area Plan for the Drakensberg ____ Aim and Scope of the Study The study was commissioned in 1999 by the KwaZulu- Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission to consider the desirability of designating the lower-lying portions of the Drakensberg Mountains and agricultural lands of the prov-ince surrounding the park as a Special Case Area (SCA), and to prepare a Special Case Area Plan (SCAP) for the moun- tains and influent surrounds. The need for the study aroseout of increasing pressure for various forms of development in these mountains and peripheries, which had the potential to negatively affect the integrity of the park and the uniqueresources of the mountains, especially their biodiversity, water production, and scenic values. Protection of the inner wildernesses was seen as a key consideration. An SCA isdefined as an area with special or unique character, which may require additional protection over and above normal legislated development application procedures. The study area forms an important component of a greater study area (the Maloti-Drakensberg Conservation and De- velopment Area) in the high altitude mountains sharedbetween Lesotho and South Africa, in which a parallel feasibility study was undertaken by the two governments in cooperation with the World Bank. The goals of these twostudies were broadly similar, with particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable land uses, conservation of theunique natural resources, and economic upliftment of the people resident in the area (KwaZulu-Natal Town and Re- gional Planning Commission 2001b). Summary of Principal Findings and Recommendations The study showed that existing legislation makes provi- sion for the protection of all the principal resources of the study area except landscape quality. Landscape transfor-mation by a number of land uses such as agriculture, commercial afforestation, and rural settlement was found to be a significant threat to scenic values and the naturalbeauty of much of the area. Tourism (and ecotourism) are primary land uses in significant portions of the study area together with agriculture, and thus the potential for theseuses could also be threatened by such land uses. Further- more, uncoordinated or nonsustainable development was found to be a primary cause of landscape transformationimpairment of scenic values of other portions with unreal- ized potential for tourism, to the probable future detriment of current landowners and communities. The planning strategy adopted was to select a candidate SCA strategically located to protect both the integrity of the natural resources and scenic values in the approaches to thepark, and of the park itself. A zoning system for the proposed SCA was developed, based on the Seville Strategy of UNESCO. This system incorporates the park itself as a corearea and makes provision for a gradation of intensity ofdevelopment eastward away from its eastern boundary. The objectives for the zoning system were to provide a reasonable level of development opportunities within each zone, as wellas to decrease the potential negative effects of development as the visitor approaches the mountains. The system in- cludes two primary zones: a Buffer Zone immediately adja-cent to the park, with development largely restricted to extensive forms of agriculture and limited low-intensity tourism development; and a Commercial Agriculture Zoneaway from the park, in which intensive forms of agriculture and tourism are considered to be appropriate. The principal findings and recommendations of the report of the study (KwaZulu-Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission 2001a) include: The area shown in figure 1 should be declared an SCA for conservation of its unique natural resources, in particular its scenic values and landscape quality. A system of zones, and in particular a Buffer Zone, should form the basis for the regulations for the Drakensberg SCAP. The policy provisions for the SCAP (and its zoning system) should be integrated into the relevant subre- gional plans. The primary objectives of the SCAP are to contribute to conservation of the unique natural resources, the integ- rity of the park and the promotion of sustainable land uses, economic stimulation, and job creation. Consideration should be given to designation of a part, or the entire SCA, as one or more Biosphere Reserves in terms of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program.22 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Bainbridge Establishment of Buffer Zone in the Peripheries of Wilderness Areas...

Bainbridge Areas of Resource Conservation Zone, identified in the study, should be considered for formal designation asprotected areas. Tourism (and ecotourism) has the potential to become a primary land use together with agriculture. Consultation with authorities and communities in the study area should form a continuous component in the implementation of the recommendations. Project to Refine and Delineate the Eastern (Outer) Boundary of the Buffer Zone ____________________ Study Aim One further recommendation of the SCAP study was that there was a need for refinement of the eastern boundary ofthe Buffer Zone, to ensure a rational basis for the implemen- tation of regulations applied to the SCA, as well as to reflect the underlying physiographic and environmental determi-nants. This second study was undertaken shortly after the initial study (KwaZulu-Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission 2001a,b). Major issues that were addressed in this second stage project were: Establish principles and criteria to be used for demarca- tion of the eastern boundary of the Buffer Zone. Relevant policies and legislation. World Heritage status and the need to protect the important resources of the park. Consultation with interested and affected parties. The approach employed for this study was based partially on recently published guidelines for establishing policy andbest management practices for buffer zones in terrestrial ecosystems in developing countries (Ebregt and De Greve 2000). These support the following definition of a bufferzone, proposed by Wild and Mutebi, which was adopted for this study: Any area, often peripheral to a protected area, inside or outside, in which activities are implemented, or the area managed, with the aim of enhancing the positive, and reduc-ing the negative impacts of (nature) conservation on neigh- boring communities, and of neighboring communities on conservation (Ebregt and De Greve 2000: 7). Ebregt and De Greve (2000) recommend a holistic ap- proach for the establishment and management of bufferzones. This implies that both conservation and development considerations be employed as appropriate for the specific conditions that pertain for each buffer zone, with social andcultural settings considered at least as important as envi- ronmental factors, and that nature conservation and socio- economic development are not only complementary, but alsostrengthen each other's effectiveness and positive impacts. This summarizes the approach adopted for the present study. Furthermore, the specific key needs identified fordelineation of the Buffer Zone included requirements for protection of the integrity of the park and conservation of the natural character of the Drakensberg foothills peripheral toit, as well as to meet the needs of residents, tourists, andvisitors to the Drakensberg, bearing in mind its location as a key component of the Maloti-Drakensberg TransfrontierConservation and Development Study Area. Consultation The consultation process involved a series of workshops and consultative meetings with official agencies and stake- holder groups. Summary of Principal Findings and Recommendations of the Secondary Study _________________________ This study confirmed the need for a buffer zone around the entire eastern boundary of the Ukhahlamba-DrakensbergPark, that is, that this zone should form part of the zoning system of the Drakensberg SCAP. It was decided that the zone should principally comprise land of low agriculturalpotential, that is, areas where soils and other physical conditions such as slope are not conducive to intensive agriculture or other forms of development. As far as practi-cable, land of high agricultural potential, which is a natural component of the adjacent Commercial Agricultural Zone, should be excluded. This proved feasible by virtue of the hillynature of the Drakensberg foothills. These and other consid- erations (such as the inclusion in the buffer of sensitive sites and natural communities) provided the basis for develop-ment of a series of principles and criteria, which led to the delineation on maps and aerial photographs of the precise location of the eastern boundary of the Buffer Zone; thewestern boundary consists of the park boundary. The study further indicated that agriculture (and in some instances settlement) are current primary land uses in the Buffer Zone, but the zone is also well suited for small-scaleecotourism, a use which should be promoted in order to offer landowners another economic incentive compatible with the overall vision for the area. The forms of tourism facilitiesconsidered to be appropriate include small-scale chalet com- plexes, small hotels, camping, cottage industries, and arts and craft outlets. The zone is also particularly suited fornature-based forms of outdoor recreation, which should be facilitated by development of a system of trails for use by foot, horseback, or mountain bicycle. Based on the principles and criteria defined for the pur- pose, the zone was delineated both in a Geographic Informa- tion System (GIS) and physically on the ground by means ofGeographic Positioning System (GPS) points to an accuracy of 20 m (65.6 ft). The Buffer Zone varies in average between a minimum width of about 500 m (546.8 yards) and amaximum of just over 2 km (1.2 miles). It is believed that the proposed Buffer Zone has the potential to achieve the principal objectives of the SCAP, inparticular to make significant contributions to protection of the unspoiled natural character, and the resources of out- standing universal value of the World Heritage Site and itscomponent inner wildernesses. It should also contribute to the protection of the present, largely unspoiled natural character of the landscapes, to scenic values and natural24 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Bainbridge Establishment of Buffer Zone in the Peripheries of Wilderness Areas... communities in the immediate peripheries of the park, and to the promotion of sustainable land uses. The SCAP makes provision for the formulation of spatial framework plans and land use schemes that should address the following: Identification and conservation of natural resources in the Buffer Zone that are of outstanding universal value. Promotion of sustainable development and conserva- tion of the other natural resources of the Buffer Zone and other zones of the SCAP. The recommendations of the second phase study include:Development of partnerships between the park author- ity and stakeholders for development of a comprehen- sive strategic land use management system for theBuffer Zone within the framework of objectives for the Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and Development Project. Consideration given to the nomination of all or part of the SCAP as a Biosphere Reserve, as recommended by the World Heritage Bureau and the SCAP Report. The plan includes the provision of incentives to landown- ers and communities with title to the land to accept and to benefit from the provisions of the plan. These include thefollowing recommendations: Tourism should be recognized and promoted as a pri- mary land use along with agriculture, not only through-out the SCAP area, but also in the Buffer Zone. The permissible density for low-scale tourism develop- ment in the Buffer Zone should be increased fromprevious levels. Provision should be made for direct access into the park for guests to tourism facilities in the Buffer Zone (in- stead of through distant public entry points).A primary product of the SCAP is a recommended system of land use guidelines and controls for achievement of theobjectives of both studies. A list of preferred and nonpreferred land use activities is provided for each zone. Table 1 provides the recommended activities for the Buffer Zone. Summary and Conclusions _______ As far as is known, this is the first attempt in South Africa to delineate a buffer zone on private and communal land around the peripheries of a major protected area such as theUkhahlamba-Drakensberg Park. The proposed Buffer Zone was designed to benefit both the park itself, as well as landowners, visitors, and tourists, through the implementa-tion of control measures to conserve the integrity and natu- ral character of both the protected area and the buffer, and by promotion of sustainable land uses, including tourismand agriculture. These measures could create the opportu- nity for the creation of one or more Biosphere Reserves in the proposed SCA. They should also promote protection of theintegrity of the wilderness areas within the park through the preclusion of nonsympathetic development in the approaches to the park.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014South Africa comprises approximately 10 percent moun- tainous terrain and isolated mountains, based on the criterion of 450 m (1,476 feet) local relief. Distinctive hilly terrain and distinc- tive coastal and river relief make up approximately 13 percent of theland surface. The highest mountains are located in the Drakensberg with peaks reaching 3,400 m (11,155 feet) and local relief up to 2,100 m (6,890 feet). The extensive Cape Fold Mountain Range (totalingabout 21,000 km 2, or 8,108 miles2) also have several peaks with local relief close to 2,000 m (6,562 feet). Many other less extensive mountain ranges exist throughout South Africa. Developments and poor management practices in mountain ar- eas are increasing on private and government land, and mountain wilderness is shrinking. The objective of this paper is to: provide anoverview of major mountain ranges, their conservation status, and the type of communities that live in close proximity to these mountains; highlight key threats to mountain wilderness; anddiscuss and analyze policies, legislation, and other \"social contracts\" that deal with mountain management in South Africa, focusing on how key issues such as overexploitation, overburning, lack of finance,law enforcement, lack of knowledge, bad environmental attitu des,water pollution, inappropriate private and infrastructural developments, and poorly planned access routes are being addressed. A hypothetical case study, where suitable socioecological zoning is used in the planning and development of a private mountain reserve, is discussed. The rationale for using socioecological zoningis to encourage the conservation of mountain wilderness by only developing in areas where potentially negative effects on wilderness qualities can be minimized, and to restrict nonwilderness-depen-dent activities in identified wilderness areas. Socioecological zoning requires that a predetermined range of social needs and uses, applicable to the characteristics of the mountain environment in thecountry, is scientifically matched to the appropriate ecological and physical characteristics of the mountain area. Introduction ____________________ Based on the criterion that a mountain constitutes an area elevated at least 450 m (1,476 feet) from the local relief (the height difference measured from the lowest point within thearea being considered), South Africa comprises approxi-Mountain Conservation in South Africa M.

Distinctive hilly terrain and distinctive coastal and river relief make up approximately 13 percent of the landsurface. Mountains in South Africa either form part of the Great Escarpment or are free standing. The Great Escarpmentextends from the mountainous regions of the Northern Province, southward to the Drakensberg, past Lesotho and the Eastern Cape into the Southern Cape. It then continuesnorth of the Cape Fold Mountains to Sutherland in the Karoo, before turning northward toward Springbok in the Northern Cape (DEAT 1997). The highest mountains in South Africa are located in the Drakensberg with peaks reaching 3,400 m (11,155 feet) with local relief up to 2,100 m. The extensive Cape Fold sandstonemountain ranges ( totaling about 21,000 km 2, or 8,108 miles2) also have several peaks with local relief close to 2,000 m (6,562 feet). Many other less extensive mountain ranges exist throughout South Africa (Blignaut 2000a). Mountain Wilderness ____________ Some mountainous areas are still wild and unspoiled as a result of harsh living conditions for humans, rough topogra- phy, and remoteness. In these pristine wilderness areas,there are few signs of human modification. Indigenous fauna and flora are very dominant. These places provide a range of opportunities to visitors for solitude and to interact withnature on nature's terms. The wilderness qualities in mountains vary depending on geomorphology, climate, surrounding land use, and faunaand flora, for example: The Cape Fold Mountains form part of the extremelybiodiverse Cape Floral Kingdom ecosystem and offer many undisturbed mountain peaks and kloofs. Visiting these wilderness areas can be strenuous. Leopard andsigns of free-ranging wildlife are present in some areas, but the wilderness character of these mountains is linked to solitude; striking scenic beauty with steepascents and rough terrain; pure moun- The KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg harbors one of the world's greatest rock art collections. There are an esti- mated 600 sites with more than 35,000 individual rockart images. It contains high-altitude and unique South- ern African alpine-tundra vegetation and associated endemic paleoinvertebrates. It offers outstanding viewsand a range of peaks to climb. Wildlife can be encoun- tered at varying altitudes. The Lebombo Mountains are less than 800 m (2,625 feet) high, but are probably the richest wildlife moun-USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 27Shroyer and Blignaut Mountain Conservation in South Africa tain habitat south of the Zambezi Escarpment, mostly by virtue of their length down the Kruger National Parkand the wilderness of Mozambique on the eastern side. Elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo, rhino, and another 40 to 50 large mammals, mainly antelope, as well as enor- mously rich birdlife inhabit parts of it. The Richtersveld is a mountain desert with summer daytime temperatures regularly higher than 40 C (104 F), where both plants and animals have adapted to the harsh desert conditions. Although a mountain zonation policy (fig. 1) has been proposed (Blignaut 1992), there is currently no formal policy specifically aimed at mountain conservation. Many moun-tainous areas are not zoned, and there are no specific management objectives or indicators to monitor compliance to set targets on State or private land. In many cases thediverse mountain wilderness landscapes are not managed. There is currently no attempt to protect the remaining mountain wilderness by restricting access and making in-ducements to go elsewhere through the provision of recre- ational facilities in more appropriate areas. As a result, many of these wilderness areas are being targeted forecotourism. Even with a moderate increase in the use of wilderness areas, their nature conservation status may be totally unimpaired, while the wilderness experience may beruined.Mountain Communities in South Africa _________________________ True mountain communities, people who have tradition- ally lived in mountain areas, are a rare phenomenon inSouth Africa. African communities are mostly located in hilly terrain with few communities actually inhabiting the mountains, unlike mountain communities in South America,Asia, and Europe. Diversity of Mountain Communities The culture of people living in close proximity to moun- tains varies from mountain to mountain, depending on agricultural potential, proximity to markets, climate, scenicvalue, rock formation, biodiversity, presence of wildlife, conservation status, recreational opportunities offered, so- cioeconomic factors, and so forth. The following loose catego-ries attempt to describe different communities who live close to mountains or who enjoy benefits provided by mountains: Traditional mountain communities, which are peoplewho live in the foothills or who live in the mountains on a permanent basis, whose ancestors also lived in moun-tainous terrain, and who utilize resources provided by mountains, mountain slopes, or mountain streams as Figure 1\u2014Socioecological zoning.(I) (I) (X)(II) (IV)(III) NEW NEW (VII) (VIII) BIOSPHERE RESERVE (IX) Is a combination of a spectrum of the above zones By catering for a continuum conflicts can be avoided and needs satisfiedEQUIVALENT IUCN ZONING CATEGORIESECOLOGICAL ZONE (Research)WILDERNESS ZONEWORLD HERITAGE SITE (Global Status)NATIONAL PARK NATURE RESERVE HERITAGE SITEMOUNTAIN FEATURE / MONUMENT (Spot Zone)MOUNTAIN RECREATION ZONE (Developed site)MOUNTAIN SPORT ZONE (Sport climbing, skiing, equipment used)WISE USE OPTIMUM USE SUSTAINABLE MOUNTAIN DEVELOPMENT, BUT START OF DEGRADATION OF NATURAL SYSTEMS ANTHROPOLOGICAL ZONE (Mountain peoples)MULTIPLE USE ZONEOVER EXPLOITATIONTourism opportunitiesCONTINUUM ANTHROPOCENTRIC ECOCENTRIC development and human usemore intense development and human use28 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Shroyer and Blignaut Mountain Conservation in South Africa their primary livelihood. This includes livestock farm- ing (cattle, goat, and sheep), crop farming, and daggagrowing. Examples of mountain communities are: Basotho people who live on the Great Escarpment between South Africa and Lesotho; the Hananwa peopleof Blouberg in the Northern Province; and the people of the Richtersveld, the Namas, and the Bosluis Basters (Van den Berg 2000). Subsistence communities such as at Wupperthal in the Western Cape, Qudeni in Zululand, and Mnweni and Singati in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg. Rural communities, which include commercial farmers, small-scale commercial farmers, and farm laborers. Farms can be managed by private individuals, companies, or consortiums. Examples are flower farms in the Cape Mountains, trout farms in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakens- berg, and cattle farms in the Waterberg. Communities living within or on the boundaries of private or public mountain conservation areas, such as in the Richtersveld and Drakensberg. Landowners of private nature reserves and those in- cluding their land in nature conservancies such as the Cederberg, Vo\u00eblvlei, and Grootvadersbosch Conservan-cies in the Western Cape. Foresters and personnel working for mining or loggingcompanies. Urban communities living within or on the boundaries of private or public mountain conservation areas, for example, in Cape Town, Ceres, and Franschhoek. Twogroups can be identified: \"Armchair mountain admir- the people who are fairly passionate about moun- tains but who seldom climb them; and \"local mountainusers,\" the people who utilize the mountains on a regu-lar basis for exercise, recreation, spiritual renewal, and to socialize or enjoy the scenic beauty. Business people running ecotourism operations who use the mountains as the attractant. Mountain tourists, the visitors from other areas, na-tionally or internationally, who travel to mountainousareas to enjoy stunning mountain landscapes or to hike. In general, people living in mountainous areas have be- come ecoconscious and take a direct interest in the manage- ment of mountains as well as their resources. This has led to the formation of Mountain Forums, Friends of the Mountaingroup, and Hiking and Mountain Clubs. Projects Involving Mountain Communities Sustainable mountain development, as per Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 (developed at the 1992 World Summit on Sustain- able Development, Rio de Janeiro), requires the involve-ment of local mountain communities to ensure that both community needs and conservation needs are met. Some local projects involving mountain communities are: Mnweni Donga Erosion Reclamation Project . This project in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg is coordi-nated by the Mnweni Community Trust. Trained groups are now offering a commercial service to other commu- nities along the slopes of the mountain range. This isan excellent example where the community formed apartnership to combat environmental degradation on mountain slopes in their area. Working for Water Project . The Government's Work- ing for Water Program, spearheaded by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, was launched in 1995 togain control of the growing problem of invasive alien plants. The program currently runs over 200 projects in all nine of South Africa's Provinces. Special teams havebeen trained to undertake high-altitude alien vegeta- tion clearing in mountainous terrain. Through Working For Water Projects, people living in mountainous ter-rain have been given opportunities to develop new skills and to work as contract laborers. Zululand Trail Project (ZTP) . This South African Youth Exchange Project started in 1992. The objective of the ZTP is to explore the remote and beautiful areas of Zululand, very often scarcely populated, to identifypossible routes for hiking trails and incorporating local villages as \"stop-overs.\" Visiting local villages provides an interesting cultural experience to exchange stu-dents, and provides tangible financial benefits to the locals. Key Threats to Mountain Wilderness_____________________ Threats to South African mountains are numerous and can be categorized under two headings: unsustainable land use practices and potentially threatening situations (Blignaut 2000b). Unsustainable Land Use Practices Unsustainable land use practices could include: Burning and overburning of indigenous mountain veg- etation. Indigenous vegetation is adapted to the inci- dence of lightning and rock falls. These start the moun-tain fires that are necessary for the germination of some plant species. However, deliberate and frequent manmade fires have devastating and severe effects onmountain vegetation, particularly at high altitudes and on dry slopes where regeneration is slow. Mature veg- etation in South African mountains is currently rare. Cultivation, even on moderately steep mountain slopes, leads to erosion, particularly during fallow periods and heavy rainfall. The loss of vegetation cover has multipleconsequences: landslides, siltation of dams, drying up of perennial streams, flash floods downstream, and loss of biotic diversity and genetic resources, including insectand other faunal populations essential for pollination of fruit and seed sources. Plantations and invasive alien vegetation. Plantations of imported invasive tree species located in mountain catchments cause a massive loss of runoff and perenniality. The water yield from a mountain catch-ment covered by invasive vegetation, such as hakea, pine, and wattle, is reduced by 50 percent compared to a catchment covered by indigenous fynbos (Burgers1993).USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 29Shroyer and Blignaut Mountain Conservation in South Africa Grazing in fragile mountain areas and overgrazing. Bad farming practices by owners of mountain land, and demographic pressures in mountain communities coupled with unsustainable cultural practices that do not match current realities, result in overstocking. This leads toloss of natural vegetation cover, with its serious conse- quences. It also increases pollution from animals and humans within the catchment areas, resulting in illhealth, greater filtration costs, and negative effects on tourism and recreation. Badly located and inappropriate infrastructure has an accumulative adverse effect on mountain ecology and landscapes, leading to loss of natural vegetation cover and to pollution. For example: illegal impoundmentsmade by farmers diminish water supply to main dams and degrade riverine ecology; illegal tourism develop- ments, such as roads for offroad vehicles and mountaincottages, cause erosion and pollution; masts and other communication devices on mountain summits adversely impact landscapes and ruin wilderness. Potentially Threatening Situations Potentially threatening situations include: Easy access. South African mountains are not high inglobal terms, nor indeed extensive. Many of the moun-tain ranges are narrow. In the Cape Fold Mountains, there is an average width of only 7 km (4.3 miles). Similar to the Drakensberg, this permits reasonablyeasy access for exploitation to core wilderness areas. Many largely unspoiled public mountain reserves arebeing developed for ecotourism to provide funds formanagement and other government agendas. This oc-currence has at its source the general weakness in the economy and the indifference of many politicians to long-term conservation and most certainly to wilder-ness. Even protected areas are being opened up for limited exploitation by adjacent communities and to provide new livelihood opportunities. While in much ofthe developed world conservation of protected areas is becoming more strict, the reverse is occurring in Africa. This augers badly for wilderness, which once destroyedcan seldom be restored. Economics is at the root of many land exploitationproblems. Some private landowners are now looking atexploiting their mountain land to gain short-term ben- efits for economic survival. The withdrawal of farming subsidies, low agricultural prices, steep increases infuel costs, and higher labor expenses all contribute to this. Politics. Some commercial farmers are apprehensive about their future in South Africa. This perception has been exacerbated by local farm murders and the Zimba- bwe land grabs and land claims. Insecurity of titleusually leads to exploitation of land in the short term, which could have a noticeable impact on mountains. Lack of respect for the natural environment is often at the root of exploitation of mountain land. This attitude has its source in lack of knowledge and education, coupled with indifference and greed for personal gain. Ifwe were healthy morally, we would not consider themountains as \"waste land\" to be exploited and ruined for personal and public gain. Climate change. If carbon dioxide levels double by the year 2050, some of the Cape fynbos biome will disap- pear, as it will be unable to adapt to climate/atmo-spheric changes. However, much of the species-rich montane fynbos is likely to adapt because of the climatic diversity found in mountain environments. Mountainareas in South Africa are therefore likely to be signifi- cantly important repositories of biotic diversity in the future. Policies, Legislation, and Other \"Social Contracts\" That Deal With Mountain Management in South Africa _________________________ Social contracts regarding mountain conservation involve a range of government, private, and communal stakehold- ers. The instruments for mountain conservation range fromformal explicit contracts, such as national legislation, to undocumented implicit private initiatives. There are also various public-private partnerships that contribute to moun-tain conservation. These social contracts mainly relate to land use, infrastructure developments, commercial oppor- tunities, and access. Ownership of Mountains Mountains, hilly country, coastal buttresses, or cliffs in South Africa can be owned or managed by: the State (na-tional, provincial, the above-mentionedparties. The area of mountain catchments on State land amounts to 1.7 million hectares (6,564 miles 2), about 15 percent of the total area of major catchments. Eighty-fivepercent of mountain catchments, about 9.7 million hectares (37,542 miles 2), is privately owned (Rabie and others 1992). Of the privately owned areas, 5.5 percent are proclaimedmountain catchment areas, while 79.5 percent are unde- clared catchments (Rabie and others 1992). The result is that many mountainous areas with high wilderness quali-ties are not proclaimed as such. It is thus essential that public-private partnerships be promoted to conserve South Africa's mountain heritage. Legislation Relating to Mountains The only legal definition in South Africa related to \"moun- tain\" is that of \"mountain catchment area\" in terms of the Mountain Catchment Areas Act (MCAA) (Act 63 of 1970). Such an area is simply described as an area defined anddeclared by the Minister of Environmental Affairs by notice in the Gazette to be a mountain catchment area. This definition fails to describe the characteristics of such anarea, although a good idea of what represents a mountain catchment is obtained from the interdepartmental Ross Report (1961), which culminated in the MCAA.30 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Shroyer and Blignaut Mountain Conservation in South Africa Legislation that pertains to mountain areas are (Price 2000): The MCAA applies to State-owned mountains and a percentage of privately owned important mountaincatchment land. Its overall purpose is the production of clear, pure water. The biotic diversity of these pro- claimed mountain areas has been reasonably well con-served as unsilted, unpolluted water through the reten- tion of a reasonably mature vegetation cover. National Forests Act (Act 84 of 1998) . This Act makes provision for the protection of indigenous forest, as well as for the support of community forestry (http:/ /www.gov.za/ yearbook/water.htm). It provides for thedesignation of wilderness areas on State forest land. National Veld and Forest Fire Act (Act 101 of1998) . In terms of this Act, Fire Protection Associations (FPAs) need to be established. While it is compulsory to establish FPAs on all State lands, FPAs on private lands are voluntary. The purpose of the Act is to prevent andcombat veld, forest, and mountain fires throughout the Republic. National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998) . This Act pro- vides for the protection of water resources (the defini- tion includes streams) and the use of water, including its abstraction from streams and other sources, andregulates activities that result in the reduction of streamflow. In some regions, steering committees have been established to compile catchment reports thatprovide input into the development of integrated Catch- ment Management Plans. Integrated Catchment Man- agement is a focus of the new Water Act. National Environmental Management Act (NEMA)(Act 107 of 1998) . This Act is broadly aimed at the decisionmaking processes and coordination of govern- mental functions relating to the environment. Of gen-eral interest is the Act's adherence to principles of Integrated Environmental Management and Environ- mental Management Plans. Environment Conservation Act (Act 73 of 1989) . This Act provides, among other things, for the declara- tion of Protected Natural Environments, the control ofpollution, the control of environmentally harmful activi- ties, and the creation of regulations to govern procedures to be followed in environmental impact assessments. The Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act (CARA) (Act 43 of 1983) . The new regulations under CARA add substantial legal capacity to the quest tocontrol invasive alien plants, especially in mountain catchments. Government Initiatives Toward Mountain Conservation Government initiatives regarding mountain conservation include: Wilderness Areas . Since 1971, 11 wilderness areas have been designated in terms of the Forest Act. All but one (Ntendeka W.A.) protect high altitude ecosystemsin the principal mountain systems of the country (Bainbridge 2001). National Parks . National Parks are proclaimed in terms of the National Parks Act (Act 57 of 1976). South African National Parks (SANParks) manages four Na-tional Parks where mountains are the key attraction: Cape Peninsula, Golden Gate, Tsitsikamma, and Richtersveld. Other National Parks with mountainousterrain are the Kruger, Karoo, Addo Elephant, Marakele, and Mountain Zebra. Private, communal, or NGO land can be incorporated into national parks on a contractualbasis. Provincial Nature Reserves . Some Provincial na- ture reserves are proclaimed in accordance with em-powering provincial legislation by which the Provinces manage State land. Many of these reserves contain mountains, hilly country, coastal buttresses, or cliffs. Abreakdown of Provincial reserves per province is as follows: Eastern Cape (47), Free State (17), Gauteng (6), KwaZulu-Natal (87), Mpumalanga (14), Northern Cape(6), Northern Province (52), North West (14), and West- ern Cape (51). Some of the mountainous nature reserves do not have resident managers. Indigenous Forests . A National Forestry Action Pro- gram (NFAP) for South Africa was developed in 1997. Indigenous high forest covers only about 300,000 hect-ares (1,158 miles 2) or 0.25 percent of the country's surface, mainly on the eastern and southern slopes of mountain ranges from the Cape Peninsula in the West-ern Cape to the Soutpansberg in the Northern Province. Forty-three percent of indigenous high forests are man- aged by the Department of Forestry according to certainmultiuse objectives. Protected Natural Environments . There are three Protected Natural Environments in mountainous areas: the Cape Peninsula Protected Natural Environment(CPPNE) portions that are included in the CPNP, the Magaliesberg Protected Natural Environment (MPNE), and the Lourens River Protected Natural Environment. World Heritage Sites . On November 29, 2000, the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park was inscribed as a \"mixed\" natural and cultural World Heritage Site, interms of the Convention on the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage. An application for World Heritage Status for eight representative constellationsites is currently being prepared for the Cape Floral Kingdom and the Cape Fold mountains. Transfrontier Conservation Areas . A Memoran- dum of Understanding was signed between South Af- rica and Lesotho in June 2001 for the establishment of the Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier ConservationArea (TFCA). The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site is located within the Maluti- Drakensberg TFCA. On August 17, 2001, a Memoran-dum of Understanding was signed between South Af- rica and Namibia to put in place an environmental collaboration program through the establishment of theAi-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Conservation Park. Mega Reserves . The Cape Action Plan for the Environ- ment (CAPE) project recommended that three mega-conservation areas (400,000 to 600,000 ha, or 1,544 toUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 31Shroyer and Blignaut Mountain Conservation in South Africa 2,317 miles2) be established in the Cederberg, Little Karo, and Baviaanskloof areas (WWF-South Africa2000). This important initiative will contribute respec- tively to an integrated approach to mountain conserva- tion in the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces. Public-Private Partnerships Public-private partnership initiatives regarding moun- tain conservation include: Biosphere Reserves . Three biosphere reserves have been registered with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and there are nine initiatives underway. Declared BiosphereReserves in mountainous terrain are Kogelberg (estab- lished in 1998) and Waterberg (established in 2000). Biosphere Reserves in mountainous areas currently inthe planning phase are: Soutpansberg/Limpopo; Kruger to Canyons, Drakensberg Special Cederberg, Boland, and Royal Zulu. Conservancies . A conservancy is an association of private landowners or tenants who voluntarily set asideand consolidate the natural resources of their proper- ties for the purpose of conservation and sustainable utilization. Through cooperation between the farmingcommunity and conservation authorities, this concept has grown into a national conservation movement (Cape Nature Conservation 1997). Private Initiatives Private initiatives regarding mountain conservation include: Natural Heritage Sites . South African Natural Heri- tage Sites are designated where certain criteria are metand where landowners commit themselves to the con- servation management of the site. The number of natu- ral heritage sites in mountainous areas is not available. Private Game Farms . Presently there are more than 9,000 game farms, from unregistered farms to those officially recognized by nature conservation depart-ments as \"exempted game farms\" that allow the cap- ture, selling, and hunting of game. Many game farms are located in mountainous areas. Private Reserves . There are approximately 160 pri- vate reserves in South Africa. Figures per vegetation type are not available (SA State of Environment Report2000). SA Natural Heritage Program . Private landowners can apply to the Department of Environmental Affairsand Tourism to have properties awarded Natural Heri- tage Program status. Access to Mountain Areas, Rock Faces, and Coastal Cliffs Access to mountains in South Africa is dependent on the ownership of the area, resulting in no legal right for access to climb or mountaineer\u2014therefore, \"no right to ramble.\"Only a limited extent of mountain land meeting the criteria for wilderness exists, and a fair percentage is privatelyowned. Access on Private Land . Private landowners may give permission to climb mountains in their ownership or they may refuse. Mountain and hiking clubs under- take extensive measures, including the purchase ofmountains and rights of way, to obtain access. Some landowners now require payment, at least for road maintenance across farms and parking. Access on State Land . In mountain ranges located in national or provincial parks, access is granted according to permit conditions, and in a few areas there is noaccess for mountaineering. In proclaimed wilderness areas, access is also per permit and is restricted to prevent overcrowding and a degradation of the wilder-ness experience. Access to Communal Land . Some mountainous ar- eas fall within communal tribal ownership, and permis-sion to climb must be obtained from the tribal authori- ties concerned. Payment for access to such areas is now becoming common. Access to Coastal Cliffs . Land below the high water mark belongs to the State in terms of the Sea Shore Act (Act 21 of 1935) and is accessible to everyone. However,coastal cliffs above the high water mark could be in private ownership. Rocky coastlines may thus become inaccessible without obtaining permission. Access in Conservation Areas . In certain areas, access for mountaineering has been lost or restricted due to the establishment of national parks or privatenature reserves. In particular, an emphasis on conser-vation of the \"Big Five\" (lion, elephant, leopard, rhino, and buffalo), resulting in the creation of additional national parks (for example, Marakele National Park),has in some cases meant that climbers and hikers can now only access such areas under guard, if at all. Trails in some national parks have been closed due to theintroduction of buffalo (for example, Mountain Zebra National Park). In other areas (for example, Baviaanskloof), mountaineering is popular, even though buffalo havebeen released. User Fees and Financing Provincial and national authorities have nearly always charged a fee. An exception is the Cape Peninsula National Park, which has partial free access. With the cut in conser-vation budgets in South Africa, fees are increasing, in some instances dramatically. Although some private landowners still allow free access, many are now charging fees to moun-taineer and hike on their property. Financial resources to cover the objectives of sustainable mountain development are obtained from each national,provincial, or municipal authorities' budget. In certain in- stances, financial assistance is provided by donor organiza- tions, such as the Global Environment Facility or PeaceParks Foundation. On occasion, conservation-worthy moun- tainous land is purchased by NGOs such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for approved projects and The Moun-tain Club of South Africa for mountaineering.32 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Shroyer and Blignaut Mountain Conservation in South Africa Legal Liability The situation regarding the legal liabilities of landowners for mountain accidents on their land varies. Some nationaland provincial authorities and some private landowners require indemnity forms to be completed; in other instances, there are no agreements. There is no legislation ruling on this,and there has not been a court case in South Africa to test this aspect. Rescue s ervices are provided by provincial emer- gency services and on a volunteer basis by members of theMountain Club of South Africa. On land managed by KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, including some areas in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg, a rescue services levy formspart of entrance fees. Case Study: Riviersonderend Private Mountain Farm ___________ Background : Mr Smith bought a share in a beautiful farm in the mountains as a weekend getaway. He is a keen botanist and mountaineer and wanted to conserve themountain land in an appropriate, scientific way, while making some money through ecotourism. He spoke to the consortium of landowners, which he was part of, and theydecided to appoint a consultant to advise them on a moun- tain management strategy that combines ecotourism with conservation. Consultant's Strategy : The first step was to undertake a field trip to identify core wilderness areas that need to be protected; to get an idea of wilderness qualities; to identifyfeatures of outstanding scenic beauty; to gather informationon topography, fauna and flora; and to identify ecotourism opportunities. The second step was to consult the Depart- ment of Water Affairs and Forestry regarding the catchment management plan of the area. The third step was to zone the area to inform future land use. The fourth step was to set objectives and targets for the management of each zone, withmeasurable indicators. Thereafter, a mountain manage- ment and monitoring plan was developed. Four zones were identified: 1. Pristine mountain wilderness . The purest form of wilderness with no signs of modern modification (no roads,fences, dams, windmills, powerlines, fire breaks, solar pan- els, and so forth), only natural sound, no motorized access. Recreational activities: backpacking, kloofing, rockclimbing,swimming. 2. Remote mountain wilderness . As above but signs of modern modification visible in the distance. Recreationalactivities: backpacking, kloofing, rockclimbing, swimming. 3. Modified wilderness . Areas with easy access that retain naturalness. The road to the farmhouse and thefootpath to the tented camp were included in this zone. 4. Developed area . The farmhouse and laborers' cot- tages were included in this category. Process : A meeting was held with the landowners to discuss the mountain management and monitoring plan,aimed at combining mountain conservation with low-impact ecotourism.Outcome : The landowners supported the idea of protecting the wilderness qualities of the mountain reserve. They agreed that infrastructure should be limited to theexisting footprint, which included an old farmhouse and two laborers' cottages. No new roads were to be con- structed, thus limiting vehicular access to the existingfarmhouse. Where present, old boundary fences were to be removed to improve the wilderness qualities. They decided to erect two tented camps and a \"long- drop\" to accommodate overnight visitors. Visitors would have to walk to these camps. Local people were em- ployed to manage t he tented camps. This included cook- ing, cleaning, and \"portarage\" from the farmhouse to the tented camps. Vis itor opportunities included day walks, kloofing, rockclimbing, bird viewing, and botanizing. All supported the removal of alien vegetation in a phased approach, taking cognizance of the importance of followup clearing. Local contractors were to be used. A meeting was organized with neighboring farmers to join a Fire Protection Association. A decision was made to reintroduce wildlife to the area. In this regard, a meeting was set up with the nature conservation authority. A monitoring program was implemented to establish whether management objectives were met. Assumptions : The above-mentioned scenario assumes that: 1. A socioecological, national mountain zoning policy is not in place. If such a policy was operating, mountain rangeswould already have been socioecologically zoned by a panel of experts in cooperation with all landowners concerned. Thereafter, a Mountain Management Board comprising land- owners, affected parties, and authorities would have ensured that the landowners' application met the criteria of the existing zoning pl ans. (This is the policy advocated by Blignaut, via oral and wr itten submissions to the Council for the E nviron- ment and other institutions, since 1987. The princi ple aim being to pres erve remaining mountain wilderness.) 2. The landowner(s) cooperates with the concept of wil- derness. This is usually not the case, as the landowners' principle objective is to make money. Thus, 4-wheel-drivetracks through the mountains and chalets deep into the mountains, with concomitant access and communication infrastructure, are likely pressures. Because there is nonational mountain policy and because what legislation there is, is poorly enforced, massive wilderness degradation may take place. When landowners view their land for benefits,wilderness is nearly always the first casualty. Conclusions____________________ Although South Africa does not have a formal wilderness management or mountain management policy, various part-nerships are being implemented toward achieving sus- tainable development in mountains. In some instances, developments in mountainous areas are not sustainable,USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 33Shroyer and Blignaut Mountain Conservation in South Africa as short-term financial gains are perceived as more impor- tant than long-term sustainability. The government is responsible for conserving mountains in national parks, provincial and municipal reserves, and wilderness and indigenous forest areas on State land, whilea range of mechanisms, for example Biosphere Reserves, Natural Heritage Sites, and Conservancies are available for mountain conservation on private land. In addition, private,communal, or NGO land can be incorporated into national parks on a contractual basis. There is a need to include mountain communities in decisionmaking regarding mountain management and to en- sure that these people derive benefits from ecotourism. More projects a imed at environmental education and the creation of jobs for mountain communities need to be initiated. As a way forward, the only remedy to save remaining mountain wilderness is to undertake socioecological zoningof South Africa's mountain ranges, preferably as part of a national mountain management policy, in order to identify and protect these wilderness areas for posterity. The exist-ence of unambiguous zoning plans covering South Africa's important mountain ranges would pre-empt development pressures and inappropriate compromises with the result-ant loss of wilderness.References_____________________ Bainbridge, B. 2001.

Introduction ____________________ Change and transformation are arguably two of the key- words that spring to mind if one becomes embroiled\u2014sometimes unwittingly and invariably reluctantly\u2014in con- temporary political, social, and economic debate in Southern Africa. They are also key words behind principles andpractices in global contexts, where attempts are made to address present development problems and envisage the sustainable use of resources into the future. The call for sustainable development is often heard and is invariably defined as: ...development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future gen- erations to meet their own needs (Botchway and others 2001:407). In our opinion, that definition in itself is insufficient and ineffective as a means to understand the challenges ofWAG-CEAD Alliance: Commitment to Wilderness Training and Protection in Southern Africa W. D. Densham R. J. Fincham securing and perpetuating a tradition of innovative debate around wilderness training, management, and protection.McNeill (2000: 22) notes that the ...sustainable development debate has often been cast (by the Bruntland Report and others) in terms of the rights of futuregenerations. ...it necessarily involves: Rights of the poor in the present generation, as against those of the rich. Rights of non-humans as against humans. Rights of future generations as against present generations. His observations are crucial because they underline the political, most often government- driven desire to uplift the considerable populations of the continent, where poverty fashions the life expectations of most people. There is seriouserror in thinking that we can plan for the future by adopting consensus-type definitions eschewed by Botchway (2001) and the famous Bruntland Report (Bruntland 1987). Wemust rather face the confrontation that exists in the heart ofthe \"sustainable development\" debate, as made so abun- dantly clear when the other two dimensions as spelt out by McNeill (2000) are added. The world of the \"haves\" and the\"have nots\" have very different views on the value of conser- vation, for example, and they color the theory and practice of conservation and wilderness actions we may wish to take.Mary Seely, speaking at the 1996 Wilderness Management Symposium in Namibia (Jankowitz and others 1999: 189), sets out the issue succinctly: ...I would like to suggest, that if all of us are interested in Wilderness, as we all profess to be, and why we are here, we ought to be spending a lot more time looking outside of the Wilderness in Namibia. That is where the poverty is takingplace. That is where the land degradation is taking place. That is where the population is...and the situations...that are going to impact upon what we consider Wilderness, what wewould like to see as Wilderness in the future. And we should be spending more time there already. It is our contention that the alliance formed between the Wilderness Action Group (WAG), the Centre for Environ- ment and Development (CEAD)-University of Natal, and the partners of both organizations promotes an excitingphilosophy of education, training, and research in wilder- ness. It embraces ideas that highlight a sound understand- ing of the African, as well as the more global contexts inwhich a pedagogical philosophy mu st be etched. It is a philosophy that builds on the ideas of Africanists such as Draper (1998), Mkhize (1999), Player (1999), Muir (1999), Densham (1999), Bainbridge (1987), Van Rensburg (1995), and Carruthers (2001). It also takes cognizance of theUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 35Densham and Fincham WAG-CEAD Alliance: Commitment to Wilderness Training and Protection in Southern Africa ever- expanding conservation and wilderness literature found elsewhere (Beinart and Coates 1995; Martin 1999; Nicolson1970; Weingart 1999; White 1967; and many others). As such, the objective of this paper is to examine the value of bringing wilderness practitioners and more broadly fo-cused academics together to develop a program of wilderness training that is intended to contribute to wilderness man- agement and protection. To achieve this aim a brief outlineof the historical background to the alliance is presented. Thereafter, the nature of the alliance is examined before its achievements are considered. Key challenges are articu-lated as a basis for a prognosis of future actions. Context and Perspectives ________ A major concern in fostering wilderness conservation in this region has been that key organizations embrace wilder-ness as part of their mandate. As Densham (1999) points out, wilderness conservation in Africa had its origins in KwaZulu- Natal when the then Natal Parks Board, now the EzimveloKwaZulu-Natal Wildlife (EKZNW), set aside the first wil- derness area in Zululand in 1955, others being added in the Province and elsewhere thereafter. By the 1990s, wildernessas a separate category in the South African classification of protected areas was in place. While these steps are laudable, there has been little imprint of wilderness proclamationmore widely on the continent, although the symposium held in the Waterberg Plateau Park in Namibia in 1996 high- lighted its significance and what was being done in thatcountry (Cooper 1999). Another issue highlighted by Densham was the lack of a common approach to management of wilderness. Herein laythe impetus to develop wilderness management training.WAG became the driving force behind training after its inception in 1979 as a voluntary nongovernment organiza- tion (NGO). Amongst others, its mission is to: Promote the ethic of wilderness conservation in southern Africa and elsewhere; and Promote the appropriate manage- ment and use of wilderness areas. It has also been concerned with: Submissions to governments, politicians, decision-makers and international agencies on the value of wilderness; and Education and training programs for wilderness managers, administrators, users of wilderness areas and communitiesliving adjacent to wilderness areas. By the 1990s, WAG was fully involved in a vigorous training program to fill a clearly perceived void. It also realized that it was not only formal organizations thatrequired such training but that other NGOs and communi- ties with direct and indirect interests in wilderness needed to be vitally involved. It also became evident that its partnership with the United States Forest Service was pivotal in developing training, given the considerable experience from those parts. So, itdelivered courses from the early 1990s, training some 500 to 600 participants over an 8-year period\u2014both in South Africa and in Namibia, where similar concerns and a growingwilderness expertise made for happy synergy. In 1998, WAG and CEAD met to formally discuss the evolution of a partnership to forward the training programthey had developed. Also attending was Dr. Wayne Freimund from the Wilderness Institute, University of Montana, Schoolof Forestry. This tripartite alliance has been important in the development of the management training that has ensued, as indicated later in this paper. The Centre for Environment and Development-Univer- sity of Netal, established in 1995, has three key functions: (1) teaching, (2) research, and (3) outreach activities. In its inception years, the flagship activity has been a 1-year interdisciplinary course work Masters Program in Environ- ment and Development (MEnvDev). The program annuallyattracts 25 or so students, from all over Africa in particular. In more recent times, students and researchers from other parts of the globe are joining the program, denoting a moreglobal appeal of the program and the work of CEAD. How- ever, the African nature of the programs remains a key strength. From a potential focus on wilderness alone, the meeting mentioned earlier also resulted in the establishment of an entirely new program of postgraduate study in ProtectedArea Management (PAM). The first intake of postgraduate students will enter the program in July 2002. The PAM program admirably complements the MEnvDev program.Its purpose is to produce graduates who understand the concepts and principles of Protected Area Management in the local and Southern African context. These graduates willprovide the skills and expertise critical to institutions and communities tasked with managing the sustainable use of all categories of protected areas. It is useful to touch on one or two aspects of the PAMprogram, since we see that as the context for futurewilderness teaching and management training. PAM opens up the possibility to train managers of Wilderness through participation in the Masters pro- gram itself. This will enable graduates (exit qualifica-tions include certificates, diploma, and degree options) to have training in conservation management and prin- ciples from theory and practice that are directly rel-evant to wilderness. Professional short courses associated with PAM willinclude the Wilderness Concepts and Practice course,open to all who meet the necessary entrance require- ments. This course has evolved out of the two courses developed by WAG, the Basic and the Advanced man-agement courses, offered before the alliance was set in place. The offering of the Basic and the Advanced manage- ment courses to potential audiences as in the past. The offering of specially tailored courses based on thoseabove, for example, as in the Special Course given justprior to the 7 th World Wilderness Congress. CEAD/WAG Partnership TANSTAAFL is a wonderful acronym boldly making the point that, \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.\" Any partnership requires careful nurturing, and a hallmark ofthis one has been the joint commitment of both parties. What then makes for the successes that it has achieved? The following issues spring to mind:36 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Densham and Fincham WAG-CEAD Alliance: Commitment to Wilderness Training and Protection in Southern Africa Complementarity\u2014Each partner has brought specific skills to the marriage. WAG's practical experience hasbeen invaluable. CEAD's interdisciplinary expertise and unique position within the academic community is vitally important. Complexity\u2014The very nature of wilderness begs a mul- tifaceted examination. To progress in the training and garnishing of management skills for wilderness meansthat learners must, on the one hand, not embrace wilderness concepts and practice via experiential learn- ing from practitioners alone. That learning must bepackaged within a broader range of theoretical eco- nomic, environmental, social, political, and ethical con- siderations that work at different scales within a system(fig. 1). WAG provides the former, and the university provides the latter. Problem-based learning\u2014This approach to training (fig. 2) is well suited to the wilderness philosophy. Learning is Teacher controlLearner control LecturesProject/case study work Problem solving Learner control Figure 2\u2014Opting for problem- and project-based learning.Boundaries set by symptoms of a \"problem\" (that is, an issue) Key: N = Natural S = Social T = Technological Macro-level emergent phenomena from T-N-S interaction aggregation from below Meso-level decision environment set by macro-level emergent phenomena at meso-level aggregation from below Micro-level decision environment set by macro-/meso-levels emergent phenomena at micro-levelNS T NS T NS T Figure 1\u2014Issues leading to emergent phenom- ena (Botchway and others: 398, fig 24.1). Emer-gence refers to the phenomena whereby causes at one hierarchical level generate qualitatively new characteristics at another level of greatercomplexity. Translated into our terms, wilderness problems mainly caused by the complex interac- tions between technological (T), natural (N), andsocial (S) systems across space and time.driven by the learner; the lecturing and wilderness experts act as facilitators. The ability to link theory andpractice in a meaningful way is greatly enhanced. Accreditation\u2014All courses taught are now fully accred-ited within a University System that has internationalstanding and demands quality assurance in the deliv- ery of its programs. Skills Development Act of the Republic of South Africa\u2014 In an effort to enhance the skill levels in all organiza- tions, each one has to pay a 1-percent levy on all salaried individuals within it. In turn, about 75 percent of thatlevy is retrievable if staff are sent on accredited training programs. The Concepts and Practice courses meet these requirements, and so it means that future intakes are, inprinc iple, assured for organizations whose mainstream activities include wilderness management. Evaluation and review process\u2014I (the Coordinator of the training program) have instituted a course evalua- tion and review system that obtains strong feedback from learners and from those who teach on the course.In this way the program remains relevant and meets needs. Adaptability\u2014Courses can be adapted and tailor made to suit the requirements of clients. A virtual reality\u2014CEAD and WAG have long held thephilosophy that \"small is beautiful.\" The courses devel-oped through the partnership have not required huge infrastructural requirements, but rather the develop- ment of course material and staff skills that are readilytransportable. As such, the courses can be taken to different venues. Delivery in the Southern African De- velopment Community region and further afield aredistinct possibilities. Partnership Achievements________ Following are some of the key achievements to date: Proven contribution to trained management capacity\u2014There is now a trained cadre of field workers who can provide management capacity in wilderness designated areas, specifically within an African context. Involvement of communities abutting and/or with a stake in wilderness areas in capacity building\u2014Com munities abutting on wilderness are developing capacity to ap-preciate and contribute to wilderness conservation. Professional training of postgraduate students\u2014Studentsare being trained at a postgraduate level in Wilderness Concepts and Practice . Exposure for wilderness\u2014The courses have provided broad exposure for the need of wilderness conservationin an underdeveloped or disadvantaged world context. Development of expertise in making managementplans\u2014The ability of a broad group of learners to con-duct management plans is in place. Assistance in the proclamation of new wilderness areasand setting in place wilderness legislation\u2014The settingaside of new wilderness areas in Southern Africa has taken place, and WAG in particular has made consider- able contributions to the legislative process in SouthAfrica.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 37Densham and Fincham WAG-CEAD Alliance: Commitment to Wilderness Training and Protection in Southern Africa Namibian Wilderness Training Initiative\u2014The Namibian Wilderness Association (NWA) has indicatedthat they wish to, and are capable of, assuming the role of a Wilderness training provider. The NWA has stated that they wish to retain their association with WAG andCEAD. However, they will be seeking a more direct partnership with the Polytechnic of Namibia in respect to accreditation. Constraints ____________________ The following have been identified as limiting factors in the sustained development of training in wilderness management: Need for self-sufficiency\u2014Becoming self-sufficient froma funding perspective will be a necessity. Taking fulladvantage of the Skills Development Act will be crucial so that relevant courses become self-supporting and donor funds are not necessary. Striving for formal support\u2014The formal support from conservation organizations will be crucial so that staff is required to undertake relevant courses, including theanchor Basic and Advanced courses specifically de- signed for managers and the Wilderness Concepts and Practices fashioned for postgraduate student training. Executive and senior management training\u2014At present, there is no strong targeting of executive/senior manage- ment within the teaching schema. Invariably, this keygroup of decisionmakers do not rate wilderness as a priority within sustainable development and conserva- tion contexts. They generally do not understand orappreciate the need for wilderness and its special visitorand management requirements. The training of facilitators\u2014The facilitators of the train-ing programs need to ensure that relevant individualsand organizations master the wilderness material and can, themselves, become facilitators. The inception of a Train the Facilitators course in October of this year has paved the way to ensure this capability into the future. The maintenance of standards is crucial\u2014The Univer-sity of Montana has, in principle, agreed to act as anoutside evaluator of all courses developed, and that role must be ensured. Government support\u2014Government support for wilder- ness is understandably limited. Here, the work of the Wilderness Action Group, the Centre for Development, the Wilderness Leadership School, and the WildernessFoundation provides a model so that this program of training can be emulated. The need to spread the message\u2014There remains a limited number of key NGOs in the region that do not know of the program. Strategies to involve them will be essential. The need for a focused research initiative to underpin the training\u2014No teaching initiative can long remain relevant and vibrant without reference to practitionerswho are at the cutting edge of discovery around their area of expertise. As such, a vision for linking research to the teaching program is necessary.Looking to the Future ____________ The context in which protected areas are managed, whether under private, State, or communal ownership, has changed dramatically. Whereas, in the past, a professional approach to species protection many have been appropriate, now it isnecessary to manage simultaneously for social, economic, and biodiversity sustainability within and across socio- political and geographical boundaries. To bring about afresh approach to the job, a new generation of managers is required. The development of the Protected Area Management (PAM) program at CEAD-University of Natal provides a context within which wilderness concerns can be strategi- cally integrated within a broader educational program.Wilderness must be conceived literally and figuratively as an integral part of conservation management. It must not be viewed as an \"add on\" or a \"nice to have\" activity. This is the strategy being adopted by the WAG-CEAD partnership. It provides a model for furthering wilderness teaching, research, and outreach, and it is one that can beadopted more widely outside the confines of these two organizations. Under their auspices, in association, or sim- ply bearing the lessons learnt here, the promulgation of newinitiatives is entirely feasible and to be welcomed.

In 1997, the Recreational Opportunities Zoning (ROZ) Plan was developed to meet the needs and expectations of widely different levels of visitors, by presenting as broad a range ofwilderness qualities as possible, based on the premise that no facets of biodiversity conservation are significantly affected by existing ecotourism activities within KNP. As pressure to generate revenuemounts, there is an increasing squeeze on wilderness areas and the sense of place within KNP. The boundaries and development limi- tations of the ROZ Plan, the very policy that was designed to allowa graded range of wilderness experiences, is being challenged. The KNP zoning policy and philosophy is presented, as well as a nonquantified assessment of the environmental impacts ofecotourism within the Park, to challenge the premise that biodiversity conservation is not affected by tourism developments. A simple investigation into the ecological basis for zoning within KNP hasbeen included, as well as a list of shortcomings that should be addressed in the upcoming revision of this policy. Introduction ____________________ One of the fundamental drawing cards for visitors to Kruger National Park (KNP) is its wide range of intrinsic and often intangible \"wilderness qualities.\" These vary inWilderness, Wilderness Quality Management, and Recreational Opportunities ZoningWithin Kruger National Park, South Africa Stefanie Badenhorst Jan P. Erasmus Freek J. VenterFlip J. Nel degree from pristine wilderness trails and areas to large, well-developed, and modernized rest camps. The attributes, which are perceived, sought, and experienced, include re- moteness, serenity, peace, wildness, solitude, harmony, re-flection opportunities, and inspiration. The intensity with which the environment is experienced is a direct function of the ambience and spirit of a place that combines bothphysical characteristics and atmosphere, also termed the \"sense of place\" (fig. 1). History of Zoning in Kruger National Park Zoning in KNP has been a source of debate for many years and is an ongoing challenge in terms of the geographic extentand size of different zones, their desired quality of pristine-ness, and the development and management thereof. Gener- ally, criticisms and conflicts arise over the varying range of perception, expectation, and interpretation of what wilder-ness is and how it should be treated. The KNP 1975 Masterplan (Joubert 1975) resulted in 32 zones being identified within five main categories: (1) botanicpriority areas, (2) wilderness areas of minimal human influ- ence, (3) rare antelope priority areas, (4) elephant priority areas, and (5) general wildlife areas. These were delimitedprimarily on the basis of vegetation and animal communi- ties, with no attempt made to categorize the intensity of tourism development. The subsequent delineation of 35 landscape types, based on extensive phytosociological surveys, geomorphological features, soil types and vegetation (Coetzee 1983; Gertenbach 1978, 1983; associated faunal communities were consid- ered more appropriate units for the zoning of KNP. Thereasoning was based on the fact that composition of land- scapes reflects the natural diversity of species and structure of the area and thus represents the primary priorities for thePark's management. Thus, in 1986, the KNP Masterplan included a zonation plan based entirely on the 35 land- scapes, with all landscapes including wilderness zones, natu- ral zones, and development/general tourism zones (Joubert 1986). This formed the basis of the revised zonation policy developed from the 1997 review of the KNP Master Plan.40 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Freitag-Ronaldson, Kalwa, Badenhorst, Erasmus, Venter, and Nel Wilderness, Wilderness Management, and Recreational Oppor tunities...

Wilderness Within the Kruger National Park Management Framework As part of the 1997 Master Plan review and contribution to the management of KNP, an objectives hierarchy (Volume VII) (Braack 1997a) and revised policy recommendations (Volume VIII) (Braack 1997b) were developed as supple-ments to the 1986 Master Plan. This places the wilderness theme, as one of the four cornerstone objectives under the KNP Mission Statement, into context within the overallKNP management framework (fig. 2). The zonation subobjective has received the most attention and resulted in the development of the Recreational Opportunities Zoningpolicy in 1997 (Venter and others 1997). Recreational Opportunity Zoning Plan for Kruger National Park _____ Zonation in the 1997 revision of the Master Plan for the management of KNP aims to meet the needs and expecta- tions of widely different levels of \"wilderness\" visitors and,therefore, presents as broad a range of wilderness qualities as possible. This zonation exercise was termed the Recre-ational Opportunities Zoning Plan (ROZ, figure 3, table 1; Venter and others 1997) and has been a useful guide to the further infrastructure and ecotourism developments in thePark. It was argued at the time of formulation of the ROZ policy, that the conservation of wilderness for its own sake was nota driving issue. This premise was based on the fact that the conservation of all facets of biodiversity, namely structure, function, and composition, were not significantly affected byexisting ecotourism activities anywhere within KNP. The proper management of ecotourism use was considered to pose no threat to the Park's primary conservation objective,namely ecosystem maintenance. Biodiversity maintenance was thus no longer the driving principle behind the zoning of KNP, but it was recognized that visitors to conservationareas seek intangible attributes of \"wilderness qualities\" such as solitude, remoteness, and peace, in addition to simply viewing wildlife. This led to a philosophy of maximiz-ing wilderness experience and opportunities for visitors in the ROZ Plan. Figure 2\u2014Position of wilderness and zoning objectives within the overall Kruger National Park management framework (compiled from Volume VII of the KNP Master Plan; Braack 1997a).ROZ PlanKNP MISSION STATEMENT To maintain biodiversity in all its natural facets and fluxes, and to provide human benefits in keeping with the mission of the South African National Parks in a manner which detracts as little as possible from the wilderness qualities of the KNP WILDERNESS QUALITIES OBJECTIVEBALANCING OBJECTIVEHUMAN BENEFITS OBJECTIVEBIODIVERSITY OBJECTIVE TO MAINTAIN WITHIN ALL AREAS OF THE KNP THOSE SPIRITUAL AND EXPERIENTIAL QUALITIES1 ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONCEPT OF WILDERNESS 2, ACHIEVED THROUGH DEFINED MANAGEMENT OF ZONES AIMED AT PRESERVING DIFFERING DEGREES OF WILDERNESS EXPERIENCE. (1 By \"spiritual and experiential qualities\" is meant, amongst others, solitude, remoteness, wildness, serenity, harmony and other attributes; 2where the attributes of a naturally-functioning ecosystem and its associated ambience remain unimpaired by humans) AWARENESS OBJECTIVE To promote an appreciation of the intrinsic inspirational and recreational values of wilderness qualities as manifested at different levels. ZONATION OBJECTIVE To plan, develop and implement a zonation system providing a range of differing degrees of wilderness experience in a manner which strives to maximise throughout the KNP those attributes which make up wilderness qualities. To recommend upper and lower limits for the proportion and composition of areas allocated to the different wilderness quality zonesMONITORING & MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE To develop appropriate monitoring mechanisms to verify whether those qualities and experiences for which zones have been allocated are being maintained, and target attributes which may require restoration so as to achieve specifications of individual zones.COLLABORATION & NETWORK OBJECTIVE To develop, implement and maintain a collaborative network between the KNP and other conservation or wilderness-associated institutions (regional, national, international) so as to promote wilderness qualities and associated values.AUDIT OBJECTIVE To establish a regular external auditing capacity to ensure that wilderness qualities are not being eroded within the KNP.POLICY & LEGAL OBJECTIVE To ensure that legislation exists to adequately protect the maintenance of zones of wilderness qualities (as specified under Recreational Opportunities Zonation) and their designated borders within National Parks.42 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Freitag-Ronaldson, Kalwa, Badenhorst, Erasmus, Venter, and Nel Management, and Recreational Oppor tunities... Figure 3\u2014Recreational Opportunity Zoning Plan within Kruger National Park.Nevertheless, pristine minimum impact zones were re- tained in substantial tracts in the ROZ Plan on the basis of(1) keeping options open for future generations, (2) providing for the increasing need of a sector of society seeking remote- ness and a back-to-basics approach in truly pristine andunaffected wilderness, and (3) satisfying the ethical and moral justification for at least some such areas remaining. Many of these wilderness areas (pristine and primitivecategories) are located in blocks historically unaffected by development, but often peripheral to the Park or fragmented by linear management and other infrastructure developments. The ROZ system was thus devised within the wilderness objective ...to maintain within all areas of KNP those spiritual and experiential qualities associated with the concept of wilder- ness, achieved through defined management zones aimed atpreserving differing degrees of wilderness experience (figs. 2 and 3; table 1). Zone delineation took into account the following: 1. Due consideration for the distribution of existing wil- derness areas and wilderness trail operations (= zonation bydefault).2. Designation of the most appropriate and sustainable environmental zonation for an area. 3. The extent of possible alteration by future human actions. 4.Distribu tion of impacts in time and space that affected existing zonation at the time of ROZ development ( such as, management actions and existing infrastructure and development). 5. Cognizance of uncertainty or sensitivity to specific zone designation for an area. Challenges to the ROZ Policy One of the fundamental reasons for continuous challenges to the ROZ policy by development proposals is the perceptionthat zone definition is not made explicit enough and that the ecological basis for setting aside these areas is not empha- sized. This is coupled, to some degree, with the notion thatwilderness areas do not generate comparative incomes to other developed zones. This has resulted in some \"bending of the rules,\" as the intrinsic need for and right of pristine andprimitive wilderness areas and associated wilderness quali- ties are not viewed equally by all parties. Similarly, the impacts of tourism have not been quantitatively assessedand thus no impact value is put to these, and they are considered insignificant or absent. Ecological Basis of Zoning in Kruger National Park Assessed \u2014The zoning proposed by Joubert in 1986, and based on the 35 landscapes described by Gertenbach (1983),form the basis of the zoning policy described in the ROZ Plan. However, these ecological principles underlying zone delin- eation are not explicitly stated, which has led to somechallenges to the underlying philosophy of ROZ in KNP. Over the years, there have been a number of different ecological systems of land classification used in KNP (for a comparative summary see Solomon and others 1999). Here,we use (1) the Venter-based land classification hierarchy (Venter 1990), which is mainly focussed on the decisive role of soil characteristics in shaping plant communities of theLowveld region, and (2) the Gertenbach landscape classifi- cation (Gertenbach 1983), based on geomorphology, climate, soil, vegetation pattern, and associated fauna. A simpleGeographical Information System (GIS) based analysis of geographical overlays of ROZ zones and Gertenbach's land- scapes (n = 35), as well as Venter's land systems (n = 11) andland types (n = 56), was used to evaluate the ecological basis for zoning within KNP. The results are provided in figures 4 and 5, where bar graphs indicate the extent of coverage byROZ zones, as well as wilderness zones only (categories A and B) afforded each land unit (be it land system, landscape, or land type). Figure 4a graphically illustrates the spread ofland units across ROZ zones in KNP, indicating complete representation of all three land classification units in the pristine and primitive wilderness zones (zones A and B). Themajority of land units are also represented by more than 40 percent of their areas in wilderness zones (fig. 4b). If Venter's land type is used as the mesoscale most desir- able and adequately detailed unit of land definition, eight land types stand out as being potentially underrepresented (<35 percent of their areas) in the wilderness zones of KNPas currently defined geographically: Lwakahle, Marithenga, Badenhorst, Erasmus, Venter, and Nel Wilderness, Wilderness Quality Management, and Recreational Oppor tunities...

At the slightly courser Gertenbachlandscape scale, landscape 8 is severely underrepresented in wilderness zones (fig. 5b). This constitutes the moderately undulating granitic plains with C. mopane tree savanna, namely, the Phalaborwa sandveld. At the macroscale of land systems, the least represented land system in wilderness areas is the Bulweni system (BU, fig. 5a), a very narrow andsensitive north-south land system. Environmental Impacts of Wildlife Tourism \u2014A nonquantified assessment of the environmental impacts of ecotourism within KNP is presented here to challenge the premise that biodiversity conservation is not affected bytourism developments within the Park (table 2). Many of these impacts have been observed by rangers and others, and have been grouped and summarized here. The conclusion can be drawn that, although only <3 percent of KNP is directly disturbed by human infrastructure, there is evidence that certain components of biodiversity (struc-ture, function, composition) may be affected, and the overall Table 1\u2014Con.ABCDEFHigh-density Zone Pristine Primitive Semiprimitive Limited motorizedMotorized miles) ofboundary Accommodation\u2014tentor rustic hut Camping with own tentAccess mainly ongraveled roads Permanent luxury (lowdensity) camps Permanent rusticcamps Camping with own tentor caravanUnrestricted to mainly ontarred accessbut limited to officialroads Access on tarred andgraveled roads Permanent (high-density) camps withmodern amenities Permanent rusticcamps Camping with own tentor caravan possible Figure 4\u2014Extent of representation of differ- ent land type classifications (land systems, landscapes, land types) in ROZ zones in Kruger National Park: (a) number of land units per classification type within zones A to D; (b) percent of land units represented within wilderness zones A and B.10(a) land systemslandscapesland types5356 49 3133 35 32 24 111111 702030405060Number represented 02468101214161820Number of land units 01 - 2 0 21-40 41-60 61-80 81-100 Percent in wilderness areas (zones A and B)land systems land types landscapes(b)A ROZ zoneBCDUSDA 2003 45Freitag-Ronaldson, Kalwa, Badenhorst, Erasmus, Venter, and Nel Quality Management, and Recreational Oppor tunities...

Ground hornbills beg for food along most tarred roads. Baboons and vervet monkeys have become problems at picnic sites and rest camps, although they are still completely wild in wilderness areas and avoid trails and camps in these areas. Terrapins at water points along general tourist roads feed on tidbits thrown to them and may even \"beg.\" Bushbuck in Letaba Camp often feed on pasta, bread, and a variety of other dishes offered to them by tourists. Honey badgers, various mongooses, and spotted hyenas often raid dustbins and are fed around rest camps, particularly along fencelines. Diurnal birds, such as fork-tailed drongos, have been known to become nocturnal because of perma- nent spotlights at camps. Artificial lights and lighting attract insects, which attract frogs, which in turn attract snakes, which are often killed. Yellow-billed kites and other birds become problematic at picnic sites and camps where they are fed and/or become thieves in their own right. Vultures have been known to follow helicopters during culling operations. Tortoises picked up and removed from the field. Fish trapped in wire gabions during flood conditions and sometimes exploited by staff and visitors, primarily as a food source. Mutilation and theft of plants for private use or gardens. Collection of medicinal plants or plant parts. Predation efforts are disturbed, for example, along tarred roads with high volumes of traffic. Conversely, predators may capitalize on the distraction caused to prey by vehicles. Certain KNP lion prides have become experts at catching giraffe by causing them to slip on tarred roads or up road embankments. Predators may kill antelope by chasing them into camp fences. Scrub hares, kudu, and so forth, often congregate within fenced-off camp areas and attract predators, such as leopard regularly found inside Berg-en-Dal Camp fence. Numerous reports and suspected cases of cross-breeding of domestic cats and African wild cats in peripheral areas of KNP. Occurrence of exotic Nile tilapia and silver carp in KNP rivers, and the probability of hybridizing with indigenous fish species. The introduction of alien plant seeds into the KNP system, and further spread thereof on vehicle tires, and so forth, (for example, the suspected spread of red water fern ( Azolla filiculoides ) along the eastern boundary rivers and tributaries by vehicles on the Lebombo Overland Ecotrail). Inadvertent introductions of locally foreign animal species into areas of KNP from neighboring farms and reserves, such as gemsbok from the Timbavati area and nyala from Mthethomusha and SabiePark Reserves. Snakes and scorpions are readily killed in rest camps, as they are viewed as undesirable. Poisons and other means are used to remove or kill ants, bees, wasps, and so forth. Monkeys and baboons are regularly killed in and around rest camps and picnic spots as problem animals. Kori bustards in the Lower Sabie area have been killed against powerlines when flushed during night drives. Powerlines can potentially kill many large birds, and there have been reports of giraffe electrocuted by sagging powerlines (when supporting poles are pushed over by elephants). Grey louries and other birds have been recorded as drowning in reservoirs. Road kills by speeding tourists and staff are ongoing and include wild dog pups, lion cub, honey badger, impala lambs, and many nocturnal and other birds. Numerous night-jar and scrub-hare road kills, especially on tarred roads at night when there is late driving. There have been reported incidents of antelope poaching from vehicles. Animals have drowned in water troughs. Reeds, bush, and riparian trees are cut for better game-viewing opportunities. Waterholes created as game-viewing points cause unnatural game concentrations and vegetation damage. In some cases, erosion also results due to bad placement on sensitive soils. Sewage systems/French drains/artificial wetlands create new unnatural habitats, sometimes in naturally dry areas.

The Way Forward _______________ As pressure to develop and generate much needed revenue mounts, there is an increasing squeeze on wilderness areas,as well as the greater sense of place within KNP. This is exerted directly on the boundaries and development limita- tions of the existing ROZ Plan, resulting in challenges to thevery policy that was designed to allow a graded range of wilderness experiences. A revision of the ROZ Plan is sched- uled for the upcoming months, and a number of issues thatneed to be addressed during this process are listed in table 3. In addition, pressures around the borders of KNP are mount- ing as developments impinge on the conservation area,effectively reducing the nonimpacted core area and shrink- ing the distribution of \"pure\" wilderness attributes. It is accepted that a system of zoning alone will not provide a holistic approach to the protection of wilderness qualities or wilderness areas, but that an integrated environmental management approach is needed. Park managers mustsolidify the basis upon which to consolidate the maintenance of a graded wilderness system that combines societal values, biodiversity conservation, precautionary principles, andsustainable development into a balanced plan guiding the further development and expansion of Kruger National Park.Tarred roads lead to increased runoff stimulating tree growth and encroachment\u2014this is particularly noticeable with mopani in the northern KNP and sickle-bush in the south. Litter degrades the natural scene and is a danger to wildlife. An extreme example is the dump sites. Weirs, dam walls, and gabions have a barrier effect to fish migrations and may lead to deaths and disturbance of migrations and spawning. Certain activities may result in introduction or spreading of alien biota (for example, the spread of Azolla on the Lebombo Ecotrail route). Floods cause damage to infrastructure that requires significant reconstruction and the use of gravel and sand from natural sources, as well as resulting in unsightly concrete and other debris being deposited in river systems. Dust from gravel roads affects plants and their palatability. Widespread harvesting and subsequent transport of thatching grass on open vehicles has increased the distribution of this species along roadsides. Building materials (for example, the use and transport of river sand) spread alien seeds and plants. Artificial dams and other water surfaces increase the distribution and breeding habitats of mosquitoes and associated malaria epidemics. During summer months, tarred roads may be hot barriers to movements of snakes, reptiles, and so forth, and may be a death trap for insects, snails, millipedes, and so forth, that are killed by vehicles. Road construction has resulted in many instances of unnatural damming of water flows. Vehicle or other tourist activity disrupts animal group cohesion by separating groups of animals on either side of a road. Similarly, traffic and tourist interest may result in separation of parents from their offspring when crossing roads.Table 2\u2014Con.

In principle, there should be no structures in wilderness areas, with the exception of possible water points. Gravel pits, old structures, and so forth, must be rehabilitated. Rubbish, stockpiled gravel, andso forth, to be removed. Where a motorized zone directly borders a pristine wilderness zone, no cascading of zones is practical or necessary\u2014the core area can be managed as pristine. Propose a Wilderness Buffer Quality Zone\u2014this should enable a ranking of proposed activities on the edge of wilderness zones according to size, scale, and persistence of impacts (for example, a vehicle has a short-term impact while driving by, while a structure on the edge of a wilderness zone ispermanent and will always lower the quality of the wilderness experience). Roads within a cluster of wilderness blocks should be downgraded and, where possible, completely rehabilitated. Impacts must be managed in all instances\u2014this should be made explicit in a management plan for all zones.

Cement drifts must be maintained on the \"best practice principle\" \u2014avoid building cement drifts in wilderness areas where possible. If a drift is necessary, it must be built with the least impact and as unobtrusively as possible.

It discusses the value of Recreational Oppor- tunity Zoning within the boundaries of the Park, as well as theimpacts of boundary intrusions on its wilderness characteristics. The need for an Integrated Management Approach near Park boundaries is highlighted, and the concept of a \"brick wall syn-drome\" is discussed in detail. Possible solutions are suggested, and it is concluded that the answer may lie within adopting an Inte- grated Development Zone approach for the Park's border areas. Introduction ____________________ Game Rangers in Kruger National Park have the man- date to protect and manage the integrity of this unique system. They are faced with many challenges in this regard, and have managed the Park's 22 sections, protecting itscomponents of biodiversity, for over 100 years. Some 200 field rangers assist the section rangers in daily counter poaching exercises and patrols. The gradual growthof the white rhinoceros population over the past threedecades, together with an increase in elephant numbers, bear testimony to their achievements. This success is also reflected in the following figures: only five elephant and 15 white rhinoceros deaths related to poaching incidents were recorded during the past 3 years. The size of Kruger National Park (more than 2 million ha, or7,722 miles 2), the diversity in topography, and the extreme changes in climatic conditions make this an achievement of note. In addition to many other challenges facing the rangers in the year 2000, the increase in alien plant infestations have impacted on available manpower and budgetary require-ments. Rangers have responded to this exotic threat, and more than 100,000 foreign plants have been eradicated or removed over the past 18 months in southern Kruger Parkalone. It is, however, suggested that there are other threats to the integrity of Kruger National Park, and many may argue that these are more significant and have a greaterimpact on the future of this natural heritage.Cross-Boundary Impacts in the Crocodile River Valley: A National Parks Perspective Ralf H. Kalwa Recreational Opportunity Zone Plan______________________ During the late 1990s, Kruger National Park embarked upon an ambitious exercise to reevaluate its Management Plan. Scientists, rangers and other interested and affectedparties became party to a plethora of workshops and public debates. Various aspects of the management plan were scrutinized and reassessed. The Fire Policy, the ElephantManagement Plan, the Water Provision Policy, and the Recreational Opportunity Zone (ROZ) Plan, were some of the management tools that faced revision and that wereaccepted by the South African National Parks Board (SANParks) for implementation. The ROZ Plan was regarded as a useful tool in the management decisionmaking process. Although it has been criticized for delineating Kruger National Park into zones based on the wildlife experiences that could be expected, itdid carve the route for the establishment of Wilderness Areas. Many will argue that these wilderness zones are far from perfect. This may be so; however, the challenge faced byrangers in the year 2000 is to ensure that these areas are conserved in all their facets and fluxes, and that rehabilita- tion programs are implemented with the same vigor andenthusiasm afforded to counter poaching programs and alien plant control. The ROZ Plan recognized the recreational value of the various zones and landscapes in Kruger National Park (fig.1). Based on this approach, 49 percent of the surface area was allocated to a wilderness land use. The challengefaced by rangers was to manage the pristine value awarded to these areas and to maintain the particular characteris- tics associated with this type of land use. Essentially, theseareas are untrammeled by man, have little or no man-made influences or infrastructure present within their bound- aries, and are open for public use for hiking and sleepingclose to nature, with its limitations and splendors. Primitive and pristine hiking areas within Kruger Na- tional Park are also targeted for rehabilitation and correc-tive management programs to rectify mistakes and improve their \"wilderness\" characteristics.

Law enforcement and conserva- tion management in this zone is particularly difficult, andvarious government departments and associations are at loggerheads as to who should carry the responsibility for this \"gray area.\" Boundary Intrusions_____________ Developers adjacent to this \"no mans land\" have capital- ized on this confusion and are building closer and closer to the water's edge, infringing upon the Park's boundary. In manycases, these developments do not follow the Integrated Envi- ronmental Management approach, with tragic results. Cross- boundary intrusions include light and visual pollution fromspotlights that are seen by our tourists during night drives-up to 13 km (8 miles) into Kruger National Park. The millennium floods of February 2000 comfortably pressed the reset button, and many structures were dam- aged and washed away. Kruger National Park and its rivers are now inundated with broken pieces of building rubble,decks, pump houses, entertainment lapas, and other struc- tures that were built in and around the Park's boundary, below the 1:50 year flood line. The industrial boom associated with the advent of the Maputo Corridor has increased noise levels, which can be heard by the hikers in the primitive wilderness zone 25km (15.5 miles) into the Malelane Mountains. An increasein rail and road traffic compounds this \"annoyance\" factor even further. Pump stations, loyally drawing on the water resources from the Crocodile River to quench the ever-thirsty cane fields, add to this constant hum in the air. This is regularly interrupted by the aerobatics and thunderous roar of thecrop sprayer leaping from field to field in its endeavor to boost agricultural yield. Wilderness trail rangers have been forced to seek refuge on the rare occasion a pilot has \"transgressed\" the Kruger Park airspace and \"spooked\" an elephant or buffalo herd into a short stampede. One may be excused to ask whether theseclients should continue supporting this hiking area under these conditions. Prevailing intrusions and pollution threat- ening the integrity of these unique areas have becomedifficult to mitigate. \"Brick Wall Syndrome\"___________ In the late 1990s, the ranger corps in this area realized that the threats to our unique National Park had shiftedfrom the impacts of poaching, toward the negative, long- term impacts of indiscriminate developments and associ- ated wilderness and habitat degradation. It soon becameevident that the Park (the ROZ Plan), its boundary, and the neighbors on the southern bank of the Crocodile River were interconnected, like the bricks in a wall.Removing one or two bricks at a time would not necessar- ily cause the wall to topple; however, at some unknown pointin the future, the removal of one brick too many may cause the system to collapse. The future of the wall lay in Inte- grated Environmental Management. Lower Crocodile River Environmental Group: A Fresh Initiative ________________ Discussions initiated by the local ranger and backed by management saw the establishment of the Lower CrocodileRiver Environmental Group (LCREG). More than 100 inter- ested and affected parties workshopped towards the follow- ing vision statement: To balance all interests in the Crocodile River Region towards sustainability. Participants agreed to support the following objectives: Whilst ensuring environmental integrity the LCREG should: optimize economic growth for the region, optimize economic opportunities in the region, optimize sustainable resource utilisation and manage- ment in the region, and establish communication highways. From this early beginning, the local ranger involved all the role players in the area to participate in the decisionmak-ing process, especially pertaining to the development initia- tives in the area. The LCREG initiative managed the process based on the principles of Integrated Management, and alldevelopments were drawn into an Environmental Assess-ment process. Decisions were not based on an ad hoc as- sumption. A process of informed decisionmaking replaced the old approach, and mitigation became a management toolused by developer and neighbor alike. The Nkomazi Toll Plaza was shifted to a new site farther down the road, the TSB Pump Station near Malelane Gatewas given a \"sound proofing\" facelift, and participation on behalf of the LCREG saved many trees in the riparian zone from being bulldozed into oblivion. Involvement further afield has brought the plight of our wilderness areas to the attention of an international consor- tium of airport developers. Noise and flyover tests withinKruger National Park will ensure that the new Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport is built at the right site and within an acceptable environmental framework. Airtraffic control (the crop sprayer?) will now be managed, and transgressions will become a management issue. The use of aircraft that satisfy European Standards are supported, andthe integrity of the ROZ Plan may now be guaranteed. Integrated Development Zone: A Pie in the Sky?________________ Where to from here? The LCREG has been operational for 3 years. At a recent plenary, its members voted to continue with this initiative and unanimously supported the objec-tives set for the group in 1996.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 53Cross Boundary Impacts in the Crocodile River Valley: A National Parks Perspective Kalwa Government legislation makes it possible for an area of special significance to be declared a Limited DevelopmentArea (LDA).

The LCREG Plenary has asked its steering commit- tee to investigate the implications of declaring the LowerCrocodile River Area an LDA.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014Within the emerging field of scholarship exploring the interaction between nature and culture in Africa, the idea of wilder- ness has provided a convenient \"straw\" target for critical research- ers. Primarily this is derived from the association between wildernessand the colonial preservationist mindset seeking to alienate indig- enous people from nature, both intellectually and materially. This essay is written from the straddling standpoint of one who has learned much from both wilderness thought and writing an- tagonistic to it. The objective is to probe for truths, thereby opening paths toward reconciliation. A more positive inclusion of wildernessin the promising research agenda exploring African landscapes is beginning to emerge and needs further encouragement. It is conven- tional wisdom that wilderness arrived on the South African conser-vation scene, and thus to Africa, in Zululand during the 1950s, through American literature eagerly grasped by rangers such as Ian Player. Another reading of the past has been made by Carruthers(1995, 2001) who found wilderness-oriented management in the policy and practice of the first warden of Kruger National Park, James Stevenson-Hamilton, which paralleled that of Aldo Leopoldin the North American context. This paper considers a telling aspect of park management not considered by Carruthers\u2014the burning regimes of the Kruger\u2014to confirm that distinctively wilderness-oriented policy and practice emerged endogenously and needs to be acknowledged and celebrated. The intention of the exercise is to demonstrate the insight of environmental history into the shiftingrelationship between culture and nature. However, for critical scholars to assist in the quest for African wilderness, some danger- ous excesses of storytelling and mythmaking have to be looked backupon and disowned. In the same gesture, others need to be brought forward and embraced since they offer wilderness a redeeming resource of hope. Wilderness and War _____________ When I wrote the above title, the 7th World Wilderness Congress was far off on a hazy horizon. My intention was tosquare a wilderness tradition up with scholarly onslaught while playing referee, commentator, and judge in the ensu- ing pages of exchange. As the title indicates, I favoredwilderness as the contender most in need of encouraging commentary and aimed to improve its bad press in academic work on Africa. I never imagined how difficult this taskwould be. What turned things around was a book hitting the market with unfortunate pre-Congress timing. Storyteller isIn Quest of African Wilderness Malcolm Draper Jones' (2001) biography of Laurens van der Post, who was, and still is, a hugely important figure for wilderness gener- ally, but for African wilderness in particular. Many keyspeakers at the Congress were clearly haunted by the dark side of this wilderness legacy and, through dismissive re- marks, unsuccessfully sought to exorcise the Congress of theshadow thrown by the book. Clearly, they were saddened by the book, but so was the author: This has also been a sad experience for me. Soon after I took on the commission I discovered, to my astonishment, that Sir Laurens was\u2014to use the (extremely) polite word\u2014a fantasist.In fact, I discovered that scarcely a word he spoke or wrote could necessarily be believed. To use Martha Gellhorn's phrase about Hemingway, he was a mythomaniac. I wasconcerned not to deny that Laurens, in his long life, achieved much good. But most readers have concluded from my book that, behind the glossy career, Laurens van der Post can bestbe described as a charlatan (Jones 2002). Like the events of September 11, 2001, the ramifications are still yet to be fully appreciated. But among the rubble of both demolition sites there is something to be learned.Perhaps the publication of an unflattering profile of such an important figure in the history of this Congress provided an opportunity to reflect on and repair some of the damage tothe wilderness ideal. Studies taking into account the interaction between cul- ture and the environment, together with a stance critical of colonial and scientific approaches to conservation in Africa,have gathered momentum in the last few decades. Anderson and Grove (1987: 5,6) pulled together a wide-ranging variety of work in a landmark volume for the environmental historyof the continent. A point of departure for them is van der Post's statement at the 2nd World Wilderness Congress: We must come to grips with the need for the survival of life on this planet and one of the most essential of these needs is the preservation of large areas of wilderness...it is a war inwhich we are engaged...it is a subject which is not political, but beyond politics, sociology, and material ideals. Anderson and Grove (1987: 5, 6) maintain that this view is \"naive and idealized\" and that their book sets out to \"explode the myth\" and \"assert the importance of sociologi- cal factors and material ideals.\" The recent revelationsabout van der Post unfortunately vindicate their argument. He wielded his considerable influence and used it in an attempt to prevent the first democratic elections in SouthAfrica. He fanned the flames of political violence, taking its toll on thousands of lives in the run up to 1994, and encour- aged Zulu and Afrikaner leaders to pull out of nationalpolitics. He was desperate for a confederate constitution for South Africa rather than a government of national unity as we now have. He dreamt of \"a model of a new world, a modelof a Zulu\u2014and ultimately Afrikaner\u2014renaissance into the spirit of a new South Africa.\" In 1992, van der Post was introduced by Ian Player to the late John Aspinall and58 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Draper In Quest of African Wilderness Jimmy Goldsmith who had thrown their maverick rightwing ideas and considerable capital behind Mangosuthu Butheleziof Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Fortu- nately, Buthelezi got swept up by the spirit of forgiveness and compromise personified by Nelson Mandela. Nonethe-less, van der Post never felt touched by \"Madiba magic.\" After meeting Thabo Mbeki in 1989, van der Post said that he and his ilk had no vision of a new and greater South Africaand that it would be wrong to build up their self-importance (Jones 2001). Like Aspinall, van der Post died deeply pessi- mistic about the future of South Africa without some form ofbalkanized homeland system along the lines of that de- signed by apartheid's architects. Both Aspinall and van der Post's vision of South Africa derived from the romantic tradition that shaped their understanding of wilderness and politics alike. Africa for them was an Eden where humanity could make a freshstart. Both were pulled along by Rousseau's historical slipstream of belief. \"Noble savages\" whose culture was shaped by the serendipity of wilderness provided the modelfor the world to follow. Granted, their ideas have to be seen in the context of their time, but both bowed out very recently and their ideas live on. Even the critical RichardGrove observed van der Post's spectre over an academic conference on African environments, at Oxford in 1999. At the same conference, I presented a paper in which wesought to come to terms with Aspinall (Draper and Mar\u00e9, in press). William Beinart, the Rhodes Chair of Race Relations, who convened and hosted the conference, said inopening that environmental history had successfully chal- lenged and inverted the colonial elevation of western cul- ture and stereotypes of Africans as incompetentenvironmental managers, but perhaps this has been all tooneat (Beinart 2000). Nevertheless, activists are more likely than academics to have led the way to this change of heart. This Congress was one such forum that has been hugelyinfluential in this regard. So, too, has been the Ecologist magazine that preceded it by 7 years. Thus, the fallout among the Ecologist editors in the late 1990s provides an instructive warning to this Congress. The Ecologist was launched by Edward (Teddy) Gold- smith with the support of both Sir James (Jimmy) Gold-smith and Aspinall. In 1972, Nicholas Hildyard joined and grew to be the most influential figure next to Teddy. By 1997, a deepening ideological rift grew into an unbridge-able chasm. Hildyard claimed that differences with the magazine's founder over ethnicity and gender issues led him and the rest of the editorial team to leave and to set upThe CornerHouse. The conflict spread waves of dissent among environmentalist circles in Britain. Hildyard (1998, 1999) maintained that in the last decade the authoritarianNew Right in Europe had consciously reframed its politics of exclusion in the progressive language of cultural differ- ence: a language that permits the racist to project racism asa socially acceptable act of loyalty to people of one's own kind or as legitimate cultural self-defense. This is precisely what Aspinall came to address the IFP about in 1992, whenhe was made an honorary Zulu in recognition of his unstint- ing patronage. He encouraged Zulus to not only proudly wield their cultural weapons, but sharpen their spears andfall on their traditional enemies\u2014the Xhosa led by Nelson Mandela (Draper and Mar\u00e9, in press; Jones 2001). Hildyardargued that such thinking becomes a politics of cultural apartheid. Within the Greens, for example, a preoccupa-tion with \"authentic cultures\" and \"ancient traditions\" naturally lends itself to a politics of authoritarian cultural essentialism (Hildyard 1998, 1999). His warning that thereis a grave danger in such ideology, could not be better illustrated than by the killing that took place as the IFP, with the support of the apartheid regime, attempted toensure its hegemony in the face of growing support among isiZulu-speaking South Africans for a more inclusive vision of a Rainbow Nation. Romantic feeding of ethnic conflict stems from a view, childlike in its simplicity, that \"natives\" can be divided into two categories: good and bad. According to Neumann (2000),African local communities are still divided into \"good\" and \"bad\" natives, depending on how close they are to nature\u2014 in the perception of conservation agencies dominated bywestern capital. The closer they are to nature the \"better\" they are, and the more they have the right to stay in the area and taste the financial privileges of western donor attention.The more \"modern\" they are, the more they pose a threat to the success of nature conservation and the farther away they should be held from these conservation areas; that is, theyshould be removed. The writing of Rider Haggard best illustrates the roman- tic view of Africa and Africans. A close friend of his wasTheophilus Shepstone, the 19 th century Native Affairs colonialist in Natal associated with designing indirect rule. Both men construed the order of things in a fashion quite outof step with their Victorian contemporaries. Most signifi- cantly, they did not associate the Zulu kingdom as \"other\" or wilderness, but inverted the opposites of their day, associat-ing colonial Natal with barbarism and chaos. Zulu patriar-chal order provided an inspiring model for these Victorian men nostalgic for older forms of authority becoming steadily undermined by modern industrialism. So, too, it did forAspinall whose boyhood reading of Haggard's Nada the Lily was life changing. According to Hamilton (1998), however, the novel explored the way the Shepstone system sought toreach into a Zulu world to discover the principles by which it might best establish its authority. Such mythical fiction inspired Aspinall to patronize both Zulu politics and Zululandwilderness conservation. Similarly, van der Post's life story is about the blurring between fiction and fact. An Indiscriminately Burning Romance ______________________ One of the tasks of social scientists, philosophers, histo- rians, and the like is to demythologize, and the \"received\"American idea of wilderness has drawn a good deal of such critical flak in recent years (Callicot and Nelson 1998; Soul\u00e9 and Lease 1995). I do not want to rehearse thesedebates here. Rather, what I want to argue is that South Africa has been largely absent from this story. This is surprising given that the wilderness history of Africabegan here, as did the World Wilderness Congress. Al- though this was in the Zululand reserves with Jim Feely, Ian Player, and others reading the received American ideasof Leopold and Tripensee, it took a very distinctive charac- ter that sets the African wilderness history apart from theUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 59In Quest of African Wilderness Draper American. Similarly, academic histories of Africa have tended to gloss over wilderness, usually conflating it withnational parks and game reserves or invoking it as an extremely conservative policy. For instance, Cock and Koch (1991: 1) introduce a volume that sought to interpretthe local progressive environmentalist agenda as follows: Until very recently the dominant understanding of envi- ronmental issues in South Africa was an authoritarian con-servation perspective. This focused exclusively on the preservation of wilderness areas and particular species of plants and animals. Jane Carruthers (1995, 2001) has provided insightful accounts of James Stevenson-Hamilton's conservation ca-reer, which began in 1902 and continued through the creation and management of Kruger National Park. She suggests that his was a nascent romantic wilderness phi-losophy and that he was suspicious of the national park concept as well as interventionist science. While he was grudgingly sympathetic of poachers and viewed thebushman's genocide as \"brutal injustice,\" he was not ro- mantic about Africans. All the same, when the National Parks Board decided to replace all African skilled laborwith whites, he was appalled, believing that \"'good natives' were far better workers than 'poor whites.'\" While he was an advocate of a restrained hand in management of thePark, he did not have any doubt about the importance of anthropogenic fire: Controlled burning of old grass...is I believe essential to the welfare of the animals in a sanctuary....It has been proved by experiment in the Park that failure to burn grass at theright time of the year [between March and May] not only drives away all game from the unburnt portions, but is the cause of devastating fires at a later period of the year. The natives on the Portuguese side of the border, invariably burned their grass in early winter, with the result that thegame used to flock over to that side, and the same was the case with the shooting-farms over to the west (Stevenson-Hamilton 1947: 14, 15). The common-sense fire regime instituted by Stevenson- Hamilton, which ruled until 1948 when the Nationalistapartheid regime took power, is righteously looked back upon by today's managers as \"indiscriminate\" burning. The absence of firebreaks and the accumulation of high fuel loadsled to occasional wildfires raging through the park in the early years (Kennedy 1999). Such lack of control was the nemesis of successive management regimes that sought tohave flame flickering benignly on the alter of science in accordance with the laws of nature, not culture. As the recent inferno claiming several human lives in the Krugertestifies, however, wildness is recalcitrant. Uncoincidentally perhaps, half of Magqubu Ntombela's speech at the first World Wilderness Congress was occupied by an eco-poeticdescription of May: Nhlangula the month of May, the month when winter starts, when the leaves fall and we feel the first pinch of cold. Thedays grow shorter and a great stillness falls upon the land. Nhlangula is the time when my people begin burning grass on the hills and pastures... (Ntombela 1979: 81). Carruthers' (1995) chapter exploring the tension between \"wilderness and science\" in Kruger National Park is entitled\"Playing God\" after Chase's book about the devastatingYellowstone Park fire in the United States, yet her social history does not include fire. Andrew Kennedy has filled thisgap and sees management of the Kruger turning full circle back to the laissez-faire philosophy of its first warden, Stevenson-Hamilton, whose motto was \"keep it simple, keepit wild.\" Kennedy's (1999) conclusion is derived in part from the Kruger's management, adopting a lightning-fire regime that assumes that humans played little or no role in burningearly African savannas. Rather than returning to Stevenson- Hamilton's view, this approach would appear to have re- jected it, and embraced an American policy\u2014onlylightning-induced fires are legitimate in large wilderness areas like Yellowstone. Pyne (1997: 451) has shown how fire is the key to understanding the separation of nature fromculture that is the hallmark of American wilderness ideology until relatively recently. For Europeans and others who have a less stringent idea of natural purity, the necessity ofhuman burning was obvious: To a new generation of critics it appeared that the only alternative to bulimic binges of fire-feast and fire-famine wasto replicate something like the indigenous fire practices. But that was tantamount to stating that the reserve had been fashioned by people, that it was not truly and purely wild, andthat wilderness was more a state of mind than a state of nature. A recent issue of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service journal Fire Management Today , containing articles by historians of fire, shows that the critics are being heeded (Pyne 2000; Williams 2000a,b). The dangerousbuildup of dry matter in the chasm between nature and culture is going up in flames, and fresh growth will no doubt emerge. Stevenson-Hamilton's approach to wilderness \"manage- ment\" flew in the face of the conservation wisdom of his time. He saw the need for fire to inhibit tree and bush growth on the African savannah, thereby cultivating range for grazinganimals. At the beginning of the last century and before, desiccation and soil erosion were perceived as the harbin- gers of an environmental apocalypse in South Africa. In themid-nineteenth century, a Scottish missionary in Cape Town, Croumbie-Brown, advocated a halt to deforestation and advocated the planting of \"trees of righteousness\" (Grove1997). Although not Scottish, continuing in this tradition was Father Bernard Huss, the social apostle of MarrianhillMission near Durban, whose career was parallel to Stevenson- Hamilton. He was the teacher of and guru to hugely impor- tant African intellectuals such as H. I. E. Dhlomo and B. W.Vilikazi. He also taught Robert Mazibuko agriculture. Mazibuko, fondly remembered as the \"tree man,\" became a leading light of environmentalism through his advocacy oforganic horticulture, tree planting, and the like. Mazibuko won many accolades such as the Audi Terra Nova award shared by Ian Player and Credo Mutwa. Huss's Textbook on Agriculture was first published in 1921 and continued to be printed over two decades. It was translated into several African languages and widely used in \"native\" education.Father Huss broke new ground with what probably was the first significant environmental education initiative in South- ern Africa, carrying as it does a strident conservation mes-sage. I am currently trying to disentangle his message from that of Mazibuko whose prophetic words, such as \"soil60 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Draper In Quest of African Wilderness erosion leads to soul erosion and visa versa,\" are still alive in our minds after his death in 1997, but this cannot be donehere. Yet, like those who went before him, Huss advocated afforestation by exotic species as an imperative to bring rain and shore up soil erosion. Today of course, we know that itcan cause desiccation and erosion. Huss also advocated the \"conservation\" of native bush and forests that are destroyed by \"indiscriminate\" cutting and burning, \"especially by na-tives and Indians...by contemptuous disregard for the laws of nature, we bring down curses upon the land\" (Huss 1936: 60). The use of the term \"'indiscriminate,\" to describe indig- enous burning practices and settler emulation thereof, by both contemporary science and early missionary environ-mentalism, is not coincidental. By claiming privileged ac- cess to the laws of nature, science seeks to elevate itself as the high priesthood, dictating the terms on which cultureshould relate to nature. The new fire suppression regime in the Kruger coincided with the ascendancy to power of the apartheid regime in 1948 and also marked a separation, butbetween nature and culture, with a downturn for wilderness thinking. The social and ecological consequences of both ideas were moribund and dangerous. As had Gifford Pinchotin the U.S. Forest Service before them, this new generation of resource conservationists were confident of their mastery over nature and sought to eliminate burning that seemedwasteful. This presumption of control marked a shift that Stevenson-Hamilton would have contested given his loath- ing of scientists (Carruthers 1995, 2001). Such an attitudehad continuity after the Second World War in the Zululand reserves, where the white rhino was saved and where the first formal African wilderness areas were established byIan Player and others in tension with bureaucrats andscientists, but with a pragmatically negotiated relationship with others (Draper 1998). To use Ian Player's Jungian vocabulary, the romantic wilderness idea has a soul troubled by the shadow cast by people who once lived in African wilderness. Congress de- bates and the \"however\" clause of the Port Elizabeth Accordmake this patently obvious (Martin and Muir 2002: 7). Player, who had a role in moving \"wilderness people\" from Ndumu Game Reserve, observed this dark side of himselfand wondered if, perhaps, at least some of them should have been left to live there: These were wilderness people who had existed in a tough environment of malaria, searing heat and extreme material poverty, but spiritually they had a richness we could notimagine. They were being removed from the game reserve, and their situation would come back to haunt us. They had been part of the landscape, and although it was true that theyhad killed most of the antelope, it was their slash and burn practices that later enabled the game to increase dramati- cally when the last person left (Player 1997: 47). Player, in turn, was moved by such wilderness people, but spiritually since they \"blunted our Western mindset andsubconsciously led us on new paths\" (1997: 47). While the American and Australian idea of wilderness has been roundly criticized for the sublime being associated with \"virgin\" or\"empty\" land, the same could not be said of Africa where, in its formal birthplace in Zululand, the architects of wilder- ness recognized that the land had been occupied for millen-nia. Piety did not derive from an imaginary depopulation ofthe land, but from its indigenous inhabitants, as well as the environment from which they had been banished by theirresistible serpent of modernity. This could derive in part from the fact that South Africa was not, by Alfred Crosby's definition, a \"land of demographic takeover\" by westernEuropeans (Crosby 1988). Cultural factors were more im- portant than biological phenomena and thus have distin- guished our idea of wilderness from the received Americanidea. According to Bill Bainbridge, whose career is central to our mountain wilderness story, from their designation as such in the 1970s there was never any question about therole of anthropogenic fire. Management sought to emulate the burning practices of the San or bushmen. Since they were long gone and their remaining artifacts left little clueabout their burning habits, a combination of guesswork and science had to suffice (Bainbridge 2001). Critics, such as Cronon, argue that the sublime tendency of wilderness tends to converge around the worship of the mountain as cathedral (in Callicot and Nelson 1998). Yes, we do have our awesome Cathedral Peak in our world-heritagemountain range, but among the first areas declared wilder- ness were Zulu names such as Mdedelelo (the one who cannot be conquered), which contrasts sharply with a namesuch as Kruger, or Bob Marshall for that matter. The range itself is now called Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg, an evocative amalgam of Zulu (the barrier of spears) and Afrikaans(Dragon Mountain). The relatively peopled landscape in this region meant that we have a rich legacy of indigenous names such as those of the oldest game reserves in Africa: Hluhluwe-Umfolozi, proclaimed more than a century ago where our (official) wilderness story began. Wilderness and the African Mind? _________________________ While much has been written of the psychological function of wilderness for the American and European mind, apart from the assertion of the economic benefits thereof circulat-ing more equitably, the same cannot be said of the African mind. The problem is that today it is probably impossible to speak of such a thing as the African mind, so what we are leftwith are landscapes with multiple layers of perception. The task of sifting through the sediment of cultural deposit in Southern Africa has been taken up by a small and looseinterdisciplinary constellation. Apart from publications and a research agenda (Ranger 2000), such meetings have re- sulted in pilgrimages to holy mountains, from those of theValley of a Thousand Hills in KwaZulu Natal, to the Motopos in Zimbabwe. At every conference a serpent raises its head. This mythical creature appears to inhabit rivers and lakesthroughout Southern Africa. When angered, inkanyamba , as she or he is known in isiZulu, can vengefully visit people in a devastating storm or flood. In Lesotho, the monster ispowerful enough to cause seismic tremors damaging founda- tions of houses in retribution for the recent damming of rivers, which reverses their flow and sends the water toJohannesburg. \"We went to look on top of our 'Table Moun- tain' ( Mkhambathini ) near where I live. There the snake is said to have opened the earth and engulfed people who try tosettle as well as their houses, but the creature eluded us\" (Peden 2000). Nevertheless, the absence of development andUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 61In Quest of African Wilderness Draper cultivation on a readily accessible and arable stretch of plateau surrounded by poor homesteads proves the exist-ence of the mountains guardian in real, material terms. From the top, one can see Nhlangakasi in the east where the faithful make an annual transcendental ascent as theirprophet Isaiah Shembe bade them. Magqubu Ntombela was one of his devoted followers. In Harare, Zimbabwe, the popular Wilderness Church worship outdoors. If, as critics point out, wilderness is rooted in sublime myths, and conservative ones at that, then it has some untapped allies in Africa. Wilderness is surely not only the\"other\" of modern western society. As Haila (1997) has shown, in early Finland, wilderness was defined from the ethnocentric standpoint of the dominant culture and im-posed as a category upon relatively powerless inhabitants of the area. Such processes seem to be universal. So, too, does the association of myth with wilderness. Whetherancient or modern, they make that which is changeable appear fixed and primordial: mythologizing \"transforms the reality of the world into an image of the world, Historyinto Nature. And this image has a remarkable feature: it is upside down....In passing from history to nature, myth acts economically: it abolishes the complexity of human acts, itgives them the simplicity of essences\" (Barthes 1973: 141, 143). Mythologies, therefore, make that which is cultural and politically contestable seem natural. But myths de-pend on storytellers to evolve and do this. As Hope (2001) noted in his damning review of Jones' Storyteller , van der Post gave a face and a story to a discarded people beforeanyone else thought to do so. So, too, did this Congress to many other marginalized people and environments. In so doing, however, it verged on the flip side of the racistimperial coin. Perhaps this might explain why, in itsinaugural year of 1977, the Congress was opened and blessed by apartheid minister Piet Koorhof, \"who during the 1980s, was responsible for the forced removal of thou-sands of black people in order to conform to the dictates of 'separate development,' and who has earned a well de- served notoriety in the roll call of apartheid politicians.\"Such associations have made local progressive environ- mentalists treat the idea of wilderness with caution (Khan 2000). Van der Post found that his ready endorsement ofenvironmentalist causes could lead to the absurd when he found his name associated with a group called \"Planet in Change\" which had among its speakers a hypnotherapistwhose mentor was the Archangel Gabriel, and a woman in touch with a group of aliens from the Pleiades (Jones 2002). Recognizing that water spirits are important and over-looked factors of wilderness protection and landscape ap- preciation in Africa (see Bernard, this proceedings ), we turn to the Sanusi (African spiritual leader of the highestorder) Credo Mutwa. He opened, blessed, and along with Ian Player, told many stories at this Congress. Following him we experience a similar slippage from the sublime: Now, sir, this story has got many versions in it. Through- out South Africa, amongst many tribes, you'll find stories of these amazing creatures who are capable of changing from reptile to human being, and from reptile to any other animalof their choice. And these creatures, sir, do really exist. No matter where you go throughout Southern, Eastern, West- ern, and Central Africa, you'll find that the description ofthese creatures is the same. Even amongst tribes whichnever, throughout their long history, had contact with each other at all. So, there are such creatures. Where they come from, I will never claim to know, sir. But they are associated with certain stars in the sky, and one of these stars is a large group of starswhich is part of the Milky Way, which our people call Ingiyab, which means 'The Great Serpent.' And there is a red star, a reddish star, near the tip of this huge rim of stars which ourpeople call IsoneNkanyamba... .It is the star called Alpha Centauri, in English. Now, this, sir, is something that is worth investigating. Why is it that well over 500 tribes inparts of Africa which I've visited in the last 40 or 50 years or so, all of them describe similar creatures (Mutwa 1999)? While Mutwa provides astonishingly valuable insight into this African cultural universal, he pushes the limits of credibility and leaves this scholar somewhat incredulous. His prophet status at the Congress was challenged by theWILD Foundation President, Vance Martin, when Mutwa, in the context of a call for his people to have their land and wild animals returned to them, held that conferences suchas the Congress achieve nothing. This is not to say that all Western minds are alike. Mutwa's ideas converged with those of fringe conspiracy theorist, David Icke (1999, 2001),who has made an industry of disseminating Mutwa's ideas as authentically African confirmation of his own (Icke and Mutwa 2001). Icke combines New Age mysticism (voices,intuition, projection, \"energies\" and \"densities\" or \"domains\") with environmental activism; he was spokesman for the Green Party in Britain during the 1980s (Poole 2001). If this Congress can make a difference by laying the foundations on which the New Partnership for Africa (Nepad) recovery program can be built, as its founder Ian Playerhopes (Player 2001), then we have to re-examine our mythsand reject those that are dangerously divisive. At the same time, we need to seek out and nurture other stories and their tellers for they are the keepers of hope. After the Congress,however, having followed an important line of storytelling to the stars, I wonder. References_____________________ Anderson, D.; Grove, R., eds. 1987.

This paper explores the high value these indigenous nations place on protecting wildlife species that are deeply rooted in indigenous tradition. Tribes havetaken a leadership role in conserving species on tribal trust lands, and they also influence Federally managed areas. Of particular impor- tance are Federal lands with wilderness status, critical to assuringthe continuance of key species of significant cultural and ecological value. Tribal treaty and religious rights create a Federal nexus on public lands. Large predators and fish important to these indigenousnations are particularly threatened by poorly planned development on public and private land. Also threatened are fish whose existence may depend on clean, free-flowing waters that emanate from head-waters protected by wilderness and wild river status. This paper explores how Tribes are leading the way in restoring three species and the ecosystems on which they depend; theseefforts include restoration of wild salmon, buffalo, and the wolf. It draws on native voices and tribal projects and policies. Although no policy is a perfect match for tribal values, the phrase \"all myrelations\" has significant meaning for threatened species who may depend on the preservation of their wild land habitats. A future in which tribes and the Federal government develop adaptive, collabo-rative policies for public land is one that keeps a place for brother wolf, salmon, and buffalo in active, restorative relationships. Through such collaboration, health is shared with all who pass through the wild lands. Introduction ____________________ The high value American Indian Tribes place on protect- ing wildlife and their habitat is deeply rooted in indigenous traditions. These internal, indigenous nations within the United States are leading a number of wildlife restorationefforts. This paper describes the role these Tribes play in three major wildlife restoration projects, the interconnec- tions with wildlife restoration and wilderness, and theirefforts to protect wild rivers and native fish. About 560 Federally recognized tribal nations hold trust lands amount- ing to somewhere between 3 and 5 percent of the landmassof the United States. They exert influence on other Federal lands through treaties and executive orders of the Presidentof the United States, and the Secretary of the Interior who acts as the fiduciary agent for the President in these mat- ters. Tribal lands, Federal public lands, and waterways,particularly those with wilderness status, are critical to key species of significant cultural and ecological value to the Tribes. The threat of loss of key species in North America, such as salmon, buffalo, wolf, and eagle, is itself a measure of the magnitude of threats to cultures, human health, and wildlands. Conversely, restoration of these species and their ecosystems restores the health of human communities with the health of their surroundings. A tribal vision of theessence of the wild embeds ideas of how particular tribes came to be part of the Earth, part of creation, and part of what the future holds. Various species play important rolesin the creation and migration narratives of native peoples: they remain tied to the people in the past, present, and future. They remain present in prayers, in visions, and inhealthy diets. Certain animals in particular indicate the health of the ecosystem. Spiritual values related to the natural system are dependent upon restoring health tospecies and humans in this combined cultural and naturalcontext. Issues for Native Americans on Federal Wilderness Lands There are three major wilderness issues of significant concern for American Indian Tribes. First, the idea of anatural ecosystem without human intervention runs against many tribal traditions. Although many tribes traditionally control use to some areas for both spiritual and practicalreasons, complete exclusion was unusual. Recognition of the human role in the ecosystem is widely recognized. Even though legal wilderness designation under the WildernessAct of 1964 is intended to protect cultural values, these provisions can be forgotten in practice. Second, Federal land agencies have often tended to target resources for highuse recreation areas, not toward species and the habitats upon which they depend, creating a management dilemma (Cole 2001). Third, heavy-use public recreation trails maybe juxtaposed against areas traditionally restricted as shrines or the combined spiritual and actual homes of animals. In the past, policy gaps all too frequently led toregulations that excluded native peoples from traditional activities, while inadvertently excluding indigenous knowl- edge of the ecosystem. Significant improvements have occurred in these areas in recent years, especially after the issuance of Presiden- tial Orders on consultation with tribes through govern-ment-to-government relations and on sacred lands, and aProtecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands Linda Moon Stumpff64 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Stumpff Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands Joint Secretarial Order in 1996 on cooperation with tribes in implementing the Endangered Species Act. These or-ders, combined with treaty provisions and other agree- ments, constitute a Federal nexus within which American Indian Tribes work with land policy on Federal lands,including wilderness and wild river designations, to as- sure the continuity of wild species and their cultural traditions. Some tough challenges remain. Despite signifi-cant changes, major policy areas outlined in laws and executive orders have not received the needed attention that creates administrative mechanisms and guidelines toassure their broad implementation. Much is left to the discretion of line managers who must work under strong local political pressure; they frequently lack sufficientadministrative guidance, training, and support from higher levels to make decisions that fully implement the intent of laws and executive orders regarding American Indianrights. Another major challenge comes from the political boundaries that mark differences in practices and facili- ties between wilderness areas, other public lands, triballands, and other forms of public and private property, and result in negative impacts to species (Landres and others 1998). Two Principles Emerging From Indigenous Relationships With Wildlife The guiding wisdom that governs indigenous relation- ships with species is respect. It is a respect that flows from a deep understanding of the life force in every particle ofliving beings. Respect is incorporated in action throughrestorative practices for humans and \"all our relations.\" This reciprocal, restorative principle is applied in planning and practice. These values, intended to guide action, arereflected in the statement of a tribal vision for the rebirth of a great river, which was made by the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission: The tribal vision is the rebirth of the spiritual values of the Basins' land, water, air, plants, fish and wildlife and the importance of those values expressed in love, purity, respect and worship that sustained life for native peoples before thetime of...the worlds' great religions. This strength should not be lost (CRITFC Biennial Report 2000: inner cover). This vision leads to the first principle guiding restorative relationships within the ecosystem. It derives from an indig- enous concept of evolution\u2014the idea that peoples, species, and processes evolved together over time in the most usefuland efficient ways. The value that emerges from this prin- ciple is diversity over monoculture. The actions that flow from this principle are represented in connective relation-ships to ecosystem processes. Knowledge acquired over the long term is applied to restorative actions. The second principle comes from the idea that the bounty of species and natural resources represents a gift that entails human responsibility. Thus, the greater the damage to the species and the ecosystems on which they depend, thegreater the responsibility to sustain them through the gov- ernance of human use or restorative practices. Restorative actions are invoked only by high risks to species; they arelimited by respect for the bounded and incomplete nature of all human knowledge. The loss of wildness and wild speciesstems from the reversal of these two principles and results in the concurrent loss of knowledge and in unleashinghuman irresponsibility without limit. Knowledge of the basis of the interconnected, adaptive restorative relation- ships constitutes the substance of wildness, as far as weknow it. Responsible action to preserve ecosystem relation- ships based on long-term knowledge, constantly renewed and reborn with changing conditions, is the only sustainablesolution. Restoration of the Wild Buffalo, Salmon, and Wolf as Examples ofFederal-Tribal Comanagement_____ Tribes continue to influence the Federal Government in placing lands and water in appropriate kinds of protected status to benefit fish and wildlife. Tribal initiatives take place within the context of a Federal nexus, which givestribes leverage to apply pressure through negotiation and legal action. In the Northwest, and in other areas, they work for the protection of pristine waterways and clean watersupplies to benefit fish, wildlife, and humans. In some areas, they are taking over management of reintroduced species such as the wolf, or taking actions to protect species beforethey become endangered, such as the Apache trout. Recently, a number of significant relationships and agree- ments led to numerous instances of comanagement be-tween American Indian Tribes and the Federal Govern- ment on Federal and State lands. The Grande Rhonde Tribe in Oregon exemplifies a relationship in which tribesinfluence Federal policy. The Tribe has currently takenover the land use planning function on National Forest and Bureau of Land Management lands. Concern for the care of the land and biodiversity was the primary motivatingfactor for the Tribe. Leadership for the wolf reintroduction program in the State of Idaho by the Nez Perce Tribe represents another outstanding example. Actions initiatedby the Northwest Indian Fish Commission for restoring salmon to Puget Sound and the greater Seattle region of the State of Washington represent the long-term commitmentof Northwest Tribes. Protection of traditional values and re-establishment of traditional ecological relationships with the buffalo through educational programs are special ac-tions created by tribal colleges and many Tribal Nations. The three case studies included in this paper demonstrate how tribes initiated actions to restore wildlife and the landand water on which they depend, implementing their programs based on the two principles of respect for evolu- tionary processes and remembrance of the original gift andattendant responsibilities to restore and protect. In re- searching the cases, I found that the three programs are implemented with modern science, but guided by tradi-tional knowledge with cultural objectives. Traditional Knowledge Tribes have accumulated knowledge over long periods of time as they interacted with various species on the North American Continent. This knowledge, originally drawn fromempirical experience and validated by spiritual values,USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 65Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands Stumpff became encapsulated in cultural narratives. The traditional knowledge base is adaptable and verifiable in the continu-ous expression and implementation of relationships with other species and the ecosystem to which all belong. It is the center of long-term knowledge of the continent, while sci-ence can only infer a picture of the North American ecosys- tem through tree-ring analysis and other limited methodolo- gies. As such, this knowledge is critical to the sustainabilityof wildlife and the ecosystems upon which they depend. Significant challenges exist for creating a useful dialogue between modern science and the knowledge base of tradi-tional science held by tribes. Resolution of differences will mean finding common ground and working to understand disparate objectives and methodologies. It will also meanreleasing the stereotypes of the \"noble Indian\" and the \"noble scientist.\" Actual integration of such diverse ways of knowing may be neither possible nor desirable. At the sametime, great benefits may be obtained from recognizing par- allel ways of knowing that inform each other and connect the past with the present and future. As a starting point, somecharacteristics of the development and use of traditional knowledge and science need to be recognized. One character- istic of traditional knowledge focuses on continued cycles ofuse and restoration to assure the health of humans and \"all our relations.\" This is different than a science that explores for all that is knowable or all that is of economic value, oreven all that serves the most humans best. A second major choice in science is the decision of where and how it is to be applied. Applications of traditional science to land-use sys-tems connect humans to the living elements through care of the ecosystem. Actions based on changing factors harmonize adaptive decisions. Finally, \"best use\" as it applies to tradi-tional science is to use knowledge to evaluate the quality ofhuman interactions and their impacts on other species. Visions of the land are often connected with ideas of use, as Elizabeth Woody (1999: 14) reminds us: What has happened to Celilo Falls illustrates a story of inadequacy and ignorance of this land. The story begins, of course, long before the submergence of the falls, with the seed of ambition to make an Eden where Eden was not needed. Oneneeds to learn from the land how to live upon it. The conceptual framework behind traditional knowl- edge and science goes back to the first principle of respect for the love that flows from understanding the life force inevery grain of evolution. Thus, to fish, and to take life, while respecting that the fish lives in ways we can relate to, constitutes the basis for a defined respect expressed inbehavior and in ceremony. The next step in expressing this love of the life force affects immediate behavior that leads to sustainable relations. This is reminiscent of the kind ofexperience Aldo Leopold had when he recollected the sight of that kind of love extinguished in a dying green fire deep in the eyes of a wolf. That experience led him to an inspiredset of actions that initiated the wilderness system. A scientific emphasis on restoration takes place in the narrow gorge of time between the past and future. It movesTribes and governments away from endlessly deconstructing colonialism and making promises. It shifts energy to restor- ative actions that benefit communities. In order to takerestorative action, the knowledge base itself needs restora- tion. Experience from the past is drawn from tradition andworked into guidance that leads to a vision of the future. Actions are informed by experiential knowledge in the cycleof adaptation. In this context, restoration is a form of rebirth and the recognition of the sovereign nature of all species. Restoring Salmon Nations Rebirth and retention of spiritual values contained in the natural system and in the people are components of salmonrestoration. Healthy relationships are reborn in natural cycles that depend on wild rivers that in turn depend on the human responsibility to assure the continuity of the wild.Restoration, then, carries express human responsibilities. In the case of the Nisqually Tribe, the fact that the headwa- ters of the Nisqually River fall within the protection of theNational Parks, and its delta now is included in a National Wildlife Refuge, greatly widens the opportunities for resto- ration. Billy Frank, Jr., of the Nisqually Tribe, clearlyrestates the main idea of the second principle that connects restoration and responsibility for the salmon: Some of the scientists say that our river's spring chinook went extinct back in the 40's. I don't believe that. That any salmon is extinct. The salmon was here when we got here.Nature put the salmon here. For us. And nature will take care of that salmon. That life is still here, in the streams, out in the ocean. I can't believe all that life, from the Nisqually headwa-ters all the way up to Alaska, is gone. I'll never say extinct. With a flicker of the right action, that life will revive itself (Wilkerson 2000: 104). Salmon live as part of a complex cyclical system, migrat- ing out from their natal streams to the ocean and returningyears later to the streams to spawn\u2014a journey of thousandsof miles. Tribal wisdom and knowledge guide scientific and technical aptitude to restore salmon in action. Tribal fish commissions in the Northwest assemble hydrologists, ge-neticists, biometricians, and other scientists to do research that benefits the salmon. At the same time, they bolster the Tribal position in the realm of public opinion and publicpolicy. What works and what does not work is the bottom line of applied restoration. Failure is obvious to all. The score from destroying wild river habitat is salmon few, humanszero. The lesson is not that the fish will be gone, it is that the people will be gone. Success is based on a many-sided vision. Supaneeqx, a Walla Walla word, has no easy translation.However, its general meaning makes sense when circum- scribing appropriate human actions in the Columbia River Basin\u2014actions like looking at something, whether an issue,a problem, or an organization, from many different angles and directions. This many-sided vision is applied in practice through the implementation of the tribal-based \"Spirit of the Salmon Restoration Plan,\" or the \"Wy-Kan-Ush-Mi-Wa-Kish.\" This tribal plan for salmon restoration makes recommendationseven to areas outside of the Tribes' control, such as changes in hydroelectric operations and changes in ocean fishing regulations. Despite the bounded nature of the Tribes' politi-cal control, the plan places them in a leadership role for restoration of harvestable and healthy runs of salmon in the Columbia Basin. The way is known, but partnerships arerequired. Tribes employ their extensive abilities for collabo- ration, while they persist in bringing multiple public and66 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Stumpff Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands private entities together. At home, they build tribal capacity to assume greater responsibility. After years of persuasion,tribal pressure resulted in abundance-based regulations for ocean fishing of Chinook salmon, and even the great hydro- electric dams now make some seasonal releases of water forthe salmon. Restoring Relationships From the Heart \u2014During their thousands of years of history on the Columbia River, indigenous people knew about experimenting with dams as a means of containing fish for individual villages. Fromthese experiences, a traditional understanding emerged that outlined how dams disrupted the natural allocation patterns of wild rivers, for fish do not go above the dams. Atraditional story from the Nez Perce Tribe illustrates the human problems that create dams and result in allocative dilemmas. It is a story of point and counterpoint, a perver-sion of the first stories of creation that contain a lesson about the consequences. Coyote was walking up the river on a hot day and decided to cool himself in the water. He swam down the swift riveruntil he came to the waterfall where the Wasco people lived. Five Maidens had dwelt there from ancient times. This was the place where the great dam kept the fish from going up theriver. While he was looking at the great waterfall, Coyote saw a Maiden. Quickly he went back upstream a ways and said, \"Iam going to look like a little baby, floating down the river on a raft in a cradle board, all laced up.\" As Coyote was drifting down the river, he cried, \"Awaa, awaaa.\" The Maidens,hearing this, quickly swam over, thinking that a baby might be drowning. The Maidens took the baby home and cared for it and fed it. He grew very fast. When he was crawling around one day, he spilled some water on purpose. \"Oh Mothers,\" he said. \"Will you get me some more water?\" The youngest sister said, \"Why don't you make him go and get it himself? The river is nearby.\" He began to crawl toward the river, but when he was out of sight, he jumped up and began to run. The oldest sister turned around and said, \"He is out of sight already. He certainly canmove fast.\" \"That is because he is Coyote,\" the youngest said. When Coyote reached the river, he swam to the fish dam and tore it down, pulling out the stones so that all the water rushed free. Then he crawled up on the rocks and shouted gleefully, \"Mothers, your fish dam has been broken.\" The sisters ran down and saw that it was true. The youngest Maiden just said, \"I told you he was Coyote.\" Coyote said, \"You have kept all the people from having salmon for a long time by stopping them from going upstream. Now the people will be happy because they will get salmon. The salmon will now be able to go upriver and spawn.\" This is how Celilo Falls came to be where the Wasco people are today. As a result of Coyote tearing down the fish dam, salmon are now able to come up river to spawn on the upperreaches of the Great Columbia River and its tributaries (Landeen and Pinkham 1998: 83). This story is in direct contradiction to the philosophy of Manifest Destiny\u2014the belief that resources were put here to belong to the individual user, to maximize profit, who then gained the right to rule over the land. It points out its ownphilosophical flaw by which use becomes the right itself, rather than just one type of relationship between living things governed by a system of rights based on the workingsof natural systems. American Indian Tribes need to use the resources, but use occurs within the workings of naturalsystems. If the newcomers to North America thought that the resources looked unused and the fisheries plentiful\u2014 wasn't this good? Wasn't this the real definition of success,of a job well done? Everything was put back in its place, used so skillfully and understood in its underlying design that it appeared almost unused. The plants, the animals, and fishand birds returned in good numbers. The underlying maxim of \"control the people, not Nature,\" even in its wildest manifestations, applied. Some areas were restricted fromuse, others used only for certain purposes. No one hunted or fished who was not properly trained to understand the web of relations and interconnecting parts. Save all the parts,save the many relations, save ourselves. The Federal Nexus \u2014Six species of salmon swim the rivers of the Northwest: they are Chinook, they are Pink, they are the Silver or Coho, they are Chum, and they are Sockeye and Steelhead. The number of salmon stocks in theUnited States is now 335, and of these, 100 are threatened and 12 are extinct. N'ch-iwana, the main stem of the Colum- bia River, choked by 19 Federal hydroelectric dams, blocksthe salmon from returning home to spawn. Dams were built all over the West for a variety of purposes. Some of the dams are no longer even functional, but they still create salmonbarriers on numerous streams and rivers in the Northwest. The lack of Wild River designation on the Columbia River system and throughout the Northwest led to continuing theactivities that obliterated a once rich King salmon fishery. The State of Washington, with its vast network of rivers, remains almost without Wild River designations. Federalwilderness designation and other protective regulations,such as National Parks and National Forests, however, protect headwaters essential to clean water for the fish. Designations that protect the watersheds downstream toassure the flow of cool, clean water for feeding areas and other habitat conditions essential to the fish, are lacking. Hatcheries, History, and Histrionics \u2014The wild salmon lives to produce bounty. It hatches from a tiny egg high in forested streams, and the 1-ounce fish swims to theocean where it grows to 15, 20, or even 60 pounds. Salmon that return to spawn afterwards die and rot to feed the mountains, providing 16 percent of the nutrients needed byyoung salmon and 17 percent of the nutrients for stream- side vegetation. In the Columbia River alone, nearly two hundred million pounds of fish return each year. If theywere cows, a rancher could turn loose a 200-pound calf that would disappear and come back to his gate on a predeter- mined date in a few years weighing about 50,000 pounds:that would be equivalent to what the wild salmon do (Manning 1999). Fish hatcheries, first implemented by State and Federal agencies to maintain harvestable runs, are controversial. Improperly managed, they release fish that compete with wild fish. And regulatory science sometimes leaves logicwanting. In runs with 80-percent hatchery fish and 20- percent wild fish, harvest limits are set that allow for harvesting 66 percent of hatchery fish and 33 percent ofwild fish. Thought to protect the wild fish, simple extrapo- lation of the math suggests that such limited regulatory policies will assure the eventual demise of the wild fish. InUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 67Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands Stumpff other cases, hatchery bred fish, that come from original broodstock from native streams that are on the brink ofextinction, may offer the only possibility of restoring those runs of Steelhead and salmon. In response to the loss of salmon, the Federal Government and the States began an active program of fish hatchery production in an attempt to replace the wild salmon. Many aspects of this restoration effort are fraught with problems.Each hatchery fish costs $62.50 (Manning 1999). Fish hatch- eries consume energy in order to dump biomass into the system, while the wild salmon return biomass to the systemin a natural cycle. The average hatchery spends the capital, not the interest, by feeding the hatchery fish other fish. This reverses the allocation system implemented by a naturalsalmon run in a wild river. Not only do wild salmon living in wild rivers bring back protein from the ocean without cost, they also provide point-to-point delivery by returning totheir stream of origin. Despite the difficulties involved with hatcheries, they are key to the restoration efforts developed by the Tribes in theColumbia River Basin. Most Tribal fish hatcheries adapted their programs to the principle of compatibility with native wild fish and naturally spawning populations. The produc-tion of fish of native origins to specific watersheds was prioritized. Faced with extinction of an increasing number of salmon species, hatcheries become a way of \"saving all theparts,\" while persisting in efforts to mount pressure. Federal and State hatcheries tended to manage for nonnative fish that crowded out the wild salmon. At some places, likeRedfish Lake, Idaho Game and Fish projects killed and poisoned native salmon in order to replace them with hatch- ery-raised \"sport fish.\" Many problems occurred even whenthe State and Federal hatcheries were developed for nativefish species. The State of Oregon produced so many Steel- head, they deemed them \"surplus to their hatchery pro- gram.\" In 1988, with support from the Yakima Tribe, the NezPerce Tribe, and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation sued the State of Oregon (United Statesversus Oregon). They obtained an injunction to prevent Oregon from destroying Imnaha River hatchery Steelhead. These Steelhead, developed from native broodstock of theregion, are being used by the Tribes to rebuild runs in the Imnaha Basin from which their ancestors came. Tribal Perspectives on Linked Actions to Sustain Wild Salmon \u2014In the practice of restoration, traditional knowledge and science have never been separated. At-tempts to restore fish runs through hatcheries are at best a short-term solution. This links to longer term solutions for preserving the wild character of waterways. Because theNez Perce, Umatilla, and other Tribes revere water and the fish that live in it, there is great concern for the Columbia River. In 1997, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indiansand the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission nomi- nated the Columbia for designation under the American Heritage River program, as a step in getting Federal supportto recover plants, animals, fish, and people. Wild and Scenic River Designation for the Hanford Reach, the last free- flowing section of the Columbia, was sought. In many simi-lar actions, Tribes repeatedly used their Federal relation- ship to create restoration actions that preserve key components of the ecosystem.Great dam building projects significantly impacted the ecosystem and prevented salmon migration, plunging someruns of fish into near extinction. Fish hatcheries were often the only mitigation. Hatcheries have been among the most complicated issue. Thirty-eight hatcheries were constructedbelow the Bonneville Dam, however, the Dam prevented the fish from swimming upriver where the Tribes might catch them. Hatcheries caused a loss of biological diversity inspawning fish that were not adapted to their environment, and that may lack survival skills. At the same time, Tribes have established some hatcheries under a different rubric,using eggs from native fish and working to mimic natural conditions. In cases where the salmon are virtually gone, such hatcheries are critical to the continuance of the cultureof the people, who so firmly believe their fate is linked to the salmon. Tribes continue to pressure the Federal Govern- ment to increase water releases from dams in attempts tomimic wild conditions on the Columbia that benefit salmon. The Northwest Tribes have a clear understanding that salmon restoration will require multiple connected actionsoccurring in cycles over a period of many years. From the basis of their long-term perspective, they recognize the need to: Understand all sides, including traditional, political, and scientific aspects of restoration. Anticipate all consequences by completing an analysis from all perspectives. Retain traditional knowledge as the guiding wisdom, while making use of the best technical informationavailable. Understand the effects of decisions on people, groups, and organizations. Make necessary recommendations, including those out- side of tribal control, with persistence and dedication to collaborative action (CRITC 2000). What works and what does not work is the bottom line of applied restoration science and policy. Failure is obvious to all. Success is based on a many-sided vision. Supaneeqx\u2014 that Walla Walla word that has no easy translation\u2014stillcarries comprehensive meaning for planning efforts by describing the action of looking at something, whether an issue, a problem, or an organization, from many differentangles and directions. Their Salmon Plan is accompanied by demands for restoring sections of wild river. Tribes must now use their extensive abilities for collaboration and theirpersistence to bring multiple public and private entities together, while working at home to build tribal capacity to assume greater responsibility. The Boldt Decision, a Fed-eral Court decision affecting Washington State, assured the Tribes of a harvestable catch of salmon, and fortified their rights to gather shellfish and materials for traditionaluse on public and private lands. Tribal Nations, through their Federal standing, may sue States, individual, and corporations to protect salmon. And they continue to do so. Restoring the Buffalo Nations Tribes maintain an ancient relationship to the American Bison, called \"buffalo\" in common parlance. The buffalo is considered a spiritual being who can be called by those who listen and offer respect. The buffalo lived on the Great Plains68 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Stumpff Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands in vast prairie grasslands. Estimates of the number of buffalo at the time of European contact range from 30 to 70million animals. These great herds were called \"the greatest animal congregations that ever existed\" (Matthiesen 1987: 151). By the end of the Indian Wars in the Northwest in the1870s, less than 100 buffalo remained in the wild. Buffalo bulls are larger than females, weighing about 2,000 pounds. They have heavy horns and a large hump ofmuscle that supports their huge heads and thick skull, yet they can run as fast as a horse. They become especially ill- tempered during rut. The roars and posturing of theirbattles certainly justify the expression of \"buffaloing\" some- one. Buffaloes raise their droopy tail straight up when they are ready to charge. Cows have narrower, curved horns andthey weigh about half as much as bulls. They are protective of the calves and may be even more dangerous. American Indian Tribes played a critical role in preserv- ing the American bison. The Cape buffalo of Africa and the water buffalo of Asia are true buffalo, but the American bison has been called \"buffalo\" for so long now that the termsare used interchangeably in popular literature. According to a peculiar characteristic of the buffalo, the calves followed the horses of the hunters who had slain or separated themfrom their mothers on a hunting expedition. The buffalo herds, the lifeblood of the Indian Nations of the Plains, were victims of wasteful overhunting by the newly arrived \"fron-tiersmen.\" The systematic slaughter of the bison was the military, political, and economic expression of colonialism and oppression. The Southern herds were the first to go.Between 1872 and 1874, a million animals a year were shot, leaving a solitary survivor to meet its end in Buffalo Springs, Texas, on the trail to Santa Fe (Matthiesen 1987). Massiveslaughters accompanied the Northern Pacific Railroad con-struction that cut directly across Sioux treaty lands. The slaughters coincided with the height of the Indian Wars in the 1870s and 1880s. Walking Coyote, a Pend d'Oreille Indian, brought in sev- eral calves that followed him to St. Ignatius, Montana. He kept a small herd of buffalo that grew from those orphanedcalves. He later sold them to Charles Allard, Sr., and Michael Pablo, who were ranching on the Flathead Indian Reserva- tion. From this small herd came many of the animals laterused in restoration, including the larger number of them in Yellowstone National Park. In 1893, they bought Buffalo Jones' remnant herd at Omaha, adding 26 purebred animalsthat they kept until purchased by the Canadian Govern- ment. This herd, so oral history says, originally came from Canada. The hybrids, or cattalo, were never allowed to mixwith the thoroughbred bison, but were sequestered on Wild Horse Island, at Flathead Lake. When the Federal Government implemented the allot- ment policy that opened the reservations for white home- steaders in 1910, Michael Pablo was forced to sell the buffalo to the Canadian Government. In the 23 years under Indianmanagement, the herd of 36 bison increased to over 30 times their original number (Jones 1909). The roundups were extremely difficult. He notes, \"The buffalo, when they foundthemselves being urged from their native pastures, would turn on the riders and in the wildest fury charge the line,\" scattering all over the country (Jones 1909: 7). Finally, aspecially constructed fence running 26 miles (42 km) inlength, gave them a line to drive the buffalo down to the 24- inch (61-cm) timber corrals before being shipped by specialtrains to Alberta. Much of this narrative of the restoration of the buffalo relies on traditional knowledge of the buffalo retained on the Flathead Reservation. It is an unusualexample of how restoration efforts following traditional management practices may accomplish significant and amazing objectives. When the Federal Government interfered with the man- agement of Indian trust lands by American Indian Tribal Governments by passing laws that broke up traditional wildrange lands, the result was the loss of wild animal range and the animals that used it. At the time when the Flathead Reservation was fragmented by the Allotment Act, Allardrealized that their wild bison herd would not be welcome. He sold his bison to Charles Conrad in Kalispell. This herd was later important as the nucleus of the National Bison Rangestock. The sale to Canada drew strong public response, and the American Bison Society was formed. President Theodore Roosevelt and William Hornaday of the Smithsonian workedto persuade Congress to set aside national range land for the American bison. Three reserves were established between 1907 and 1909. Again, the Salish Kootenai Nations of theFlathead Indian Reservation responded, extending a long- term lease of their trust lands to establish the 18,500-acre (7,487-ha) National Bison Range. Its reserve is primarilymade up of native Palouse prairie grasslands, but also includes forest, wetland, and river bottom woodlands. This wildlife refuge is intensively managed for species diversity. The extreme damage done to natural processes through farming, cattle ranching, and the resulting introduction of noxious plants and exotic animals requires significant con-servation work by humans to begin emulating natural con-ditions. The bison are vaccinated today due to largely un- proven, but politically troubling, claims that they might act as transmitters of disease to cattle. In fact, brucellosis, thedisease attributed to the buffalo, is really a cattle disease that was transmitted to bison in some areas. Bison are strong and hardy beasts, much better adapted to the Ameri-can Plains than European varieties of cattle. The restoration of the buffalo is intimately connected to their central place in the living ecosystem. Understanding and respecting thebison is considered integral to bringing them back. In oral history, recorded by the culture committee of the Blackfeet Nation of Montana, Mary Ground tells the story of Iniskim,the Buffalo Rocks, that illustrates how the buffalo is re- garded as a spiritual entity who can be called back: It was the middle of winter in the days before the Pikuni (Blackfeet Tribe) had horses. They were camped down by a creek for the winter and the people were starving. The buffalohad moved out somewhere. The men would go out and hunt but there were no buffalo any place. In camp, they cleaned out everything they could think of to eat. Finally, they evenstarted to cook those little calf skins they used to dry berries in...They boiled some of their rawhide ropes for food. There weren't even any birds or rabbits left. The youngest wife of the Chief took her rope down to the creek to get wood. She was looking for some of those dried-up rosebuds, too. She was gathering up her wood and looking forthose dried-up rosebuds when all at once she heard someone singing. \"Woman over there, you woman, take me, I am holy. I want a gift. May I have kidney to eat?\"USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 69Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands Stumpff There was no one there but her. She stood there but she couldn't see anything. Finally, she saw the gravel and rocks rolling down on the side of the cliff on the bank. She went over there and found this Iniskim, a buffalo rock. It's a petrifiedrock shaped like a buffalo. The woman picked it up and kissed it and said, \"You must be the one who's singing. Sure I'll take you. I'll take you home with me.\" She put it in her dress andgot her wood all ready and went home. When she got to her teepee, she told her husband, \"I want you folks to straighten up the teepee...invite all the elder men,the Medicine Men and the young men. We're going to make Medicine. She showed him the Iniskim and said, \"I feel sorry for the little ones and the older people. They're starving. We'llsee if we have the good luck to get our buffalo back again.\" In those days they had buffalo jumps. They were nearly always ready in case the buffalo would come near the camp\" (Ground1978: 37-38). In the story, the buffalo return and the woman is honored for her work in calling back the buffalo. The Federal Nexus \u2014The Federal Government was slow to react to the loss of the buffalo. Tribal members secured buffalo here and there. Tribes took the initiative for intro- ducing buffalo on many reservations. The sale of the majorremaining herd of buffalo to Canada finally resulted in political pressure. The National Bison Range, the reintro- duction of buffalo into Yellowstone National Park, and otheractions resulted. In the Southwest and other areas, a number of tribes keep small herds of buffalo today. They are regarded as importantanimals to the spiritual health and welfare of the communi- ties. The Buffalo is part of the sacred Mountain Way ceremo- nies of the Navajo, and the Pueblos celebrate their connec-tion to these animals with Buffalo Dances. Before European contact, many of the Southwest tribes traveled eastward to the southern plains to hunt buffalo. The restoration of the buffalo is intimately connected to their place as the centerpiece of a lifeway, especially for the northern tribes. Understanding and respecting the bison is considered integral to bringing them back. The Inter-TribalBuffalo Commission has worked to encourage building up herds through the application of traditional methods and some marketing. They now coordinate the efforts of a num-ber of tribes. Tribes continue educational efforts to teach people that the buffalo must be respected and that it is integral to sustained living on the Great Plains. Tribalcolleges develop curriculum on buffalo, and Winona La Duke writes extensively about the vision for returning the prairies to the buffalo and the buffalo to the prairies in a major effortto restore native ecosystems. Restoring Brother Wolf The relationship of many tribes to the wolf reflects the kinship between first peoples and the wild. John Marshall, Lakota Sioux, noted, \"This kinship between first peoples andthe wolf took us down the same road nearly to the end\" (Marshall 1995: 6). In a time before people became arrogant, it is said that people learned from the wolf. The wolf useswhat he has within to hunt. The wolf is emulated because he is so successful in living within the web of relationships. The wolf's powerful knowledge and skill as a hunter furtherencouraged that emulation. Many tribes learned the prac- tice of the wolf. The Apache tribe, locked in a 300-year battle with the Spanish, Mexican, and later the United StatesGovernments, learned to copy the howls. They copied them so exactly that they could communicate across great dis-tances and not be recognized. Northern Wolf-Sungmanitu or Timber Wolf \u2014John Marshall, in his book, On Behalf of Wolf and First Peoples , reveals a dream of a wolf he had as a small boy. From this dream, in which a wolf asks him to sing his song, heinterprets his role as an equal of the wolf with a responsibil- ity to tell the wolf's story. He says, \"It was then that I began to learn that the wolf and I are brothers. That I am more likehim than I ever imagined. Born into the same land of the same Mother. We are kindred spirits and fellow travelers in a common existence, bound together by respect, adversity,and challenge\" (Marshall 1995: 5). The wolf's vigilance in defending his family, regardless of the strength of the enemy or the odds of the struggle, was observed. Finally, peoplelearned that they could emulate the wolf and, in turn, came to exist to serve the environment and participate in the mutuality of life (Marshal 1995). By accepting the premisethat the wolf is a model, the different levels of relationship and meaning between wolves and first peoples can be under- stood. This means recognizing boundaries and parametersof mutual respect on the Earth. It also recognizes the physical relationships of living in the same place together. Finally, it recognizes the being of the Earth itself, the ecologyof being. The emulation of the wolf was not the same as being the wolf, for it was understood that each species had its ownplace and its own characteristics or strengths that were its key to survival. Although humans held great powers of understanding, those powers were not held to dominate, butto survive. Sometimes, emulation led to the formation ofspecial societies in tribes. For example, the Pawnee tribe was known on the plains as the \"Wolf People,\" and the sign language for the wolf was the hand with two fingers held ina v-shape on the right side of the head. Marshall (1995) gives the name of the wolf in Lakota, \"sungmanitu tanka,\" great dog of the wilderness. He notesthat this is a new name, because it includes the concept of wilderness, which is European in origin. Previous to Euro- pean contact, the Lakota did not compartmentalize theworld with anthropomorphic terms like \"wilderness.\" Rather, culture and society were joined as a concept, not a place. And the more correct interpretation of manitu was not wilder-ness, as place, as legal entity, but wilderness \"place away from where humans are.\" Marshall also notes an older word for wolf, \"mayaca,\" a term that may more closely relate to thewolf's characteristic of denning in a step face or riverbank. He tells a story, similar to stories from other tribes, this one learned from his grandfather, about the understandingbetween people and wolves: A woman leaves her village and home in heartbreak and anger because her husband has brought home a second,younger wife. It is late autumn and she travels toward the village of some of her relatives. She becomes lost, her food supply is gone, and she faces the prospect of having to totallyfend for herself. Eventually, she is found by a family of wolves, which leads her to shelter and occasionally brings her fresh meat. Over the winter, she learns the nuances of their communication. Finally, a wolf tells her that some of her people are moving close. After that, she leaves her wolf family and finally reaches the villages of her relatives, who70 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Stumpff Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands had received word that she was probably dead. Her relatives were overjoyed to see her, and they give her the name of Woman Who Lived With the Wolves (Marshall 1995: 12-13). The story records the closeness of the relationship be- tween humans and wolves and their mutual interdepen- dence. In fact, the near extinction of the wolf and of first peoples ran parallel after European contact. Both wolf andIndian got in the way of Manifest Destiny. Pressed to extinction, the timber wolf of the North, the lobo wolf of the Southwest, the red wolf, and other subspecies reached thebrink. Marshall develops the idea that the wolf is a hunter who is the equal of his prey\u2014he uses what he has within him tohunt. There is no question of superiority to the prey. This is why the wolf is emulated, because he is successful in living within his own place, unimpaired by ideas of progress andsuperiority over another. A political economy of wolves is different than that of ranching and markets. Both northern and southern wolves were pushed over the borders, thenorthern wolf retreating to Canada, the lobo retreating into Mexico. Today, the wolf is a bio-political pawn in the wider battle that will determine who owns the future of the NorthAmerican West (Mitchell 1994). The Federal Nexus \u2014The Federal Government, under the Endangered Species Act, launched a plan to restore the wolf to the North in the early 1990s. Wolves were moving across the Canadian border and frequenting Glacier Na-tional Park. The new plan was to release wolves into the Rocky Mountain area, Yellowstone National Park, and Na- tional Forests and wilderness areas of central Idaho. Fifteenwolves were released each year to reach about 100 wolves ineach of the areas. The State of Idaho refused to participate, so the Nez Perce Tribe was chosen as the Governmental authority to release the wolves in that State. Their diligencewas rewarded; the wolves prospered under the management of the Tribe. Through the wolf, the Tribe took a greater role in land management off reservation. The wolf's reintroduc-tion range roughly resembled the five million or so acres (20,234 km 2) of territory once under the stewardship of the Nez Perce Tribe. Now they are on this land again, monitor-ing the wolf and the conditions he lives in. The restorer is the restored. The Lobo\u2014The Mexican Wolf of the South The movements of the southern wolf, or lobo, called the Mexican wolf ( canis lupus baileyi ), crossed my own lifepath on several occasions. I saw the last known pair in Arizona shortly before their capture in the 1960s, outlined against the dusk on the Nantac Rim. When I moved up to Olympia,Washington, in 1997, I found that captive lobo wolves were living near me at the Wolfhaven facility. The breeding program at Wolfhaven, a nonprofit organization, producedsome of the packs later to be released in the Southwest. In 1998, I visited the Turner Ranch for the annual Native American Fish and Wildlife Association meeting, and wasallowed to view the same wolves at a distance shortly before their release into the wild. After the virtual elimination of the elk in the Southwest, the wolves thrived on livestock. This introduction of cattle was paramount in changing the native diet, as well asimpacting the ties between native peoples and the animals that filled their landscape. The extermination of Mexicanwolves occurred before they were extensively studied through the methods of Western science. Much remains to be learned, making traditional knowledge about the wolf even moreimportant. Mexican wolves have the most consistent colora- tion of all of the gray wolves\u2014a richly colored mix of buff, gray, rust, and black. The wolves may weigh from 50 to 85pounds, with male wolves weighing more than the females. An adult wolf is about the size of an adult German shepherd. The southwestern subspecies of the gray wolf, often called the lobo or Mexican wolf, shares long-held and important ties to the cultural and spiritual world of the Apache people. Missing from the native landscape they shared with theApache people from time immemorial, a landscape that included Arizona and New Mexico in the United States and ranged down into the Sonoran Desert in Mexico, the Mexi-can wolf is again heard in the mountains and grasslands of the Southwest. The Mexican wolf is the most genetically distinct of all of the gray wolves and is one of the rarest of allmammals. The Apache belief that all life is sacred meant that action must be considered to benefit the wolf, an animal thatcarries special powers. In a practical way, it is understood that wolves play a critical role in the ecosystem that cannot be filled by other predators. Wolves live in family groups, orpacks, and practice complex social behaviors. Wolf families usually consist of a set of parents (alpha pair), their off- spring, and other nonbreeding adults. They usually livewithin a specific territory, which may range in size from 50 to more than 1,000 square miles (129 km 2 to more than 2,590 km2). Their social structure is maintained by their communication systems: through vocalizations, body pos-tures, and scent marking. Wolves are noted for their distinc- tive howls, a sound that has become attached to various traditional songs and to the idea of wild lands. A tightlyorganized structure, enhanced by communication such as howling, enables them to work together and, conversely, to stake out their own territory. Wolves hunt as a group,coursing or chasing their prey. It is believed that the characteristic of killing weak or old animals helps to keep their prey populations of white tail deer, mule deer, and elkhealthy. The virtual disappearance of the lobo from its range in the Southwest was due to a program of continuous and un-bridled killing encouraged by government policy. Wolves were extensively poisoned, shot, and trapped by government agents and private individuals. In the Southwest UnitedStates and in Mexico, both the Apache people and these wolves carried a government bounty on their heads in the 1800s. By the early 1900s, high cattle-stocking rates coupledwith overhunting of deer and elk resulted in many wolves preying on livestock. The Arizona, or Merriam's elk, a large antlered elk that ranged from the Wichita Mountains ofOklahoma to the Mogollons in New Mexico, west to the Chiricauhuas of Arizona and south into Sonora in Mexico, once ran in herds of as many as 2,000. By the close of the 19 th century, they became hard to find. After the virtual elimina- tion of the elk, wolves thrived on livestock. The Federal Nexus \u2014In 1970, it was decided that the only chance for ensuring the survival of the Mexican wolfUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 71Protecting Restorative Relationships and Traditional Values: American Indian Tribes, Wildlife, and Wild Lands Stumpff was to begin a captive breeding program. The last wolves were captured around the San Carlos Apache Reservation inthe 1960s for breeding in zoos. The last time I saw them, only a year before their capture, they seemed to cling to the top of a ridgeline, so much a part of the land itself. At that time, Idid not know they would be the key to the restoration program, but perhaps they did, for coming down so close as to be in our range of vision was unusual. In 1973, the UnitedStates passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Although it did not apply specifically to tribal lands, tribes again became partners in the return of the wolf to the Southwestthrough cooperatively working on the implementation of that Act. The Mexican wolf was listed as endangered under ESA in 1976. By 1992, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) established the Recovery Goal for the Mexican Wolf under the ESA, \"to conserve and ensure the survival of Canis lupus baileyi by maintaining a captive breeding program and re- establishing a viable, self-sustaining population of at least 100 Mexican wolves within the wolf's historic range.\" In1998, a wolf release program was initiated to relocate wolves into the Apache National Forest of Arizona. They began releasing captive-reared wolves into the area in March 1998. The release area chosen by Federal authorities was di- rectly adjacent to the White Mountain Apache Reservation. Because of the ranging behavior of wolves, it was obviousthat the wolves would move outside the boundaries onto tribal lands. Without the existence of the 4.4 million acres (17,806 km 2) of National Forest land, including primitive areas and lands designated under the Wilderness Act of 1964, and the cooperation of the White Mountain Apache Tribe and San Carlos Apache Tribe, whose adjacent landsprovide a buffer, the future of the wolf would have loomeduncertain. Although a Federal rule exists to allow the release of the wolf on Federal lands in the State of New Mexico, the effort has stalled as a Federal agency has bowedto the perceived private interests of cattle ranchers who exert their influence over Federal wilderness lands. We will all have to wait longer to hear the howl of the wolf in AldoLeopold's Gila Wilderness. Under a joint agreement between the United States and Mexico, five wolves were captured near Durango and Chi-huahua, Mexico. The USFWS completed a captive wolf management facility and began providing an environment that minimized human contact and encouraged wild behav-iors for wolves that were potential candidates for release. The reintroduction plan allows for the wolves to be re- moved or relocated when conflicts with humans occur, suchas livestock depredation. This has been done to increase the success of wolf recovery by encouraging a wolf population with behaviors that focus on native prey and maintains atolerance level for coexistence among livestock producers. The increasingly healthy elk herds in these Forest Service and Apache tribal lands further encourage a natural bal-ance. In addition, the replacement of cattle ranching with American bison on the nearby Ted Turner ranch may pro- vide an alternative buffalo range model that proves morecompatible with range lands and wetlands than extensive cattle ranching. In addition, Defenders of Wildlife, a private conservation group, established a fund to compensate ranch-ers at market value for any documented losses of cattle to wolves. (Mitchell 1994). In the end, the political economy ofwolves differs from that of ranching and markets. The wolf populations that escaped to Mexico and Canada, pushedback over the boundaries by trapping, shooting, poisoning, and the destruction of their prey, retreated from the United States. A few of the southern subspecies of wolf survived inMexico, and a pair lived on the San Carlos Indian Reserva- tion. From all of these retreating animals, the wolf has been restored. Summary ______________________ American Indian Tribal Nations continue to extend lead- ership activities in restoration efforts on tribal and Federal lands, and waterways to which their traditional rights andtreaties extend. Increasingly, they work collaboratively to transcend political boundaries. Many key species play key roles in the cultural narratives, political institutions, andhealth of these Tribes. These ways of life are expressed through the rebirth of the ecosystem. Wilderness areas and wild rivers are an integral part of the success of strategies to assure the continuance of cyclic celebration of rebirth and restoration. As reintroduced spe- cies become re-established and expand their populations, co-management of land that affects species and tribal rights and lifeways is vital. A better understanding of indigenous knowledge will be an integral part of successful restorationefforts that contribute to the health of communities of humans and the species who inhabit the same ecosystems. The nature of knowledge and the spiritual values expressedwithin it, contain the substance and the guiding wisdom for restoring health to species and humans.

Their origin, their migration into the hills, their culture, their occupation, their demographic profile, andso forth, are delineated. A comparison of their past and present lifestyle is presented. The question of why they are called the \"ecosystem people\" is analyzed. The details of how they helped the pioneering planters from the United Kingdom to trace the area and establish tea plantations in the hills are provided. They are portrayed as excellent guides forscientific game preservation in the early days. The birth and growth of the nature preservation movement in this part of the world, namely the High Range Wildlife and Environ-ment Preservation Association, is detailed in this paper. The good working relationship between the Association and the Muthuvans, which has been preserved for nearly a century, is highlighted. Theprojects undertaken by the Association for the welfare and better- ment of the Muthuvans are enumerated. This paper shows how a corporation can be proactive in promoting the spirit of protecting wilderness by enlisting the support of a human community, which is more close to natural wilderness than the rest of us living in the cosmopolitan wilderness of today's cities.And it concludes with suggestions for newer systems and ap- proaches that could be emulated in developing countries. Introduction ____________________ The Muthuvans are \"the superior tribesmen\" of the splen- did High Ranges of the Western mountains of Kerala in Southern India. They, with their incredible knowledge ofthis rugged terrain, which varies from 3,000 to 6,000 ft (914 to 1,829 m) above sea level, rendered tremendous assistance to the pioneering British planters on their onward march toturn these hills into teeming tea plantations. The Muthuvans were of immense help in preparing the land for cultivation, constructing sheds for plantation work-ers, building tea nursery sheds, cutting boundaries for tea fields, and so on. Even as the plantations changed hands, these hill men were not left in the lurch. As a mark ofgratitude, even after a century and a quarter, the present day tea company (Tata Tea Limited) maintains an indivis- ible and sustainable relationship with the Muthuvans byHelping \"Ecosystem People\" Protect Wilderness and Their Own Welfare T. Damu implementing various welfare schemes for them to help improve their living standards, promote their health status, and protect their identity. The High Range is one of the few environmental hotspots in the world, having rich biodiversity, and the Muthuvans live in areas that are amidst thick jungles of the High Range. Most of their hamlets are situated far away frommotorable roads; hence one has to trek more than 6.2 miles (10 km) through thickets infested with wild animals and poisonous snakes, in some cases, to reach their abodes. These nonindigenous hill tribes of the High Range are distributed in small, scattered hamlets, numbering nearly 90, each with about 30 households. These hamlets arespread out in four Taluks (revenue subdivisions in a District) in Kerala. In total, the Muthuvan population is about 4,000. Surprisingly, males exceed females by about 22 percent. TheMuthuvans are a closely guarded community. Their cultural practices, beliefs, and mores are not much known to the outside world. Anthropo-Genesis_______________ Mystery and controversy surround the ancestry, history, immigration, and consequent settlements of Muthuvans. The anthropologists, who have studied the morphology and ethnographic details of the tribes, say that the Muthuvansare a mixture of Proto-Australoids (the pre-Dravidians) and Negritos (the pygmies of Malayalam origin with Negroid features). Edgar Thurston (1906), in his Ethnographic Notes in Southern India , says: Judging from the two distinct types of countenance, their language and their curious mixture of customs, I hazard the conjecture that when they arrived in the hills they found asmall tribe in possession with whom they subsequently inter- married, this tribe having affinities with the West coast, while the new arrivals were connected with the east... The idea opens up a very interesting field of study. In the 1960s, Mr. W. S. S. Mackay, a pioneer planter and an ardentenvironmentalist, observed that their variable appearance seemed to be accounted for by union with a small, dark- skinned tribe that they found in the mountains at the timeof their arrival, possibly the remnants of some prehistoric migration from the African Continent, isolated at the toe of India, following some great global eruption. These are not just speculations but studied observations, which have their basis in the scientific fact about the prehistoric tectonic movements of Mother Earth that toreapart the Indian subcontinent from the African mainland, resulting in traces of the Negroid race forming part of the people of India, especially in Southern India.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 73Helping the \"Ecosystem People\" Protect Wilderness and Their Own Welfare Damu Historically speaking, the Muthuvans are believed to have fled from the Madurai district of Tamil Nadu, one of the Statesof India, situated at the southeastern end. There are many theories and hypotheses about the arrival of the Muthuvans. All sound probable, since it is said that trials and tribulationsdue to battles and wars and political cataclysm characterized the history of Southern India, from the start of the first millennium after Christ until the mid-second millennium.This resulted in the exodus of people belonging to a fleeing community fearing the wrath of some invaders, and thus escaped to the hills to form the present tribes. Etymology _____________________ Muthuvan\u2014the name's origin itself has drawn various interpretations. It is said that during their emigration from Madurai they carried their dethroned King in turn on theirback (Muthuvu, or Muthugu, in the Tamil language refers to the upper thoracic region of the back) while crossing rivers and climbing hills. The King, pleased with theiraffection and loyalty, and surprised by their enduring capacity, named them Muthuvans. It is also stated that during their flight to the hills they carried their childrenand belongings on their backs, and after settling in the hills they called themselves Muthuvans. Today, one can still see the Muthuvassis (female Muthuvans) carry their littlechildren on their backs (fig. 1); no cradle or mat is used to lay the baby. The Muthuvans carry their belongings on their backs, not on their heads. Whatever the historical facts and pseudo-historical popu- lar beliefs, the traditions, folklore, language, religious cus- toms, certain cultural patterns, rituals, kinship structure,rules of inheritance, village organization, economy, and soforth, of the Muthuvan community are a potential subject for research. Socio-Economic Profile __________ Muthuvans live in hamlets called kudi (fig. 2). A kudi is an economically self-sufficient unit and has important political Figure 1\u2014The \"Muthuvassi\"\u2014a typical Muthuvan woman with her child clinging to her back in a cloth sack.Figure 2\u2014The \"Kudi\"\u2014Muthuvan hamlets are usually situated amidst the thick forest and high locales of the High Range far away from the mainland. and judicial functions. It used to be a mobile unit both in respect of membership and territoriality. All kudies are invariably known by the name of the place or have some localassociation. The kudi represents the Muthuvan society, each of which consists of 30 or more families. Almost all members of a kudiare related. The kudi's headman is called a Kani (fig. 3), which in the vernacular means supervisor or protector. The Kani or Kanikkar is chosen to the position by commonconsent of the adult male members of the kudi, and hegenerally retains the title until death, unless deposed for his inefficiency, infirmity, or insolence. The Muthuvans follow the matrilineal system. Formerly, they were very strict about marriages, marrying only Muthuvans belonging to other subclans of equal social status. A marriage between members of two subclans ofthe same clan in those days would amount to incest and Figure 3\u2014The \"Kani\"\u2014the Muthuvan Headman whose authoritarian influence over the clan is being eroded by the changing attitudes andlifestyles among Muthuvans. 74 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Damu Helping the \"Ecosystem People\" Protect Wilderness and Their Own Welfare was severely dealt with. Until the1970s, the Eastern Muth- uvans never used to mingle or intermarry with the WesternMuthuvans or other community members, although things are changing. Marriages are duly registered, and intra, inter, and outside clan marriages are taking place at present. In the past, a Muthuvan man would marry only after the age of 25, and a woman never was given to marriage before 18 or even 20 in a Muthuvan kudi, whereas today one findsmarriages taking place at an early age for both sexes. Widow marriage is permitted. This is to ensure the safety and subsistence of the widow and her children. The Muthuvans always emphasize the need for group living. They very much appreciate the advantage of commu- nal life and mutual assistance. The kudi also provides acertain measure of economic security against widowhood, old age, sickness, and incapacity to work, by enabling per- sons to live through these contingencies. Mutual aid is apredominant characteristic of Muthuvan kudies. The Muthuvans in general do not seem to have material aspirations, and they prefer to stay in their respectivekudies cultivating lemon grass, and so on, even though there is scope for employment in nearby tea estates of big compa- nies and others. Statistics based on the recent Economic Survey conducted by the officials of Tata Tea Limited, at the behest of the High Range Wildlife & Environment Preservation Association,reveal that the average annual income per Muthuvan family ranges from 2,000 to 18,000 Rupees (U.S. $41.30 to $371.75). It is below 4,000 Rupees (U.S. $82.60) in 42 kudies and about12,000 Rupees (U.S. $247.85) in about 48 kudies. The main source of income is from agriculture/farming. Muthuvans with a lower income are found to depend on lemon grasscultivation and ragi farming. The Muthuvan families withhigher incomes are seen dependent on pepper, coffee, or cardamom cultivation. Moreover, young Muthuvans in these families find employment in small estates as casual labor,which is reflected in higher earnings. They also rear cattle and poultry, but they don't sell the produce. They give eggs, ragi, honey, and so forth, to guestsas a token of their love. Ward and Conner (1860) in their Memoir of the Survey of the Travancore and Cochin States , state: They are somewhat more civilized than the other hill tribes, at least the comparative regard they show to their women would induce such a belief. Ecosystem People ______________ The Muthuvans are the best stewards of the natural resources. They are well acquainted with hill tracts and traceby instinct the devious paths and decide with unerring cer- tainty on the number and variety of animals that have lately traversed them. Their senses are, from constant use, keenlydeveloped, and they can hear sounds and see objects that other people would not notice. They are expert trackers with great knowledge of the country. Their endurance and thedexterity with which they use their bill hooks in clearing paths make them invaluable as guides to anyone traveling in the forests. The author himself, once while returning from the plains to the High Range, happened to witness the Muthuvans'oneness with nature and understanding of wildlife. When the author's chauffeur tried to negotiate a turn on the forestroad, the car had to be brought to an abrupt halt because there were some wild elephants blocking the road ahead. A couple of other vehicles were also stuck there with thepassengers looking terrified. We couldn't move forward as the elephants never bothered to budge. Half an hour passed without any progress. Then to our rescue came someMuthuvans, who seeing our plight, slowly walked toward the elephants, all the while talking to them in a strange language. As if they understood the meaning of what theMuthuvans were saying, the elephants looked at them and walked away into the forest without any sign of resistance or agitation! It seemed to the author that the wild beastsconsidered the Muthuvans not as a threat but a friendly lot. Shifting cultivation was the popular and customary method followed by Muthuvans in the distant past for raising crops.The lay of the land, the nature of trees and undergrowth, the accessibility to waterways, and the suitability of the land for setting up hamlets, were the chief considerations for theMuthuvans in selecting a site for cultivation. Clearing op- erations, which were a communal undertaking, used to start on an auspicious day in January determined by divinationby the religious headman of the Muthuvan hamlet. The Muthuvans used to camp on the site for a year, cultivating rice, ragi, and other millets, following a standard pattern ofsowing and harvesting, which would all be over by Novem- ber only to celebrate the festival Karthikai with pomp and pleasure. Then they would pack up after the Oracle by thereligious guru and move to another hill or valley. With the beginning of Thai (mid-January, representing the lunar month of the Tamils), the whole process would repeat. Theidea of shift cultivation was to preserve the soil fertility of aparticular area and protect its natural resources from pollu- tion or depletion. The practice of shifting cultivation is no longer in vogue because, as the tea plantations expanded, the British plant- ers demarcated vast areas for these hill men where they established their kudies and agricultural lands for a moresettled mode of cultivation. Wildlife and Environmental Preservation ___________________ The pioneer British planters sought the help of the Muthuvans' knowledge of the forests and wild animals in more ways than one. As the Muthuvans were good gamewatchers, their advice was sought by the planters on the presence and movement of game, the game to be culled, the wounded \"wild\" that needed assistance, and so forth. The High Range Game Preservation Association was started in 1928 by the pioneer British tea planters with the main objective of controlling the indiscriminate killing ofanimals to preserve the varied fauna of the area. To actual- ize this objective, the following activities were accomplished: appointing the Muthuvans as game watchers, checking theculling of animals during the nonbreeding season, and preventing people from entering the game reserve during the breeding season. With the formation of the High Range Game Preservation Association, the relationship with the Muthuvans was muchUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 75Helping the \"Ecosystem People\" Protect Wilderness and Their Own Welfare Damu Figure 4\u2014Community Medical Outreach\u2014Tata Tea Limited's medical officers and welfare officers seen in a remote kudi at one of the regular medicalcamps organized by the Company.more strengthened. The Muthuvans, who were until then living in caves and natural rock shelters, were encouragedby the Kanan Devan Hill Produce Company, a subsidiary of the famous Finlays of Great Britain, to construct huts to live in and helped them financially. Since Tata Tea Limited's business takeover in the district, more constructive philanthropic activities have been under- taken for the welfare of the Muthuvans. The High RangeGame Preservation Association was rechristened as the High Range Wildlife and Environment Preservation Asso- ciation, with its primary aim to conserve flora and fauna ofthe High Ranges. This organization is a registered body, which in the case of the Muthuvans, provides financial assistance in procuring teaching aids for the schools in thekudies and also learning aids for the students. Yet another area in which the High Range Wildlife and Environment Preservation Association helps Muthuvans issocial assistance. The Association coordinates with the tribal welfare schemes of the Tata Tea Company and the Govern- ment. The Association organizes periodic liaison meetingsby inviting the Muthuvan representatives and the Govern- ment Officials concerned, such as the District Collector and Officers of the Forest and Wildlife Departments. The Association activities are financed by Tata Tea Ltd. through annual grants. In addition to this, the management staff of the Company are actively involved in wildlife preser-vation and helping Muthuvans in many other ways. The Association's other important activities include forming na- ture clubs and organizing nature camps, competitions andclasses for students in the region to create nature awareness, rejuvenating the degraded sholas (the deciduous rain forests) with native species, assisting the Wildlife Officer of EravikulamNational Park in taking wildlife census, and managing thepark by employing Muthuvan watchers. Muthuvan watchers have been employed over the past decades, and at present there are 12 of them on the payrollsof Tata Tea Ltd. The duties of the Muthuvan watchers include keeping a vigil on divisional boundaries, fuel areas, and other places; keeping a watch on the flora and fauna;reporting to the estate Manager the movements and pres- ence of wild animals; reporting on any poaching, illegal felling, or cutting of trees; fire prevention; theft prevention;and reporting on stray cattle. The Muthuvan watchers have been instructed to write down their weekly observations of both flora and fauna. This record is studied by the Depart-ment concerned in the Company, and necessary conserva- tion and promotional activities are undertaken. Muthuvan watchers also assist the management staff in boundarychecking and act as guides to the researchers, environmen- talists, and nature lovers who trek to Eravikulam National Park, one of the finest wildlife sanctuaries in India, situatedat an elevation of 6,000 ft (1,829 m) above sea level in the High Ranges. The famous Eravikulam National Park occupies an area of 25,946 acres (10,500 ha), and is an integral part of the vast stretch of forests extending from Anamallais to the Palani Hills of Tamil Nadu. The park is unique with the shoalgrassland ecosystem at an average elevation of 6,562 ft (2,000 m). The climate here is of tropical, cool montane type. The diurnal temperature variation is high compared totypical temperate climate. The rolling grasslands hold the thin topsoil. And the area has remained undisturbed byhuman agency from time immemorial. Considering the ecological, floral, faunal, and geomorphological significanceof this area, it is listed as one of the environmental \"hot- spots\" in Asia. The Nilgiri Tahr ( Hermitragus hylocorius ), an endangered and extremely rare type of mountain goat, isprotected in this park. More than half of the total world population of these goats, numbering nearly 1,000, are here. Indian Gaur, Malabar squirrel, and a wide range of wildanimals, including the lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri Langur, barking deer, wild dogs, leopard cats, and tigers are the pride of the High Range. Tribal Outreach Programs ________ The Muthuvans have always looked to Tata Tea Ltd. for help, encouragement, and guidance in solving their prob- lems. And the company, owing allegiance to the Muthuvancommunity, has always treated it as its moral and social obligation to do the best to alleviate their suffering and ameliorate their welfare. Since the inception of the Commu-nity Development and Social Welfare Department in Tata Tea in 1984, regular tribal medical camps (fig. 4) have been held in the kudies adjoining the tea estates and located evenfar away in this region. After Independence, the British left, and the Indian in- heritors of this tea planting company have kept up the legacyof medical care. Medical camps are being held in most kudies two to four times a year. These are conducted whenever the Muthuvans report outbreaks of disease, and there are norestrictions on the number of camps conducted and hamlets covered. Thus, it is more a need-based type of response than a regular system of medical care. However, these literalforays into the leech-infested jungles helped boost the confi-dence of the Muthuvan in modern medical methods, and has built rapport. Word about compassion and care has spread. It has led to emergency cases from these remote tribal areas,located in jungles spread out in a radius of 12.4 to18.6 miles (20 to 30 km), being referred to Tata Tea's General Hospital, 76 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Damu Helping the \"Ecosystem People\" Protect Wilderness and Their Own Welfare Munnar. In all these places, the Tea Garden Hospitals continue to provide free medical aid. There is no going backon this trend, and often one can see a Muthuvan family among the outpatient crowd or snuggled in bed at Tata Tea's General Hospital. The free medical aid camps are also utilized for conducting health surveys including nutritional status of the children. Even though exact statistical details have not been main-tained, the medical team has seldom come across any case of marasmus or kwashiorkor (conditions arising from severe malnutrition) among the Muthuvan children. Two decades ago, the State Government built a Primary Health Center in Society Kudi, a hub of tribal activity because of its proximity to a nearby school, Forest Guard'shut, and a Tribal Cooperative that procured tribal produce and promoted trade. Because of refusal by Government doctors to trek to these far interior regions, the PrimaryHealth Center was not utilized for a long time. The high point of medical care has been the construction of its own dispensary 3 years ago by Tata Tea at Edaliparai.The medical officers of the Company trek to this small hospital once a quarter, stay there a few days, and conduct medical camps there and in nearby hamlets. After discus-sions with the Health Secretary during his visit to Munnar last year, governmental supply of medicines has started to this dispensary. Government health care workers also ac-company the medical officers of Tata Tea Hospitals. A singular point of note is the selection of willing young men from among the tribal community to work as TribalBarefoot Doctors. At least one young man from each kudi has been selected and training imparted on the basic health care and preventive measures, so that after a 10-day residentialworkshop at Tata Tea General Hospital, they can return totheir community and function confidently in their new role as Tribal Barefoot Doctors. The Interventions for Sexual Health Project of the Indian Medical Association, Munnar Branch, which is an HIV/AIDS prevention project supported by Tata Tea, has conducted many focus group discussions and case studies among thevarious tribal hamlets. Findings indicated that though Muthuvans generally had some knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the majority of them did notknow that condoms could be used to prevent STDs. They believe that indigenous medicines made of ground leaves of jungle plants and shrubs promote contraception. Surpris-ingly, there are very few Muthuvan families that have more than three children!Conclusions____________________ The Muthuvan who was a guide and friend to the British planter had an unwritten agreement that the Planting Company would look after the welfare and medical needs of his community. Thus started a unique bond that has re-mained intact through two centuries. This relationship not only benefited the community but also the High Range environment through the nature preservation efforts jointlyundertaken by Tata Tea Ltd., the High Range Wildlife and Environment Preservation Association, and the govern- ment departments concerned with helping the Muthuvans. This model of corporate citizenship and corporate environ- mental responsibility put into force by Tata Tea in this part of the Indian subcontinent has been appreciated by manyecologists in India. It is an example to be emulated by many corporations around the world, wherever there is opportu- nity for joint effort in nature conservation and tribal welfare. No nature conservation effort would be a complete success without enlisting the support of the tribes or the local inhabitants in that region. There are lots of ways we canlearn from these tribes in understanding nature and devis- ing ways to conserve her riches. It is the social and moral responsibility of the corporate world to educate and rehabili-tate tribes in the neighborhood, which in turn motivates them to come forward willingly to cooperate in efforts for nature and wildlife conservation.

Gwich'in Indians, whose culture revolves both materially and spirituallyaround the caribou, oppose all such development for fear that it will jeopardize that species' optimum calving grounds. Inupiat Eskimos, who stand to gain economically from petrodevelopment, favor oiland gas exploration on the coastal plain while opposing it offshore, where it might threaten the bowhead whale, the species at the center of their own culture. After reviewing the history of the conflictand weighing the respective claims of these two peoples, the paper concludes with a discussion of the threats posed to ANWR by international terrorism and by global warming. Introduction ____________________ When Alaska entered the Union, President Eisenhower designated several million acres of tundra between the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea as a refuge for wildlife. A decade later, in 1969, oil was discovered 60 miles (96.5 km)west of the refuge at Prudhoe Bay. Although the oilfield it-self was on State-owned land, transporting the oil to the Port of Valdez would require the construction of a pipeline. Over its proposed 800-mile (1,287-km) route, the pipeline wouldhave to pass through Federal lands tied up in litigation between the State of Alaska and its indigenous peoples. Eager to expedite development, the State agreed to a dealintended to eliminate all such obstacles. The 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) awarded aboriginal groups 44 million acres (178,062 km 2) of land and a billion dollars in cash, establishing 12 regional and over 200 village corporations to manage that settlement. It also authorized the Secretary of the Interior to set aside lands he or shedeemed scenic or ecologically significant. Intense conflict spawned by the latter directive ended only after Jimmy Carter's failed bid for re-election, when Congress, over theprotest of the State delegation, passed the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA). Carter himselfEndangered Species, Endangered Culture: Native Resistance to Industrializing theArctic Sandra Hinchman would later call ANILCA the most important environmental legislation of the twentieth century, as it dramatically in- creased the amount of Federally protected land, adding 104million acres (420,873 km 2), including 56 million acres (226,624 km2) of wilderness, to the system. The size of the original Arctic National Wildlife Range (renamed a Refuge)was itself doubled, and 17.5 million (70,820 km 2) of its 19 million acres (76,890 km2) were declared permanently off limits to industrial development. However, to win passage ofthe 1980 bill, the administration agreed to a fateful compro- mise: Congress reserved the right to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's (ANWR) 1.5-million-acre (6,070-km 2) coastal plain to oil and gas exploration in the future. The status of that coastal study area\u2014commonly called the 1002 land, after the pertinent section of the Act\u2014hasgalvanized the petroleum industry and its critics like no other issue. It has also called forth some unusual alliances. On the one side stand interests seeking to open up the areafor development: the four transnational corporations (Brit- ish Petroleum, Exxon-Mobil, Phillips Petroleum, and Chev- ron) competing for drilling rights; American labor unions,anticipating the creation of up to735,000 jobs around thecountry; the vast majority of Alaskans, hoping to continue receiving dividends and tax relief from oil leasing; and the Inupiat people, who reside on the North Slope. Attemptingto exclude the coastal plain permanently from development are the Government of Canada, the Gwich'in Nation, whose members dwell on either side of the Alaskan/Yukon border,and the environmental community. Opinion polls taken prior to September 11, 2001, indicated that 66 percent of Americans oppose drilling in ANWR (Defenders of Wildlife2001a). Virtually no fact about ANWR is uncontested. Estimates of how many billion barrels of technically and economicallyrecoverable oil lies beneath the coastal plain, what percent- age of American energy demand it would satisfy, how long it would take to erect the necessary infrastructure, and howextensive, permanent, and damaging that industrial \"foot- print\" would be, all vary widely. Disagreements have arisen over the likelihood that oil would be sold abroad, whether itwould significantly reduce United States dependence on foreign sources, and whether it would result in lower prices for consumers or merely in more profits for corporations. Finally, and inevitably, there are disputes regarding the aesthetic and ecological qualities of the coastal plain itself. As Barry Lopez (1986: 278) has remarked, \"it is preciselywhat is invisible in the land...that makes what is merely empty space to one person a place to another.\" Supporters of development depict the study area as a flat, boggy, treeless,almost featureless wasteland that is virtually uninhabit- able by animals most of the year. They emphasize the78 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Hinchman Endangered Species, Endangered Culture: Native Resistance to Industrializing the Arctic ruggedness, resilience, and near invulnerability of both the land itself and the 200 bird and animal species that summerthere. This image is difficult to reconcile with what some of their opponents (such as, the Wilderness Society, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Resources De-fense Council) see: America's Serengeti; the premier birthing and nursing ground for Arctic wildlife; one of the most complete, pristine, and undisturbed ecosystems in the world;and ANWR's biological heart. In their view, the ANILCA Section 1002 area is inherently fragile, and its fauna can be extremely sensitive to disturbance. Bruce Babbitt, InteriorSecretary during the Clinton administration, predicted that if oil companies were allowed in, it would be ANWR's death knell as a wildlife refuge. Porcupine Caribou ______________ Debate regarding the status of wildlife in the Refuge has centered around the Porcupine caribou herd. Section 1002 of ANILCA had directed the Interior Secretary, in consultationwith his/her Canadian counterpart, to assess the likely impact of coastal plain development on this particular group of ungulates. Seven years after the passage of ANILCA, theUnited States and Canadian Governments signed a bilat- eral agreement affirming their commitment to conserve the herd (Canadian Embassy Web site 2001a). Indeed, theCanadian Government, which established two National Parks for its protection, continues to press its southern neighbor to follow suit. Similar concerns about the herd'swelfare led over 500 American and Canadian scientists to sign a petition in March 2001, calling for a ban on oil exploration in ANWR (Defenders of Wildlife 2001b). Proponents of development, however, bristle at the sug- gestion that the caribou might be threatened by it in any way. The Porcupine herd is extensive, numbering between 130,000 and 170,000 animals (according to environmental-ist and oil company estimates, respectively). Like all other herds, its numbers fluctuate in natural cycles (Lopez 1986). If it is currently in temporary decline, that is offset by in-creases in the Western and Central Arctic herds. In fact, when the members of these other herds are factored in, it turns out that there are actually more caribou in Alaskathan people. Why, then, has the status of the Porcupine herd gener- ated so much concern and controversy? Of three subspeciesof caribou residing in North America, Barren-ground cari- bou, to which the Porcupine, Western Arctic, and Central Arctic herds belong, migrate the farthest distance (Lopez1986). All these herds reside seasonally on Alaska's North Slope. Wintering in the Canadian taiga near the Porcupine River, a tributary of the Yukon, the Porcupine group trekshundreds of miles every spring to the ANWR coastal plain, where the Brooks Range pinches down to between 15 and 40 miles (24 and 64 km) of the sea (Dunkel 2001). Pregnantcows lead the exodus toward this optimum calving and postcalving habitat. After the cows have given birth, bulls and juveniles join them to browse on tundral grass andlichens (Canadian Embassy Web site 2001b). Aside from the superior foraging opportunities it provides, the area is favored by the herd because it affords relative protectionfrom predators and relief from insect pests. When the cows fail to reach the plain before they drop their calves, as hashappened at least 5 out of the last 19 years, the newborn mortality rate skyrockets. Environmentalists fear a substantial population crash among the Porcupine caribou if the infrastructure associ- ated with development alters the herd's migration routes.They point out that pregnant and nursing females are so sensitive to \"disturbances such as the presence of humans, vehicles, and noise\" that they might \"abandon their maincalving ground\" if the proposed development goes forward (McManus 2000: 42). Ample evidence exists to support this view. One study has concluded that caribou around devel-opment facilities tend to spend less time feeding and to run more (Murphy and Griffiths 1999). More ominously, a Canadian Government report alleges that calving by theCentral Arctic herd near Prudhoe Bay has \"nearly ceased,\" and that \"starving and dead caribou have been docu- mented\" in the area (Davidson 1993: 30). Petroleum indus-try analysts counter that the Central Arctic herd, far from being harmed by industrial development, is actually thriv- ing in the midst of it. But whatever the status of the CentralArctic caribou, the Porcupine herd's situation may be unique: \"Other herds may survive but this one won't, because there is not enough land to the east\" of the zonewhere drilling would occur. With mountains to the south, the sea to the north, and the already occupied habitat near Prudhoe Bay to the west, the herd has literally \"nowhereelse to go\" (Gemmil, personal communication). Indeed, Canada's Interior Department estimates that the herd's birth rate may fall by up to 40 percent if drilling commencesin ANWR (Linklater and Gemmil 2001). Caribou People _________________ Should harm befall the Porcupine herd, no group would shoulder the consequences more than the Gwich'in (Kutchin) Nation. Of all Indians in the hemisphere, the Gwich'in arethe most northerly, residing in 15 isolated villages above the Arctic Circle in Alaska and Canada. For over 20,000 years the Gwich'in were nomadic, following the caribou and othergame in their seasonal migrations. Once 100,000 strong, these Athabascan hunters now number fewer than 8,000, having been decimated by exposure to Old World diseases.Much has changed in their culture since the time of first contact with Caucasians: they exchanged their shamanism for the Episcopalian faith, established permanent settle-ments in order to remain near their children's schools, adopted the English language, and embraced certain tech- nological innovations, from rifles and snowmobiles to elec-tricity and satellite TV. But what has not changed, despite their (limited) participation in the cash economy, is a com- mitment to subsistence living. Materially, socially, andspiritually, their culture continues to revolve, as it has since time immemorial, around their relationship to the caribou. Comparisons are sometimes made to the dependence oftraditional Lakota culture on the buffalo (Bartholet 2001; Davidson 1993). \"The caribou is everything to us,\" as Gwich'in spokesperson Faith Gemmil (personal communication) putit. \"It is our life.\" The centrality of the Porcupine herd to the Gwich'in culture is apparent in their creation legend. Originally, so the storygoes, humans and animals were one species. When the hourUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 79Endangered Species, Endangered Culture: Native Resistance to Industrializing the Arctic Hinchman of separation arrived, the Gwich'in were split off from the caribou. Yet the brothers forged a pact of eternal kinship, bywhich each would always retain a piece of the other's heart. Thus, \"what befalls the caribou befalls the Gwich'in and vice versa\" (International Indian Treaty Council 1992: 2). The Gwich'in bond with the Porcupine herd is hardly meta- phorical. Caribou meat accounts for about 80 percent of the tribal diet. In a typical year, the tribe will harvest about 3,000caribou, utilizing virtually every part of the animal for food, tools, or clothing. It is their belief that hunting can succeed only when animals voluntarily surrender their lives. The sense thatreciprocal obligations exist between the caribou and the Gwich'in has given rise to strict norms regulating when, where, and under what conditions hunting may occur (Callaway, personalcommunication). The Gwich'in maintain seasonal hunting camps for about 2 months of the year, after the caribou have left the coastal plain on their long return migration. The plainitself, as \"the sacred place where life begins,\" may never be disturbed (International Indian Treaty Council 1992: 2), even in times of famine and starvation (Linklater and Gemmil2001). \"We don't go there,\" says Gemmil (personal communica- tion). \"No one should go there. The caribou need time to themselves.\" Aside from not entering the birthing ground,hunting parties must spare the first band of caribou that passes by, kill no more animals than they need, and give thanks for what they take. Animals are butchered on the spot, great careis taken not to defile the ground with blood, and although some meat is consumed right away most is dried on racks and preserved for later use. This meat is shared throughout thevillage community, for as one elder said, \"we have always done things as a group and thought in terms of the tribe and the family\" (Davidson 1993: 28, 25). Although it is true that the Gwich'in would have few alternate sources of food if the caribou herd diminished or its migration routes were altered, the importance of the caribou harvest to their culture goes well beyond the economic.Subsistence is more than just nutrition; it is the basis for ethical relations among people, and between people and nature (Callaway, personal communication). To preservetheir way of life, the Gwich'in believe they must preserve the Porcupine herd, which in turn demands preserving its birthing ground. \"If there were no caribou we wouldn't have lived herefor thousands of years,\" says one Gwich'in man. \"That's who we are and where we came from\" (Bartholet 2001: 23). The depth of these attachments is evidenced by the fact that outof 211 native villages that qualified for benefits under ANCSA, two of the seven that refused to participate were Gwich'in (Anders 1994). Recognizing that all cultures require an eco-nomic base, Gemmil (personal communication) comments, \"We were offered money and jobs, first pick. But we said, no! No amount of money can replace our heritage. Our land mustalways be here for us to survive on.\" \"We are the caribou people,\" adds another Gwich'in woman. \"Without the land we are nobody\" (Davidson 1993: 31). Gwich'in Environmentalist Alliance _______________________ The Gwich'in did not always oppose industrial develop- ment in the high Arctic. From the 1970s through the mid- 1980s, they entered into lease agreements allowing Exxon,British Petroleum, and Rougeot of Tulsa to explore for oil on lands through which the Porcupine caribou migrate,making no provision to protect the herd in the process. Critics contend that only when these efforts came to naught did the Gwich'in decide to reverse course. Tribal spokesper-sons respond that the leases pertained only to the southern part of their reserve, outside the herd's range. They empha- size the environmental lessons they learned from the expe-rience: when elders noticed a dieoff of smaller creatures near where seismic tests were being conducted, they ad- vised the tribal council to terminate all leases (Davidson1993). The Nation's resolve to oppose drilling in ANWR crystallized in 1988, after the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, when representatives from all 15 of their settlements in Alaskaand Canada convened in Arctic Village, 125 miles (201 km) south of the coastal plain. Perceiving a threat to their culture's survival, they unanimously passed a resolutionagainst development and created a Steering Committee as their political arm, instructing it to \"go out and tell the world why we take this position. Do it in a good way and wewill succeed\" (Gwich'in Steering Committee 2001). The eight-member Steering Committee has attempted to influence the political process in far-off Washington andOttawa, primarily through lobbying efforts, attracting me- dia attention, and establishing alliances with other indig- enous peoples and international environmental groups.Their efforts enjoy a \"solid base of support among native peoples,\" including the Alaska Intertribal Council, the National Congress of American Indians, to which 500tribes belong, and the worldwide Indigenous Environmen- tal Network, backed financially by Greenpeace and similar organizations (Taylor 1995: 32). Church groups\u2014depictingtheirs as a human rights struggle\u2014have rallied behindthem (Carpenter 2001), as have all major American envi- ronmental organizations, most notably the Sierra Club, Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth, The Nature Con-servancy, Defenders of Wildlife, and the National Wildlife Federation (Faith Gemmil from the Gwich'in Steering Committee sits on their Board of Directors; Dinero, per-sonal communication). These groups are concerned not only about the integrity of the Arctic ecosystem and its species but also about the bad precedent that would be setif drilling were allowed in a wildlife refuge. For this reason, among others, \"If ever there were a Stalingrad for the environmental movement in Alaska, it's ANWR\" (Jans2001: 11A). Detractors of the Gwich'in Nation allege that they are fronting for environmental groups that are using them fortheir own ends. They depict the Steering Committee as a \"white-dominated organization\" based in far-off Anchorage and \"funded by environmental Power2001a). Gwich'in spokesmen deny all that, insisting: \"We manipulated by anybody. Our position was home- grown\" (Gemmil, personal communication). And indeed, thealliance between the Gwich'in and environmentalists does seem in some ways a marriage of convenience. The Gwich'in don't think of themselves as anti-oil; like most other Ameri-cans, they use many petroleum products in their daily lives (Davidson 1993). An observer at a recent meeting in Arctic Village remarked that \"when the environmentalists madespeeches, [Gwich'in] eyes glazed over... Their cause has been fought in the U.S. by the environmental community80 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Hinchman Endangered Species, Endangered Culture: Native Resistance to Industrializing the Arctic above all others. They know this. But when the issue dis- solves, the marriage will too\" (Dinero, personal communi- cation). Still, although \"not environmentalists by any stretch,\" the Gwich'in in small ways \"are moving in that direction,\" for instance by banning the use of styrofoam andusing solar power to run the communal freezer that stores caribou meat during the summer months (Dinero, personal communication). Environmental organizations, for their part, have some- times taken positions antithetical to the perceived self-inter- est of indigenous peoples, particularly when the welfare ofendangered species seemed to be at stake. As Dryzek and Young (1985) point out, policies that environmentalists have supported in the past have actually heightened the problemsof remote communities in the North. On this issue, however, there is a shared conviction uniting environmentalists and the Gwich'in: both believe\u2014in the words of the NationalWildlife Federation President\u2014that it is impossible to \"par- tially change the coastal plain without altering the whole ecosystem\" (Lurie 2001: 24). Inupiats and Petrodevelopment____ Like the 6,500 Inupiat (Inupiaq) Eskimos of Alaska's North Slope traditionally were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Generally speaking, fish and marinemammals like the seal, walrus, and especially the bowhead whale were their mainstay, supplemented by caribou, bear, moose, sheep, waterfowl, and other wild game. Famine andstarvation in bad years were not uncommon (Anders 1994). However, the economic situations of Inupiat bands varied considerably, depending on whether they resided primarilyin the Brooks Range or along the Arctic coast. The coastalInupiat, from the early 20 th century on, could supplement their subsistence harvest with commercial whaling, trap- ping, and herding, as distant markets began to penetratetheir remote land. Although each of these commercial ven- tures ultimately failed, their collective impact was indelible, tying the coastal Inupiat to the cash economy and introduc-ing new technologies into their traditional subsistence har- vest (Chance 1990). Few sources of income remained for the Inupiat until Washington, in the Cold War era, began to appreciate the high Arctic's strategic value. During this period, the Inupiat repeatedly were treated as pawns in the geopolitical arena.The construction of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line radar installation near the coastal village of Kaktovik pro- vided jobs for some local people, but led to the displacementand forced relocation of many others (Chance 1990). More sinister was Project Chariot, in which the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), with the blessing of the State of Alaska,planned to conduct atomic weapons tests under the pretext of blasting out a deep-water harbor near an Inupiat village in the northwestern part of the State (Chance 1990). When theeconomic value of the proposed harbor proved negligible, the AEC's rationale shifted: they now billed Project Chariot as an experiment \"in 'geographical engineering' [designed to] deter-mine the effects of a nuclear explosion on the environment\u2014 its rock substrata, soils, atmosphere, and biota, including man\" (Chance 1990: 144). Not until the Inupiat, the environ-mental community, and the larger public learned of this wantonly destructive and arguably genocidal scheme was itunceremoniously shelved. It is noteworthy that, in the cam- paign against Project Chariot, the Inupiat Paitot (\"People'sHeritage\") was formed as the first association of its kind to protect Native interests in the far north. A decade after the defeat of Project Chariot, the 1969 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay resulted in an economic windfall that substantially altered the Inupiat way of life. Tax revenues generated by the oil boom financed infra-structural improvements and the provision of expanded public services. The Inupiat, already partially integrated into the cash economy, quickly embraced the \"accoutre-ments of a modern lifestyle once limited to communities far to the south\" (Buege 1997: 99; Chance 1990: 4, pre-oil,\" says an Inupiat spokes-man. \"But thanks to the industrial tax base created by the oil fields, ...we have opportunities we couldn't have dreamed of\" (Arctic Power 2001b). Indeed, the mayor of Kaktovik, theonly community within ANWR's geographic boundaries, bluntly warns: \"If you take away the oil money, you've got a subsistence way of life. All of a sudden you'd be trying to findfood, stay warm, keep out of the wind\" (Bartholet 2001: 31). These material advantages, however, have come at the expense of traditional values, institutions, and relation-ships (Dryzek and Young 1985). The Inupiat norm of self- sufficiency erodes with the influx of consumer goods from afar (Chance 1990). Subsistence activities have become lessnecessary for survival, and their nature has changed as a function of \"capital intensification\" (Dryzek and Young 1985: 126); for example, the snowmobiles now used to facilitatesubsistence hunting are costly to purchase, operate, and maintain (Anders 1994). Then, too, social cohesion is threat- ened by the growth of new cleavages and forms of politicaland economic inequality. Ideologies of individualism andpersonal achievement undermine norms of sharing, \"kin- kin cooperation,\" and collective responsibility (Chance 1990). And the rise of village and regional corporations has chal-lenged, and in many places disempowered, traditional struc- tures of authority. Thus, while the Inupiat historically were no strangers to economic booms and busts, the weakenedcondition of their cultural \"support and distribution sys- tems\" renders the prospect of a decline in oil revenues extremely daunting (Chance 1990). \"It is difficult,\" as Dryzekand Young (1985: 127, 135) say, \"to hold the cash economy in a partial embrace... The social transformation has gone too far in most of the villages of the North to permit a [simple]return to older ways\" of life. When the oil runs out, as it inevitably must, Inupiat society is likely to confront even more wrenching dilemmas and challenges. Tensions have also erupted between coastal and moun- tain Inupiat, with the latter believing their interests have been shortchanged by the Arctic Slope Regional Corpora-tion, one of the 12 regional corporations established as part of the settlement of Native land claims. The Corporation acquired subsurface rights to over 90,000 acres (364 km 2) in ANWR in a 1983 land swap with the Department of the Interior (Chance 1990). The swap, brokered by a public interest environmental law firm, added 100,000 acres (405km 2) to Gates of the Arctic National Park. But this was land on which the mountain Inupiat historically had conducted their subsistence harvest. Thereafter, they needed permitsto enter the land and were not allowed to use all-terrain vehicles (their preferred, if untraditional, mode of transport)USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 81Endangered Species, Endangered Culture: Native Resistance to Industrializing the Arctic Hinchman to reach the hunting grounds. For its part, the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation cannot lease out the land acquired inthe transfer unless Congress approves opening up the coastal plain to oil and gas exploration. Thus, the hopes of the North Slope Inupiat when the swap was made have not yet beenrealized. Cleavages and tensions aside, most Inupiat\u2014belonging to one of the wealthiest Native groups in the UnitedStates\u2014do seem strongly to favor development in ANWR (Buege 1997). A former mayor of Kaktovik contended that the oil beneath the surface of ANWR could provide jobs,schools, and a thriving economy for residents. In a recent opinion survey of Kaktovik villagers, 78 percent of respon- dents said they either \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that the1002 area should be opened to oil and gas exploration (Arctic Power 2001c). The oil companies have helped to promote these sentiments by ingratiating themselves withthe Inupiat and co-opting their leaders (Chance 1990). A representative of Arctic Power, a pro-development lobby- ing organization financed by the State of Alaska, stressesthe convergence between the Inupiat right to use North Slope land \"to provide for their culture\" and the right of \"all Americans... to benefit from the national treasure lyingbeneath the coastal plain\" (Easley, personal communica- tion). Supporting the ambition of the oil companies and the Inupiat is the 90,000 member Alaska Federation of Na-tives, a political organization led by an educated, urban- ized elite for whom petrodevelopment is the \"key to brighter future\" (Chance 1990: 149-150, 163). Bowhead People ________________ Although most Inupiat apparently support drilling in ANWR, they simultaneously oppose offshore oil exploration, fearing potential harm to the bowhead whale, which tradi- tionally was as central to their culture as the caribou is to theGwich'in. Even with the benefit of modern technology, whal- ing remains a dangerous occupation in which hunters' lives are regularly lost. Accordingly, Inupiat men pride them-selves on their whaling prowess. Like the Porcupine caribou herd, bowhead whales are threatened by development, but unlike the caribou, bowhead whales are officially endan-gered. In the late 1970s, an international moratorium on hunting the marine mammals, supported by certain envi- ronmental groups, was briefly in effect; it was lifted only inthe wake of a sophisticated media campaign orchestrated by the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. As part of the com- promise rescinding the ban, the Inupiat agreed to limit thesize of their annual bowhead harvest (Chance 1990). The Western Arctic subgroup of bowhead whales, num- bering about 7,800 animals, comprises the majority of thespecies' global population. Each spring, passing through narrow channels in the ice as it breaks up, the Western Arctic bowheads migrate en masse to the Beaufort Sea,where they consume the bulk of their annual calories during a 4- or 5-month stay. Because oil spills would likely concen- trate in the ice-free channels, the species seems highlyvulnerable. The risk of accidents is increased by the severe storms that occasionally blow into the area. Understand- ably, many Inupiat worry about British Petroleum-Amoco'supcoming Northstar Project, which incorporates a 6-mile(10-km) long offshore pipeline. They are also concerned about continuing offshore exploration in the Beaufort Sea,sponsored by the Government of Canada. Despite their apparent support for oil exploration and their participation in the global economic system, theInupiat of the North Slope continue to regard the hunting of creatures like bowhead whales and caribou (which, in contrast to the Gwich'in, they do hunt on the coastal plain[Chance 1990]) as a vital component of their identity. For them, as for the Gwich'in, subsistence hunting reaffirms a deep cultural connection to their environment. It providesthem with a link to their past and to their spirituality. Indeed, employers complain that these activities too often distract Inupiat workers from their job responsibilities.\"It's just that they always want time off to hunt. That's the big problem\" (Chance 1990: 83). Many prefer to work intermittently, combining wage labor with more tradi-tional economic activities. Economic Ethics and International Law ___________________________ To some extent, the rights of indigenous groups are a matter of international law. The United Nations' Covenant of Civil and Political Rights guarantees ethnic minoritiesthe right to \"enjoy their own culture\" (Kymlicka 2001: 123). Because Indians and Eskimos are not just minorities but peoples, they have a more robust right to self-determinationas well (Anaya 1996). Natural resource rights, enabling peoples to freely dispose of their natural wealth and re- sources for their own ends, are also widely recognized ininternational law (Crawford 1988), as is an \"inalienablehuman right\" to economic development (Anaya 1996). The Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, currently making its way through channels at the UnitedNations, promises additional rights, including \"cultural integrity\" (Anaya 1996), \"the right to maintain their distinc- tive and profound relationships with their lands, territoriesand resources,\" and \"the right to be secure in the enjoyment of their own traditional means of subsistence\" (Crawford 1988: 63; Wilmer 1993: 223-224). Unfortunately, international covenants can offer little guidance in a case like this, which pits the rights of one First Nation against another. The Inupiat right to eco-nomic development collides with the Gwich'in right to preserve their way of life. It is unclear whether the latter guarantees a right not to develop, or only to receive com- pensation for development's unwelcome effects (Kymlicka 2001). But no after-the-fact remedy could adequately com- pensate the Gwich'in if disaster were to befall the Porcu-pine caribou, the essence of their culture. Some scholars have argued that indigenous groups wishing to maintain premodern ways of life may deserve special protectionsover and above those granted to peoples with \"pervasive links to the global economy\" (Anaya 1996; Kymlicka 2001). In that view, international law requires an \"endangeredcultures\" convention to parallel agreements regarding en- dangered species (Kymlicka 1989). Yet the analogy in some ways seems false, if not pernicious. Unlike the course ofbiological evolution, that of cultural evolution is deter- mined at least partly by conscious choices that people82 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Hinchman Endangered Species, Endangered Culture: Native Resistance to Industrializing the Arctic make. It is one thing to want to shelter a culture from choices made by outside forces beyond its control, but quiteanother to freeze it into the amber of traditional patterns and relationships. Doing so would \"prevent aboriginal peoples from adapting to new circumstances, from havinga living culture\" (Kymlicka 2001: 203). Should the Inupiat, opting to join the mainstream, have rights inferior to those of the Gwich'in simply because the latter prefer not to? Atwhat point in any movement away from traditionalism does a group forfeit its rights? The political theorist Van Dyke (1985), a long-time advo- cate of group rights, has advanced eight guidelines for rank ordering the claims of groups and adjudicating conflicts between them. In his scheme, the claims of a group shouldtake priority to the extent that it: (1) is a self-conscious entity seeking its own preservation; (2) has a reasonable chance to succeed in that endeavor; (3) is effectively organized to act inits own interest; (4) has members who pin their identities on it; (5) has been perceived traditionally as a group by others; (6) is divided from other groups by deep cleavages; (7) is notcostly or burdensome to others in pursuing its interests; and (8) is able to grant to similar groups the same rights and statuses it claims for itself. In the current case, both theInupiat and the Gwich'in meet the first six tests. The Inupiat, precisely because they seek further integration into the world economy, seem to have the edge on criterion #2,though to the extent to which they succeed in that ambition, they may be less able to satisfy criterion #4. In regard to criterion #7, substantial costs would accrue to each of thesegroups if the claims of the other were to win out. The Inupiat potentially stand to gain billions of dollars in revenues. But because they are already wealthy, it does seem fair to saythat \"they will be fine even without development in ANWR.They won't suffer poverty. They have alternatives\" (Gemmil, personal communication). For the Gwich'in, the stakes are far higher. The cost could be cultural as well as economic,their effective death\u2014or murder\u2014as a nation. Not unrea- sonably, they \"view any threat to the calving grounds as an act of genocide\" (Lurie 2001: 20). A member of the Gwich'inSteering Committee has declared: \"[The Inupiat] are not our enemy. This is not an Indian versus Eskimo issue. This is about our right to self-determination and to continue to livein our culture\" (Lurie 2001: 21). The eighth criterion may be decisive. It has a Kantian aspect, for it asks, what would happen if the claim of each ofthese groups were universalized, or made applicable to all? The Inupiat claim cannot meet this test. It would allow drilling for oil on ANWR's coastal plain, which might imperilthe caribou, but would disallow offshore drilling, which might imperil the bowhead whale. Since the species play equivalent roles in these cultures, such a policy wouldviolate criterion #8. Gemmil (personal communication) sums this up as follows: \"We respect [the Inupiat] position... We support their opposition to offshore development, and we aredisappointed that they don't reciprocate.\" In short, the two groups have claims that are irreconcil- able and for all practical purposes mutually exclusive.There are asymmetries of wealth and power between them, and also asymmetries in regard to what it will cost each to lose its battle. Financial compensation to the Gwich'in fordrilling on the coastal plain would do nothing to assuage their loss, which could be both intangible and incalculable.By contrast, since the Inupiat loss would be financial, monetary compensation to them for not allowing drilling on the coastal plain seems to be an appropriate remedy. It has been estimated that Americans might be willing to pay between $300 million and $40 billion per year in taxes andhigher energy costs in order to keep Alaskan wild lands pristine (Manning 2001). Assuming that this was an accu- rate assessment at the time it was made, one wonderswhether it remains true post-September 11. Two Threats ____________________ Prior to the terrorist bombings in Washington, DC, and New York City, drilling on the ANWR coastal plain seemedunlikely to win Congressional approval. Although the Bush- Cheney administration had identified opening up the 1002 study area as a priority, and although the House of Repre-sentatives had voted in its favor, the Senate, controlled by a slim Democratic majority, held firm in opposition. But the political situation has changed radically, and champions ofdevelopment in ANWR are using the threat of future terrorist attacks to press their advantage. More than ever, exploring potential domestic oilfields is presented as anational security/patriotism issue. In the words of Alaska's Senator Murkowski, \"Mideast oil funds terrorism. The need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil is a legitimateneed.\" A poll taken before the attacks showed that 74 percent of Americans favor exploring for new domestic oil sources rather than continuing to import oil from abroad(Henry 2001). And if boosters of exploration are correct, ANWR's coastal plain may well turn out to be the biggest potential field in thecountry. Pro-development forces estimate that there is enoughsubsurface petroleum in the 1002 area to replace 30 years' worth of Saudi oil, or to meet the needs of the entire United States military for at least 6 months. Already there has beenan attempt in Congress to attach the opening of the 1002 area as a rider to the $40 billion response package passed in the wake of the bombings. If anything, the political atmo-sphere now is even more charged than it was during the OPEC oil crisis of the mid-1970s, when suits filed by environ- mental groups wishing to stop construction of the trans-Alaskan pipeline were quashed by swift Congressional ac- tion (Haycox, personal communication). There were previous Congressional attempts to open the coastal plain to drillingduring the mid-1980s (until the Exxon-Valdez accident rendered that effort impolitic) as well as a few years later, during the Gulf War. Nothing is easier to imagine than arepeat of those efforts. Indeed, at this writing, the momen- tum for opening up the 1002 area seems practically irresist- ible, even though terrorism itself is already driving up thecosts of North Slope oil: the vulnerability of both the pipeline itself and the massive holding tanks in Valdez has necessi- tated heightened surveillance and security. From an ethicalstandpoint, the pro-development position rests on \"resource egalitarianism,\" according to which resources on public lands should be used to benefit the greatest number withinthe national community (Kymlicka 2001), with no group enjoying a special status or claim. Unless Americans were to see wilderness and biodiversity as \"resources\" more valu-able than oil, the national need for energy independence inUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 83Endangered Species, Endangered Culture: Native Resistance to Industrializing the Arctic Hinchman a time of political crisis would trump the Gwich'in desire to maintain their culture. But if the politics of countering terrorism poses the main immediate threat to the ANWR ecosystem, the Porcupine caribou, and the Gwich'in people, there is also the long-termthreat of ozone depletion and global warming. In fact, an- thropogenic climate change caused by fossil fuel use might threaten the Inupiat, especially those residing in low-lyingcoastal areas, at least as much as their Athabascan counter- parts. For complex reasons, the greenhouse effect is espe- cially pronounced in the circumpolar regions of the world(Steiner 2001). Accordingly, no State is more affected by climatic change than Alaska, where average temperatures have risen 5 F in the past 50 years (Bartholet 2001). The form of atmospheric pollution known as Arctic haze absorbs light from the sun and thereby increases the temperature of Arctic air (Chance 1990). Higher air temperatures promotemelting. Glaciers have receded dramatically, permafrost has thawed, sea levels have risen, and about 11,500 square miles (29,785 km 2) of Arctic ice (the combined size of Mary- land and Delaware) have disappeared annually over the last decade. Some climatologists predict that by the end of the century, the Arctic Ocean during summer months could beentirely ice free (Stolzenburg 2001). Locals already have noticed changes in seasonal patterns (Lurie 2001). Summers are hotter. Snow arrives later and, although there is nowmore of it, it melts faster. River and stream levels are in flux. Each year, spills of toxic materials at the Prudhoe Bay complex release tens of thousands of tons of the potentgreenhouse gas nitrous oxide into the atmosphere (Davidson 1993). These changes, in turn, inevitably affect the subsistence harvest in particular, and economic activity in general.Rougher seas, more severe storms, and more frequent storm surges have made hunting bowhead whales and other ma- rine mammals\u2014always a dangerous occupation for theInupiat\u2014even more so (Callaway, personal communica- tion). Salmon runs have declined; caribou numbers will probably fall as well. Research has shown that the caribouare harassed by insects more during warmer summer months and therefore spend more time standing around and less time feeding. It is also harder for them to get at their winterfood when the snow is deep. This uses more energy and takes time away from eating. In fact, one study concluded that abiotic phenomena, especially snow cover, seem to be thebest predictors of the size and well-being of large herds (Arctic Borderlands Ecological Knowledge Society 2001). Likewise, the early breakup of river ice during the calvingseason can spell disaster for caribou. In 2000, when preg- nant caribou were unable to cross the ice-choked Porcupine River before giving birth, an estimated 15,000 newborncalves drowned, being too small and weak to swim (Gemmil, personal communication). In essence, the Porcupine caribou herd may serve as the \"canary in the coal mine\" for the healthof the Arctic ecosystem. Finally, and ironically, global warming is likely to cause problems even for the oil companies themselves. The thawingof permafrost adds to the cost of road, bridge, and pipeline construction and maintenance (Steiner 2001). More volatile and unpredictable weather at sea will jeopardize offshoredrilling installations and possibly lead to more spills andaccidents. Inevitably, these costs will be passed on to consum- ers, even while their use of petrochemicals\u2014regardless ofwhere these originate\u2014worsens global warming in a vicious cycle. As Gemmil has observed, global climate change itself is a symptom of the bigger problem that people are depleting theEarth's resources too fast (Lurie 2001: 16). In the last analysis, the path to both national security and a healthy environment leads away from fossil fuel depen-dency and toward reliance on energy sources that are renew- able, decentralized, and less vulnerable to political and economic vicissitudes or terrorist attack. By contrast, ifnational security concerns lead Americans to aggravate global warming by despoiling the environment, \"the tragedy of September 11\"\u2014as one ecologist has argued\u2014\"may beamplified many times over\" (Ahl 2001).

What is often unrealized and unreported however, is theeffect of the transition to game farming on farm workers who still reside on the affected land. This paper traces the tensions that exist between white landowners and/or managers, and black farm work-ers. It questions the applicability of current legal statutes aimed at providing security of tenure for farm workers. It examines potential solutions to the impasse reached between landowners and farmworkers. It stresses the need, due to the politically sensitive issue of land and land restitution in South Africa, for an equitable solution that provides security of tenure for farm workers, along with accessto the various sacred sites within the game farming landscape, while allowing a compromise to be reached that is acceptable to the landowners. Introduction ____________________ The goal of the ongoing research initiative from which this paper is drawn is to investigate the impact that changes inprivate farming strategies are having on farm workers in the Bushmans River area of the Eastern Cape. Although com- mercial farming has decreased considerably in the areasince the early 1990s, current changes in the region revolve primarily around the development of commercial game farming, most notably for trophy hunting. The potential ofgame farming for ecotourism and the associated benefits of employment, capital generation, and infrastructure devel- opment have seen the creation of a large number of privategame farms between Grahamstown and Port Elizabeth. What is often unreported and unrealized, however, is the effect that this transition to commercial game farming ishaving on former Xhosa farm workers who still reside on the affected land.Contested Rights: Impacts of Game Farming on Farm Workers in the Bushmans River Area Kelly Luck Zweliyanyikima Vena The tensions that exist between landowners and/or man- agers and farm workers have been identified as revolvingaround a number of key issues: security of tenure and residency rights, access to water and grazing land, stock restrictions, housing provision, and access to grave sites andother sites of cultural significance (chief here being certain water pools and riparian zones considered to be inhabited by ancestors and that are essential components in both tradi-tional and Christian oriented family rituals). Through a discussion of the current legal position of farm workers in South Africa, an examination of the economicsituation of farm workers, an explanation of the security concerns of farmers, as well as through the use of empirical case studies, this paper analyzes the tensions that existbetween farm workers and landowners and/or managers. It discusses attempts at tacit eviction of farm workers by landowners. It addresses the question of the need for accessto the landscape by farm workers to ensure their social and spiritual well being, and finally examines a possible solution to the situation of farm workers and game farms. Economic Concerns of Farm Workers _______________________ The economic implications of game farming for farm workers revolves around their inability to secure a livelihooddue to unemployment and certain residential and livestock restrictions. Game farming demands a different kind of labor force than that associated with crop and livestockfarming. This has resulted in a large number of retrench- ments. Following this, most farm workers rely on seasonal jobs and members of the family who draw pensions anddisability grants. Seasonal work on chicory farms yields an average of 10 Rand (approximately $1) per day. Farm work- ers are therefore severely economically disadvantaged. Forthose farm workers with rights to remain on the land, the loss of income and rations makes the possession of stock a vital necessity for survival. The keeping of stock and theaccess to sacred sites within the game farm allow for contin- ued practice of various traditional and religious rites. These serve to ensure the spiritual and social well-being of theaffected people. Security Concerns of Farmers_____ Farm killings are a national problem. Accounts of farm killings in the Eastern Cape are common in the media. Theseattacks on both farmers and farm workers have generated a86 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Luck and Vena Contested Rights: Impacts of Game Farming on Farm Workers in the Bushmans River Area feeling of apprehension amongst the Province's farming community. A number of farmhouses in the Bushmans Riverarea have been burgled in recent months. It is therefore understandable that farmers would seek to secure them- selves through restricting access to their property. TheGovernment has allowed farmers to erect boom gates as a means of ensuring their safety. What must ultimately be understood is that it is often not the farm workers on the property who are responsible for the growing number of farm attacks. It is usually other people in the area, or those from further afield. It is therefore in theinterests of landowners to ensure that they are on good terms with the farm workers on their land. These people will then have a vested interest in protecting the land andensuring that it is free from outside interference. Existing Legal Protection for Farm Workers _______________________ Farm workers in the Eastern Cape have a long docu- mented history of inconsistent working conditions and a lack of adequately protected legal rights. Influx control and theabsence of trade union organization has resulted in low wages and limited means of legal protection from human rights violations and work related abuses (Antrobus 1984;Cocks and Kingwell 1998; Manona 1988). The current gov- ernment has attempted to improve the situation of farm workers through the implementation of the Extension ofSecurity of Tenure Act 62 of 1997 (ESTA). ESTA provides for stringent procedures when a landowner, or person in charge of the land, intends to evict residents. The would-be evictorhas to make an application in writing to a magistrate statinghis reason for eviction. While a farm worker's right of residence may be terminated on any lawful ground, the process must be equitable, fair, and in accordance with thevarious provisions, as laid out in the Act. Furthermore, the Act extends additional protection to those \"long-term occu- piers\" who have resided on the land for a period of 10 yearsand have reached the age of 60. Despite this, the National Land Committee (NLC) acknowledges ...that although offering limited rights, [ESTA] has been demonstrated to be woefully inadequate in securing real tenure rights for farm dwellers (NLC Annual Report 1999-2000:23). The ineffectiveness of the Act results from its inability to protect the tenancy rights of the dependents of household heads once they die (dependents may be legally evicted 12months after the death of the household head), as well as its inability to ensure the residential security of short-term occupiers. Beyond the above, farm workers are often uninformed about the existence of the Act, something which has led to attempts at tacit eviction because once people leave the landthey lose all associated rights to it. Such evictions and retrenchments have reached alarming proportions in recent years. Downsizing in existing farming operations, and gamefarming, has led to landlessness, unemployment, growing shack settlements in neighboring towns, and livestock over- population on urban commonages.Legal protection as it currently stands extends to securing residency rights for long-term occupiers, but does not pro-vide for the protection of those aspects of the landscape that are identified by farm workers as sacred and therefore essential for the continued practice of religious rites. Al-though there is a strong international call through organiza- tions such as the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD-UNCED), the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Popula-tions (WGIP), and the Working Group on Traditional Re- source Rights (WGTRR), for the recognition of indigenous knowledge and the need for its preservation and protection(Gray 1997), the preservation of and access to sacred sites is not something that is legally enforceable in South Africa. Farm workers have a strong affiliation with the surroundinglandscape, due in many cases to long-term residency and the existence of family graves. There is also a strong identifica- tion with various sacred sites within the landscape and thearticulation of a need for their protection. The two case studies discussed in this paper are taken from one research site along the Bushmans River. Mr.Engelbrecht (names of individual farmers, landowners, and farm workers have been changed) is the South African director and a 20-percent shareholder of a newly establishedgame farm. Mr. Engelbrecht is in partnership with a number of Americans with a long established history of game farm- ing and trophy hunting in America. The partnership hasbought six adjacent farms along the river, which are being consolidated to form a game farm. There are 19 farm worker families in residence on three of the purchased farms Case 1: Attempts at Tacit Eviction Tacit evictions, through such measures as the imposition of severe water restrictions, lack of access to farms for farmworkers, and stock restrictions, are a common reality as certain landowners attempt to force their workers to leave voluntarily, thereby rendering null and void their responsi-bilities as laid out in ESTA. These responsibilities include the stipulation that if farm workers are evicted or re- trenched, a settlement offer must be secured that will allowfor the construction of housing in a new locality that is of equal standard to that occupied in the place of former employment. In many cases, the advent of game farming andtrophy hunting, which heightens the danger for resident farm workers, has served as justification by certain land- owners to limit farm worker access to the landscape. Mr. Stewart bought his farm from the Landbank in 1999 after the previous farmer had gone bankrupt. The farm was later purchased in November 2000, along with five otherproperties in the area, by an American investment group for the purpose of establishing a game farm for trophy hunting. Mr. Stewart negotiated a usufruct right, which allowed him to remain in residence and run his cattle in a specified area of the farm. When Mr. Stewart took over management of the farm in 1999, he imposed cattle restrictions of two animals per family. Although cattle restrictions are often placed on farm workers (Cocks and Kingwell 1998), the previous owner hadnot imposed any restrictions. The lack of livestock restric- tions being replaced by these new stringent restrictions could set a precedent that could be detrimental to farmUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 87Luck and Vena Contested Rights: Impacts of Game Farming on Farm Workers in the Bushmans River Area workers. Only three of the six resident families have stock, but of these, all have animals in excess of the limit imposedby Mr. Stewart. The farm workers informed Mr. Stewart that they could not abide by the restrictions, as they needed the stock to ensure their economic well-being. Mr. Stewartthen implemented a system in which stockowners had to pay 20 Rand (approximately $2) a month per full-grown animal for grazing, vetting, and dipping. Sometime later, he isreported to have informed the farm workers of his intention to personally sell all of their animals and hire a truck to collect them. Such actions and threats can be seen asattempts to force farm workers to leave the land and settle elsewhere. More seriously, Mr. Stewart imposed severe water restric- tions on the farm workers living on his property. The farm contains two dams: one for human consumption and one for livestock use. There is also a borehole in close proximity tothe main farmhouse. He has consistently denied access to the dam with water fit for human consumption. In July 2001, during a public meeting between Mr. Engelbrecht, the SouthAfrican Manager of the game farm; Mr. Stewart's son, who acted as interpreter; Mr. Bonda, a representative of an agricultural NGO; and the farm workers, Mr. Stewart's sondefended the blocking off of the dam by saying it was in response to the farm workers, who had left certain farm gates open and let their own cattle move freely through thesegates. The situation has yet to be resolved. Meanwhile, the farm workers approached a neighboring farmer and re- quested permission to draw water from his dam. The requestwas granted. The farmhouse that Mr. Stewart occupies is situated just off the main driveway leading to his farm and one of the otherfarms within the game farm. The gate leading to Mr. Stewart'shome is also used to access the remaining driveway to the second farm. Mr. Stewart frequently locks this gate, com- plaining of too much traffic through the farms. The farmworkers are not informed about the locking of the gate and are left without a key, something that severely restricts both their and their visitors' access to the property. While lockingthe gate is understandable, given the incidents of farm attacks discussed earlier in the paper, Mr. Stewart should inform the farm workers and possibly negotiate a situationin which they keep their own key or have access to one. The above case illustrates an active attempt on the part of the landowner, or in this case occupier, to make life difficultfor the resident farm workers. Although many of the dis- cussed actions took place prior to the onset of the game farm, such attempts have escalated now that the game farm isbeing constructed. Both Mr. Stewart and his son have given assistance to Mr. Engelbrecht, and frequently oversee the still fledgling operation while he is away with clients at othermore established hunting sites. These actions constitute an attempt on the part of Mr. Stewart to tacitly evict those people resident on his land, all of whom were resident beforehis arrival. Case 2: Sacred Sites Within the Game Farming Landscape Sacred sites refer to specific areas considered by the local people to be places within the landscape where their ances-tors reside (Hirsch 1995). The Xhosa farm workers andmembers of the larger community identify three such locali- ties: the water, the grassland, and the forest. Each localityis believed to contain ancestral spirits, the most powerful being the river people ( abantu bomlambo) who reside in certain identifiable 1931). Access to these sites is considered vital for the continued well-being of the community. Family rituals areoften conducted at the various river and forest sites to ensure agricultural success, health, fertility, and good fortune. Di- viners and their apprentices also make use of certain pools, revealed to them in their dreams, for training purposes. Alongside the traditional, indigenous-oriented use of the various sacred sites within the landscape, local AfricanZionist Christian, farm-based congregations make use of the sacred pools for full submersion baptisms. This ritual is a definitive step for adult churchgoers, as it marks their fullentry and acceptance into the congregation. The strong influence of indigenous African beliefs within the African independent/indigenous churches (Maboea 1994; Oosthuizenand others 1996), which view the healing energy of the church as converted ancestral/traditional energy, has culti- vated a respect for the landscape which parallels that felt bytraditionalists. It is pertinent to point out at this stage that a respect for the landscape arises out of an awareness of the need to showthe \"proper\" respect to the ancestors. As stressed in Bernard (this proceedings), this involves an ecological ethos of protec- tion and preservation of sacred sites, as environmentaldegradation or disturbance of any sort will result in the ancestors abandoning the sacred site. Mr. Menzi and his brother, Mr. Sol Menzi, are both former farm workers. Mr. Menzi is a resident of Mr. Stewarts farm,and Mr. Sol Menzi lives on a nearby farm that has been turned over to the people through the government purchas- ing the land from the previous owner. Mr. Sol Menzi's wife developed a rash on her arms and back. Initially she approached the local herbalist and Zionist priest, Mr. Zenani, for advice. Mr. Zenani prescribed acourse of treatment. When this failed to bring relief, Mr. Zenani suggested she be taken to the local clinic. The medication offered by the clinic did not bring any reliefeither. Mr. Zenani then suggested she be taken to a healer, Mr. Zenani's niece, who was in the area performing a ritual for clients. During the divination session, she revealed thatthe rash was in fact caused by the ancestors, and was an outward sign that the family needed to purify itself. The healer advocated the performance of a river ritual. Thiswould involve the seclusion of the family, with the imposi- tion of certain food taboos, and the offering of gifts, by a chosen representative to the ancestors at a sacred pool. It is pertinent to point out at this juncture that these rites of passage were conducted in the past on an annual basis. Rituals involve not only the religious ceremony itself, but theprovision of food and beer for ritual participants and guests, and the payment of the healer for his or her services. The significant cost of performing such rituals has resulted in asituation where they are often neglected. It is believed that the neglecting of such rituals may result in ancestral dis- pleasure, as is evident by Mrs. Sol Menzi's rash. It is also important amongst the Xhosa that river rituals be performed at sites associated with the family, as it is believed that the88 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Luck and Vena Contested Rights: Impacts of Game Farming on Farm Workers in the Bushmans River Area family ancestors reside in certain pools near where they lived in their earthly lives. Familial association with a par- ticular site is usually dependent on long-term occupancy in an area. In the past, this has resulted in farm workers ap- proaching their employers, or adjacent landowner, depending on the location of the neares t sacred pool. Increasingly, how- ever, it is game farm managers who need to be approached in respect to the performance of ritual. A detailed discussion of the ritual, and the symbolism of rebirth and renewal involved, is beyond the scope and theme of this paper. What is important to stress is the need foraccess to these sites within the landscape to ensure both the spiritual and social well-being of the people involved. South Africa, unlike Australia, has no sacred site protec- tion laws to ensure access to and use of the various water, forest, and grassland sites. Many farmers are sensitive to the need of the people to access the various identified sites ontheir land. If timely requests are made, permission is usu- ally granted. In some cases, farm workers report setting aside a piece of the slaughtered animal (when ritual sacrificewas involved) for the farmer and his family to secure good relations between the two parties. It has been suggested by some local Afri can National Congress (current ruling gov- ernmental party) counselors that this system be encouraged to establish rapport between farm workers and game farm owners. Sharing the meat of a sacrificial animal is a strongsymbolic gesture of social affiliation and respect. The ecological ethic of many traditional cosmologies, as mentioned above, ensures respect for the site and therebypreservation of the landscape. The presence of the ancestors is in fact indicated by the presence of various animals and birds associated with the water (otters, fish, birds), theforest (monkeys, mongoose), and the grassland (mongoose,hare) (Hirst 1990). By supporting these attitudes of respect for the landscape, pollution and degradation of such sites may be avoided. Access to such sites is vital for the spiritualwell-being of farm workers and therefore cannot be avoided. Although landowners hold legitimate concerns of pollution of sites, the promotion of and empathy for traditional ideolo-gies may well prevent this. Potential Solutions to the Problem__________________ The Extension of Security of Tenure Act is aimed at farm workers on farms still under production or those left fallow. It could subsequently be argued that game farming and theland on which it is conducted require additional legislation. Because of the restrictive nature of game farming in relation to stock numbers, residential security, and access to sacredsites, current government initiatives to protect the rights of farm workers are inadequate. A possible solution to the problem of a restriction to individual livelihoods, viewed as favorable by a number of farm workers, is the allocation of land adjacent to or on the periphery of game and hunting zones. The purchasing of thisland, if not already held by the game farm, is potentially facilitated through settlement offers made by the landown- ers to the farm workers, and by ESTA grants afforded by theDepartment of Land Affairs. Some landowners are exploring this option and are seeking ways in which the farm workersmay benefit through their engagement in cultural and ecotourism or agri-villages. Such endeavors should be com- mended and supported by all who are seeking a satisfactory resolution of the problem and a means whereby the benefits of game and ecotourism can be shared with affected communities. An initiative, which involves the farm workers from the first two case studies, is far from finalized. Mr. Engelbrecht, the Director of the game farm under discussion, has identi-fied a potential site outside of the game farm. The process is, however, hampered by a number of factors, including the fact that the transfer of ownership from the previous farmerto Mr. Engelbrecht has yet to be successfully finalized. Although access to the various sacred water and forest sites within the game farm and burial rights have been success-fully secured, the size of the allocated land is still under discussion. Mr. Engelbrecht has agreed to give ownership of the land to the farm workers by giving individual title deedsto household heads for their residential plot and establish- ing communal grazing land for the stock. This will provide residential security for farm workers and their dependents,as well as a certain amount of security for Mr. Engelbrecht, as it ensures the proximity of people with a vested interest in the protection of his land. A number of the farm workershave expressed their desire to leave the confines of the game farm due to the restrictions and dangers (the eventual introduction of predators and hunting) it imposes. Stillothers have articulated their plans for the land in question (grazing land for stock, as well as arable land for potato and mealie [corn] production). What remains to be investigatedand finalized is the role of the government in terms of housing and agricultural assistance. Conclusions____________________ The situation faced by farm workers resident on land set aside for game farming and trophy hunting is complex.Attempted farm worker evictions and the need for the performance of ritual, as well as the economic implications of the move to game farming for farm workers, have shownthe need for reconciliation between farm workers and land- owners, not least because of the security this would provide landowners, considering the potentially volatile nature ofland restitution issues in Southern Africa. Values attached to the landscape by farm workers are due in part to their long residence in the area, as well as theircosmological orientation that promotes ecologically sound practices. The ineffectiveness of current legislation govern- ing farm workers in South Africa demonstrates the need foradditional legislation as well as the need for landowners to act in such a way as to secure the tenure of farm workers and to assist in providing generally poor, uneducated, and unem-ployed people with sustainable livelihoods.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service,Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014Recreationists' understanding of subsistence in Gates of the Arctic National Park (GAAR) was examined using StructuralDevelopmental Theory. This perspective contends that people uni- versally differentiate three major domains of social issues\u2014moral, conventional, and personal\u2014by how they reason about them. Sev-enty-five percent of respondents understood subsistence use of GAAR as a moral issue. Further, respondents maintained conflict- ing moral judgments when justice, welfare, and naturalism valuesassociated with subsistence were juxtaposed with human and nonhuman welfare values associated with wilderness. The high incidence of conflicting judgments suggests the existence of conflict,or cognitive disequilibrium, between values associated with subsis- tence and values associated with wilderness. Respondents attempted to coordinate their judgments in ways that can be described asoverriding, contradictory, and contextual. No respondents had hier- archical integrated understandings of subsistence and wilderness values. Implications of these findings are discussed. Introduction ____________________ Gates of the Arctic National Park & Preserve (GAAR), one of the 10 park units created by the Alaskan National InterestLands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980, was established with a management mandate to preserve wilderness values that is unparalleled in any other U.S. National Park (USDI/NPS 1986). This mandate, however, must be understood in the context of the other purposes for which the park was established, allowed uses, and prior existing rights. GAARand other National Parks created by ANILCA, unlike parks in the lower forty-eight United States, allow for the continu- ation of \"customary and traditional\" subsistence uses byrural Alaskan residents of wild, renewable resources for direct personal or family consumption (Willis 1985). Although the allowance of subsistence in GAAR diverges from previous legislative definitions of wilderness, the hu- man presence and subsistence culture in the park was initially thought to complement the wilderness purposes ofthe park (USDI/NPS 1986). Such a complimentary relation- ship would successfully harmonize the GAAR management mandates to allow for the continuation of subsistence and toUnderstanding Wilderness and Subsistence in Gates of the Arctic National Parkand Preserve, Alaska Chad E. Dear \"provide for the enjoyment\" of the wilderness qualities of the park. The actual relationship between the subsistence cul- ture and the wilderness purposes of GAAR, however, has not been adequately studied and is, therefore, not yet wellunderstood. Understanding recreationists' perspectives re- garding subsistence in GAAR is important for two primary reasons: (1) to determine if the aforementioned GAAR man-agement mandates conflict, and (2) to empirically examine the influence interactions with subsistence may have on psychological developmental aspects of recreationists' un-derstanding of nature, indigenous people, the human role in wilderness, and the human-nature relationship. The pur- pose of this study, therefore, is to identify, classify andanalyze recreationists' understanding of subsistence in the context of their experience in GAAR. Theoretical Framework___________ Such an analysis requires an approach that accounts for the complexities inherent in the coordination of the social-psychological constructions of wilderness and subsistence. In other words, recreationists' behaviors and reactions to subsistence can not be taken at face value because suchbehaviors and reactions are underlain by complex patterns of understanding and active efforts to balance personal judgments about the issues the situation in GAAR provokes. Structural Developmental Theory, the perspective em- ployed in this study, explains human understanding through the nature and functions of psychological structures(Ginsburg and Opper 1969). These structures are comprised of the various ideas people develop and maintain regarding social issues. Structures also include patterns of thinking, orschemas, that situate ideas within more or less well-orga- nized wholes. Ideas are organized within these schemas through the process of reasoning about social issues. Ideasand schemas regarding social issues can be differentiated depending on the perceived moral, conventional, or personal nature of issues (Turiel 1998). In other words, if a personthinks morally about an issue, they will employ different ideas and reason about the issue differently than a person who thinks about the same issue as go verned by conventional or personal considerations. Specific qualities of individuals' judgments and supporting justifications are the criteria for determining into which \"social domain\" the individual con- ceptualizes an issue. Identification, classification, and analysis of ideas and schemas within moral, conventional, and personal socialdomains provide a basis for understanding the interrela- tions between thought, action, and cultural context (Kahn 1999). The premise here is that forms of reasoning make adifference in how different possibilities are weighed andUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 91Dear Understanding Wilderness and Subsistence in Gates of the Arctic... calculated by an individual. The link between thought, action, and cultural context is complicated, however, by thepsychological fact that people develop and simultaneously maintain multiple and, at times, conflicting judgments re- garding the same issue (Turiel and others 1991). Such casesmay result in judgment/action inconsistencies. Turiel and others (1991) note that judgment/action incon- sistencies require explanations that take judgment coordi-nation into account. Judgment coordination occurs when an individual's experience simultaneously activates psycho- logical structures supporting conflicting judgments. Thesestructures, which were not brought into relation before, are forced into a psychological relationship. The relationship established through judgment coordination generally in-volves a compromising of structures. Identifying, classify- ing, and analyzing ideas and schemas related to an issue within moral, conventional, and personal domains aid inunderstanding an individual's or group's progress through the process of judgment coordination. Finally, hierarchical integration, or structural develop- ment, happens when previously held psychological struc- tures are, through interaction with the social and physical world, transformed into more comprehensive and adequateways of understanding the world and acting upon it. This process involves the development of a new understanding of conflicting values that preserves the integrity of both values,but transforms their relationship from one of conflict to one of integration under some superordinate concept. This pro- cess is distinct from judgment coordination in that it doesnot involve a compromising of judgments, but instead involves an integration of judgments at a hierarchically elevated level. Methods _______________________ Semistructured interviews including hypothetical sce- narios describing interactions between recreational and subsistence use of GAAR were posed to GAAR recreationists. Qualitative methods were employed to (1) identify recreation-ists' initial and secondary judgments and justifications of the issue; (2) classify respondents' initial judgments within moral, conventional, or personal social domains; and (3) ana- lyze the coordination efforts between recreationists' mul- tiple and conflicting judgments and justifications. The respondent group was composed of 24 males and 6 females ranging from 19 to 66 years of age with an average age of 42. Seventy-six percent had received or were working on four-year college degrees. Forty-six percent had attainedor were working on graduate or professional degrees. Forty- eight percent of respondents identified their homes as being in urban areas, 30 percent in suburban areas, and 22 percentin rural areas. Thirty-three percent of respondents were from the contiguous United States east of the Rocky Moun- tains, 26 percent west of the Rocky Mountains, 22 percentwere from Alaska, and 18 percent from Europe. Ninety- three percent of respondents identified themselves as being Caucasian. Respondents had been planning their trips toGAAR for an average of 7.5 months.Findings _______________________ Sixty-one percent of respondents were accepting of subsis- tence in GAAR and conceptualized the issue as moral. Fourteen percent were not accepting of subsistence in GAAR and also conceptualized the issue as moral. Justifications ofboth positive and negative moral judgments referred to concepts of justice (rights and fairness), welfare (of humans and/or nature), and naturalism (perceived harmonious andrespectful relationship between subsistence user and na- ture). T wenty-five percent of respondents were accepting of subsistence in GAAR and conceptualized the issue asconventional. A broad finding of this study is that respondents' psycho- logical structures associated with wilderness generally de-veloped exclusively of psychological structures associated with subsistence, and vice versa. In other words, there was a lack of coordination between wilderness and subsistencestructures. These structures may have developed separately because they were never before forced together through experience. While previous experience may have rarely done so, the scenarios presented to respondents in interviews did simul- taneously activate recreationists' psychological structuresregarding wilderness and subsistence. Questions in the interview forced respondents to reason about the issue of subsistence use of GAAR Wilderness in a way that connectsthese previously disconnected structures. Respondents' at- tempts to reason about the hypothetical scenario resulted in respondents maintaining multiple and conflicting judgmentsin the interview. The high percentage of individual respon-dents who maintained conflicting judgments suggests the existence of conflict, or cognitive disequilibrium, between values associated with subsistence and values associatedwith wilderness. The psychological discomfort associated with states of disequilibrium led respondents to attempt to resolve or coor- dinate their conflicting judgments. Respondents were identi- fied as coordinating their judgments in ways that can be described as overriding, contradictory, and contextual. Each major coordination type and subtype, as well as their impli- cations, are described below. In many cases, individuals coordinated their conflicting judgments in multiple ways. Judgment Coordinations Overriding \u2014In overriding coordinations, a moral judg- ment supporting subsistence trumped conflicting secondary judgments supporting wilderness values. The 37 percent ofrespondents classified in this category lacked a developed moral understanding of wilderness values. This allowed the well-established moral content and structure of respon-dents' judgments supporting subsistence to override emerg- ing, still tentative, and not as widely shared judgments supporting wilderness values. For example, Doug, a 55-year-old from New Jersey, stated that an interaction with subsistence in GAAR would make his experience \"less of a wilderness experience, but in the kind of situations we are92 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Dear Understanding Wilderness and Subsistence in Gates of the Arctic... talking about its okay...that is part of the balancing of interests that I'm prepared to accept and that I believe isjust.\" The moral value Doug associates with subsistence, what he \"believes is just,\" overrode values he associated with wilderness e xperience. Doug's judgment coordination, as well as others in this category, may be explained by the general acknowledgment that social justice moral schemas are much stronger in society than wilderness/biocentricones. The lack of strength of wilderness values also may have to do with the tendency of these subjects to frame wilderness values as mostly grounded in self-interested referencesrelating to \"wilderness experience\"\u2014an argument perceived as much weaker than social justice as grounds for moral justification. The implication of this finding is that the subsistence community, as well as land managers, can rely on a signifi- cant amount of support for subsistence use of GAAR. Over-riding coordinations, however, foreclose any attempts at integration between wilderness and subsistence values. Recreationists' support of subsistence, therefore, is at theexpense of wilderness values. Contradictory \u2014In contradictory coordinations, two con- tradictory judgments were simultaneously upheld. The 25 percent of respondents classified in this category conceptu- alized the issue of subsistence in wilderness as being conven-tional rather than moral. Psychologically structuring the issue as conventional allowed these respondents to maintain contradictory judgments because their final judgment ulti-mately depended upon the social norms of the area estab- lished by custom, laws, and regulations. This group of recreationists does not need to be persuaded to acceptsubsistence for any reason besides the fact that there is a lawallowing subsistence use of GAAR. Contextual \u2014In contextual coordinations, respondents' judgments depended on the specific context, as specified by them. Four major types were identified: ecological impact, naturalism, race, and frequency of interaction. Each contex-tual coordination subtype, as well as its implications, is detailed below. Eighty-three percent of respondents' support for subsis- tence use of GAAR was contingent upon subsistence users' impact on what was perceived as the more important moral value of ecological health. If subsistence was determined todegrade the ecological health of the environment, then subsistence would not be acceptable. For example, Eric, a 19- year-old from England, claimed that he would supportsubsistence \"as long as the other concerns for the ecology of the area...are being met.\" If this category of respondents is added to the 14 percent of respondents who were initially notaccepting of subsistence for reasons including ecological impact, then nearly all (97 percent) respondents can be understood to value ecological welfare when set in competi-tion with justice, welfare, and naturalism values associated with subsistence. The implication of this finding is that if recreational and subsistence activities occur in the samegeographic area, and psychological conflict is to be kept at a minimum, perceived environmental impact must be kept low. The greater the perceived environmental impact, thegreater the difficulty of eventually integrating wilderness and subsistence values.Seventy percent of respondents made contextual coordi- nations referring to naturalism, or a perceived harmoniousand respectful relationship with nature. In such cases, respondents supported subsistence; however, this support was contingent upon subsistence users' ability to exemplifya harmonious and respectful relationship with nature. Recreationists required that subsistence users conduct their activities according to an environmental ethic that, in mostcases, was assumed to be part of the subsistence culture. Recreationists' support for subsistence was withdrawn if this ethic was not perceived. This pattern of support\u2014and withdrawal of support\u2014for subsistence, depending on respondents' perceptions of local peoples' relationships with nature, is characteristic of thestereotype of the \"ecologically noble savage\" (Buege 1996). This requirement of \"authenticity,\" Buege claims, is oppres- sive in that it forces Natives to conform to non-Nativeconceptions of how they should live and relate to nature. Very few respondents overtly acknowledged that the right to self-determination\u2014a prominent justification supportingsubsistence in the park\u2014contradicts and could possibly override the naturalistic reasoning pattern described above. Respondents' support of subsistence was also dependent on race. Thirty-three percent of respondents were less likely or unwilling to judge subsistence acceptable if the subsis- tence user was a non-Native. For example, Dave, a 47-year-old Hispanic from California, claimed that \"if a non-Native person...had the right to [subsist in the park] through...a government permit or something like that then I would bemore adverse to that than if it was a person who through family generations acquired that right.\" The ANILCA mandate \"to provide the opportunity for rural resident people engaged in a subsistence way of life to continue to do so\" (emphasis added) is a colorblind mandate (Willis 1985). A significant portion of subsistence activities in and around GAAR is undertaken by non-Native ruralresidents. The condition of race described by this group of respondents reveals a potential for increased conflict be- tween recreational users and non-Native subsistence usersof GAAR. Frequency of interaction was the final major type of contextual coordination identified. Thirty percent of respon-dents claimed that their support for subsistence would deteriorate with increased encounters with subsistence or signs of subsistence activities. The implication of this find-ing is that conflict between recreation and subsistence users of GAAR could be avoided by regulating recreational visita- tion to keep frequency of contact with subsistence low. Ifhigh frequency of contact is unavoidable, stronger justifica- tions supporting subsistence may be needed to minimize conflict. A less prominent, but interesting, contextual coordination referred to a distinction between subsistence being accept- able in the park and subsistence being acceptable in respon-dents' experience in the park. In other words, subsistence is acceptable, but \"Not In My Wilderness Experience\" (NIMWE). The enormous size of GAAR, coupled with the fact thatrecreational and subsistence activities generally occur in separate areas of the park, suggests that a large majority of visitors to GAAR never see subsistence activity or signs of it.These physical realities currently allow for the continuationUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 93Dear Understanding Wilderness and Subsistence in Gates of the Arctic... of NIMWE thinking. The finding that NIMWE thinking was apparent in at least 17 percent of respondents suggeststhat a partitioning of the park through a zoning scheme, where recreationists would know that they have a lesser chance of encountering subsistence, would be accepted andappreciated by this segment of recreationists. The separa- tion of users or perpetuation of NIMWE thinking would not, however, contribute to a more adequate understanding ofthe unresolved conflicts in recreationists' understanding of subsistence in GAAR. In other words, this practice would avoid psychological and social conflict rather than attempt-ing to resolve conflict. Toward an Integrated Understanding of Wilderness andSubsistence Values______________ Respondents generally lacked the ability to coherently reason about or understand subsistence use of GAAR. Through the interview process, many respondents showed signs that they were becoming aware of the inadequacy oftheir understanding of the issue. This awareness of their inadequacy of understanding, or state of disequilibrium, led in this case to judgment coordination efforts. Such effortsinvolved certain values being maintained at the expense of other values. Disequilibrium may also instigate the develop- ment of new and more adequate psychological structuresthat preserve the integrity of both values, but transform their relationship from one of conflict to one of integration under some superordinate concept (that is, hierarchicalintegration). The presence of disequilibrium, and the subsequent po- tential for hierarchical integration, represents an opportu- nity to move closer to the goal of reducing conflict betweenwilderness and subsistence values in GAAR and other parks and protected areas around the world. Left unmanaged, recreationists' personal experiences, such as actually en-countering subsistence in GAAR or other parks, might activate developmental processes or it might not; existing biases and contradictions might prevail. Without presenta-tion of balanced views regarding this issue, such as was presented in interviews, exposure to subsistence in GAAR or other \"wild\" areas may only reinforce and elaborate existingconflicting understandings of wilderness and subsistence. The opportunity for the National Park Service, or other parties with a vested interest in the continued preservationof the physical and cultural values inherent in GAAR, is to facilitate the developmental process of creating new under- standings of wilderness, subsistence, and their relationshipin the park. Rec ognizing that the active mental life of visitors is critical in their experience is a first step in this process. Recreationists are not passive receptors easily molded by pamphlet-style educational efforts. Recreationists' response to these or any other informational medium is determinedin large part by their existing ideas and schemas regarding an issue. Their existing understanding is not idiosyncrati-cally structured, but generally follows the various patterns revealed in this study. Specifically, recreationists are in- clined to identify and reason about conflicting moral ideasinvolved in interactions between recreational and subsis- tence use of the park. In this sense, wilderness recreationists are moral philosophers potentially seeking advanced forms ofreasoning. Effective efforts to influence recreationists' judgments and actions regarding subsistence use of GAAR and otherparks and protected areas involves understanding and ac- counting for the deliberate, systematic, and philosophical nature of recreationists' thought. To the extent that manag-ers can understand, work with, and employ methods that more directly engage peoples' psychological structures, the more precise and sure they can be about the effects ofparticular managerial interventions. Understanding recreationists' thought content and pro- cesses relating to subsistence are also relevant beyondimmediate management concerns. Such understanding can add clarity to the current contentious discourse regarding the idea of wilderness and its ability to appropriately ad-dress issues of past and present indigenous human cultures on wild lands. In this regard, a structural developmental approach to what has been termed by some, \"The Great NewWilderness Debate\" (Callicott and Nelson 1998), may illus- trate the disequilibrium many in the conservation philoso- phy community are experiencing. Such an approach mayalso trace our psychological progress toward a more ad- equate and integrated understanding of wilderness, subsis- tence, and the human role in nature.

A new challenge emerged for the National Park Service in Alaska and may serve as a model for \"reconnecting\" indigenous people with parklands and other wild lands of America. While not an agreed upon national priority or right, \"reconnection\" efforts may be stimulated through the observation of the successes in Alaska and equip thenext generation of administrators, legislators, and leaders with new tools to engage the international debate over where man fits into the landscape and how we are part of parks and wild places. The Organic Act of 1916, which established the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) to manage a national system ofparks and monuments, provided an early conceptual foun- dation of resource preservation coupled with visitor use. The Antiquities Act of 1906 had already established an impor-tant set of mission values for national monuments defined as\"objects of historic and scientific interest,\" but never men- tioned use of the areas. Over the years, the \"system of parks\" and the \"national service\" mandated to manage it has evolved, matching society's interest and emphasis on the continuing evolution of protection of our national heritage. Society's view of what \"wildness\" is relative to \"wilder- ness,\" and what Homeland is relative to Wilderness, is also evolving. More frequent than not, native cultures within the \"system of parks\" were not seen by society as part of theparks. Certainly, native cultures within our wilderness units, which were to be \"untrammeled by man,\" were never considered to be part of the landscape or had long beendisplaced through military, legal, or economic actions. In short, the preponderance of the body of law establishing protected landscapes in America excluded native culturesfrom these landscapes, viewing them, in most cases, as some sort of \"interesting artifact\" of the land, necessitating re- moval or continued exclusion in order to avoid marring thescenery. To quote the 1964 Wilderness Act, man now becameLiving Cultures\u2014Living Parks in Alaska: Considering the Reconnection of NativePeoples to Their Cultural Landscapes in Parks and Protected Areas Robert L. Arnberger relegated to the status of a \"visitor who does not remain,\" rather than a harmonious occupant of the land. It was not until passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) in 1980 that an alterna- tive management model for protected landscapes was pre-scribed. The new Alaska park lands created by this environ- mental legislative milestone are clearly an experiment on a grand scale. The 10 new National Parks, preserves, andmonuments, including additions to three prior existing park areas, are the largest, most diverse, and most outstanding park lands yet put into the American park system. Congressalso mandated that traditional uses would be coupled with resource preservation and traditional National Park values. A new vision of management of traditional park values, ofwildness and wilderness, was legislated where man was viewed not as apart from nature, but rather a part of it. It was a view that did not separate man from the land, butrather, joined man's traditional activities with the land. The law also made it clear that park and preserve protection was not meant exclusively for natural and cultural resources\u2014it was extended to people, their lifestyles, and intangibleassociations with the land. A new challenge emerged for the NPS in Alaska: preserve the land and its resources while allowing for the subsistenceharvest of wild resources, which will in turn help to preserve the cultural values of the people using the land. Title VIII of the Act makes it clear that the opportunity for those whotraditionally have used these areas for subsistence purposes will continue to do so and that such use will be the priority consumptive use whenever restrictions on use are neces-sary. The opportunity for those who live in rural Alaska and depend on the land to maintain their subsistence lifestyle was recognized as a major value of these new park areas. While traditional park values were not to be compromised, for the first time a congressional mandate for managing National Park areas recognized the continuum that existswhere people and their uses of the landscape are concerned. Congress recognized that to artificially disrupt this con- tinuum would, in fact, critically alter the very values mostworth preserving in these areas. Congress also recognized the importance of maintaining unimpaired ecosystems and natural and healthy populations of fish and wildlife as a primary requirement to assure the opportunity for continued traditional uses. Consumptive uses, including traditional means of access for subsistence purposes and travel betweenvillages, may continue. It was a view that consumptive resource use by humans could harmonize with the land- scape as long as ecosystems continued in a natural andhealthy state.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2002 95Arnberger Living Cultures\u2014Living Parks in Alaska: Considering the Reconnection of Native Peoples... Importantly, the Act did not distinguish between native indigenous peoples and other rural peoples. However, ruraldemographics in many areas are almost exclusively native Alaskan peoples. How does this \"great experiment\" in Alaska serve as a model for \"reconnecting\" indigenous people withpark lands and other wild lands of America? While most Alaska Natives, by luck or an accident of history, were never forcibly evicted as they were elsewhere, indigenous peoples,by most measures, are not afforded this connection to most park landscapes in the rest of the country. Their \"reconn ection\" is certainly not an agreed upon national priority or right.The historical record is generally one of eviction and culture devaluation, rather than one of connection and valuation. The public debate can be polarized and intense, promisingno easy answers. This is an issue fraught with political, economic, social, and legal challenges. The NPS finds itself placed squarely in the middle of a complex social debate. Itwill present land managers with some of the most important emerging land management issues of the future. Is the collection of eaglets in Wupatki National Monument by the Hopi Indians for religious purposes problematic? When the Mickosuki Indians create and improve a settle- ment in Everglades National Park, are there contentiousissues? When the Timbisha in Death Valley National Park demanded the return of a homeland within the park, did they threaten traditional park values? When the Hualapaiof the Grand Canyon asserted jurisdiction over NPS lands within Grand Canyon National Park, did it challenge ad- ministrators? Did each of these examples create complexlegal and policy challenges? Yes, of course they did, includ- ing challenging the capacity of NPS administrators to find constructive resolution approaches because of an extremelylimited \"toolbox\" of law and policy alternatives. Because ofthese challenges, do we refuse to engage potential solutions and deny cultural connections to homelands that existed before parks were established, or cultural practices thatpredate modern man? Do we relegate \"living cultures\" to the junk pile of \"extinct cultures\" because we choose not to engage the issue and look for possible resolutions? No, ofcourse not\u2014nor is anyone proposing that. Do we exercise care and deliberation, understanding each case, each people, each issue, and understanding that each resolution (if thereis one) may be similar but always different? The affirmative answers are self-evident because these peoples already stand upon our doorstep, knocking on the door of many of ourNational Parks across the nation, demanding back some- thing they have lost. While the record is still evolving, it is clear that the Alaskan experiment establishes a precedent for study and comparison. Alaskans are assured of continued legal, cul- tural, and subsistence connections to the landscape. Ournational conversation about man in wilderness and native homeland versus untrammeled Wilderness has been broad-ened and deepened. That is why ANILCA holds so much promise. Alaska is serving as a laboratory of how indigenous peoples and their cultures remain and are joined with thelandscape\u2014inseparable from it. They are a deeply held and important component of what parks and wild places are. They are not just a collateral value. In fact, the culture joinedwith the land is one and the same value. This model will be needed as the NPS struggles throughout our park system, engaging native peoples and their \"reconnection\" to thelandscapes protected in these units, but frequently lost as traditional cultural landscapes. Just as America presented the world with the first Wilder- ness Act in 1964, perhaps ANILCA can help redefine all peoples' relationship with the land throughout America and perhaps the rest of the world. It may be that the Alaskamodel equips the next generation of administrators, legisla- tors, and leaders with new tools to engage the international debate over where man fits into the landscape and how theyare part of parks and wild places. It may be that the wisdom legislated in Alaska, and the generational struggle to make the law work, will mature a society to honor the fact that manhas always been part of the land. Because we evolved from the land, the land has always been with man. He has carried it with him during the long march through time. The land isnot only in his DNA, but also in his heart and his spirit. If man is to succeed in this endeavor of living on the land, then he cannot be separated from it.

It is anational federal body comprising 13 autonomous sections distrib- uted throughout South Africa, with a national central committee coordinating the Club's national operation. Key activities includemountaineering and rock climbing, search and rescue, securing access to mountains, conservation, and outreach. The MCSA has good linkages with national bodies such as the InternationalMountaineering and Climbing Federation (UIAA) Access and Con- servation and Mountain Protection Commissions. The MCSA's involvement in conservation of the mountain environment includesthe following initiatives: Watchdog function in terms of development proposals and land-use changes in mountain areas in South Africa. Environmental Management Plans for Club properties to pro- tect the wilderness qualities of properties and to educatemembers re garding environmentally friendly behavior in mountains. Environmental Management Systems (according to ISO 14001 EMS guidelines) for sport climbing and mountaineering in the Cape Peninsula National Park, and ongoing conservation efforts to clear invasive alien vegetation and protea atlassing. Public participation regarding local, regional, and national environmental issues potentially affecting mountains and re- lated communities. The MCSA strongly supports initiatives to preserve mountain wilderness areas. Introduction ____________________ The Western Cape Province of South Africa is blessed with great natural beauty. The rugged Cape Fold Mountains areattractive and impressive by any standards. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that shortly before the turn of the 20 th century, some of the region's like-minded inhabitants, who displayed a natural desire to explore this mountainAn NGO's Contribution to Mountain Conservation in South Africa A. Schoon M. Shroyer F. Hunziker environment, decided to vest their activities with some degree of formality, and formed the Mountain Club of SouthAfrica (MCSA). This occurred in 1891, and it is interesting to note that the formation of the MCSA took place at much the same time as other European mountaineering clubs, asthe same needs were being experienced elsewhere. The MCSA is in fact one of the oldest mountaineering clubs in the world. Today the MCSA's membership has grown to over 4,000 members in 13 autonomous sections countrywide, with the largest concentration of members in the Western Cape. TheClub operates as a federal body with a central organization looking after its national and international interests. Due to its modest size, the Club makes use of only very limitedprofessional help and relies largely on voluntary input from its members for its operation. A fine distinction is drawn insofar as the MCSA is a \"mountain club\" rather than purely a \"mountaineering club.\" This broadens the perspective, allowing the Club to partici- pate in most things to do with mountains. While mountain-eering and climbing are, and always have been, the Club'score interests, it also participates in many other mountain- related activities. The objective of this paper is to briefly summarize the MCSA's range of activities, to describe its involvement in activities concerning conservation of the mountain environ- ments in South Africa in greater detail, and to highlightsome typical issues that are relevant to them. International Involvement_________ Like many other sporting bodies, the MCSA experienced a degree of isolation during the apartheid era, manifested inthe difficulties experienced when climbing overseas, par- ticularly in the greater ranges such as the Himalaya and Karakoram. There was also very limited contact with othermountaineering federations, and the MCSA \"missed out\" on very significant steps in the development of mountaineering and climbing that occurred at the time. That changed quite dramatically in the early 1990s when the Royal Dutch Alpine Club and the British Mountaineer- ing Council put the MCSA forward for membership in theWorld Mountaineering and Climbing Federation (UIAA) and the MCSA was elected to that body. With its UIAA membership and the changes that took place in South Africa's political fortunes, the international mountaineering community has gone out of its way to wel- come the MCSA back into its ranks. In terms of mountain-eering and climbing, this has been of im mense benefit to the MCSA due to the opportunities that have been made100 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Schoon, Shroyer, and Hunziker An NGO's Contribution to Mountain Conservation in South Africa avail able to its members. But a further benefit, which was perhaps not at first evident, has been the benefit derived interms of the contact, information, and advice available through working with the UIAA's Commissions, which ad- dress specialized fields such as expeditions, training, medi-cal matters, youth, and safety, among others. The MCSA is presently one of only two mountaineering federations on the African Continent that are members of the UIAA. Activities of the MCSA ___________ To give an overview of the full spectrum of activities in which the MCSA is involved, all its key activities are de- scribed here. These are expanded only where relevant to theobjective of this paper. Mountaineering and Climbing The MCSA has a proud record of mountaineering achieve- ments from expeditions made to mountain ranges outside South Africa's borders. These include many important as-cents of mountains in ranges on the African, North and South American, and Asian Continents and elsewhere. Mountain Club of South Africa members have also exten- sively explored the mountains of the many ranges inside South Africa, where Club members have made most first ascents of the mountains considered to be of major impor-tance. Individual MCSA sections organize frequent Club meets that vary in nature and difficulty from simple hikes to scrambling and kloofing (canyoning). The MCSA's KwaZulu-Natal Section has organized an annual July (winter) Campat various locations in the Drakensberg for the past 80 years. Other MCSA national meets also provide opportunities for members from sections around the country to climb and hiketogether. Besides all these organized meets, members orga- nize many more of their own private excursions. South Africa offers some of the best rock-climbing oppor- tunities to be found anywhere in the world, and both tradi- tional and sport climbing are major activities of MCSA sections. In traditional rock climbing (generally on longermultipitch routes), the leader and other members of the climbing party are protected by clipping the climbing rope into temporary protection (in the form of slings, chocks, andcamming devices called \"friends\") placed over rock projec- tions and in suitable cracks as the climbers proceed, with all of this equipment being removed when no longer required.In sport climbing, the routes are generally shorter and steeper, and protection is afforded by clipping the climbing rope into permanent preplaced anchors drilled into the rock.Unique access and environmental issues relating to sport climbing are addressed elsewhere in this paper. Whereas mountaineering and climbing are essentially noncompetitive recreational activities, one of the more re- cent responsibilities that has evolved from the MCSA's membership of the UIAA is the promotion of competitionclimbing in South Africa. Climbing competitions are held on artificial (often indoor) climbing walls, and results are judged according to the difficulty of the preset routes and thecompetitors' achievements climbing them. A national rank- ing is established, enabling South African climbers to com- pete in international competitions.Search and Rescue In conjunction with other government bodies (such as the police or air force) and the statutory emergency services, theMCSA has over many years offered a highly effective volun- tary mountain search and rescue service to provide assis- tance to hikers and climbers who get lost or suffer accidentsin the mountains. Training and Development The MCSA recognizes the importance of safety in moun- taineering and climbing and has over the years provided training in mountain leadership and in mountaineering andclimbing skills, both for its own members and for nonmem- bers. More recently it has taken the initiative in forming the South African Mountaineering Development and TrainingTrust (MDT), of which it is the chief patron, to formulate and apply training standards. The MDT is now recognized both by the Government and by the tourism industry as the relevantauthority in this field. MDT standards are fully documented and are in the process of being incorporated into the stan- dards set by the Government's qualification authority. The MCSA subscribes to the UIAA ethic contained in its \"International Year of the Mountains 2002 Summit Char- ter\" (UIAA Summit Charter 2002) that everyone should befree to enjoy the natural mountain environment and that mountaineering and climbing contribute to the human spirit and to human endeavor, as freedom sports with human andsocial values. Therefore, it is aware of the importance of providing opportunity to previously disadvantaged commu- nities to use and enjoy South Africa's mountain environmentin a safe and responsible manner. In order to introducemembers of these communities to the mountain environ- ment and to convey a message to them regarding the safety and responsibility aspects relating to going into the moun-tains, as well as the importance of protecting mountains, the larger MCSA sections operate outreach programs. Access and Conservation Probably the single most critical element determining the well-being of our Club's mountaineering and climbing activi-ties in South Africa is the question of maintaining access to the mountains and to other climbing areas (such as river and roadside crags or sea cliffs). Both at sectional and nationallevels, enormous effort is put into ensuring that existing MCSA access arrangements are maintained and, where necessary, new ones are negotiated. The MCSA has over theyears both negotiated access servitudes with landowners and purchased key properties to provide a guarantee of access in perpetuity, particularly in important mountainareas. Mountaineering federations around the world report simi- lar experiences in this regard, continually having to monitorand, where necessary, take action to preserve their mem- bers' access to mountains and climbing crags. Access is inextricably linked to conservation of the mountain environ-ment, and the MCSA clearly recognizes this when dealing with access issues. In an effort to assist its member federa- tions, through the dissemination of information on accessUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 101Schoon, Shroyer, and Hunziker An NGO's Contribution to Mountain Conservation in South Africa and conservation issues, the UIAA through its Access and Conservation Commission is compiling information fromaround the world on the current situation regarding access to mountains and climbing crags. This includes the legal status pertaining to access (and liability of the landowner)and particular access difficulties that exist, as well as the principal conservation issues affecting access. The MCSA has already contributed information to the Commission inthe form of a State of the Nation Report (Shroyer 2001a) setting out the status in South Africa in this connection. In order to retain the wilderness character of the moun- tain properties that it has purchased, the Club has adopted a policy restricting the construction of permanent shelters (mountain huts), encouraging its members to camp instead,making use of tents where necessary. Both on those few properties where shelters have been constructed and on properties without any such \"improvements,\" the MCSAstrives to apply the same environmental principles that it would expect others to apply on similar land elsewhere. In the case of the Club's largest section in Cape Town, a detailed land management plan for the Club's properties is in the process of being drafted and implemented, and it is intended that the same provision will ultimately be appliedto all the Club's properties. The MCSA endeavors to become involved as an interested and affected party for any development proposal in moun-tain areas. Where practically feasible in terms of its re- sources, it adopts a monitoring role on all forms of proposed development that may pose a threat to the mountain envi-ronment, from proposed projects like the Witterivier and Visgat Dams in the Western Cape, to the Mnweni cableway in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg, to major developmentplans in the Magaliesberg. In the case of the Table Mountaincableway upgrade, the MCSA played a proactive role in the public participation process. In terms of one of its prime objectives, the Club strives to initiate and support actions toward preserving and protect- ing the natural beauty and wilderness character of the mountains and toward promoting their effective conserva-tion management. The MCSA's specific goals in this regard are to: Prevent pollution of mountain environments. Maintain biodiversity of mountain ecosystems. Promote the sustainable use of resources. Support integrated environmental management proce- dures for development proposals or changes in land use in mountain environments (this includes environmen-tal impact assessments and public participation). Motivate its own members and the public to conduct all activities in the mountains in an environmentally re-sponsible way. Promote open communication on environmental issues within the MCSA and, where appropriate, between theMCSA and other parties. The MCSA has adopted and strives to apply the UIAA's Environmental Guidelines (2002) in its various activities and actions. Club members serve as Corresponding Members on the Mountain Protection and Access and Conservation Commissions of the UIAA. The MCSA places a high importance on the conservation of South Africa's mountain heritage. The Club's Cape TownSection initiated an active program for the removal of invasive alien plant species in 1945 and has ever sincesteadfastly continued its work, more recently joined by other younger sections in this conservation effort. Club members frequenting remote mountain areas have contributed sig-nificant effort to the recent Protea Atlassing Project in the country. Potential for Change in the Mountain Environment ________ Increase in Number of Users The number of people going into the mountains in South Africa is likely to rise dramatically. Although our mountainsare presently not heavily used, they will become more so. An extreme example is the use of the Western Table on Table Mountain where tourist traffic has increased in a very shortspace of time. We should learn from other nations' experi- ence how to manage these problems, although some of them are certainly unique to our situation. One factor that may be unique to our situation is the likely transition in a large section of our country's population over a period of time from a survival lifestyle to one where peopleare relatively better off and will have the inclination and means to participate more in recreational activities. The MCSA believes that education will be an important consideration in dealing with this increased interest. It is important that people appreciate and understand the moun- tain environment, learning to conserve it, as well as how touse it and enjoy it responsibly and safely. These are funda-mental issues that the MCSA is already trying to address through its outreach programs and will hopefully, in the future, be able to address through the proposed developmentside of the MDT. Invasive Alien Plants The effects of the invasion of alien plant species have had a significant impact on native vegetation on some of South Africa's mountains. Members of our Club possibly appreci-ate more than others the extent of this problem, because they see first hand how these alien infestations are taking hold in some of our remotest areas. While the MCSA and afew other concerned parties have for many years operated plant conservation programs, actively participating in the eradication of alien plants in mountain environments, it isgratifying that there is now national recognition of the threat posed by alien vegetation in our water catchment areas, and very encouraging that a concerted effort is beingmade to commence redressing this problem. With the limited resources that are available, it is going to take a huge effort to make this project a success. It isimportant that available energies are used to best effect, and we should ensure that expert knowledge available in bodies like the MCSA is put to best use. Too often we haveseen a lot of time, effort, and money put into clearing projects, which have been wasted through incorrect tech- niques being applied.102 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Schoon, Shroyer, and Hunziker An NGO's Contribution to Mountain Conservation in South Africa Developmental Impacts Various forms of development have made a significant impact on the mountain environment. For example, there isa proliferation of communication structures in our moun- tains. In themselves, these structures may have more of an aesthetic impact than anything else, but in cases whereroads have been constructed to give access to the sites to facilitate building and maintaining the structures, there has often been severe environmental degradation. An examplewhere this has happened is on Ben Heatlie, near Worcester, where an access road more than 20 km (12.4 miles) long has been built in extremely fragile terrain. The MCSA is runninga project to compile information on existing communication sites in sensitive mountain environments to try to apply pressure to limit further degradation. Fortunately, newenvironmental legislation is now in place to ensure that new structures of this nature may be erected and other forms of development undertaken only after a proper environmentalimpact assessment has been done. But, it is still necessary to keep one's eyes open to see that the legislation is enforced. Impacts of Users An emotive issue relating to sport climbing (a compara- tively recent development in rock climbing that has in-creased immensely in popularity throughout the world over a very short time) is the fact that sport climbing relies on the placement of fixed protection on the climbs in the form ofanchor bolts drilled and glued into the rock. However, this is in fact a relatively insignificant impact in relation to the impact of access. Because most sport climbing areas arequite concentrated, with many climbing routes in a smallarea, the impact on the vegetation caused by the climbers moving between the routes and reaching the climbing area can be far more serious. In the 1990s, European climbing federations experienced major problems with access to some of their climbing areas (specifically sport climbing areas) being completely closeddown due to public pressure exerted on environmental grounds, partly for the reasons already set out here, but also due to possible disturbance of nesting birds, such as per-egrine falcons. Largely from concerted efforts made by the German Alpine Club (DAV) and the Swiss Alpine Club (CAS), many of these constraints have now been removed.Dialogue was initiated by these federations involving all parties concerned so that the climbers' aspirations and needs and the environmental groups' concerns could all beheard and understood, and so that management plans ap- propriate for each particular area could be worked out and agreed upon. This successful process resulted in an informative joint UIAA/World Conservation Union (IUCN) seminar held in Barcelona in 1998, following which valuable guidelinesentitled \"Access and Conservation Strategies for Climbing Areas\" were published by the UIAA's Access and Conserva- tion Working Group (UIAA/IUCN 2001). Building on this experience and the information flowing from it, the sport-climbing community, supported by the MCSA, developed a management plan for sport climbing inthe Cape Peninsula National Park (CPNP) that has nowbeen accepted by South African National Parks and is being implemented via a Sport Climbing Working Group. It hasbeen a very successful initiative and one that sets new standards for recreation management in protected areas. The MCSA is in the process of drafting proposals for asimilar management plan for mountaineering in the Cape Peninsula National Park. Challenges Regarding Wilderness Management ___________________ There are very few wilderness areas set aside in South Africa, particularly when we consider mountainous wilder-ness areas. The mountain wilderness areas that we do have and that are afforded an enhanced conservation status must be recognized as being extremely precious, and we should alldo our utmost to ensure that these areas are preserved in a pristine condition for future generations. There are other mountain areas that deserve recognition as wilderness areas too but that are not afforded any special conservation status. Such areas, together with their present form of ownership and conservation status, need to bedefined and means sought to afford them with an enhanced conservation status before the window of opportunity is lost. To promote a better understanding of the present conser- vation status of mountains in South Africa, the MCSA, together with the World Wide Fund for Nature\u2014South Africa (WWF-SA), sponsored a research project conductedby Shroyer (2001b) entitled \"Establishing the Status of Mountain Conservation in South Africa.\" The purpose of the research was: To provide an overview of the major mountain ranges in South Africa and their conservation status. To provide information about mountain communities living in them. To provide a brief analysis of the policies, legislation,and other \"social contracts\" affecting their conservationstatus. To highlight some of the key threats to mountain wilder- ness in South Africa. Opportunities___________________ The year 2002 offers South Africa a great opportunity to focus its peoples' attention on mountains through the UnitedNation's International Year of the Mountains (IYM 2002). The MCSA recognized this opportunity and lobbied the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mr. ValliMoosa, and his department at Central Government to set up a national IYM 2002 Committee to support and coordinate the country's efforts to make this event a big success, anaction that the Government has already set in motion. The MCSA will be liaising closely with this IYM 2002 Committee to promote a number of important nationalevents that will take place during 2002. These will include the declaration of Mountain Protection Days over the week- end of September 14-15, when it is hoped that countrywide mountain conservation projects will be publicized nation- ally in the printed media and on television, as well as aUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 103Schoon, Shroyer, and Hunziker An NGO's Contribution to Mountain Conservation in South Africa confer ence focusing on the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg Mountains, with the specific objective of contributing to theProtected Area and Parks Conference to be held in Durban in 2003. The Drakensberg conference, which will be sup- ported by the UIAA as one of its international IYM 2002projects, has exciting potential in view of the recent develop- ments in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg\u2014the declaration of the Drakensberg as a World Heritage Site and the forma-tion of the Maluti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area. In addition to the contribution that it will make on these projects, the MCSA is planning various other national events to celebrate IYM 2002, the most important of which will be: The publication of a book on the history of mountaineer- ing in South Africa. Application made to the Post Office for a commemora- tive stamp issue in South Africa focusing specifically on mountains. The production of an educational video on the moun- tains of South Africa, emphasizing their importance and the need to conserve them, Through partnerships with organizations like Working for Water and Ukuvuka Firestop, undertaking special IYM 2002 projects (such as the high altitude clearing of alien vegetation) to publicize work done toward con-serving mountains. The expansion of the Banff Festival of Mountain Films to a major national event in South Africa. Conclusions____________________ The MCSA, although a relatively small mountaineering federation, endeavors to play a role in the conservation of the mountains of South Africa, and this paper outlines the actions it is taking in regard to some of the issues involved. Membership of the UIAA, the World Mountaineering and Climbing Federation, has provided useful guidance inhelping the MCSA to resolve some of the conservation issues it has faced. Many of the problems in South Africa are notunique and have been thought about and often successfully addressed by our international friends. We should draw on this experience where appropriate and use the support thatthey are willing to give us. Similarly, organizations like the MCSA should strengthen partnerships with other NGOs to achieve common goalsrelating to mountain conservation. More work is needed, particularly with regard to defining and taking action where mountain areas should be recog-nized as wilderness areas and afforded enhanced conserva- tion status. The International Year of the Mountains 2002 affords South Africa a great opportunity to highlight theimportance of South Africa's mountains and the need to conserve them.

Proc. RMRS-P-27. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014The Muskwa-Kechika Management Area (M-KMA) encompasses more than 6.3 million ha (24,324 miles2) of the Northern Rockies and Great Plains in northeastern British Co- lumbia. The M-KMA is one of the most significant wildernessareas in North America, with extensive forests, spectacular geo- logical formations, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, hot springs, subalpine and alpine areas, and major wetlands. It is home to a huge varietyof wilderness and wildlife\u2014much of the wilderness is ecologically sensitive and some of the wildlife is threatened or endangered. The M-KMA encompasses large oil and gas reserves, and the energysector is a major employer in the area. The central and western areas of the M-KMA are high in metallic and nonmetallic re- sources. Exploration projects have been established, and there issmall-scale mining of sand and gravel. Portions of the M-KMA have high timber values, with over 40 percent of the Fort Nelson (one of British Columbia's most northerly communities) economybeing driven by the forest sector. The management model at M-KMA is intended to establish a world standard for environmental and economic stability. Themanagement intent of the M-KMA is to maintain in perpetuity the wilderness values, the diversity and abundance of wildlife, and the ecosystems on which it depends. There is significant ongoing re-search, inventory, planning, enforcement, education, and extension funded by a trust fund that can annually award up to $3 million to supplement government base funding in the area. Projects areawarded to government agencies, First Nations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector to undertake work directly related to the M-KMA. This paper will address the challenges of protecting and sustain- ing wilderness values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area while also attempting to manage multiple natural resource uses(trapping, hunting, oil and gas, mineral extraction, timber extrac- tion, ecotourism, recreation, and so forth). Additional challenges stem from the commodity-based nature of the extractive industrieswithin a global market and the uncertainties with respect to First Nations rights and claims. The paper will lay out the history of the M-KMA, review management challenges, and address five lessons learned that could apply to other such areas.Protecting and Sustaining Wilderness Values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area Paul J. Mitchell-Banks History ________________________ The Muskwa-Kechika Management Area (M-KMA) can be considered a \"child\" of three Land and Resource Manage-ment Plans (LRMPs), which are large regionally based planning processes that involve multiple stakeholder par- ticipation in drawing up a plan that attempts to address theinterests of all. The LRMPs can take from 3 to 7 years and involve multiple roundtable meetings that are facilitated and at which all participants are given voice. The threeLRMPs and their completion dates related to the Muskwa- Kechika Management Area were the Fort Nelson LRMP covering 9.8 million ha (37,838 miles 2) (October 1997); the Fort St. John LRMP covering 4.6 million ha (17,761 miles2) (October 1997); and the Mackenzie LRMP covering 6.4 million ha (24,710 miles2) (November 2000). Each of these three LRMP processes essentially carved out an area of special significance that was, in turn, amalgamated to cre- ate the M-KMA (Land Use Coordination Office, Province ofBritish Columbia 1997a, The 6.3 million-ha (24,324-miles 2) Muskwa-Kechika Man- agement Area is unique within Canada and, indeed, theworld. It is an area of incredible beauty that has beeninhabited by First Nations for millennia and has been the home, workplace, and recreational area for local residents and international visitors for over a century. The M-KMA is: ...one of the few remaining large, intact and almost unroaded wilderness areas south of the 60th parallel. It supports a diverse number of large mammals including moose, elk, mule deer, whitetail deer, caribou, plains bison, mountain sheep,mountain goat, wolves, black bears and grizzly bears in population densities of global importance. Few places in the world match the natural features of the Muskwa-KechikaManagement Area in terms of species groupings, remoteness and minimal development. The area is also well endowed with rich energy and mineral resources. In general, oil andgas reserves dominate the eastern portion of the area while a variety of metallic and non-metallic resources can be found in the central and western portions of the area. Valuable timberresources are also present in the southern portion of the area (Land Use Coordination Office, Province of British Columbia 1997b). The 1997 Muskwa-Kechika Management Plan sets out some ambitious objectives to address the unique beauty,biodiversity, cultural importance, and resource wealth within the M-KMA, specifying that: The management intent for the Muskwa-Kechika Man- agement Area is to ensure wilderness characteristics, wild- life, and its habitat are maintained over time while allowingresource development and use, including recreation, hunt- ing, timber harvesting, mineral exploration and mining, oil and gas exploration and development. The integration ofUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 105Protecting and Sustaining Wilderness Values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area Mitchell-Banks management activities especially related to the planning, development and management of road accesses within the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area is central to achieving this intent. The long-term objective is to return lands totheir natural state, as much as possible, as development activities are completed (Land Use Coordination Office, Province of British Columbia 1997b). Legislation Arguably the roots of the M-KMA lie within the three approved Land and Resource Management Plans. Specifi- cally, however, it was a 1997 Order-in-Council (where min- isters in the cabinet approve a decision without going to thelegislature) that established the Muskwa-Kechika Manage- ment Plan (Land Use Coordination Office, Province of Brit- ish Columbia 1997c). The following year, the government passed Bill 37-1998, the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area Act, that directly addressed the specifics of the Management Area and Plan,provided for the establishment of the Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board (a public advisory group) and the Muskwa- Kechika Trust Fund, and some general issues such as thepower to make regulations. Both the Muskwa-Kechika Management Plan and the Muskwa-Kechika Management Act address the five required planning processes that arerequired to be undertaken with the area: (1) Recreation Management Plan, (2) Wildlife Management Plan, (3) Oil and Gas Pre-tenure Plans, (4) Parks Management Plans,and (5) Landscape Unit Objectives (for forestry planning). What was unique about these plans was the requirement for multiministry signoff, which was to assist in ensuringthat planning was coordinated and addressed a broadrange of issues and not necessarily just those of one minis- try. With the new government, this has been scrapped, and now the plans are signed off by single ministries, with theMinistry of Sustainable Resource Management deemed to be a \"neutral\" ministry and responsible for Recreation, Oil and Gas, and Landscape Unit Objective Planning. TheMinistry of Water, Land and Air Protection is responsible for Wildlife and Parks planning. Another innovative aspect of the planning is the excellent working relationship between the local government manag- ers who are the statutory decisionmakers. There is a teamlike arrangement, in which the managers not only focus on theirown mandates but also work closely with each other to avoid duplication, conflicting programs, and uncertainty. The gov- ernment managers and staff also have established closeworking arrangements with the M-K Advisory Board as a whole and certain board members who are active partici- pants in various planning processes. While board participa-tion does not replace public participation, it does provide a greater level of comfort that a wide range of values are being addressed. Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board The Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board is appointed by the Premier of British Columbia Province. Its role is to provide advice on the natural resource management in the M-K Management Area and to identify suitable projects andproposals consistent with the purposes of the trust to receiveTrust funding (Minister of Environment, Lands and Parks 1998). The board was originally established with up to 17 mem- bers to represent a broad range of interests, including but not limited to, First Nations, environmental, business, la-bor, and Fort Nelson and Fort St. John Land and Resource Management Plan participants. The current board is slightly larger, including the acting chair, seven First Nations rep-resentatives, three local government representatives, two members from the Oil and Gas sector, one mining sector representative, a forestry representative, one labor repre-sentative, two environmental representatives, one trapper guide member, a member of the British Columbia Wildlife Federation, a backcountry tourism representative, and theMuskwa-Kechika Program Manager (ex-officio position). Over the past year, the Strategic Plan and Policy and Procedures Manual for the Board has been approved, andthere has been a concerted effort to increase the levels of awareness regarding ongoing issues and concerns. Muskwa- Kechika Advisory Board meetings are held a minimum ofthree times a year, with at least one of the meetings being held deep within the M-KMA to help orient the board members to the issues and to increase their awareness aboutthe Muskwa-Kechika Management Area. Muskwa-Kechika Trust Fund One of the unique legislative features behind establishing the M-KMA was creating the Muskwa-Kechika Trust Fund, which has two primary purposes: (1) to support wildlife andwilderness resources of the management area through re-search and integrated management of natural resource development; and (2) to maintain in perpetuity the diversity and abundance of wildlife species and the ecosystems onwhich they depend throughout the management area. The trust fund is currently annually provided with $1 million Canadian per year, as well as a project fund top-up allow-ance in which the government will match dollar for dollar contributions, to a maximum of $1 million. The base fund- ing, as well as the maximum matching, creates a maximumannual fund of $3 million. Every fall there is a call for project proposals that are submitted to the Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board, subjectto a number of review processes, and then reviewed by the Board with recommendations passed on to the trustee of the trust fund. After the trustee has reviewed and approved therecommended projects, management of the projects is then given to the Muskwa-Kechika Program Manager who serves as the trust fund projects manager and comptroller. Fund-ing agreements addressing deliverables, reporting, and fund- ing arrangements are negotiated and signed. Currently, there are five project funding envelopes under the trustfund: (1) building an information base, (2) supporting plan- ning, (3) improving management, (4) advancing applied science (research), and (5) promoting awareness and in-volvement. Every year the Premier (head of the Provincial Government) is given a report from the Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board regarding the activities of the Board and thehighlights of the trust funded activities. There is ongoing research with wildlife and habitat, particularly for certain species such as grizzly, moose, elk, and Stone sheep.106 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Mitchell-Banks Protecting and Sustaining Wilderness Values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area Historically Significant Activities Of all the activities within the M-KMA, it is the oil and gas sector that is currently the most active, the mostvisible, and that will likely create the greatest manage- ment challenges. With the recent sharp increases in both oil and gas commodity prices, there is renewed interest ininvesting in exploration and development, and this has led to a sharp increase in the number of seismic, drilling, facilities, and pipeline applications (Oil and Gas Commis-sion 1999). The oil- and gas-rich Western Canada Basin extends into the northeast corner of British Columbia and extends west into the M-KMA. While to date the majorityof the oil and gas activity is outside of the M-KMA bound- aries, given the high prices, there is increasing pressure from industry and a desire by government to complete thepre-tenure planning within the M-KMA, and thus open planned areas to oil and gas development. During the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999, a total of 1,801 applicationswere approved, and for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000, a total of 2,487 applications were approved\u2014repre- senting a 38 percent increase. Results are not available forthe fiscal year that ended March 31, 2001, but an increase is expected again. One of the oil and gas exploration initiatives that received a high degree of review and discus-sion occurred at Chicken Creek in the Upper Sikanni area (one of the Resource Management Zones or management units on the southeast side of the M-KMA). This is animportant wildlife area, and particular care is being paid to monitor any potential impacts. Forestry is a bit of an anomaly within the M-KMA. Where- as the forest sector is one of the Province's largest and mostubiquitous industries, the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area is unique in that its timber resources are relatively limited. At this time, there is long-term planning for limitedforestry development, with considerations such as road development limitations and costs, haulage distances, stand size, density, and piece size all limiting the developmentpotential. It is possible that forestry development will be closely associated with the oil and gas sector and take advantage of roads approved for the oil and gas explorationand development. In the near future, it is quite likely that forestry will initially focus in promising areas located at the south end of the M-KMA in the Graham/North ResourceManagement Zone. The vast area of the M-KMA has important mineral resource potential supported by a mineral occurrence data-base, existing tenure, and exploration and development activity. Historically, the area has received limited explora- tion, but there is significant opportunity for future mineproduction. One of the challenges that mining will face in the area is how to deal with the controlled access to the area\u2014 but there are opportunities to explore how to develop minesin conjunction with other industrial activities such as oil, gas, and forestry. Trapping and guide-outfitting are historically important activities within the M-KMA. While the numbers of employ- ees does not come close to approaching the oil and gas sector, there is still a strong commitment through both legislationand ongoing management and planning to ensure that these activities are supported and that their needs are considered among all of the industrial activities. Hunters, anglers, andbackcountry recreationists have historically accessed the area, with users from the local communities as well as otherstraveling great distances to take advantage of the vast wilderness spaces found within the M-KMA. Obviously, wilderness values are important to these users. Management Challenges _________ There are numerous challenges in attempting to effec- tively manage the M-KMA. The most obvious one is the sheer size of the area at 6.3 million ha (24,324 miles2). Access is extremely limited (and controlled through Ac- cess Management) as directed by the LRMPs\u2014with only a few roads, and trails that are accessed by horseback,snowmobile, or all-terrain vehicles. Government staff make extensive use of helicopter and jetboat transport to access the M-KMA because ground access is so limited.Fuel often has to be remotely cached for both helicopters and jetboats due to the long distances from staging points and the size of the M-KMA itself. Along with the huge distances are the extremes in tem- perature, with seasonal fluctuations of 80 C not uncommon. At -40 C (-40 F), equipment is subject to heavy wear and it is trying on the staff as well\u2014particularly if there is a breakdown or incident such as getting stranded. All staff carry emergency survival gear (cold weather sleeping bags,first aid kits, rations, satellite phones, and so forth) in vehicles. Another management challenge is the long distance (ap- proximately 1,300 km [808 miles] by road, 2 hours by air) from the Provincial Capital and the location of some of the senior government executive managers that are ultimatelyresponsible for the success of the M-KMA. Extra care has tobe taken to keep the \"southern\" managers up to speed on the issues and actions being taken by the \"northern\" statutory decisionmakers responsible for government managementwithin the M-KMA. This can be occasionally frustrating for both \"southerners\" who are more aware of the machinations within the legislature and the \"northerners\" who are morefocused on the local situation. There is the ongoing challenge of attempting to address the overall intent of three Land and Resource ManagementPlans (LRMPs) in the planning for the M-KMA. The LRMPs tend to deal with generalities and do not give strong direc- tion with respect to operational planning. This lack ofspecific guidance is further complicated with five required plans because the legislation provides no guidance as to what the plans should entail other than the broad activities(such as recreation or oil and gas development) that they are supposed to address. As if that were not enough challenge, there is also the overriding question of what exactly iswilderness. This is a very hotly debated concept and incorpo- rates issues such as manmade impacts and the presence or absence of people, but in the case of the M-KMA, it was a keycomponent of the legislation but is not defined. Wilderness remains an undefined concept 4 years later in the initiative. One of the increasing challenges for the M-KMA is the growing public awareness and level of expectations about what \"could\" or \"should\" occur within the M-KMA. It is difficult to ensure that everything that is planned\u2014or evenmore challenging, simply decided upon at a political level\u2014USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 107Protecting and Sustaining Wilderness Values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area Mitchell-Banks can be effectively implemented. The M-KMA, by its very nature of being a new approach to planning and manage-ment, demands that the government staff, board members, and public participants in the planning process attempt to address every challenge with a set of \"fresh eyes\" and ofteninnovative approaches. The final, and potentially greatest, challenge revolves around land claims. Treaty Eight was signed over a centuryago, and three of the board members represent Bands that signed the treaty. The Kaska Dena Treaty is currently under negotiation, and the treaty discussions are wide ranging andat times very intense. Any legislation, decisions, or actions within the M-KMA are \"without prejudice\" with respect to a future treaty with the Kaska-Dena. Four of the board mem-bers represent Kaska Dena Bands (communities). A Letter of Understanding (LOU) was signed in 1997 between the Provincial Government and the Kaska Dena Council topermit land use planning and other government manage- ment initiatives to continue, pending the signing of a treaty. The LOU specifically: ...sets out a relationship between the two parties with respect to the planning and management of lands and resources in the LOU area from the date of signing of this Understanding until such time as it is terminated according to the provisionsof this Understanding (Government of British Columbia and Kaska Dena Council 1997). Planning and management is underway without any future certainty with respect to what lands the Kaska Dena may be awarded in the north and particularly in the Muskwa- Kechika Management Area. Lessons Learned to Date _________ There have been five major lessons to date from the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area initiative. Lesson One: There Is a Need for Adequate Data and Knowledge The first lesson revolves around the challenges of having or obtaining adequate data and knowledge about the wilder-ness qualities, wildlife and habitat values, natural resource values, and land management challenges. The difficulties stem not only from the 6.3 million-ha (24,324-miles 2) size but also from the tremendous biodiversity, differences in physiogeography, and the problems of access to the area. Many of the Resource Management Zones (managementunits) are hundreds of kilometers dimensionally, and travel by either helicopter (running between $800 to $1,000 per hour) or jetboat (time consuming for staff) rapidly consumeslimited budget dollars and staff time. The LRMPs were completed under a previous govern- ment that was not as time or cost conscious as the currentgovernment. This has led to challenges when the successor government cut back on staffing and budgets, and so the same challenges remain with fewer resources to addressthem. A lesson here is to formally commit (through legisla- tion) to adequately follow up on unique land management initiatives to ensure their successful implementation. An-other strategy is to aggressively use triage and a projectmanagement approach to see what the critical steps are in the process that are time sensitive, and to focus on thoseand practice risk management with respect to the budget and timeline. In the case of the M-KMA, this requires cooperation between the Advisory Board and the Govern-ment that was not always in place, with both parties having differences of opinion with respect to priorities. In retro- spect, the government should have mandated that allplanning would be completed prior to the expenditures from the Trust Fund being used for any other approved purposes, such as training, extension, or noncritical re-search. Lesson Two: There Is a Need for Accurate and Timely Analysis and Decisions The second challenge is related to the previous lesson but centers around the challenges of accurate and timely analy-sis and decisionmaking. This challenge involves a number of components, including translating field data into the Geo- graphic Information System (GIS), and devising adequatetools to verify, correct, analyze, manipulate, and map the output. A current initiative underway is determining how to undertake sensitivity analysis and scenario planning topermit the planners and management teams to have a better understanding of potential consequences or outcomes. GIS tools are being explored. GIS staff are in high demand fromboth the government and private sectors, and we have lost a number of high quality staff as a result of this\u2014which has in turn led to losing institutional geographic familiarity,working relationships, technical skills, process memory,and having to repeatedly retrain staff. There are also the challenges of timing with respect to planning requirements, implementation, and ongoing op-erational management. Politicians and industry can push a timeline to finish planning and create \"certainty\" that leads to challenges at best, and failure at worst, to completeplanning in a comprehensive and integrated fashion. This becomes particularly frustrating with complex landforms and resource values, and also heavy industrial and economicdevelopment pressure\u2014both of which apply to the M-KMA. Oil and gas development pressure is particularly strong, and remains so, with political instability in other oil-producingareas. A troubled forest economy and significantly reduced mining and fishing within a staples economy create fiscal pressures on the government, which seeks to fuel its trea-sury through oil and gas development. There are ongoing challenges with respect to out-of-date inventories and missing inventories. Integrated and inter-active planning tools, such as Conservation Area Design, are being completed on timelines that do not inform planning from the beginning, with the tools having to be creativelyshoe-horned into the truncated planning timelines\u2014which severely limit the benefits and values that can be obtained from the tool development and application processes. Ide-ally, a Conservation Area Design would be completed before any resource use was contemplated\u2014and this is legisla- tively possible within the M-KMA\u2014but due to heavy govern-ment and industrial pressures, the planning is accelerated, and planners and land managers make the best with what they have and can obtain within the planning timelines.108 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Mitchell-Banks Protecting and Sustaining Wilderness Values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area Similarly, incomplete and/or out-of-date inventories can severely constrain the accuracy or value of managementdecisions and planning. The adage \"garbage in garbage out\" applies to planning as much as it does to models and simulations. There are a number of things that would greatly assist accurate and timely analysis and decisionmaking of the M-KMA: 1. Creatively retaining GIS staff through providing them with challenging and intellectually rewarding tasks. TakeGIS staff out into the field; this not only gives them a greater understanding of the challenges but also the pleasure of getting out into the wilderness as well as an opportunity tosee the wildlife. Often the expense of doing this is minimal, as the helicopter or jetboat is already paid for and the only cost is staff time. 2. Take a project management approach to the planning challenges and be certain to fully address the obvious and potential challenges of political and economic/industrialdevelopment pressures. This not only coordinates the activi- ties of staff but also assists in expectation management and in establishing an effective communications strategy to keepall of the interested parties aware of progress. 3. Related to the previous point is the question of effective policy. There needs to be a process to be able to evaluate theshort, medium, and long-term implications of planning ac- tions or the lack thereof. It is tempting to think short term and focus on revenue generation, particularly when thereare fiscal challenges for the government. Short-term solu- tions can result in inadequate planning, leading to financial losses through less than satisfactory resource planning(suboptimal planning for effective use or extraction) orgreater costs (associated with environmental restoration and remediation). As importantly, and arguably ethically more so, there is also the potential for species and habitatlosses. There is a strong argument that these should be fully incorporated in the thinking in any policy evaluation, devel- opment, and implementation/administration. Lesson Three: There Is a Need for Adequate Resource Funding The third challenge involves obtaining adequate re- source funding for travel, sufficient staffing, equipment, and resources to effectively manage the area, and to be ableto address not only ongoing management needs, but to also proactively address anticipated developments\u2014such as oil and gas exploration and development continuing to in-crease in both scale and scope. Hiring freezes, challenges in finding and retaining staff, particularly those in the GIS area, compound this problem. The Trust Fund providessome security in potential funding, but all government- proposed projects seeking trust funding have to be vetted before the Advisory Board and receive recommendationsprior to being approved by the Trustee (who is the Minister of Sustainable Resource Management). This has led to some frustration on the part of the Advisory Board as towhat are government core responsibilities (which the trust fund is not supposed to give money for), and what are activities incremental to base funding. The frustration ismirrored by government staff, who \"see\" the money beingpotentially available in the trust fund, but not necessarily accessible for government activities. There are a number of ways to reduce this occurring: 1. When drawing up the initial legislation or policy to establish the area, real attention should be paid to the future implications and costs of the planning and management required. In other words, if you are building a Rolls Royce,then budget a lot of resources to successfully do this\u2014if a Volkswagon, then your resource requirements will be less. 2. Commit to finishing one initiative or related initiatives prior to taking on new challenges. Do not be tempted to spread resources thinly, attempting to do a little bit of everything. This relates to the project management argu-ment\u2014do the things that need to be done first, and make certain that they are done adequately well. You don't want to have an elegant planning process established with no datato feed into it, for example. 3. Ensure that there is a clear understanding through legislation and administrative procedure on how funds andstaff time can be employed, and be consistent with the approach while being flexible to real emergencies and not just \"nice to dos.\" The Trust Fund administration wasclouded by some uncertainty with respect to how it could be used, and more importantly, what exactly were the govern- ment core responsibilities that were not meant to be funded,but which in reality often lacked funds and were key to making the M-KMA work. 4. Initiate a fund-raising strategy as soon as the area is established or the initiative implemented. Four years into this process, fund raising is only now beginning to be seri- ously looked at\u2014and it is a case of being very late to start andhaving lost some very positive media opportunities while theinitiative was still new. Lesson Four: Politics and Agendas Politics and agendas are the fourth challenge, and are an inherent part of the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area initiative. There are politics in the capital with politiciansresponding to lobbying and making decisions without con- sulting Government staff\u2014often with very frustrating con- sequences, as the decisions are often made without anyappreciation of the existing situation or resources avail- able to Government staff. The Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board is very political, with every member having a con-stituency and an agenda to address within the area. Gov- ernment managers and staff are also political in that they have the mandate of their ministries to fulfill, and therecan be clashes between the ministries with their conflicting agendas. One of the most challenging aspects of the Muskwa- Kechika Program Manager's job is to champion the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area initiative and to serve as a liaison between the various groups and promote effective communication, \"buying\" into a common vision and coop-eration. This job plays a keystone role in not only holding the process together, but also encouraging it to progres- sively continue forward. Politics are always a wild card. Politicians can be very challenging with respect to how they respond to perceived problems\u2014but their perception is often heavily influenced byeither key supporters, effective lobbyists, political assistants,USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 109Protecting and Sustaining Wilderness Values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area Mitchell-Banks or general public opinion\u2014all of which are quite capable of leading to decisions that do not support effective land useplanning. Communication and documentation play a key role in setting the stage and making information and potential scenarios known\u2014it is more difficult for a political decision tobe made that is adverse to the land use management if key supporters of the initiative (both within and without Govern- ment) are aware of the facts and the situation, so thatdecisions are not made and observed in a vacuum. Manage- ment often involves a lot of time explaining to people what is going on, and as importantly, what might go on. Lesson Five: There Is a Need to Define Roles and Responsibilities The Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board is unique in the Province not only for the scope of their advisory and monitor- ing function, but also in that they are the body that makesrecommendations for a multimillion-dollar trust fund. Fund- ing has grown increasingly scarce over the last decade, and the trust fund is drawing increasing attention from bothwithin and without Government. In many ways, it is the trust fund that can potentially serve the greatest role in ensuring that the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area is a successful initiative, and there needs to be a healthy appreciation between the Muskwa-Kechika Advisory Board and government staff inhow to best apply the fund to complement existing govern- ment statutory responsibilities and initiatives. The trust fund is there to ad vance the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area with a view to maintaining the unique features of thearea, while also permitting industrial and economic develop- ment over three-quarters of the area. This is a daunting, butnot insurmountable challenge. It will require all parties and individuals involved to assume their roles and cooperativelywork with everyone else to fulfill not only their individual responsibilities but also those of the group as a whole. There needs to be a greater accountability for decisions that aremade and a greater attempt to let the general public know how the funds are being spent.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has created a National Landscape Conserva-tion System (NLCS) in response to their growing shift toward protection of special areas. This NLCS brings National Conserva- tion Areas, National Monuments, Wilderness, Wilderness StudyAreas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Historic and Scenic Trails into a single network in order to improve protection of benefits and increase public awareness of scientific, cultural, educational, ecological, and other values. Introduction to the Bureau of Land Management ___________________ The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for more land than any other agency in the United States of America with over 260 million surface acres (1.05 million km2). The vast majority of this land is located in the arid western third of the United States and in Alaska. These lands are the canyons, deserts, and cacti of the American Southwest, the open landscapes of the short grass prairie,the isolated tundra, the wide-open landscapes that surroundWestern towns, and the isolated retreats that often form the image of the American West. Public lands managed by the BLM are those Federal lands left over from the early yearsof Western expansion. In the country's first 150 years, our national policy was to dispose of these Federal lands to build a strong nation, raise funds, and encourage settlement ofnew territories. Lands were sold or given to settlers, home- steaders, veterans, towns, colleges, private corporations, and States. Some of the land was set aside to becomeNational Parks, National Forests, Wildlife Refuges, Indian Reservations, or Military Bases. During the disposal era, over 1.1 billion acres (4.45 million km 2) of public lands were transferred out of Federal ownership. The disposal era ended for the BLM in 1976 with passage of its organic act: The Federal Land Policy and ManagementAct. This law changed the course of BLM management in numerous ways including directing that public lands are to be retained in Federal ownership. The lands that remainedNational Landscape Conservation System: A New Approach to Conservation Jeff Jarvis are the 260 million acres (1.05 million km2) of public lands that are now managed by the BLM. The BLM-managed public lands are a priceless legacy and a long-term invest- ment for the American people. Prized originally for theircommodity value, today the public lands offer much more: unparalleled recreational opportunities, wildlife reserves, and in the increasingly crowded American West, one of thelast guarantees of open space. Special Values Identified _________ In the 1960s, Congress began to recognize the need to protect some of the natural, historical, and cultural re-sources on these public lands. Efforts designed to raise awareness of the BLM started in 1964 when the lands were renamed the National Resource Lands. The need to protectthe unique values of public lands was realized by BLM and Congress over the next decade. A major step in creation of a BLM land protection system was taken in 1970 when Con-gress created the King Range National Conservation Area on California's northern coast. This first National Conserva- tion Area was designated to conserve and develop for the useand benefit of the people of the United States the lands andother resources under a program of multiple use and sus- tained yield. Congress expanded the areas protected under national designations numerous times in the following decade. The 10.6 million acres (42,897 km 2) within the California Desert Conservation Area were set aside in 1976. The Steese Na-tional Conservation Area, which contains 1.2 million acres (4,856 km 2) in east-central Alaska, was designated in 1980 to protect wild and scenic rivers, crucial caribou calvinggrounds, and Dall sheep habitat. Additional protective des- ignations were passed into law for the rugged lava flows on New Mexico's El Malpais \"badlands\" (1987), the rich wildlifeand riparian area along Arizona's San Pedro River (1988), and other areas throughout the West. In total, Congress created 14 National Conservation Areas in eight WesternStates from 1970 to 2000. In 1996, the BLM was entrusted with the responsibility of managing its first National Monument with the Presiden-tial De signation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante Na- tional Monument in U tah. The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was designated to protect the area'sobjects of historic or scientific interest, including geologic treasures, w orld-class paleontological sites, extensive ar- cheological resources, and outstanding biological resources.Since then, the BLM's responsibilities have continued to ex- pand. Congress and the President created an additional 14USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 111Jarvis National Landscape Conservation System: A New Approach to Conservation National Monuments in seven additional States from 2000 through 2001. In addition to National Conservation Areas and National Monuments, Congress used a variety of protective designa- tions to protect the natural values of other landscapes,including Wild and Scenic Rivers, National Trails, and Wilderness. This explosion in land protection led to numer- ous changes in the BLM. The agency began the slow processof changing from an agency responsible for developing com- modities to an agency with an additional new mission, the long-term conservation of public lands. These designations created a pattern of special areas where the overriding objective was long-term conservation, restoration of the land, and protection of biological diversity.A set of common management prescriptions emerged: the areas are withdrawn from disposal, there is more intensive management focused on providing visitor services and inter-pretation, and restoration is a priority. Many of the areas are also withdrawn from mineral entry. During development of these conservation designations, Congress and the BLM learned that no single type of desig- nation was appropriate for all situations and no single designation was adequate to protect all the landscapes thatdeserved protection. In some cases, Wilderness was the most appropriate designation. In other situations, a National Conservation Area designation did a better job of protectingan area's values while allowing certain existing uses. In some cases, it is appropriate to have more than a single designation for a special landscape. This most often occurswhen a Wilderness, Wild and Scenic River, or National Trail is located within a National Conservation Area or National Monument. National Landscape Conservation System ________________________ Although this expanding collection of special areas was managed under somewhat consistent prescriptions, the BLMdid not have an organized approach to management of these areas. In the summer of 2000, the BLM responded to the growing concern over management of these areas withcreation of the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The NLCS brings into a single system BLM's most protected landscapes. By putting these lands into a singlesystem the agency hopes to improve management of these special areas, improve public benefits that flow from a well- managed system of conservation areas, and increase publicawareness of these areas' scientific, cultural, educational, ecological, and other values. The NLCS includes the BLM's National Conservation Areas, National Monuments, Wil-derness, Wilderness Study Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Historic and Scenic Trails. Although the NLCS does not create any additional legal protections, the BLM manages these great landscapes of the American West with a set of common principles: The conservation of natural values is of primary concern. Areas are managed in partnership with surrounding communities. In developing management plans, theBLM is working with local communities, particularly with regard to amenities such as food services and lodging. The BLM does not provide food, lodging, andintensive visitor services within the areas. Instead, visitors are encouraged to see the landscape in thecontext of the history and tradition of the entire region. Intensive services are provided by the surrounding communities. Conservation Areas and Monuments often include within their boundaries Wilderness and Wilderness Study Areas or Wild and Scenic Rivers, where motor vehicles areexcluded. Outside such areas, the maintenance of roads and the use of motor vehicles are managed to protect fragile soils, riparian areas and other plant communi-ties, and wildlife habitat. Vehicles are restricted to designated routes. Valid existing rights such as existing mineral leases are recognized. Traditional uses such as grazing and hunting will con-tinue, provided that these activities are consistent withthe overall purpose of the area. The BLM recognizes that in many instances these uses can be compatible with good wildlife management, protection of biodiver-sity, and enhancement of natural values. Many of the areas are unavailable for developmentunder the Mining Act of 1872 and various other generallands laws that are incompatible with long-term protec- tion of our natural environment. Management plans should be prepared, or existing plans reviewed and updated, to reflect the importance of the conservation principles for which the place has been recognized. Acting with public and private partners, the BLM can be the paradigm of the Interior Department's motto: Com- munication, cooperation, and consultation all in theservice of conservation. Early Success Although it is too early for an assessment of the NLCS, its creation appears to be a success. The BLM has improved management of these special areas. Improved management has in part been the result of an increase of approximately$9 million in operation funds and $4 million in planning. These funds have been used to increase staffing, improve visitor services and facilities, and provide public informa-tion. The benefits from increased emphasis on planning will take several years to show but will result in improved management of various uses, restoration of disturbed areas,and numerous long-term efficiencies in delivering public service. Public interest and support has been outstanding. Nu- merous national publications, including the National Geo- graphic , , Sunset Magazine Wilderness Magazine, Backpacker , and USA Today , as well as untold local newspapers, have celebrated formation of the NLCS and discussed some of the more outstanding land- scapes protected under the umbrella of the system. Andfinally, public s upport is building. One example of this is public response to a series of letters sent by the Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, requesting the views of public officials regarding the management of the National Monu- ments. Over 7,000 responses have been received. The major- ity of these letters and E-mails addressed the overall topic ofmonuments, without focusing on a particular area, and112 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Jarvis National Landscape Conservation System: A New Approach to Conservation supported protecting all newly designated monuments. However, the majority who wrote about a particular areaalso supported the management and protection of the monu- ments. Similar to the creation of the National Parks in the 1900s, some of the areas have been controversial. Themajority of Americans recognize the importance of these designations, however, and support their long-term conser- vation management. The Future _____________________ In an increasingly crowded American West, NLCS lands are unique. They are havens of solitude and a reminder of the West as it originally was. The BLM is proud to bestewards of these special landscapes. As we continue to improve our long-term conservation management of these landscapes, we will assure the increased benefits that flowfrom a well-managed system of conservation areas. Conservation Areas _____________ With over 800 units in the NLCS, it is not possible to describe them all. Summarized below, however, are a few ofthe areas in the System: National Conservation Areas Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails (December 21, 2000) \u2014This area includes nearly 800,000 acres (3,237 km2) in northwestern Nevada. Ten Wilderness Areas provide additional protection to the rug-ged interior mountain ranges in the area. A National His- toric Trail protects wagon wheel ruts and historic inscrip- tions, largely unchanged from when pioneers movedwestward through the area in the 1800s. California Desert (October 21, 1976) \u2014This area's 10.6 million acres (42,897 km 2) feature vast desert areas with a myriad of wildlife and recreational opportunities. The desert's outstanding values are also protected within 65 WildernessAreas, one National Monument, and two National Trails. Colorado Canyons (October 24, 2000) \u2014From salt- bush desert to the spectacular canyons of the Black Ridge Wilderness, this diverse area in west-central Colorado en- compasses over 122,000 acres (494 km 2), including more than 75,000 acres (304 km2) of Wilderness. El Malpais (December 31, 1987) \u2014These 226,000 acres (915 km2) of rugged lava flows in west-central New Mexico display some of the Nation's most significant geological, cultural, scenic, scientific, and wilderness resources. Gila Box Riparian (November 28, 1990) \u2014This 22,000 acre (89 km2) desert oasis contains cliff dwellings, historic homesteads, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, and more than 200 species of birds in southeastern Arizona. Gunnison Gorge (October 21, 1999) \u2014A variety of natural and geologic features and unsurpassed recreational opportunities are on display in western Colorado's GunnisonGorge, a 57,725-acre (234-km 2) area.

Science and stewardship to protect and sustain wilderness values: Seventh World Wilderness Con- gress symposium; 2001 November 2-8; Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Proc. RMRS-P-27. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service,Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014The Wildlands Project seeks to create a connected system of protected areas across North America that will ensure thesurvival of all native species, including top predators and wide- ranging species, in the context of fully functioning ecosystems. Core protected areas are designated based on the biological needs of keyspecies and the requirements of critical ecological processes. To work they must have, or will be restored to have, those attributes traditionally ascribed to wilderness. Some critics argue that TheWildlands Project model is inapplicable to other parts of the world, especially the developing world. The inapplicability is based on nonbiological considerations. The applicability of Wildlands typeconservation outside of North America is examined in light of large- scale conservation work in Latin America and Asia. In both regions, conservation efforts similar to those of The Wildlands Project areunderway and show promise. There are important differences, but the similarities are significant enough to suggest the approach can be applied. The similarities between conservation work in NorthAmerica, Latin America, and Asia is attributable in some cases to Wildlands Project influence. In other cases, similarities are due to similar strategies emerging from similar conditions leading to species loss. The Wildlands Project____________ The Wildlands Project has been working across North America for 10 years to address the current extinction crisis. In places like the \"Yellowstone to Yukon\" (Y2Y) and the Sky Islands Wildlands Network (SIWN)\u2014both multinationalefforts\u2014conservationists are developing and implementing systems of connected protected areas. These regional projects are elements within a broader, continental program stretch-ing from the Arctic to the Darien Gap. The continental scale is important not just because the threats to nature are continental. Threats aside, continents are evolutionarilyand ecologically significant (Flannery 2001; Soul\u00e9 and Terborgh 1999). Prefragmentation landscape level connec- tivity has played a major role in structuring communities,and it affects both top-down and bottom-up regulation of ecosystems (Clark and others 1999). The Wildlands Project was created in response to acceler- ating species loss and massive landscape hemorrhaging. The effects of habitat loss and degradation were magnifiedThe Wildlands Project Outside North America David M. Johns greatly by the loss of connectivity. The legal boundaries of protected areas were becoming actual boundaries as devel-opment and conversion consumed intervening unprotected wildlands. These actual boundaries were biologically inad- equate to sustain species and processes over the long haul,even within the biggest islands like Yellowstone National Park. This was especially true for wide-ranging species such as top carnivores, some ungulates, and others, and forimportant ecological processes like fire and succession (Noss 1992; Noss and Cooperrider1994; Terborgh 1999). It was clear to us that more and bigger protected areas wereneeded, and that natural connectivity also needed to be protected and restored. We also recognized that responding to threats, while absolutely necessary, was not sufficient. We needed to create an alternative vision, a positive vision of a biologically healthy North America. We needed to be able to say that thisis what we stand for, rather than simply opposing this or that development. The best defense, it has been said, is a good offense. Almost since the beginning, there has been global interest in our approach as outlined in various publications describ- ing it 1999). There has also been skep- ticism about the application of our model outside of North America, or even English speaking North America. The ques- tion is important because the extinction crisis is global, not North American. We need answers about what works now. There are two ways to approach the question of the applica- bility of our approach. The first is to examine essentialaspects of our approach and ask whether these can or should be applied elsewhere. This approach involves more than just thought experiments, but it certainly includes them. Another approach, the one I will take, is simply to compare our approach as it has evolved with other efforts around the world. Michael Soul\u00e9 (in press) has outlined our approach insome detail. In summary, our goal is to create systems of connected protected areas that have a very high probability over the long haul of protecting existing or recovered popu-lations of key species, including wide-ranging animals and top carnivores; that encompass functioning ecosystems of all types; that allow processes to operate unencumbered; andthat can accommodate climate change. At the heart of these protected systems are big cores that have, or are restored to, a wildlands state. By wildlands, I mean self-willed land\u2014alandscape undominated. Humans are very poor ecosystem dominants and differ from other dominants (Rodman 1987). These goals reflect fundamental values about the intrinsicworth of nature and recognize the limitations of humans to substitute their brains for evolution. Another feature of our approach is the reliance on biology, ecology, and relatedsciences to tell us what types of areas we need to protect, how much, and where, in order to achieve our goals. Just as weUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 115Johns The Wildlands Project Outside North America must have a positive vision and not just respond, so we also cannot simply accept the leftovers of civilization. We mustprotect biologically valuable lands. As a species, we have choices and extraord inary flexibility. Other creatures do not. Our goals (which may be informed by a range of values) and our reliance on science (which includes all systematized and testable knowledge) are invariant aspects of our ap- proach. The variant aspects are the human dimension. Soci- eties vary in their patterns of land ownership and use; attitudes toward n ature and other creatures; population con- centration and dispersal; economic development and geo-graphic mobility; effectiveness of law enforcement; road type and density access to wildla nds and to firearms; and in their organized and financial support for conservation. Theseare not totally independent of biology, but interact in the application of our approach. A society without firearms and extensive motorized access may require smaller buffers (forexample Oates 1999). Lands of high agricultural value are usually also of high biodiversity value. This conflict is universal. But in societies where labor-intensive agriculturepredominates, there are large numbers of people present, and this creates different kinds of pressures than in societies where technologically intensive agriculture dominates andfewer people are present, most having moved to cities (Hous- ton 2001). Those remaining, however, are usually motorized and armed. With this model in mind, I will examine large scale conser- vation in Latin America and Asia. Much conservation is not at a large scale, but it is important work. Without large-scale protection, however, much will be lost. Latin America___________________ The Ecological Corridor of the Americas (EcoAmericas) is an effort to create a system of linked protected areas from Tierra del Fuego to Alaska along the continents' mountain-ous backbone (Wildlife Conservation Society 2000a). Project goals include the designation of new protected areas, the expansion of existing protected areas, and the creation oflinkages, all based on the principles of conservation biology. EcoAmericas is also seeking to strengthen the management of protected areas, improve their financial health, and im-prove cross-boundary coordination. In the near term, EcoAmericas is working to consolidate 36 World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves totalingabout 45-million ha (173,746-mi 2) (Boza 2001). These sites are in 15 countries from Argentina to Mexico. Other current subprojects include: consolidating core areas and designat-ing connections from coast to coast in the Talamanca region (Panama/Costa Rica border); creating a new park of 25,000 ha (97 mi 2) along the Costa Rica-Nicaraguan border to maintain connectivity along the MesoAmerican Biological Corridor; creating a major, 4-million-ha (15,444-mi2) link- age zone called the Yungas Andinas Biological fromSouthern Bolivia to Northern Tucuman Province in Argen- tina; and consolidating management and enhanced pro- tected status for Madidi National Park, Bahuaja-SoneneNational Park, and Tambopata National Reserve, which are contiguous protected areas in Bolivia and Peru that lie in the 30-mill ion-ha (115,831-mi 2) Vilcabamba-Amboro Conser- vation Corridor. Work, of continu es on the Meso- American Biological Corridor itself.Not surprisingly, there are similarities and differences between EcoAmericas south of Mexico and The WildlandsProject. (Mexico north, and Wildlands efforts such as the SIWN and Y2Y, are part of EcoAmericas.) The most impor- tant similarities are: Existing protected areas are too small and in many cases do not include the most biologically importantparts of the landscape. New protected areas are needed and existing protected areas need to be expanded, based on the principles ofconservation biology. Large-scale ecological and evolutionary process are a major focus in protected area design. Connectivity, based on genetic, migration, and dis- persal needs of selected species, is a major focus. A transboundary approach spans both intranational and international borders. Human activities in buffer zones are limited to those that are compatible with the needs of species in adjacentprotected areas, and that are sustainable. EcoAmericas differs from the Wildlands model in that:Biodiversity is a major focus of protection, but wide- ranging species and top carnivores are not emphasized. Connections are not strictly protected in most cases, but will have the status of buffer zones. Providing for change is a focus, but climate change is not specifically mentioned. (The MesoAmerican Biological Corridor's predecessor, Paseo Pantera, does identify climate change as a major design criteria [Sanderson1993].) Limits on roads and motorized access are not empha- sized. The ability of protected areas to contribute to the eco- nomic well-being of the adjacent communities is stressed. On the face of things it does not appear so very different. And it is too early to tell on the ground. I will hazard some early analysis. It is one thing for scientists and advocates to call for protection of lands adequate in type, size, andlocation to protect most species and processes; it is another to create a political coalition strong enough to create and enforce such a strategy. It is in implementation, whichrequires building coalitions of various kinds (grassroots and elite), where limitations become sharply defined and the choices are often stark and difficult. Humans often desirethe same biologically valuable lands that other species need. This essential tension can make it difficult to designate protected areas and certain management regimes, or tomeaningfully enforce those designations and regimes. None- theless, it is a very important accomplishment to have conservation planning and implementation moving forwardat a continental, even multicontinental, level among over a dozen countries. Russian Far East and Northern China _________________ There are many landscape-level protection and recovery efforts underway in this region, but I do not know of any thatapproach being continental in scope. Scientists from the116 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Johns The Wildlands Project Outside North America World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)\u2014both groups have a permanent and long-time presence in Asia\u2014have proposed a large-scale frame- work for tiger protection and recovery (Dinnerstein and others 1997). It includes the Russian Far East (RFE), India,Southern China, Indochina, and South East Asia. Within each of these regions, they have evaluated existing tiger populations, suitable habitat, and mortality pressures, andrecommended priorities for protection. They propose clus- ters of core areas and connectivity among them to maintain tiger populations. Habitat fragmentation, as well as habitatloss, is considered a major immediate threat. The solutions they propose are transboundary. Another large-scale effort involves increased coordination within Russia among Zapovedniks (Maleshin 1999; RCN Editors 1999b). Established over the decades, based on scientific findings of high biological value (ecosystem repre-sentation, not focal species), Zapovedniks have generally been managed fairly independently, notwithstanding cen- tralized funding. In the last decade, a lack of funding fromthe central government has driven Zapovednik leaders to seek joint solutions to their problems. Notwithstanding the economic driver, discussions of biological problems and jointstrategizing about dealing with islandization and other threats have occurred. Recognition of the importance of cooperation across Russian administrative boundaries andinternationally has also increased. Large-scale conservation planning and implementation in the RFE and Northern China is well underway. Interac-tion with similar efforts exists, but not day-to-day coordina- tion. One of the more important efforts is being led by the Wildlife Foundation, headquartered in Khabarovsk, andfounded by Alexander Kulikov and others (Wildlife Founda-tion 2000). The Foundation works with other regional non- governmental organizations (NGOs), international NGOs, and government agencies in Russia, China, Mongolia, andNorth Korea. Their work emphasizes protection of the Sibe- rian (Amur) tiger, Far Eastern leopard, Japanese and hooded cranes, and other rare, threatened, and endangered species. Protection of core areas by Zapovednik or other designa- tion, connectivity, and management of other areas for pro- tection are primary tools. Extensive biological analysis oftarget species, prey populations, habitat cover, and other factors underlies the mapping and proposed management regimes. The Foundation also works to stop poaching, tocooperate with the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) and government agencies on illegal trafficking, and to find economic alternatives to themost destructive, extractive activities. The Khabarovsk Krai Government, due to the Wildlife Foundation, its coopera- tors' efforts, and WWF funding, has committed to protecting10 percent of its land base in a system of connected cores. Protection of the region's top predator, the Amur or Sibe- rian tiger, has attracted many international NGOs andscientists. In 1995, Bruce Marcot identified three corridors that would link tiger habitat in the RFE and Northern China. The first, along the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, runsmostly north-south, linking various Zapovedniks, parks, and refuges. It also includes east-west linkages to important tiger habitat. Two other corridors are proposed: one linkingtiger habitat in Khaborovsk with tiger habitat in HeilongjiangProvince, China; and another linking habitat in Primorsky with that in Jilin Province, China, and North Korea. Miquelle and others (1999) and Pikunov and Miquelle (2001) developed a more comprehensive proposal for Far Eastern leopard and Amur tiger conservation that stretchesacross Northeast China and the RFE. They have recom- mended connecting existing and proposed protected areas with a system of corridors to create a core network. They alsorecommend protecting all potential habitat outside the core through a zoning system to delineate and appropriately manage high-priority tiger habitat. They argue that allremaining tiger habitat must be retained to sustain a mini- mum population of at least 500 tigers. Habitat outside of the core system would be managed to provide for sustainablehuman use compatible with tiger and leopard protection. Restrictions would include limited road access, low-inten- sity logging, and well-controlled ungulate hunting. The plancalls for transboundary connectivity at three points along the Sino-Russian border. The first step toward creation of transboundary protected areas has been taken with thecreation of the Hunchun Tiger and Leopard Reserve in Jilin Province, China. Khabarovsk has agreed to implement a refined version of this plan, while in Primorsky Krai, plan-ning is still in the early stages. As part of the same effort, Pikunov and others (2000) have proposed large, core-protected areas, connections, andregionwide zoning to ensure the survival of the Far East (Amur) leopard. They stress the problem of fragmentation and the need to protect very large areas and connect them.Without such action, human activity will continue to cause behavior changes and disrupted family structure that un- dermines successful reproduction, and the leopard will con-tinue sinking toward extinction. The Wildlife Conservation Society and the Heilongjiang Forestry Department sponsored a workshop in October 2000 to plan a transboundary tiger and leopard reserve and alsoto protect prey species (WCS 2000b). The New York Times reported on September 11, 2001, that a reserve was estab- lished on the Chinese side. Large predators are not the only focus of conservation in Asian Russia. The two pieces of Khingansky Zapovednik\u2014 home to endangered cranes and storks, as well as over 1,000vascular plants\u2014have been connected by creation of a spe- cial purpose preserve (Andronov 2000). The Zapovednik was enlarged earlier so that it would be big enough to contain allof the essential elements of critical hydrological processes. Anthropogenic fires started outside the reserve are a real threat to forests, and management changes have been pro-posed to address this problem. In Central Asia, where Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan border each other, the Argali sheep has been confined toislands in the high mountain ranges. Historically, these areas were connected, and the sheep seasonally used the lowlands. Efforts are underway to expand the twoZapovedniks in Russia, create new protected areas, and provide connectivity (Paltsyn 2001). In northwest Siberia, the 5-million-ha (19,305-mi 2) Great Vasyugan Bog is home to high plant and animal diversity. A protection plan span- ning several jurisdictions and watersheds is being imple- mented (Valutsky 2000). It includes several large core areasand connections.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 117Johns The Wildlands Project Outside North America In Kamchatka, the League of Independent Experts and others are proposing linkages among existing protectedareas and the creation of many new protected areas (Russian Academy of Sciences 2000). Before the fall of the Soviet Union, most of Kamchatka was off limits to exploitation, andthe region was shrouded in military secrecy. Since the Soviet demise, the region has opened up to exploitation while law enforcement has been weak. There is a tremendous urgencyto do the scientific work necessary to identify areas needed for protection; work done to date suggests much critical fish, avian, and bear habitat are not protected. This brief review of some major conservation work in Russian Asia and Northern China suggests some important similarities with North American conservation, including: Conservation has long been science based in Russia, perhaps back to the turn of the 19 th century (Weiner 1988); other countries such as China, and Mongolia have moved in that direction. There is widespread recognition, in the face of increased development and other threats, that existing protected areas are too small and need to include additional critical habitat. New protected areas are needed, or absent that, zoning is needed that effectively manages additional impor- tant habitat for biodiversity. Buffer zones are used to limit human activities to those that are compatible with the needs of species in adjacent protected areas. Predators are frequently emphasized in conservation planning and implementation as both umbrella and flagship species. Top predators, and in some cases large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, are a major focus in pro- tected area design. Connectivity, based on genetic, migration, and dis- persal needs of selected species, is a major focus. Transboundary approaches are common, spanning both intranational and international borders. Limiting roads and motorized or other illegal access are emphasized. There are also important differences that cannot be minimized: Continental-level planning is not well developed, and where it is emerging, it is driven by the need to develop economic support for protected areas, rather than by abiologically based strategy. Broad, multispecies based reserve design is occurring in some regions, but not most. High quality habitat is in many cases not proposed for status as a core protected area, but is zoned for multiple use with management regimes aiming to prevent habi-tat degradation, poaching, and so forth. Climate and other anthropogenic change is rarely noted as a criteria for reserve and connectivity design anddesignation. The ability of protected areas to contribute to the eco- nomic well-being of the adjacent communities is oftenstressed in justifying their continued existence and/or in proposals for new protected areas.It is not too surprising, given the many biological, demo- graphic, scientific, and even cultural similarities betweennorthern Asia and northern North America, that conserva- tion efforts should also show similarities. Differences be- tween the two large regions in economic stability, infrastruc-ture development, effectiveness of law enforcement, role of international borders, and stable funding for conservation are real and important. They call for different strategies, ifnot for different goals. Continental level coordination may emerge in the future, but for now Asia, even northern Asia, is very big, very diverse, and resources comparatively limited. South and Southeast Asia ________ The Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), founded in 1994, identifies habitat fragmentation as a major threat to wildlife, along with direct habitat loss (WPSI 2001).Illegal trafficking, understaffed protected area manage- ment and enforcement, and extractive encroachment are also high on the list of threats. The thrust of much WPSIactivity is on improved enforcement, especially poaching and international trade in tigers and tiger parts. Although committed to broad biodiversity protection, they see theBengal tiger as a flagship and an umbrella species. By protecting tiger habitat much else is protected. But tiger habitat is shrinking, not growing. Since 1973, India has lost one-half, or 50,000 km 2 (19,305 mi2), of its tiger habitat (Sahgal and Scarlott 2001). The number of tigers is down from 4,000 in 1990 to 3,000 now, and onlyabout 8 percent of the historic population of about 40,000 live in and around 26 reserves and parks. Like Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, and the Bob MarshallWilderness area, Indian reserves such as Ranthambhoreand Sariska were once linked by 150 miles of forest, but they are no more. Increasingly, forests are cut right to reserve boundaries, and even beyond. Illegal woodcutting and edgeeffects are not limited to poor villagers and desperate poach- ers, but to industrial logging, industrial mining, and hydro operations\u2014much of it driven by globalization and interna-tional financial institutions like the new, ecofriendly World Bank. The solution to this onslaught, Project Tiger advo- cates say, is bigger reserves and the re-establishment ofconnectivity. Dinnerstein and others (1999) agree that existing reserves are too s mall and cannot function as islands. Buffers must be expanded, access by nearby large human populations must be limited, and dispersal corridors must be recreated if tigers are to persist. Voluntary resettlement of those livingin protected areas is also considered essential, along with better enforcement: constant patrols, improved radio com- munications, armed backup, and an undercover strategy totackle professional poachers and smugglers, many of whom are primarily drug traffickers (Kumar and Wright 1999). Providing local people with a share in protected area rev-enues is also seen as important in gaining their needed support. Significant similarities exist between South Asian conser- vation work and North American work. Conservationists in southern Asia recognize:118 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Johns The Wildlands Project Outside North America Existing protected areas are too small and in many cases do not include the most biologically importantparts of the landscape. New protected areas are needed and existing protected areas need to be expanded, based on the principles ofconservation biology. Top predators are important as umbrella and flagship species; they are also important ecosystem regulators. Connectivity, based on genetic, migration, and dis- persal needs of selected species are critical in species survival; much if not most has been lost and it must berestored. A transboundary approach, spanning both intrana- tional and international borders, is required. Buffer zones around protected areas must limit human activities to those that are compatible with the needs of species in adjacent protected areas, and be sustainable. Access to protected areas must be limited; economic activities in protected areas are incompatible with protection. Unique characteristics of South Asia include: A greater emphasis is needed for improving basic en- forcement in the field and in the courtroom. A greater emphasis is required for antipoaching and to crack down on illegal trade in species. The need for generating revenue in buffer areas for local residents is important. Less emphasis on multispecies approaches in large- scale conservation. Connections are not strictly protected in most cases, but will have the status of buffer zones. Providing for change is rarely noted as a focus of plan- ning or protecting. Again, I do not think these similarities should be too surprising. South Asia and North America share habitat complexity: thousands of miles of temperate and subtropicalcoast line, a vast range of ecosystems, variants and grada- tions from the subtropical to the montane, striking seasonal variation, and much more. South Asia, of course, has beensettled longer and more intensively, and its indigenous cultural roots, notwithstanding British rule, still predomi- nate in ways that cannot be said of much of northern Asia orNorth America. Although parts of South Asia are heavily populated, it is worth remembering that Florida and Califor- nia, two of the most biodiverse areas of North America, areheavily populated and growing rapidly. Despite the popula- tion growth in both States\u2014and all that entails in a country where giving birth to a child also means giving birth toSUVs, TVs, and a host of other goods\u2014protected areas have increased and effective connectivity is being implemented (Barotz and Spitler 1998/1999; Preservation 2000/2001). Other Areas ____________________ Conservationists in other parts of the world are also focused on predators, the large scale, and connectivity. Jason Badridze in the Caucasus, the European Environ-mental Network, and the Large Carnivore Initiative in Europe are examples. In 1999, the Ukraine committed to more than doubling the amount of land in protected areasand to creating biological connectivity (RCN Editors 1999a). The Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in Namibia and SouthAfrica consists of about 38,000 ha (147 mi 2) and reflects the underlying ecological unity of the area (Shroyer and others 2001). The park's aims include protection of wild ungulates,including their migration needs, and predation regimes. An agreement between South Africa and Mozambique will foster comanagement of Kruger National Park and adjacentareas across the border, expanding the area of backcountry protection. Several other transnational protected areas are under creation or being linked and comanaged, including efforts between South Africa and Botswana, and South Af- rica, Namibia, and Angola. Project Wild is restoring megafauna such as elephant to Angola in an effort to recover ecosystemfunctiona lity. Many of the National Parks and transboundary parks are specifically providing for wilderness\u2014areas where humans will not visit in large numbers and managementwill be minimal. Due to the vast arid expanses of many parks and the presence of predators, jeep tracks, and some roads will be permitted, but access restricted. Discussion and Conclusions______ What is the source of the striking similarities found, first in the adoption of large-scale approaches, and second in their similarity? Some will suggest imperial influence. Whilehuman societies remain divided internally and among them- selves, in patterns of structured inequality that are proving very difficult to change, I do not think looking for an expla-nation there will get us very far. Yes, there are more U.S. scientists in India than the other way around and that can make a difference, but not, in this case, an essential one. All human societies share a single planet, and it is to the biotic and abiotic processes that we all owe our lives and livelihood. There is one nature, one Earth. All human soci- eties, despite their many differences and positions in theinternational economic and political order, have directly or indirectly, from growth in numbers and consumption, de- graded, destroyed, and fragmented habitat. The threatsmay vary in some detail, but the results are drearily the same. Thus, it should not be surprising that careful observ- ers around the globe would come to similar conclusions: if weare to stop the current extinction crisis, enough of the Earth must be set aside to allow ecological and evolutionary pro- cesses to recover and maintain their health with a minimumof human intervention. Looking at wide-ranging species and top predators is an important part of this approach. Whether one looks at processes or species, large protected areas andconnectivity seem little more than common sense. Other steps are important to conservation, including mak- ing human societies more Earth friendly. And on this topicthere is perhaps greater disagreement about strategies that must be pursued. But there is no substitute for basic and direct protection, and achieving it as I have just suggestedinvolves some essential actions. Lest I appear to be overstating the role of science, let me state clearly that science does not provide us with ourconservation values; it can only suggest means for realizing goals chosen on the basis of values (Johns 1999). Are the values underlying large-scale conservation driven by powerrelations? It would be foolish to deny any influence, but IUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 119Johns The Wildlands Project Outside North America think fundamentally it is not the case. Respect and love for nature exist in almost every culture to some degree, and ourdeep roots are all the same\u2014we were once hunter-gatherers. Beyond that, I think it not surprising that there are many in every culture that feel very strongly the bonds with all lifeand seek to protect it. While parallel evolution has thus contributed to the cur- rent convergence on large-scale conservation, diffusion ofideas has also played an important role. Foreman (1998/ 1999) and others (for example, Zahniser 2000) have set out the larger historical sweep of this; I want to focus morenarrowly on the last couple of decades. I believe that The Wildlands Project has had a profound influence\u2014far beyond its size\u2014on the conservation movement. Sometimes ourinfluence is acknowledged (Ankerson 1993; WCS 2000a,b), sometimes not. We, of course, have our own debts. And the process of influence is less linear than it is interactive. Briefly sketched, the immediate origins of the Wildlands model went something like this: in the early 1980s, Larry Harris of the University of Florida proposed landscapelinkages between reserves in that State. Reed Noss made a similar proposal for protected areas in Florida. In early 1985, Noss and Harris working together proposed a con-nected reserve network for northern Florida. Later that year, Noss developed a first Statewide map proposing con- nectivity across the entire State. In 1990, Archie Carr, alsoin Florida, but working on MesoAmerican conservation, conceived of Paseo Pantera. In 1991, the Paseo Pantera Project was born, and in the same year the first workshopwas held that led to a $3-billion plan for acquiring land for reserves and connectivity in Florida. In 1992, Noss pub- lished his Land Conservation Strategy article in Wild Earth . The human dimension,the way in which particular societ- ies\u2014and the way in which the global economy works through those societies\u2014degrade the natural world, does vary. Po- litical systems vary. Resources for conservation vary. Thesevariances call for a variety of strategies and specific objec- tives on the road to more common goals. Even here, however, there are similarities: What it is currently possible to achieve in conservation is inadequate\u2014we must change what is possible inorder to achieve our goals. We must push, push, push and never let up. While humans appear to exercise great power over nature\u2014at least destructive power\u2014and hence appear to define the context for nature, this is only appearance. Nature is the foundation of and context for all that we doand are. If, in our hubris we ignore this, the great tragedy of extinction will continue. There are two kinds of human hope. One is based on our psychological need to avoid despair\u2014we hope in order to keep from going crazy. Another kind of hope is based onan assessment of the state of things\u2014are they moving in a direction we consider hopeful, that is, toward good? We need to create the basis for that second sort of hope.I think we have started to do that with efforts across the globe aimed at large-scale conservation.References_____________________ Andronov, Vladimir. 2000. 22: 5-7.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014Wilderness values have always been of critical impor- tance to guide questions of wilderness policy, allocation, and stew-ardship. The Pinchot Institute report, Ensuring the Stewardship of the National Wilderness Preservation System, is driven by these wilderness values and will, hopefully, become a catalyst for action in the United States. Values of Wilderness ____________ Over the years, researchers and essayists have identified a long list of values that people hold toward wilderness. I have tried to put them into a manageable list of 10. 1. Historical Value. Some of this value is embodied in our vision of untrammeled space that looks and feels like it didin times past. Some value also is embodied in historical uses that were made of wilderness. 2. Recreational Value. That people value wilderness for cherished forms of recreation is well known and observed. Primitive and unconfined forms of recreation are often associated with wilderness. 3. Ecosystem Integrity Value. It has been observed that people often envision wilderness as the place where ecosys- tems are least disturbed by humans and where natural physical and biological processes operate. 4. Environmental Value. In this value set, we have those environmental services and functions that wilderness pro- vides so well, such as clean air and water, and diverse andnaturally occurring wildlife populations. 5. Landscape Value. Wilderness is often a place of undis- turbed landscapes and the backdrop of scenery for humanobservation from more developed and disturbed places. It is valued for its scenic and aesthetic qualities. 6. Scientific Value. Wilderness is valued as a place where baseline understanding of physical and biological processes can be obtained, and as a place where scientific experimen- tation and observation can be conducted without the con-founding nature of other human activities. 7. Spiritual Value. Given its vastness of scale and its untrammeled nature, wilderness often is viewed as a placewhere one can feel close to a creator or to the abstract called nature. For many, wilderness provides opportunity for self- reflection, meditation, and communion with spiritual things.8. Traditional Use Value. For some people wilderness provides the setting for playing out traditional uses ofhunting, fishing, camping, and woodsman skills. 9. Intellectual Value. The intellectual value of wilderness is expressed in writings about it, in song and art, and inmany forms of discourse among people. It often is valued for the freedom of intellect that it permits and fosters. 10. Economic Value. While most of the values ascribed to wilderness seem toward the anti-economic, wilderness also provides opportunity for employment and economic develop- ment. It generates economic value in that it attracts theinterests of people for both on- and offsite use and consideration. These values of wilderness are the fundamental factors that drive us to want to ensure that there is wilderness and that it is sustained over time. They are the values that should drive our consideration of principles used to guidewilderness stewardship, and they should drive our steward- ship choices. Pinchot Institute Report on Wilderness Stewardship in the United States ___________________ With these ideas about values of wilderness as back- ground, I will turn my attention to the Pinchot Institute report, Ensuring the Stewardship of the National Wilder- ness Preservation System . While this report is specific to the U.S.A., much of its content is relevant to other locales because it is based on an understanding of many of the values of wilderness. The Blue Ribbon panel that prepared the report was composed of 10 individuals from conservation organizations and academic institutions, and selected individuals retiredfrom Federal agencies, including a former U.S. Secretary of the Interior who was in office when the U.S. Wilderness Act was passed. I had the pleasure of serving as the chair of thepanel. It had two tasks: 1. Assessing the management of the National Wilderness Preservation System in contemporary society. 2. Making recommendations regarding the future of wil- derness stewardship and the sustainability of the system. Some of the questions asked by the panel were: Is wilderness taken seriously by land management agencies? Is the organizational location and level of wilderness stewardship positioned for real success? Are sufficient funding and staffing resources allocated to wilderness stewardship? Is stewardship clearly defined, and what kinds of stew- ardship are appropriate?Personal and Societal Values, and Wilderness Stewardship Perry Brown122 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Brown Personal and Societal Values, and Wilderness Stewardship Is there collaboration, cooperation, and consistency in wilderness stewardship across management agencies? Are wilderness clients being well served? Can wilderness training and research be improved and better focused? The panel focused on stewardship of a resource that has been growing in importance as a land use in the United States. The U.S. Wilderness Act passed Congress and wassigned by the President in September 1964, 37 years ago. Since the passage of the Act, the system has grown from over 10 million acres (4 million ha) in 54 units, to over 105 millionacres (43 million ha) in over 600 units. From surveys, literature, music, behavior, and experience, we know that wilderness is more important to the American people thanever before. While the panel found that there were some very good examples of wilderness stewardship, it also found areas ofmajor and minor concern. Some significant and serious contemporary dilemmas of wilderness stewardship were identified: Ensuring both naturalness and wildness. That wilderness is not isolated from its surrounding landscape. Manipulating wilderness conditions is philosophically and practically problematic. That the place of recreational use in wilderness has not been made very clear. That agency organization and commitment to steward- ship are needed for success, but they often seem lacking. That excelling in an information exchange environment implemented through modern information technologies is new and challenging. In reviewing the values of wilderness, the questions that emerged about wilderness stewardship, these contempo- rary dilemmas, and the track record of the wilderness management agencies over the past 37 years, eight Prin- ciples for Wilderness Stewardship were formulated by the Panel. We believe that these principles should guide all wilderness stewardship in the United States, and that mostof them are applicable to wilderness stewardship anywhere it occurs. These principles are: 1. Adhering to the Wilderness Act is a fundamental prin- ciple for stewardship in the United States. 2. United States wilderness areas are to be treated as a system of wilderness. 3. Wilderness areas are special places and they are to be treated as special. 4.Stewardship should be science-informed, logically planned, and publicly transparent. 5. Nondegradation of wilderness should fundamentally guide stewardship activities. 6. Preservation of wilderness character is a guiding idea of the Wilderness Act. 7. Recognizing the wild in wilderness distinguishes wil- derness from most other land classes. 8. Accountability is basic to sound stewardship. These principles led the Panel to formulate a set of recommendations that, if implemented, would shape thefuture for success in wilderness stewardship. The six broad recommendations are:1. Wilderness agencies and their leaders must make a strong commitment to wilderness before the wilderness islost. 2. Wilderness agencies must organize to maximize stew- ardship effectiveness and to develop a fully integrated stew-ardship system. 3. Wilderness planning must be accelerated and plans prepared for the guidance of stewardship activities. 4. Science, education, and training programs should be enhanced to provide information, professional expertise, and public support for wilderness stewardship. 5. Wilderness agencies should create wilderness stew- ardship positions and career opportunities from top to bot- tom and deploy financial resources for the explicit steward-ship and support of wilderness. 6. Accountability for the maintenance and sustainability of the wilderness system must be embraced by the wilder-ness agencies. While we were critical of the state of the system and many of the things that are being done, and the absence of things that need to be done, we also found several activities ongoing today that are helpful in leading us toward wildernessstewardship. We need to accelerate them and more quickly learn how to steward our wilderness resource. The Wilderness Information Network (www.wilderness. net) is one such activity. This Web site is a focal point for information about wilderness, wilderness training, and wil- derness research. It is multiagency in function and support,and demonstrates how information can be managed and shared to provide a repository of wilderness information for everyone. The Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center and the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute are interagency centers advancing understanding of wilderness and the continuous training of wilderness professionals.Their success as interagency cooperatives has varied over time, but they demonstrate that it is possible to construct interagency, collaborative units. There are also severalcollaborating institutions in Alaska that provide examples of information and policy bodies that are instructive for collaborative work. While there are good things happening today, the bottom line of our report is the need to forge an integrated and collaborative system across the four wilderness managementagencies. This is something that we have not done in our 37 years of wilderness stewardship, since the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. Our agencies operate as if there werefour wilderness systems, not one, and it is high time that we got on with developing one integrated system. To move in this direction we proposed four specific recommendations for theSecretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, the ministers who oversee the wilderness stewardship agencies. 1. The Secretaries should issue joint policies and regula- tions specifying common interpretations of law, and thus provide broad guidelines for the stewardship of wilderness. 2. The Secretaries should devise an organizational struc- ture to make stewardship happen across the agencies so that a high quality wilderness system is continued in perpetuity. 3. The Secretaries should devise monitoring and evalua- tion systems to ensure that we know how well wilderness areas are being stewarded, especially in the context of aUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 123Personal and Societal Values, and Wilderness Stewardship Brown system of wildernesses, and they should reinstitute regular reporting on the state of the system. 4. The Secretaries should develop a means of informing the American people about the National Wilderness Preser- vation System and about their wilderness heritage. The same general needs likely exist for wilderness every- where. They are to build and steward a system of wilder-nesses focused on the values that wilderness brings to the human condition, especially in the relations of humans to their sustaining environment. The framework for action prescribed in our report is one that can lead to effective stewardship and development of a National Wilderness Preservation System. Recognizing themany good examples of wilderness stewardship that have been implemented over the past 37 years, we can adopt a set of principles for stewardship, implement actions that willshape the future for success, and work toward ensuring the existence of a truly integrated National Wilderness Preser-vation System. That is our challenge, as the values of wilderness become our stewardship responsibility. Reference______________________ Pinchot Institute for Conservation. 2001.

This initiative is believed to haveconsiderable potential benefits for the conservation of Lake St. Lucia: to bring about a significant addition of conservation-worthy land to the St. Lucia Wetland World Heritage Site, to make impor-tant contributions to the conservation of the unique natural commu- nities of the area, and to promote tourism in a portion of the St. Lucia system not previously available to the public. Overall, this isexpected to create employment opportunities in one of the poorer parts of the country, stimulate the local economy, and benefit local communities in other ways. Commercial afforestation, combinedwith tourism (and ecotourism), will continue in portions of the system that are most suitable for these uses, but in a manner compatible with its World Heritage Site status. From a wildernessconservation viewpoint, it will add a protective internal buffer to the southeastern portions of the park, isolating the lake and terrestrial wildernesses from disturbance from the developed areas along the principal road and rail access routes to the west of the park. Historical Perspectives___________ Lake St. Lucia, in the northeastern portion of KwaZulu- Natal Province, is the largest natural water body in South Africa. It has an international reputation because of its historical background, its considerable natural beauty andtourism appeal, and its significant natural resources, many of which have considerable scientific value. These were among the considerations that led to the appointment of the St. Lucia Commission of Enquiry in 1964. The Commission was instructed to investigate alleged threats to the survival of plant and animal life of the lake,and factors causing high salinity levels in drought years, which at times were higher than that of the sea. The salinity regime is the principal physical factor that determines whatRationalization of the Commercial Afforestation Program on the WesternShores of Lake St. Lucia for Nature and Wilderness Conservation, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa William R. Bainbridge species, and hence ecosystem states, that may occur in the system at any stage. The Commission was instructed torecommend a solution that would best suit the lake and surrounding agriculture, forestry, and domestic and com- mercial water needs in the total catchment area (Commis-sion of Enquiry, Lake St. Lucia 1966; Taylor 1991). The recommendations of the Commission were comprehen- sive and far reaching. Important recommendations included: The phasing out of plantations that had been established in the immediate vicinity of the lake, and consolidation of this land with other areas to increase the extent of theprotected area surrounding Lake St. Lucia. Placement of the lake and the expanded protected area under a single management authority. Unfortunately, these recommendations were largely ig- nored by the apartheid government of the day. The threats to the lake were in fact intensified in the early 1990s by thesame government (Bainbridge 1993/4), when a proposal toimplement dune mining in the coastal dune cordon on the Eastern Shores of the lake was given serious consideration (Tinley 1985). It was anticipated that this form of stripmining had the potential to cause significant negative im- pacts on freshwater flows into the lake. However, this threat was averted by concerted public opposition from local andinternational environmentalists (Bainbridge 1993/4; Brooks and others 1993; Dominy 1992; Leon and others 1993). An important additional benefit of this campaign to pre- vent dune mining was the decision by the government to remove 5,600 ha (13,840 acres) of manmade forests from the Eastern Shores, which was in itself a noteworthy achieve-ment for the environmental movement. However, this deci- sion did not at that time affect any of the plantations on the Western Shores, despite the negative impacts on this sensi-tive environment. Importance of the St. Lucia Wetland World Heritage Site______________ Importance for Nature Conservation Lake St. Lucia is the estuary on the Mkuze River, but it also receives water from a number of other smaller rivers and streams. Although these are all relatively small riversby African standards, St. Lucia is one of the largest, if not the128 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Bainbridge Rationalization of the Commercial Afforestation Program on the Western Shores of Lake St. Lucia... largest, estuarine system on the African Continent. The lake is located in the Maputaland Coastal Plain at the southern-most extremity of the Mozambique Coastal Plain, which lies along the east coast of Africa between Somalia in the north and Zululand in the northeastern corner of KwaZulu-NatalProvince in South Africa. Lake St. Lucia and its associated terrestrial, wetland, and marine environments have long been regarded as having major importance for nature con-servation and tourism, and calls made for its protection (Bruton and Cooper 1980; Delagorgue 1990; Ellis 1975; Frost 1990; Taylor 1991). These are now protected in themost important coastal protected area in the country, known as the Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park, with an area of just under 290,000 ha (716,600 acres). The importance of this area has been recognized for over a century. International recognition of the importance of the area was accorded when the area was included in twoWetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention in 1975 (Jackson 1992a), and admitted to the World Heritage Site (WHS) list in 1999\u2014the first SouthAfrican site to be accorded this prestigious status (KwaZulu- Natal Nature Conservation Service 1999). A complete description of the importance of the area for nature conservation is provided in its nomination proposal for WHS satus (KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Ser- vice 1999). Among the many important attributes thatshould receive mention is the role of the lake as a breeding ground and nursery for marine organisms. Wildernesses of the Park There has long been appreciation that extensive portions of the park remain substantially unmodified by technologi- cal man, and still retain the near-pristine condition thatpertained when the park was occupied by early hunter- gatherer people, well into the twentieth century. This is one of the last remaining coastal areas to survive with itswilderness character still largely intact, which is one of the reasons why the park was awarded WHS status (Bainbridge 2001). A high proportion of the park has been zoned as wilderness by administrative arrangement for several decades, but these zones have been revised as part of the managementplan for the WHS (LSDI 2000; Bainbridge and others 2000). Included in the wilderness zones are an extensive area of the eastern portion of the lake itself and a large area of land inthe central portion of the park, together with adjacent marine sanctuary areas in both the central part of the park and in the north (fig. 1). These are the only remaining coastal wildernesses in the country. It is envisaged that these wilderness zones will be entrenched in law, in terms of recent legislation. Althoughnot yet afforded legal protection as wilderness areas per se, they enjoy secure legal protection in terms of several stat- utes, including the World Heritage Convention Act of 1999.The St. Lucia wildernesses are nevertheless vulnerable to disturbance from several quarters, especially from develop- ment in the western peripheries of the park. This explainsthe importance of the land-use rationalization exercise on the Western Shores.Afforestation on the Western Shores ________________________ Extent of Western Shores Plantations As noted above, the program to establish commercial timber plantations on State land on the Eastern and West- ern Shores of Lake St. Lucia was initiated by the (then) Department of Forestry nearly 50 years ago. There has beenpersistent public opposition to this program from the outset, since environmentalists were aware of the potential harm- ful impacts on the wetland systems and the lake itself.However, the environmental movement at that stage was not well organized, and this official arm of government remained impassive, so the program was continued andexpanded. By the start of the present millennium, the total extent of the manmade forests on the Western Shores was approximately 23,700 ha (58,560 acres) (Zaloumis and oth-ers 1999). Indications of the Impacts of the Western Shores Plantations on FreshwaterSupplies to Lake St. Lucia Typically, the lake has a highly variable salinity regime. During extensive periods of low rainfall, sea water moves into the system, and salinity levels may be as high as 90 parts per thousand. In wet seasons, the freshwater inputsfrom streamflow and seepage result in almost total flushing of the salt. These changes are accompanied by enormous and changing biodiversity. However, while halophylic speciesare able to retreat to the sea in times of low salinity, and areable to recolonize the lake when conditions favorable to them are re-established, survival options for freshwater species under hypersaline conditions are more restricted. Plantsmay recolonize the lake from the feeder rivers and swamps. Animals, however, are entirely dependent on refugia main- tained in sites with adequate, permanent freshwater inputs. A high proportion of the water in the lake system is derived from ground-water seepage and rainfall. From the above, it is obvious that in times of drought, the importanceof freshwater inputs assumes critical proportions (KwaZulu- Natal Nature Conservation Service 1999; Taylor 1991, 1998). Tinley (1971) considered the ground-water seepage to becritically important for maintaining salinity at acceptable levels in periods of drought. Jackson (1992b) estimated that the desiccating effect of the plantations on the WesternShores has reduced dry season flow of freshwater from the Mpate River (the catchment of which is entirely contained in the Western Shores) by as much as 45 percent. Decision to Privatize the Plantations of the Western Shores The South African government has, in recent years, devel- oped a policy to privatize a number of State assets, including the extensive timber plantations of the South African For-estry Company Ltd. (SAFCOL), which succeeded the previ- ous Department of Forestry.

A private company,Siyaqhubeka Ltd., with both forestry and ecotourism inter- ests, was accepted as the preferred bidder for the Western Shores plantation. Study to Rationalize Portions of the Western Shores Plantation________ Initial Study and Zoning Proposals At about the same time, the government established the Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative (LSDI), an arm of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, to develop a new access route between northeastern KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique, and to promote economic develop- ment in this previously economically deprived area. Promo- tion of tourism was selected as one means of stimulating thelocal economy and creating jobs, and it was decided that development of the new World Heritage Site should form a part of this program. LSDI was also given responsibility forthe establishment of a Park Authority in terms of the WHS Act, with responsibility for the development of an Integrated Development Plan for the park, which incorporates a tour-ism development plan (LSDI 2000). Following the announcement to privatize the plantations of the Western Shores, LSDI was instructed by the govern-ment to commission a study to investigate the plantations. This study showed that certain portions of the plantations, especially those in the western extremity of the plantationarea away from the park, were well suited for commercialafforestation and were not causing significant impacts to the park itself. In contrast, other portions in the immediate peripheries of the park were of similar character to the St.Lucia Wetland WHS in that they contained areas of conser- vation-worthy natural communities and wetlands, and also contained plantations that had been established on hydro-morphic soils. In addition, as might be expected by virtue of its proximity to the park, the area was considered to have significant potential for tourism (Zaloumis and others 1999). The study proposed a zoning system for the area to be privatized included two primary zones: A Commercial Afforestation Zone, comprising areas suited for commercial afforestation. A Natural Zone, comprising areas of conservation-wor- thy natural communities and incorrectly sited planta-tions capable of rehabilitation back to a near-natural state, for consolidation with the park. These proposals had the effect of reducing the extent of the plantations offered out to tender by approximately one- third, but were nevertheless found to be acceptable by both the government and the preferred bidder. Acceptance by thelatter was subject to the proviso that the area of plantation remaining should be economically viable. It was also based on the stated policy of the company to adhere to the prin-ciples and criteria for sustainable forestry set by the For- estry Stewardship Council (FSC) (FSC 1999). Inclusion of the proposed Natural Zone might have prejudiced their FSCaccreditation (Bainbridge and others 2000).The government subsequently instructed the parties to negotiate on the most acceptable means of delineating thetwo zones, with the aim of retaining plantations on nonsen- sitive sites and with the least possible impact on their economic viability; and selecting a consolidated naturalarea, as above, to be incorporated into the protected area as part of the WHS, and restored to its natural state by removal of the plantations present and implementation of a rehabili-tation program (Zaloumis and Brummer 2001). Delineation of a Boundary to Separate the Zones A technical team comprising professional representatives of the principal stakeholders was appointed to providedelineation criteria for a boundary to separate the two zones. The recommended criteria included the presence of impor- tant natural communities, water source areas, and wetlandsfor the Natural Zone, and the presence of soils most suitable for afforestation for the Commercial Afforestation Zone. A reconnaissance study was implemented to identify broadgroupings of these. The study suggested that a boundary following natural features would best satisfy these aims. A standard rectilinear artificial boundary proved unsuitableto separate the complex mosaic patterns of natural commu- nities. The solution adopted was to site a natural boundary separating broad soils groupings (essentially the interfacebetween dryland soils and wetland or hydromorphic soils), by use of soil augurs, as described in the Procedure for the Identification and Delineation of Wetland and RiparianHabitats (Land-Use and Wetland /Riparian Habitat Work-ing Group 2001). The intention was to site the boundary on an alignment suitable for construction of a permanent road track, following the principles for establishment of valleybottom cutoff roads. Conclusions____________________ This curvilinear natural boundary has provided a satis- factory solution to separation of the two zones, and has beendelineated over a distance of 158 km (98 miles) throughout the entire length of the Western Shores. It has been fixed by Geographic Positioning System points, and will be regis-tered as the cadastral boundary for excision of the area for permanent inclusion within the park. Summary of the Principal Achievements of the Initiative The principal achievements of this planning exercise are: The South African government has decided to excise an area (fig. 2) of approximately 9,000 ha (22,240 acres), which is to be restored back to a near-natural condition andconsolidated with the park. A time schedule of 5 years has been set for the removal of 2,000 to 3,000 ha (4,940 to 7,140 acres) of timber in this area and completion of the restora-tion program. This area contains important natural com- munities, water source areas, and wetlands, which will addUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 131Rationalization of the Commercial Afforestation Program on the Western Shores of Lake St. Lucia...

The area is expected to form part of theSt. Lucia Wetland World Heritage Site, following comple- tion of the restoration operations. The change in land use is also expected to benefit the WHS by improvement of crucial freshwater supplies into the lake following removal of the timber planta- tions, and by the provision of access for tourists for thefirst time to the western portions of the lake. The changes will also benefit the wilderness areas (fig. 1), since it will form an additional buffer within the park, toprotect the wildernesses from development in the west- ern peripheries of the park. The remaining plantations, with a total area of about 15,000 ha (37,000 acres), are considered to form an economically viable enterprise, and will constitute a sustainable land use in the peripheries of the park. The proposals conform to the requirements for the establishment of a Biosphere Reserve. The exercise will make important contributions to both the national and local economies, and provide a signifi- cant number of permanent jobs.

Certain indicators of experience quality were found to be more important than others, depending upon user group. Forexample, experiencing solitude was much more important for boat- ers who used the full river or river and lake sections of the waterway, versus boaters who only used lake sections. Emotional/symbolic andfunctional place attachment were measured for different user groups. Lake users reported higher levels of agreement to emotional/sym- bolic and functional place attachment than river users. Comparedto lake users with a relatively low emotional/symbolic attachment, lake users with high attachment levels indicated a stronger desire for solitude and experiencing an undeveloped area with lightlyimpacted campsites. Indicators of experience quality involving careless or disrespectful resource impacts was important regardless of type of user group, and it did not matter whether users had high or low levels of agreement to place attachment statements. Introduction ____________________ The St. Croix International Waterway is a complex of lakes and river segments stretching approximately 115 miles (185 km) along the border of eastern Maine and New Brunswick. The waterway is comprised of three major geo-graphic zo nes: (1) a headwater lakes and river section char- acterized by mostly undeveloped shoreline, (2) a lower river section of developed and industrialized river, and (3) a tidalestuary and bay system. This study is concerned exclusively with the headwater lakes and upper river section. This region is the longest stretch of undeveloped internationalwaterway east of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area ofFactors Influencing Experience Quality: Comparing User Groups and PlaceAttachment at the St. Croix International Waterway John J. Daigle Jamie Hannon Cynthia Stacey Minnesota and Ontario (SCIWC 1998). It is listed as one of Maine's Twenty Outstanding Rivers, and it is officially recognized as the St. Croix Waterway Recreation Area by the Province of New Brunswick (fig. 1). Most significantly,the St. Croix was included in the Canadian National Heritage river system in 1991, the first such designation in Atlantic Canada. Because the waterway is an international boundary, rec- reation and resource management is conducted by several agencies, including the International Joint Commission, theBureau of Parks and Lands and the State Forest Service in Maine, and the Department of Natural Resources and En- ergy in New Brunswick. In 1986, a Memorandum of Under-standing between Maine and New Brunswick created the St. Croix International Waterway Commission, an advisory agency, which has since taken the lead in studying water-way-related issues and coordinating planning for futurewaterway management needs. In a 1993 report, the St. Croix International Waterway Commission noted, \"distinct land and water management policies are applied without inte-gration on opposite sides of the waterway, leaving it vulner- able to incompatible uses and potential quality loss\" (SCIWC Figure 1\u2014Originally intended to recognize multiple uses of the 32,000 miles of rivers and streams, the Maine Rivers Act (MRA) states theneed for balance among various uses. The MRA specifically recog- nizes the need to protect outstanding rivers that provide unparalleled natural and recreational values, including unique recreational activitiesand solace from an industrialized society. Here, overnight canoeists travel the lower river section of the St. Croix International Waterway. 134 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Daigle, Hannon, and Stacey Factors Influencing Experience Quality: Comparing User Groups and Place Attachment... 1993). One of the key goals developed by the commission was to protect and provide for the continuation of quality recre-ational experiences, especially traditional backcountry ca- noe trips. Providing quality recreational experiences while preserv- ing the natural character of the St. Croix International Waterway poses some significant challenges (fig. 2). Pri- mary among these is the unique combination of naturalsetting and accessibility, and nearness to major population centers in the United States and Canada. The waterway is within a day's drive of 32 million people, and is well knownregionally as an excellent canoe trip with summer water and easy, enjoyable whitewater. No agency currently places any kind of entry fee or use regulation on visits to the waterway,and recreational use is essentially unmanaged. Key to protecting backcountry experiences of the St. Croix International Waterway is an understanding of the differentaspects of the visitor experience and recognizing which of these are important to visitors. These indicators of experi- ence quality are measurable variables that help define thequality of the recreation experience and standards of quality that define the minimum acceptable conditions (Manning 1999). Good indicators are practical to measure quantita-tively, sensitive to the type and amount of use, and poten- tially responsive to management control (Lucas and Stankey 1985; Watson and others 1998). They are used in managerialplanning cycles such as Limits of Acceptable Change (Stankey and others 1985) or Visitor Impact Management (Graefe and others 1990) along with standards to guide the implementa-tion of management strategies and monitoring efforts. Several studies examining indicators of quality have re- vealed some variables to be more important than others(Manning 1999). For example, litter and other signs ofvisitor use impacts appear to be more important to recre- ation users compared to management-related impacts such as signs and presence of rangers. Social indicators of quality,especially those dealing with behaviors or types of other user groups at secluded campsite locations, are more importantthan ecological indicators. Visitors to more primitive areas or sites may be generally more sensitive to a variety ofpotential indicators of quality than visitors to more highly used and developed areas or sites. On the St. Croix Interna- tional Waterway, users have unrestricted access to bothprimitive and developed sites and a wide range of water- oriented opportunities. The situation suggests the need to understand the diverse recreation experiences and indica-tors of quality. Matching the experiences visitors seek with opportunity settings best suited to providing those experiences is one ofthe major challenges to the outdoor recreation manager (Clark and Stankey 1979). On one hand, a user allocates personal resources (primarily time and money) to produce adesired recreational experience (Jubenville 1986). Users engage in a leisure activity with the expectation that it will fulfill selected needs, motivations, or other desired states(Schreyer 1986). Daigle and others (2002) report that choice of a particular leisure activity may not only be closely related to the specific benefits people derive, or believe they derive,but also tied to the perceived likelihood that the benefits will be produced. On the other hand, a manager provides a site by combining various managerial inputs (physical develop-ment, regulation, resource management) with the specific environmental setting (Jubenville 1986). Identifying the consequences of management actions is extremely impor-tant because those actions can attract or deter a given clientele group to a particular setting (Clark and Stankey 1979). For example, while some users may approve of man-agement actions (for example, easier access), others may disapprove and be forced to adjust expectations (for ex- ample, seeing more users). Increasing access may changethe type or number of visitors, and that in turn may influ-ence the likelihood of fulfilling certain user desires (for example, secluded travel and camping). In this scenario, a certain clientele group may be displaced because the settingis not likely to meet their needs. Understanding these dynamics may be especially important in terms of a \"home range\" for assessing relative availability of, and demand for,different types of place-related opportunities for activities and experiences sought within a particular region (Daigle and others 1994). A number of studies have examined place attachment as a construct for understanding the relationship visitors have to particular settings and as a tool for resource planning(Moore and Graefe 1994; Warzecha and others 2000; Watson and others 1991, 1992; Williams and others 1992). Warzecha and others (2000) found that users of the Green and ColoradoRivers had different levels of agreement with emotional/ symbolic and functional place attachment to each setting, as well as between settings. Place attachment is embedded infeelings for a specific place in contrast to specific attributes of a place necessary for a particular activity (Schreyer and others 1981). Users' opinions regarding place attachment torivers appeared to be related to the levels of importance they attached to motives for taking the trip. In addition, users with high levels of agreement to place attachment with theirrespective rivers attached different levels of importance to motives. There was a stronger desire for wild land experi- ences and management actions that provide opportunitiesfor those types of experiences at one particular setting. The authors conclude that in order to optimize the likelihood of Figure 2\u2014Better access, light and durable canoes, and growing popularity of other self-propelled watercraft such as kayaks are a fewreasons for the increased diversity of use and user groups. Here a day user runs the rapids at Little Falls on the upper river section of the St. Croix International Waterway. USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 135Daigle, Hannon, and Stacey Factors Influencing Experience Quality: Comparing User Groups and Place Attachment... meeting visitors' needs at that particular site, it is appropri- ate to consider several different management strategiesintended to provide a diversity of experience opportunities. The purpose of this article is to examine experience qual- ity domains and the relationship of these domains to differ-ent user groups and their place attachment to the St. Croix International Waterway. First, we answer the question, \"Which indicators are important in defining the experiencequality of St. Croix International Waterway visitors?\" Sec- ond, we identify users' relationship to resource in terms of emotional/symbolic and functional place attachment fordifferent groups. Rather than examining differing levels of agreement of place attachment for overall users to a specific place or compared to other places, we focus on the diverseusers of the St. Croix International Waterway. Methods for Experience Quality and User Group Comparisons ________ In response to the Waterway Commission's strong desire, among others, to protect opportunities for secluded back- country canoe travel and camping, we employed a similarvisitor survey approach conducted by Watson and others (1992). A random sampling scheme was utilized, and a modified Dillman (1983) mailing approach was implemented.The survey methodology has been described in detail else- where (Stacey and Daigle 2000). Approximately 404 useable questionnaires were returned, for an overall response rate of62 percent. This extensive, self-administered, mail-back questionnaire was designed to provide information on a variety of variables related to use and user characteristics onthe waterway. Based on a literature review and feedback from resource specialists familiar with the St. Croix Waterway, we devel- oped 22 items to assess social, resource, and managementconditions that may affect the quality of visitor experiences. Respondents rated the significance of items defining the quality of experience on the waterway on a 5-point Likertscale ranging from \"I care about the item 'not at all' to 'extremely'.\" The responses were subjected to factor analysis with varimax rotation, using principal-components extrac-tion (SPSS 1999). The number of factors was determined by evaluating eigenvalues created from the factor analysis (Kaiser 1960) and examining \"scree\" or the break in theplotted line of eigenvalues (Kass and Tinsley 1979). The internal consistency of each experience dimension scale was assessed using reliability analysis (Cronbach 1951).Cronbach's alpha coefficients were computed for each set of items comprising each experience dimension. Although the procedure maximizes the differences be- tween selected factors while minimizing the differences within them, it does not express the magnitude to which respondents relate to a given factor. Based on variablesdefining each dimension, a mean scale score was developed as a \"strength-of-importance\" measure to compare the mag- nitude of importance of each dimension across user groups.As an example, we computed a mean scale score for the dimension we labeled \"careless or disrespectful resource impacts\" by first adding the scale scores for the va riables that loaded for this factor [var1 (amount of litter I see on the riverbanks) + var2 (amount of litter I see around the camp site)+ var3 (number of trees at campsites that have been dam- aged by people)] and then dividing the total score by 3, thenumber of variables in this particular dimension. Mean scale scores for the 3 dimensions were developed for the combined user groups, as well as for defined user subgroups. In a previous publication based on data from this survey (Hannon and others 2002), we provided evidence for unique user subgroups of the St. Croix Waterway. The groups aredistinguished by demographic and visit characteristics, mode of travel, and prior experience in the waterway area. They utilize distinct, sometimes overlapping zones within thewaterway, each of which is defined by geographic features and accessibility. The first regional group is that which utilized the upper lakes, a diverse group of motorized andhuman-propelled visitors, about half of whom were over- night visitors. The next is that which utilized the lower lakes, primarily day-use fishers. The third is that whichutilized only the upper river, a section typified by quick water and numerous, easy rapids. The fourth is that which utilized the full 40-mile (64-km) river section, combining thequick water of the upper river with a more remote and placid lower section. The final user group traveled on both a lake and the 40-mile river section and stayed out for 2 or morenights. We used one-way analysis of variance to compare mean scale scores of the importance of experience quality for eachfactor across respondents in user subgroups. The compari- son yielded insight on the variation of importance for certain experience dimensions among user groups. Tukey post hoctests of pair-wise differences in means were used to identify significant differences in average degree of importance for the dimensions between user groups. Differences were re-ported at the p < 0.05 level of significance. Results of Experience Quality and User Group Comparisons ________ The factor analysis of the 22 items related to the impor- tance of items that influence the quality of respondent's experience on the St. Croix International Waterway sug- gests that they could be grouped into four dimensions.Kaiser's criterion of retaining factor eigenvalues 1 and Cattell's methods of retaining the number of factors above the break, or scree, were used to assist in identifying the fourdimensions. Considering variables with factor loading 0.5, we labeled the four dimensions as (1) careless or disrespect- ful resource impacts, (2) management activities, (3) solitude,and (4) resource impact/development. For the four factors, total variance was 59.37 percent. The management activi- ties factor, containing variables such as \"water level forboating conditions\" and \"availability of a toilet, picnic table and firepit at campsite,\" was not retained for the other analyses because of a low Cronbach's alpha coefficient ofitems making up the factor. The item correlations were of an acceptable magnitude for the other factors (Alpha = 0.91, 0.85, and 0.78, for solitude, careless or disrespectful resourceimpacts, and resource impact/development, respectively). The items for each of these remaining factors were therefore averaged to form mean scale scores. We compared mean scale scores for each factor on a user group basis (table 1). The dimension of careless or disre spectful136 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Daigle, Hannon, and Stacey Factors Influencing Experience Quality: Comparing User Groups and Place Attachment... resource impact had the overall highest mean scale score (4.21) for the combined user groups. Statistically significantdifferences in levels of importance were demonstrated among Extended Trippers (4.50) and Lower Lakes (4.00) user groups. The importance of this factor as compared to the otherfactors for all user groups is consistent with other authors' findings that litter is the most highly ranked influence on experience quality (for example, Roggenbuck and others1993; Whittaker 1992). In contrast to the careless or disrespectful behavior factor, the importance of things that influence the quality ofrespondent's experience associated with solitude was more variable among user groups. Statistically significant differ- ences in levels of importance were found between Full River(3.85), Extended Tripper (3.77) users groups, and Upper Lakes (3.01), Upper River (2.98), and Lower Lakes (2.46) user groups. In addition, statistically significant differencesin levels of importance were found between Upper Lakes, Upper River user groups and the Lower Lakes user group. The mean scale score for the combined user groups was 3.15.The top three items in the solitude factor (\"amount of noise associated with human activities on the waterway,\" \"amount of noise associated with human activities away from thewaterway,\" and \"number of other groups that camp in sight or sound of my site\") all rated more than moderately impor- tant. These top items are not related to numbers of encoun-ters (\"number of large groups that I see along the waterway,\" \"number of boats I see along the waterway,\" and \"the percent of time other people are in sight while I am boating\"), but areindicative of types of visitor behavior, especially intrusivenoise. This finding is consistent with that of several studies reported in Manning (1999), and that solitude or seclusionevaluations involve more than just the number of people met during a trip (Watson 1995). The importance of experiencing an undeveloped area, lightly impacted campsite, factor was compared across the five user groups. Variables making up this factor included \"forestry operations visible from the river,\" \"the visibility oflights originating outside the waterway,\" \"the visibility of camps and homes along the shore,\" \"the amount of vegeta- tion loss and bare ground around a campsite,\" and \"numberof makeshift camps created by visitors.\" Statistically signifi- cant differences in levels of importance for this factor were demonstrated between Extended T ripper (3.51), Full River (3.51) user groups, and the Upper Lakes (3.03), LowerLakes (2.75) user groups. In addition, the Up per River (3.22) user group was found to be significantly different thanthe Lower Lakes user group. The three user groups thatutilized the river for all or part of their trip placed muchhigher emphasis on the importance of campsite conditions ininfluencing the quality of their visit. Cameron and Stacey(2001) report that the campsites associated with the riverare more heavily impacted by use than are the campsites onthe lakes. Also, it is not surprising that the Lower Lakes usergroup placed little importance on the condition of campsitesbecause only 24 percent reported an overnight stay. We would like to note certain things that were important to all user groups but did not load into a distinct factor orthere was poor inter-item reliability of variables making upthe management factor. For example, \"water level for boat-ing conditions\" and \"the availability of a toilet, picnic table,and fire pit at a campsite location\" were rated moderately tovery important for all user groups. The Extended Trippersand Full River user groups had the most concern for solitudeand naturalness conditions; however, similar to the otheruser groups, they thought these management activitieswere important things influencing experience quality. Fi-nally, \"bank erosion at campsites,\" which did not load intoany factor was rated moderately to very important for all user groups. Methods for User Group and Place Attachment Comparisons ___________________ To measure emotional/symbolic and functional place at- tachment, our study used place attachment statements from previous research by Watson and others (1992) and similarto recent research by Warzecha and others (2000). Five statements measured emotional/symbolic attachment: This place means a lot to me. I feel no commitment to this place. I feel like this place is a part of me. I am very attached to this place. I identify strongly with this place. Seven statements measured functional attachment: I would not substitute any other area for doing the types of things I did here. I get more satisfaction out of visiting this place than from visiting any other recreation place.Table 1\u2014A user group comparison of mean scale scores related to importance of experience quality from a 1998 survey of St. Croix International Waterway visitors.

I enjoy doing the types of things I did here in the area more than in any other place. This area is the best place for the things I like to do. The time I spent here could have just as easily been spent somewhere else. No other place can compare to this area. This place makes me feel like no other place can. Respondents rated the place attachment statements for the St. Croix International Waterway on a 5-point Likert scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" A numeri-cal value was assigned after respondents answered the state- ments to reflect the following scale responses (+2 = strongly agree, +1 = agree, 0 = ne utral, -1 = disagree, and -2 strongly disagree). For each user group (Upper Lake, Lower Lake, Upper River, Full River, Extended Tripper), grand mean scores were calculated for emotional/symbolic attachmentand functional attachment to determine the strength of respondents' agreement with the place attachment state- ments. (For an alytical purposes, the 5-point scale was re- versed for the sta tements \"I feel no commitment to this place\" and \"The time I spent here could have just as easily been spent somewhere else\" so it could be compared to the otheremotional/symbolic statements and functional statements, respectively.) We used 1-way analysis of variance to compare mean scale scores of the level of agreement for each place attachment between user groups. The internal consistency for the five statements measuring emotional/symbolic attachment and the seven statements measuring functional attachment was assessed using reliability analysis (Cronbach 1951). Cronbach's alpha coefficients were computed for each set ofitems comprising place attachment scales. Similar to the Warzecha and others (2000) investigation, we sought to determine whether there was a relationship between high and low levels of agreement with place attach-ment statements and respondents' importance with certain experience domains. We compared the highest and lowest 25 percent of the mean scores for each type of place attachmentfor the Upper Lakes and Upper River user groups. (For analytical purposes, the other user groups were not part of this analysis because of the low sample sizes.) Utilizing theupper and lower limits allows us to examine both ends of the agreement spectrum. As Warzecha and others (2000) point out, the upper and lower limits do not represent the majorityof the user groups, but they may serve as an important barometer in evaluating attitudes about resource manage- ment issues. We used SPSS to run 2-tailed t-tests to determine whether there were statistically significant differences between re- spondents with high and low levels of agreement withemotional/symbolic and functional attachment statements and how they responded to statements of importance for experience domains. We examined differences in responseswithin the Upper Lakes and within the Upper River user groups, as well as between the Upper Lakes and Upper River user groups, for respondents demonstrating high and lowlevels of agreement with the place attachment statements.Results of User Groups and Place Attachment Comparisons ___________________ Levels of emotional/symbolic attachment (rated on a 5-point scale, +2 to -2) were compared for the five user groups (table 2). Statistically significant differences in levelsof agreement with emotional/symbolic place attachment statements were found between the Upper Lakes (1.01) and Full River (0.56) user groups. Inter-item reliability for thefive statements, as reflected by the Alpha scores, ranged from (0.80 to 0.92). Levels of functional attachment were compared across user groups (table 3). Statistically significant differences in levels of agreement were evident among the user groups. Mean scores were highest for the Upper Lakes (0.67) andlowest for the Full River (0.00) user groups. In addition, statistically significant differences in levels of agreement with functional place attachment statements were foundbetween the Lower Lakes (0.54) and the Full River user groups. Overall, the inter-item reliability of seven state- ments for functional place attachment was slightly higherthan the reliability of emotional/symbolic statements (0.87 to 0.92). For both types of place attachment, respondents in the Upper Lakes and Upper River user groups with high and low levels of a greement indicated differences in the impor- tance of items defining the quality of experience on the waterway (r ated on a 5-point scale, 1 to 5). These differences were apparent both within the Upper Lakes and Upper Table 2\u2014Levels of emotional/symbolic place attachment for five user groups.

River user groups and between the Upper Lakes and Upper River user groups. For example, for both user groups theimportance of experiencing solitude was rated higher for respondents with high levels of agreement with emotional/ symbolic statements than for respondents with low levels ofagreement (table 4). For functional attachment, however, no significant differences were detected between respondents with high and low levels of agreement for either the UpperLakes or the Upper River user groups. Strength of agreement also was associated with statisti- cally significant differences in respondents' ratings of theimportance of experiencing an undeveloped area and lightly impacted campsite (table 5). For the Upper Lakes user group, respondents with high emotional/symbolic agree-ment rated this factor higher than respondents with low agreement (3.17 and 2.67, respectively). Evaluation of func- tional attachment, as associated with this factor, revealedsignificant differences between respondents with high and low levels of agreement in the Upper River user group (3.46 and 2.88, respectively). In addition, experiencing an unde-veloped, lightly impacted campsite was more important for the Upper River respondents with high levels of functional attachment (3.46) than for respondents in the Upper Lakeswith high levels of agreement (2.90). For both types of place attachment, respondents in the Upper Lakes and Upper River user groups with high and lowlevels of agreement did not differ significantly in the impor- tance of careless or disrespectful behavior related to the quality of experience on the waterway (table 6). For ex-ample, not seeing litter or damaged trees at a campsite was rated similarly important for respondents in the UpperRiver group with low levels of agreement to functional place attachment (4.19), as compared to respondents in the Upper River group with high levels of agreement to functional place attachment (4.40). For both types of place attachment,respondents with the same high and low levels of agreement to statements did not differ significantly in the importance of the careless or disrespectful behavior factor. For example,not seeing litter or damaged trees at campsites was rated similarly important in the Upper River group with high levels of agreement to emotional attachment statements(4.11) as with the Upper Lakes group with high levels of agreement to emotional attachment statements (4.44). Discussion_____________________ Providing high quality, backcountry recreational oppor- tunities on the St. Croix International Waterway has be-come more challenging over time as ease of access has increased and nearby population centers in the Northeast- ern United States and Atlantic Canada have grown. In thisregion, the majority of backcountry experiences occur on private or State-owned lands, most of which lack specific, codified guidance as to the type of settings or activities thatmanagers should maintain. Also, the broad diversity of users at the St. Croix Waterway suggests that experiencing a remote or backcountry setting may not be a priority for allor even a majority of users. In these conditions, the risk of creeping product shift is great. The task of managing agen- cies becomes more complex as they try to provide for aspectrum of recreational opportunities while still maintain- ing high quality backcountry experiences. For example, recently, many campsites on the St. Croix InternationalWaterway have been hardened and enlarged, with single- cell sites split into multiple adjacent cells (Cameron and Stacey 2001) (fig. 3). These steps were taken to meet aperceived need for durable camping spots, but the possible impact on traditional backcountry values was not consid- ered. Understanding the users and their multiple defini-tions of a quality experience provides key information for meeting these seemingly conflicting goals. Experience Dimensions The results of the factor analysis can provide guidance for managing agencies of the St. Croix International Water-way. The analysis suggests tha t for some dimensions ofTable 4\u2014Importance of solitude for respondents with high and low place attachment on upper lakes and upper river sections of the St. Croix International Waterway.

For example, theimportance of careless and disrespectful impacts (litter, tree damage) were only significantly different between the Lower Lakes and Extended Trip user groups, and all user groupsrated the items in this factor very or extremely important. This finding is consistent with that reported in other studies (for example, Manning 1999). Management-related activi-ties (campsite amenities, water level management, inter-pretive sites, and programs) were also similarly ranked by all five groups, with a high importance placed on campsite amenities and on water level management, and a low impor-tance placed on interpretive signs and programming. Differences also emerge from the factor analysis, particu- larly regarding the opportunities to experience solitude andopportunities to experience lightly impacted campsites and a primarily undeveloped natural setting. The two groups of canoeists whose activities are most dependent on an unde-veloped backcountry setting (Full River, Extended Trip) placed higher importance on the opportunity to experience solitude than did the other three user groups, and this aspectof the experience was significantly less important for the Lower Lakes user group than for all the other groups. The Upper River group was also different than the two otherriver-oriented user groups. This Upper River group contains a higher proportion of day users, and day use has been shown to be associated with lower importance for solitude (Cole2001). The importance placed on the opportunity to experience an undeveloped viewshed and lightly impacted campsitesalso differed between several of the user groups (fig. 4). Again, the two river-oriented, multinight groups of canoe- ists placed the greatest importance on experiencing naturalconditions, and they are joined in this regard by the Upper River user group. All three of these river groups rate higher on this dimension than the two lake groups. This is notsurprising because the two lake groups have a much higherproportion of day users (41 percent in Upper Lakes, 76 percent for Lower Lakes). Also, recent studies of campsiteconditions in the waterway (Cameron and Stacey 2001) indicate that campsites on the upper river segment are in substantially poorer condition than in other waterway re-gions. Hendee and others (1990) report that visitors are usually less concerned with campsite conditions and other resource impacts, instead focusing on various social condi-tions. Watson and others (1998) have reported similarity inthe rankings of social and resource indicators by wilderness boaters, even though users were found to have diverse motivations or experience preferences. Our findings suggestthat on the St. Croix International Waterway, while differ- ences do occur, all groups except the Lower Lakes users placed moderate to high importance on this experiencedimension. Generally, most visitors are very concerned about certain kinds of resource impacts, and may be willing to tolerate more heavy-handed management to ensure theavailability of high quality campsites. Comparing these distinct user groups provides insight on potential management challenges and opportunities. Whilethe five groups are unique in demographics, visit character- istics, and motives, their zones of travel often overlap. For example, the Extended Trip group travels through everyzone of the waterway. These overlapping use zones are areas with a high potential for conflict. However, the groups that place the highest importance on the qualities traditionallydefining a backcountry experience\u2014solitude and natural conditions\u2014also travel for at least a portion of their trip in sections of the waterway that could easily provide thoseconditions. These groups could benefit from the creation of certain ca mpsites along the waterway specifically reserved for primiti ve camping and nonmotorized access. A reas of the upper lakes are especially well suited to this strategy because of the large number of islands, stretches of undevel- oped shorel ine, and numerous isolated coves. The lowest stretch of river might also be well suited for this kind of zoningFigure 3 \u2014User groups of the St. Croix International Waterway were not as concerned with the number of others camped nearby as they were with specific behaviors. Multi-cell campsites recentlyestablished to accommodate more users at popular locations in- crease the likelihood of users experiencing disruptive behavior, such as noise from other campers.Figure 4\u2014Approximately 95 percent of the land in the State of Maine is privately owned. Consequently, most undeveloped recreation oppor-tunities take place on these private lands. The undeveloped character of private lands, especially those located near water, is threatened by development pressure for second homes. 140 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Daigle, Hannon, and Stacey Factors Influencing Experience Quality: Comparing User Groups and Place Attachment... approach because it is already used primarily by those groups that place a high importance on maintainingbackcountry values. Also, campsite restoration projects such as those needed in the upper river zone would benefit all user groups, regardless of trip type or motivation. The LowerLakes group, which places the lowest level of importance on all three experience dimensions, utilizes a region that is not frequented by any other user groups. The variability between these five groups suggests most of all that any recreation management scheme for the waterway should be designed with the specific geographic zones and distinct visitor groupsin mind. A blanket strategy would not meet the diverse needs and desires of the waterway users. Level of Attachment Warzecha and others (2000) report that levels of emo- tional/symbolic and functional attachment were significantlydifferent between visitors to developed and backcountry areas. They also report that these differences in levels of attachment were associated with differing levels of supportfor potential management actions on two Western United States rivers. Our results only partially concur. Levels of emotional/symbolic and functional attachment varied be- tween the five user groups, with the two backcountry-ori- ented groups scoring the lowest on the scales of emotional/ symbolic and functional attachment, but there were actuallyfew significant differences. The five groups differ in many ways including primary activity, length of stay, mode of travel, group size, experience use history, and many othervariables. They bring to the waterway a desire for a diversityof conditions and experiences. However, these results sug- gest that while the visitor groups may come to the St. Croix International Waterway desiring a diversity of conditionsand experiences, nearly all users have a moderate to strong feeling of place identity and a moderate to strong belief that no other area can be substituted for this one. The uniformityand strength of feelings and beliefs held by the visitors about the waterway suggest that it is important for managing agencies to incorporate opportunities for public involvementin shaping recreation management goals and strategies for the waterway. Further, it requires that this public involve- ment be structured in such a way that it includes represen-tation from each user group. For two groups, we investigated the relationship between levels of attachment and importance of various experiencedimensions. The strongest relationship was between high levels of emotional/symbolic attachment and higher impor- tance of opportunities for solitude. A high level of functionalattachment was also associated with a high level of impor- tance placed on experiencing a mostly undeveloped setting with lightly impacted campsites. Level of attachment seemedto have no relationship with the importance of careless or disrespectful impacts encountered, suggesting that such impacts are very influential to all users, even those who haveformed no attachment to either a specific place or a general- ized setting. The two strong relationships suggest a percep- tion by the user that the backcountry values\u2014solitude,natural conditions\u2014available at the St. Croix Waterway are not easily replaced. They also suggest the visitors' percep- tion that the emotional/symbolic relationship with the St.Croix Waterway is a unique one, also not easily replaced. They further suggest that opportunities for experiencingsolitude and natural conditions may be an important part of developing emotional/symbolic relationships with the re- source, possibly an important source of satisfaction in itselffor some users.

This analysis provides the basis for developing more effective and appropriate mechanisms to involve New Zealand's indigenous people (the Maori) and local communities in the man-agement of marine reserves. Case studies of New Zealand marine reserves are used to analyze the successes and failures of community involvement in marinereserve management. Preliminary findings indicate a lack of na- tional direction on how marine reserve committees should function. In addition, a lack of funds available to committees limits thesuccesses they can achieve. Despite weaknesses in format, marine reserve committees serve as a valuable link between government and community. Any attempt to create more meaningful participa-tion requires committee restructuring from advisory bodies to those with more power and responsibility. However, this is not possible under current legislation and policy. Introduction ____________________ This study examines the effectiveness of New Zealand marine reserve committees as a means for public participa-tion. Marine reserve committees are advisory and advocacy bodies that incorporate local stakeholder representation. Case studies are used to examine marine reserve commit-tees. The possible committee types are outlined prior to the presentation of preliminary findings and the subsequent discussion. Three themes exist: (1) little national direction,(2) inadequate funding, and (3) strengthening community relations. Before marine reserve committees are examined in detail, an overview of marine protected areas and partici-pation provides a background for the discussion. Objective and Methodology _______ The objective of this study is to examine public participa- tion in the management of marine reserves in New Zealand.The main question to be answered is: Are marine reserve committees an effective means to achieve participatory input in marine reserve management? There are four case studyCommunity Involvement in New Zealand Marine Reserve Management: ExaminingPractice Laani Uunila marine reserve committees. The case studies are examined in three manners: interviews with Department of Conserva- tion (DoC) staff, a mail survey to marine reserve committee members with followup interviews, and document analysis.Currently, the DoC interview phase of the project is com- plete, with questionnaires still being returned; as such, only preliminary results can be presented. Marine Protected Areas __________ Marine protected areas (MPAs) are conservation mea- sures with worldwide distribution. MPAs differ by nation, and even within nations in terms of the reason for establish-ment, degree of protection, and method of management. Agardy (1997, 1999) states that the term MPA is generic enough to encompass all forms of marine protection, frominternational biosphere reserves to small no-take reserves. In this research, MPA is defined as: Any area of intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environ- ment (Kelleher and Kenchington 1992: 7). Kelleher and others (1995) state that the region contain- ing the most MPAs, 19.9 percent of those in the world, isAustralia and New Zealand. This fact is misleading for New Zealand because only 4 percent of New Zealand's territorial waters are protected under the marine reserve system. TheNew Zealand Government is not satisfied with the current status and is working on creating a national representative system (Parliamentary Commissioner 1999). Legislation in New Zealand Currently, there is little integration between marine pro- tection initiatives across government agencies and levels. Thirteen central government agencies, 16 regional councils or unitary authorities, and 18 marine management lawshave a role in marine protection (DoC 2000). The Depart- ment of Conservation is the key agency responsible for protected areas and species (DoC and Ministry for theEnvironment 2000). The main mechanism for creating marine protected areas in New Zealand is the Marine Reserves Act 1971. Marinereserves are specified as areas of the territorial sea, seabed, and foreshore managed for scientific study and to preserve the marine habitat in its natural state. The Marine ReservesAct 1971 is fairly restrictive, as reserve status is for areas of demonstrable scientific value, with only secondary regardUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 143Uunila Community Involvement in New Zealand Marine Reserve Management: Examining Practice for natural, scenic, recreation, and cultural values (DoC 2000). The majority of New Zealand's reserves are \"no-take\" reserves. Walls and Dingwall (1995) state that due to the fact that marine reserves are designed as no-take reserves,they are subsequently small in area. International recogni- tion and praise are accorded to New Zealand marine re- serves, as the majority of reserves are no-take, banning evenrecreational 1995). Currently, only one reserve, Kapiti, allows for limited recreational fishing (DoC2000). The Marine Reserves Act 1971 is under review to address several deficiencies, one of which is public involvement (DoC2000). The Department of Conservation has requested feed- back on how to strengthen the role of communities, Maori, and other stakeholders in the management of reserves. Cur- rently, stakeholders can have some degree of management input through conservation boards (independent statutory bodies) or marine reserve advisory committees. Ultimately, however, the Department of Conservation is responsible for management of marine reserves. Participation ___________________ The meaning of the term \"participation,\" and the degree to which it is used, have little consensus among managers and planners. Using a term with many meanings can cause significant problems, as expectations and realities differbetween groups. Dugdale and West (1991: 2) define public participation as: A two-way process of communication between planners and the community that promotes the exchange of informa-tion and ideas and seeks joint problem solving and the resolution of conflict in order to produce plans and policies that are acceptable to the community and which can beeffectively implemented. Participatory resource management and planning, there- fore, is the inclusion of the public, either general and/or special interest groups, to help create socially acceptable resourcemanagement decisions via a communicative process.There is a continuum of participation that ranges to empowerment (Arnstein 1969;Chambers 1994; Michener 1998; of this continuum, Arnstein (1969) created a \"ladder of citizen participation\" that begins with nonparti- cipation methods, rises to degrees of tokenism, and ends with degrees of citizen power (fig. 1). Arnstein (1969) cautions about the use of empty participa- tion versus true power sharing. Various authors (Arnstein 1969; Duffy and Hutchinson 1997; Forester 1989) warn of the damaging effects of nonmeaningful participation: Frustration Mistrust Disillusionment Withdrawal of participation and/or consent To create meaningful participation, Innes (1998) calls for the establishment of a stakeholder group that works in parallel to government, allowing community voices to beheard. Donaldson (1994) identifies three types of groups that can be used in participatory resource management: (1) elite, (2) exist- ing, and (3) new (table 1). Establishing a new group is the ideal, as such a group can be representative of the community; moreover, an established group may not be able to adapt toparticipatory techniques.

Duffy and Hutchinson (1997) several ways for commu- nity to be represented: issue/common cause groups, target groups, geographical, spiritual, and nets of social relations. Resource m anagers and planners need to be aware of their definition of community when selecting partners for collabo- rative planning practices. In New Zealand, marine reserve committees represent a geographical and interest groupdefinition of community. Duffy and Hutchinson (1997) found that when groups are only given power at the operational level, not the strategiclevel, frustration arises, as members want to be involved in all levels of the process. Sharing of power and responsibility are key as: ...the community can feel it \"owns\" the result, with most members of the community believing that they have had a chance to be involved, have a stake in the success of the result, and in which some do not feel personally disadvantaged whileothers have escaped disadvantage or have gained (Radford 1994: 395). Participation at the earliest possible point, even before plan conception, allows participants to truly belong to the planning process, rather than being treated in a tokenistic manner (Healey 1997; Innes and Booher 1999). Community Participation in Marine Protected Areas The focus of marine reserve research has changed in the past decade. For example, Kennedy (1990) suggested im- provements to the management of Mida Creek marine reserve; no mention was made of public involvement, savefor educating locals and tourists. While experts and re- searchers are now recognizing the need for public participa- tion, there are still several gaps in the studies that have been conducted. Much of the research on MPA effectiveness focuses on the implementation of policy, management prac- tices, a nd monitoring (for example, Nicholls 1998), not on the effectiveness of public participation in influencing the management process.Preliminary Findings_____________ Until the new Marine Reserves Act becomes law, four types of marine reserve advisory committees can be created in New Zealand (table 2). Not all reserves are required to have an advisory committee. Despite descriptions of differ-ent possible committees that can be formed under legisla- tion, there are no national guidelines for operating a marine advisory committee. In the mid-1990s, a discussion paperwas circulated with the aim to create national principles for committees and the selection of members. Unfortunately, there has been no action on this paper. The marine reserve committees examined as case studies are: Kapiti, Long Island-Kokomohua, Te Tapuwae o Rongo- kako, and Te Whanganui A Hei. An overview of each commit-tee is presented in table 3. Marine reserve committees are a combination of Donaldson's (1994) elite and new groups. The majority of positions, which are not allocated to iwi(tribes), are for int erest groups such as commercial and recreational fishers, environmental groups, and dive clubs. There is little or no representation of members of the generalpublic. Three main themes have become apparent from interviews with DoC staff and the preliminary survey re- sults: lack of a national approach, inadequate funding, andinvaluable community relations. National Direction The first and foremost theme is that respondents perceive there is no nationally coordinated approach to participation in marine reserve management. This theme can be split intotwo subsections: (1) lack of national direction and (2) theneed to be flexible to the community. The functions of the case study committees vary, from a concentration on compliance and enforcement work, to rais-ing public awareness, to approving applications for scientific research. The resources available to committees also vary, for examp le, some committees can claim travel expenses while others cannot, some committees have access to funds while others do not. These variations create an ad hoc system. Committee membership, Department of Conservation staff, and external influences all play roles in determining the focus of the advisory committees. The differences appear Table 2\u2014Types of possible marine advisory committees.

It appears that the individual interests and enthu- siasm of the members are major factors in determining the actual tasks undertaken by a particular committee. Each marine reserve and marine reserve committee is forging its own way, making mistakes and creating suc- cesses. The lack of communication between reserves is some-thing mentioned by DoC staff in all interviews. Some staff members have attempted to create information exchanges, such as the request for an exchange of minutes between LongIsland\u2014Kokomuha and the Te Whanganui A Hei. These information exchanges are few and far between, and more often due to friendships with staff in other conservanciesthan to seeking out information from all reserves. Regional differences do need to occur, as each committee is representative of the community and interest groups con-cerned w ith the reserve in question. Moreover, the rights of the Maori, New Zealand's indigenous people, must be re- spected. In addition to needing community support, marinereserves need the support of the local iwi, who give up their traditional fishing rights to the area. Due to the importance of iwi support, they often have at least 50 percent repre- sentation on the committees. Sometimes, as in the case of Te Whanganui A Hei and Te Tapuwae o Rongokako marine reserves, only one iwi is involved; however, other reservesrequire representation from several iwi. Funding Funding allocated specifically for marine reserves only came about in 2001. Prior to this, the budget for the reservescame from the conservancy budget. The lack of funds di- rectly accessible to marine reserve committees is most likely the biggest cause of frustration to the committee members, as they cannot conduct all the activities that they would like.This inability reinforces their role as merely an advisory body to DoC, when they would like more of a hand in the managem ent of the reserves. One respondent stated that the committee \"would feel more useful if we could raise and hold funds for campaigns,\" because without funds members have little they can actually do. Some committees would like to seeksponsorship from out side DoC; but there is no consensus among conservancy staff if external sponsorship is permissible. Community Liaison Marine reserve advisory committees are a key link be- tween DoC and members of the community. The link isstrongest between iwi and specific interest groups, such as commercial fishers; however, in some reserves, the link is also established with members of the general public. DoCstaff considers the committees to be \"watchdogs\" who keep pressure on DoC to uphold promises and ensure adequate management. In addition to advising DoC, the committeesserve to provide a \"reality check\" and extra \"eyes and ears\" for management. The importance of iwi connections was emphasized by all DoC staff interviewed.

For example, the Long Island-Kokomohua com- mittee did not even meet in 2000. The lack of a budget for the committee and the fact that the reserve is not a high usereserve are two factors that may have contributed to nonparticipation. It is impossible to tell without further research if there are any other contributing factors tononparticipation, in this reserve and others. Committees can have feelings of frustration at their in- ability to act in more than an advisory manner. The focus onfunding by both DoC and committee members suggests that this is an area where the participatory process needs to be improved. The marine reserve committees would acquirenew capacity if they were to have an operating budget for activities that they desire to implement. Not being able to create tangible benefits from their participation, some committees get a negative feeling about their ability to make an impact. For example, the Kapiti Marine Reserve Committee has focused on compliance andlaw enforcement for almost a decade, an area where the committee does not have any power to make a direct differ- ence; as such, little successes are nonexistent. The commit-tee, however, has made a significant contribution, adding extra \"eyes and ears\" to the reserve, in addition to pressuring DoC staff and head office to ensure that compliance work isbeing done and legal followthrough occurs. Tangible benefits from such activities are small, if at all apparent. Innovation is occurring in the Kapiti Marine Reserve, with extra fund-ing requested, and received, for a temporary advocacy of- ficer. The role of the officer is to liase with the marine reserve committee and aid in the creation of promotional material,as well as liasing with interest groups and members of thepublic. Though there are faults in the current system, marine reserve advisory committees play an important role. Theyliase with members of the community, provide a network of people to assist in compliance activities, and are able to act as an independent body and advocate for the marine reservethrough political channels. Without marine advisory com- mittees, it is likely that there would be less community under- standing of the actions of the Department of Conservation. Summary and Conclusions _______ In New Zealand, national guidance is lacking in terms of how to incorporate communities in marine reserve manage- ment. There is no operational consistency between marinereserve committees, with differences in structure and con- tributions to management. Recognizing the fact that the needs of each community are different, it is not necessarilynegative that each committee functions in a different man- ner. However, there should be better communication be- tween the committees and reserve managers so mistakes arenot repeated throughout the whole system and successes can be recreated. Reserve advisory committees want to have funds avail- able to them so they can implement promotional and advo- cacy programs without having to rely on the Department of Conservation. Becoming financially self-sufficient wouldallow the committees to become more effective in their roles.Financial self-sufficiency also means that they would have greater capacity, something that would require restructur-ing of current government philosophies in regard to public participation. Research into transferring the current para- digm of participation into one that creates more meaningfulopportunities would be useful. Do marine reserve commit- tees and Department of Conservation staff have divergent views on the current level of participation? Are committeemembers satisfied with the current process? If not, what improvements can be made to ensure continued community participation in marine reserve management? The need tosee tangible benefits from participation is key, and indepen- dent funding is one way to create visible successes. As such, this is one area that requires future research. This study contributes to more than marine reserve re- search, as the need to i ncorporate communities is a wide- spread phenomenon, be it in conservation or urban planning.The needs of each country, region, and community differ. However, the rights of people to participate in planning, and the need to incorporate the visions of the community are keyif planning is to succeed. References_____________________ Agardy, T. 1999.

It details the complexity of beliefs regarding the water spirits,particularly related to the snake and the mermaid, and their role in the calling of traditional healers in Southern Africa. The implica- tions of these beliefs with regard to water and riparian zonemanagement are examined. The pools in which such spirits reside have sacred status and are of key importance in the training of healers, as well as being i mportant sites for the performance of family rituals. Many of these sites are threatened with environmen- tal degradation, mainly by agroforestry and dam-building programs. Over the last century, healers have been increasingly marginalized from such pools through the privatization of land and the former South African Government's apartheid policies. It is argued that to promote indigenous knowledge and wise stewardship of resources,adeq uate protection of such sites is essential, and mechanisms need to be explored whereby healers and their communities can be granted access to such features of the landscape. Introduction ____________________ There has recently been a surge of interest worldwide in the way indigenous people interact with their environmentand the value of their knowledge systems. Many interna- tional organizations, such as the Convention of Biodiversity (CBD-UNCED 1992), the United Nations Working Group onIndigenous Populations (WGIP), the United Nations Educa- tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the Working Group on Traditional Resource Rights(WGTRR), are calling for the recognition of indigenous peop les rights to self-determination, the value of their knowledge, and the need for strategies to protect andpreserve this knowle dge (Gray 1997; Posey 1999; Posey and Dutfield 1996). This has largely been precipitated by the global environmental crisis, which has revealed the short-comings of an exclusively scientific approach, often within the western economic development paradigm, in solving the multitude of environmental problems facing present andfuture generations.Ecological Implications of Water Spirit Beliefs in Southern Africa: The Need to Protect Knowledge, Nature, and ResourceRights Penny S. Bernard There has been a corresponding awareness of the need to examine how indigenous people have managed to live in a sustainable way within their environments, both in the pastand the present. The need to document and preserve such knowledge is thus seen as crucial for humanity's long-term survival on Earth. It is pertinent to note that much of thisknowledge is intimately connected with the broader frame- work of peoples' cosmology and world view, which is embed- ded within their physical, spiritual, and social landscapes(Hirsch and O'Hanlon 1995; Tilley 1994). Hence, procuring and preserving existing knowledge, although crucial, is only one aspect of the equation. Knowledge is dependent on theprotection and preservation of these broad features of the landscape, within which peoples' identity, cosmology, and knowledge are embedded. In terms of the physical land-scape, protection and preservation are just one aspect of the solution. Ensuring indigenous people access to these sites is essential because such features are integral aspects of the nature, f ormation, and transmission of knowledge. Through- out the world, over the last 200 years these communities have become increasingly marginalized and denied access to such resources, with the resultant threat to their knowledge. In South Africa, indigenous African peoples are emerging from centuries of alienation and marginalization imposed on them by their colonial and apartheid masters. In the lastcentury, they were systematically denied access to a large percentage of their resources. The Land Act of 1913 is well recognized as the institutionalized mechanism that precipi-tated this, whereby it stipulated that over 80 percent of the population was to be confined to 13 percent of the total landmass of South Africa. Since independence in 1994, efforts have been made to correct this state of affairs, but the present process of land restitution is slow, arduous, very expensive, and fraughtwith many difficulties. Many who were uprooted from their natural landscapes have lost their knowledge and tradi- tions, or have repudiated them in favor of monotheism,capitalism, and globalization. These transformations, as well as the inevitable population pressures on the restricted resources, have led to behavior changes, which have re-sulted in environmental degradation and abandonment of much of the traditional ecological knowledge that is no longer relevant to them. These modern forces have allcontributed to the \"disenchantment\" of the landscape, whereby the respect for the spirits of the land is rapidly disappearing and with it a powerful mechanism for limitinghuman behaviors that have negative ecological impacts. Despite these threats to knowledge, however, there re- mains a strong body of beliefs among a core of Africanreligious functionaries\u2014the traditional diviner healersUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 149Bernard Ecological Implications of Water Spirit Beliefs in Southern Africa... (amagqirha, izangoma ). Despite being heavily \"demonized\" by their Christian invaders, they continue to play a signifi-cant and influential role in their communities. The following summary demonstrates the intimate con- nection that exists between the physical, spiritual, andsocial dimensions of Southern African spiritual healers' knowledge and practice, particularly with reference to water resources and the belief of water spirits. It must be notedthat water sources provide just one aspect of the knowledge base. Plants, forests, and mountains are also integral to the training and practice of traditional healers. The data pre-sented comes from research I have done among the Zulu-, Xhosa-, and Karanga/Shona-speaking groups over the last 4 years. These communities span a wide area of SouthernAfrica, extending across several thousand kilometers and over a number of State boundaries (South Africa, Mozam- bique, and Zimbabwe). It is worth noting that I have identi-fied a common corpus of knowledge linking the African healing traditions with the water spirits over this whole region that is not exclusive to these groups only. It alsofeatures strongly in other Bantu-speaking groups in the region, such as the Swazi, Venda, Sotho, Tshangaan, Ndebele, and Tswana, and they are also prevalent amongst theearliest known peoples of Southern Africa, the Khoekhoe and the San. Water Spirits in Southern Africa _________________ Among many of the Southern African indigenous people (Khoisan- and Bantu-speaking people) there exists a set ofcomplex beliefs regarding water, river systems, and riparianzones. The spirit world is regarded as the ultimate source of such life-sustaining resources. Water is the essence of both spiritual and physical life, and the spirit world is regardedas the ultimate source of such life-sustaining powers. Inte- gral to such beliefs are various zoomorphic spirit manifesta- tions, primarily the snake and the mermaid, who reside in orbeyond the water and who interact with humans in a variety of ways. The rivers, wetlands, and the sea are the dwelling places of such manifestations and are of fundamental impor-tance to many of the African healing traditions and their practitioners. The snake and the spirits of the water are specifically associated with the calling of healers and are seen as the providers of wisdom and knowledge, which are given to chosen individuals. Water sources are essential parts of thelandscape for conducting rituals to aid communication with the spirit world. Water in itself is regarded among many African religious functionaries as a living force, which hasthe power to transform us from one state to another at a spiritual or physical level. It has the power to purify and protect one from evil, or to heal and bring one from illness tohealth. It is thus a vital element in the performance of many religious and healing rituals. Common Themes What is remarkable about all the differing accounts of the water spirits are the similarities in the myths and coresymbols. The central feature of these myths and rituals is the association with the \"calling\" of individuals to becomediviners. This usually involves the physical submersion of the candidate under the water of a certain river pool or the sea (for a few hours, to days or even years) after which it isalleged that the individual emerges wearing the full regalia of a healer\u2014a symbolic snake wrapped around his/her body and medicines. This experience of being taken under thewater, often by a wind or a \"snake\" can happen in a dream, but this is merely notification that the individual's ancestors are calling him/her to become a healer. The \"calling\" isusually preceded by the candidate suffering an illness (ukuthwasa ), although sometimes, especially in the case of children, they just happen to be playing near the water at thetime. Individuals who have had such experiences commonly report seeing snakes, mermaids, or even their ancestors. Skills in healing, sacred knowledge, psychic abilities, andmedicinal plants seem to be the gifts that are imparted to these chosen people by the water spirits. It is the spirits that choose the client, not the other way around, and resistanceto the \"calling\" usually leads to misfortune. Relatives are not allowed to display any grief at the disappearance of one who has gone under the water or he/she may never be returnedto the living. Anyone who enters these water sources without the calling of the ancestors will disappear, never to return. Key symbolic images linked to objects seen under the water or to messenger animals that summon the \"chosen\" one to meet the spirits are remarkably similar within all the groups, namely, the snake or python, the water monitor(leguuan ), the hippopotamus, the dolphin, the otter, the crab, the frog, the brown fly, and/or the horse fly. Among the Zulu, snakes (especially pythons), and crabs that visit peoplein their houses are regarded as ancestral manifestations andshould not be harmed. Certain places are more favored by the river spirits than others. They are believed to live in deep pools of certainrivers, often below waterfalls, fast moving \"living\" water, or in the sea. \"Living\" water is often associated with its ability to generate foam, and the foam appears to be symbolicallyimportant. Berglund (1976: 146) cites a diviner ( isangoma ) informant who said, It is as I said water that is living, running in the river. That is the living water. If the water had been in a dam as you asked (a while ago), then there would not be a snake in it. It is theliving waters. It is believed the ancestors, or spirits of the water, live in a dry area at the bottom of these pools and have a lifestyle very similar to people living on earth, in that they havehouses, cattle, chickens, and so forth. They are prosperous, peaceful, happy, and in fact, lead an idyllic life. The occurrence of certain plants near pools and river sources indicate the presence of the water spirits. Palmer (1996) notes that in the Eastern Cape the presence of the umkumzi (or imkhamzi ) reed ( typha capensis ) on the edge of pools is seen as a sure sign of habitation by the water spirits. The reed is a key symbol in Zulu religion, and in one origin myth they claim that they emerged from a bed of reeds. Thereed mat is an essential accoutrement of diviners, and this is directly linked to its association with water, healing, and creation.150 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Bernard Ecological Implications of Water Spirit Beliefs in Southern Africa... For the San (/Xam) the presence of reeds and water-buchu indicates the location of the Water Snake's dwelling place(Hoff 1997). The foam generated from certain plants, the sacred ubulawu , is used by the Zulu and Xhosa for washing and eating in order to purify and connect an individual to theancestors through dreams. Many of these species come from trees, bushes, and vines that grow near water sources (Hirst 1990). Ubulawu is very often administered to healers during rituals conducted in river pools. Significant cave sites, often with San paintings, are often found in close proximity to sacred pools, and many rituals for healing and rainmakingare performed at these sites. There seems to be some discrepancy between the various areas as to whether the water spirits are regarded as shades(recently deceased relatives) of either paternal or maternal origin, or belong to a generalized amalgam of nonspecific or very old ancestors. In Natal, the water spirits, in the form ofthe snake, are referred to as the \" amakhosi \" (the great ancestors). They have explicitly stated that the snake is the metamorphosed amalgam of one's ancestors who live underthe water. Both Berglund's (1976) informant and my infor- mants suggest that they distinguish between the snake(s) that is/are a manifestation of the \"family\" (shade snakes),and the big one (\"The one which is the Lord\") representing the Supreme Deity. For instance, Berglund's (1976: 148) informant describes the python as iNkosi yamadlozi (\"the lord of the shades\" or \"the one above\") who resides in the pool. The Zulu also recognize the existence of another category of nonhuman water spirits or semi-daemons that are halfhuman/half fish (mermaids) and have stated that this is one of the forms the heavenly princess, iNkosazana , can take. These creatures often have transformative powers. Forinstance, iNkosazana can manifest as the mermaid, the snake, the rainbow, and gentle soft rain. The Shona are quite specific that the mermaids, known as njuzu, are alien spirits (mashave) of human and nonhuman origin (Aschwanden 1989). Certain mediums can be possessed by njuzu spirits who will give them healing powers. Mermaids are believed to come out of the water with their animals at night, and itis for that reason people are reluctant to go near rivers or the sea after dark. Latham (1986), Aschwanden (1989), and Daneel (1971) have indicated the close link between the Shona/Karanga Supreme Deity, Dzivaguru (or Mwari ), the original autoch- thon, from whence comes rain and fertility, and the spirits ofthe pool. The njuzu (mermaids), closely linked within the python and the puffadder, feature very strongly at the shrines to Mwari (Mlimo) at the Matonjeni Cave complex inthe Matopos region of southwest Zimbabwe, as well as at the Nyamakati Pool shrine to Dzivaguru in northeast Zimba- bwe. The aforementioned shrines are central to the rain-making cult in the region. This link with the rainmaking forces and with fertility is a common theme throughout Southern Africa. Inkosazana, the Zulu heavenly princess, asthe bringer of soft-soaking rains, is responsible for both agricultural and human fertility. Propitiation and appeals are made to her by virgins at the beginning of spring eachyear, appealing to her to bestow her gifts of fertility and to help them select a suitable husband. There are many other rituals that are performed for the water spirits at rivers throughout Southern Africa. The purposes for conducting them and the ritual process mayvary from group to group. They are mainly conducted for diviners at various stages of their training, but some house-holds will propitiate periodically to appeal to the spirits to bestow them with wealth, rain, good harvests, and fertility. Among some Nguni groups, propitiation rituals are still made prior to planting in spring. A portion of the seeds to be planted are placed on the surface of the sacred pools. The river spirits will accept half of them and return the other halfto mix with the remaining seed to enhance its fertility and yield. If none of the seed sinks, but just spreads over the water, this is an indication that the ancestors and spiritworld are offended by the misdeeds of the living. Should this happen, the participants will immediately seek to determine the cause of the ancestors' anger, and frequently confessionsof social tensions and jealousies get brought to the fore. These are discussed and resolved as speedily as possible, often at the riverbank itself in the presence of the ancestors.This reaffirms the intricate balance that they perceive to exist between the social, spiritual, and physical worlds. Sacred Pools, Behavioral Taboos, and Ecology As a result of the profound sacred status that the many rivers, pools, and water sources hold for Southern African indigenous communities, there existed in the past, and to some extent today, a range of taboos surrounding theiraccess and utilization. Pools, rivers, and expanses of water are held with a mixture of awe, fear, and reverence. Great care was taken in the past to avoid disturbing or angeringthe water spirits. Common people were forbidden to go nearsacred pools where the snake, mermaids, and spirits were known to exist. This injunction was reinforced with the fear that uninvited people would be taken under the water neverto return. Only healers, kings/chiefs, or those who are pure of heart are allowed to approach such areas. I have accompanied the izangoma to a number of these pools, and they are always approached with singing and prayer. The healer will inform the spirits who is approaching and reassures them that they come as friends. It was strictlytaboo for anyone to extract plants or resources from the water's edge. This could only be done by healers who were allowed plants for medicinal use. Traditionally, healersapproach the plant with humble clapping of the hands and appeal to the ancestors to allow them to utilize the plant for healing purposes. After removing the plant, they replace itwith white beads as a sign of thanks. Similarly, when approaching water they often make offerings of beads and silver money. Killing or injuring any of the messengers of the water (such as crabs, snakes, frog, or water birds) is also regarded as a great offense, and there are many groups in SouthernAfrica for whom the eating of fish is strictly taboo. Trans- gression of such taboos could result in the drying up of the water source and droughts. Many groups limit the distanceto which residential units can be erected near rivers and where cultivation may take place. Hoff (1997: 24) noted that the San prefer not to live very close to a water source becauseof their belief that, Water Snakes wander in the immediate vicinity of their homes, making these areas particularly dangerous.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 151Bernard Ecological Implications of Water Spirit Beliefs in Southern Africa... In many places, the effects of modernity and the pressures for population resettlement have overwhelmed these tradi-tional fears and restraints, leading to catastrophic results. Many people living in squatter settlements along rivers and streams in urban areas of South Africa have lost their livesand homes to flash floods in recent years. The water spirits are generally believed to live in pools and swamps that never dry out. It is said that their role is toprotect water sources and keep them alive. They can, how- ever, be chased away by disrespectful behavior, social dishar- mony, or if the overharvesting of riparian zones take place. This will lead to the drying up and degradation of such rivers. Such forces are regarded as the guardians of fertility, morality, and life itself. Any disrespect shown to them mayresult in drowning, droughts, floods, and tornadoes. In Zimbabwe, Aschwanden (1989: 189) reports local opinion is that, In the past\u2014before the arrival of the white man\u2014there are said to have been more pools and springs with water snakes. The many noises that came with the Europeans made many njuzu leave their habitats forever, which caused aridity. However, disobedience by many people is also said to have prompted the njuzu to retreat. Damming or channeling water from rivers can also upset the river snake. A well known example of this was the resistance given by the valley Tonga when Kariba Dam was constructed. Their main fears were that the great waterserpent Nyaminyami would be angered. The many disasters that beset the project were largely attributed to Nyaminyami's distress from being separated from its mate downstreamfrom the wall. The more recent Lesotho Highlands Waterproject encountered similar resistance from the local inhab- itants, who attributed the seismic motions to the great snake's distress with the project. How people harness the idiom of the water spirits to mount powerful community opposition to social, political, and developmental projects was clearly demonstrated in theAmbuya Juliana movement that swept through Southern Zimbabwe in the early 1990s. This was in response to certain environmental catastrophes such as severe drought androdent plagues. The movement was inspired by a prophetess by the name of Juliana, who claimed to be an emissary of the water spirits(njuzu ), with whom she had resided under water for a period of 4 years. She made her first appearance in the Zvishavane Mberengwa region at the height of the drought of 1992. Sheattributed the drought to the breakdown of respect that people had for the Earth's resources, particularly water sources, for lack of social harmony and abandonment oftraditional practices and beliefs, and for the failure of the government and state to acknowledge the role of the spirits in the War of Liberation. The major grievances of the njuzu were the construction of dams and the drilling of boreholes. She stated that the smell of cement drove away the njuzu who were pivotal in the provision of drinking water for thepeople. It was stated (Mawere and Wilson 1995: 255) that, The government is wrong in the manner in which they are blocking quite a number of streams to make dams. Thegovernment is also sinking boreholes and wells in a bad way, making explosions that frighten away the spirits and all other creatures.She instituted a set of harsh taboos, which the community had to observe should they wish the drought to break, and tofacilitate the return of the njuzu who would regenerate mountain springs, underwater, and surface rivers. Among these was the banning of the construction of dams and thedrilling of boreholes, as well as the use of soaps or the immersion of metal or enamel containers into the rivers. It was also forbidden to kill any wild animal or to collect wildfruit or plants for sale, as these attract the rain. The thousands of people who responded to her pronounce- ments, and adhered to the harsh taboos and restrictionswhich she imposed, is a graphic example of the great respect many people still hold for the water spirits in this region. Many taboos revealed a collective rejection of the moderneconomic forces of capitalism, agriculture, and religious (especially Christian) intrusion into the area. All these are seen as a threat to the maintenance of traditional practices. This desire to return to tradition has been witnessed recently in the Mvoti valley area of the Kwazulu Natal Midlands, where certain rural communities have reinsti-tuted the ancient day of rest for the heavenly princess, iNkosazana. This day was known traditionally as lesuku lweNkosazana and was regarded as the day when no one was allowed to utilize the river or to tend their fields. The reinstitution of this day of rest was in response to a claim made by a lady ( isangoma ) who claimed that iNkosazana had visited her while she was hoeing her field. She said her children's names were Saturday and Monday and that on those days no one should use the rivers but should leavethem in peace to recuperate so she and her children could enjoy them. The message was to be relayed to all five chiefdoms in the area. Collecting water, washing, or utiliz-ing any water directly from the river on her day (Mondaysand Saturdays) is now strictly prohibited. Connected with the taboos, in respect of iNkosazana , is the revival of the planting ceremonies for her in spring. Inthe Mvoti area, all members of the chiefdom have to contrib- ute a portion of their crop seeds and some money to purchase a goat for the chief prior to planting. On a designated day, allthe people in the chiefdom awake early in the morning. Taking with them their hoes and spades, traditional beer (tshwala ), and sour milk ( amasi ), they congregate together in a forested valley above the river. The men demarcate a piece of land that is to be dedicated to iNkosazana and construct a fence around it. The soil inside the area is dug byall present. Then, the chief's mother and wife and all the elder women plant the grain collected from the households (households that do not contribute are fined). Afterwards, a goat is sacrificed near the river, and an elder takes the bile from the gallbladder and sprinkles some of it into the river. He then ascends the mountain to the forestwhere the field is located and sprinkles the remaining bile on the field. I was told that this is a crucial part of the ritual because a connection has to be made between the water andthe field. \"This is done to show the significance that the garden, the goat and the river, all belong to Nomkhubulwana .\" Traditional songs are sung and there is much dancingperformed. Following this, the women, dressed in leaves from the Msenge tree (cabbage tree), a tree sacred to iNkosazana , descend together to the river to take a bath. The Msenge leaves are stripped off their bodies and thrown into the water, and naked, the women wash themselves in the152 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Bernard Ecological Implications of Water Spirit Beliefs in Southern Africa... water. No males\u2014young or old\u2014are allowed anywhere near the river at this stage. This is to emphasize respect for thewomen's bodies, as much as respect for the heavenly prin- cess, the bearer of fertility. No woman is allowed to return home until she has taken the bath. The bath signifies the endof the ritual. I conducted a small survey (n = 32) in this valley in early 2001 to evaluate how popular such rituals and constraintson using the river were to the local community. The majority of the respondents were very happy to be participating in the rituals, even though many of them did not have a clear ideaof exactly who iNkosazana was, as these things had been long forgotten. It was noted, however, that those who don't observe the day of rest or participate in the rituals have very poor and unproductive gardens. Those who had some hesitation or doubts about the practices were converted Christians, whoclaimed they had abandoned the ways of their ancestors. One such respondent even went so far as to say that these practices \"were things of darkness,\" and that ever since shehad met Jesus, she refrained from the practices of Nomkhubulwana . All the respondents endorsed their sup- port for traditional leadership through the chiefs. This is ofinterest because I believe traditional governance through the chiefs has a powerful role to play in ecological manage- ment, particularly where it has been sanctioned by the spiritworld. While these examples can be seen as convenient idioms in which communities object to the forces of modernity, capital-ism, monotheism, land invasion, and loss of control of re- sources, it cannot be denied that they have all experienced the negative ecological and social consequences that devel-opment has brought. These negative consequences merelyconfirm the community 's conviction that the divine powers of the water have been disturbed, and this idiomatic expression is the most effective means by which protest can be voiced. Environmental Threats to Sacred Pool Sites: Implications for Indigenous Knowledge___________ In the majority of the areas where I have conducted research, sacred pool sites of key significance for healers arebeing systematically threatened by development projects, mining, and modern agricultural practices. The privatization of land has led to many of the sacred pools being inaccessibleto healers, and a number of healers have been arrested and imprisoned for crossing private land to get to the sacred pools. These restrictions can severely hinder a healer'straining process. Environmental damage through development initiatives also pose a great threat to both the physical and sacredstatus of pools. For example, in the Venda region of South Africa, a recent newspaper report has highlighted the envi- ronmental damage that is being inflicted on Lake Fundudzi(sacred to the Venda people) and other river systems in the region by large scale mining and chemical and industrial development projects in the area. Many of the rivers in theregion are so polluted with chemicals and radiation that livestock and humans who drink from the water are suffer- ing from multiple health problems, including birth defects.The newspaper, Mail and Guardian (Nkosi and Arenstein 2001: 4), reports: The threats to Lake Fundudzi were caused...because the province failed to allocate enough staff to its environmental impact assessment division and expected two staff to process 15 environmental impact assessments, 35 mining applica-tions and roughly 15 other large development applications a month. The government therefore simply allowed subsis- tence farmers to invade and begin ploughing the steep hillsabove Lake Fundudzi on poorly constructed terraces without conducting environmental impact assessments or obeying other land use laws. This report possibly overemphasizes the role of environ- mental impact assessments in curtailing such negativeeffects, and does not investigate disadvantages of such large-scale development projects in the region, or why there has been a need for local peasant farmers to move into thearea in the first place. In the past, the region around the lake has been strictly monitored. van de Waal (1997: 51) documents the difficulties re- searchers had in gaining access to the sacred lake, and he describes the \"myths and superstitions\" regarding it in the Venda region. These are completely in keeping with thegeneral conceptions of the snake (python) and the water spirits that I have already outlined. This lake itself is alleged to be inhabited by the ancestral spirits of the Vhatavhatsindi people. Even today, the foreign public is not allowed access to the lake. Only Gota (headman)Netshiavha can give permission to visit the lake itself. In an attempt to conduct surveys on the lake, lengthy negotiations with the headman and his Tshivase Tribal authority atMukumbane and Chief Tshivase himself were required, after which temporary permission was given to conduct a short pilot survey on the lake in 1988 which was later withdrawn. The impact of large-scale agroforestry in many of the areas where sacred pools exist pose another serious threat to their well-being. The Mvoti River, which I have already discussed, is under serious threat by intensive agroforestry(pine, gum, wattle, and poplar plantations) and sugar canefarming. Most of the Upper Mvoti Catchment region, whichfeeds into this river, is now owned by a number of large,multinational agroforestry companies. A report done on the status of this catchment area by MBB Engineering (Anon 1998) notes extensive afforestation, withmarked reduction in streamflow. According to this report, ahigh density of alien vegetation presently exists in theriparian zones of the various subcatchments in the area.This is in direct contravention of the law, which in terms ofthe Conservation of Agricultural Resource Act (1983), statesthat no cultivation or soil disturbance may take place, and notrees may be planted, within a minimum distance of 30 m (98feet) from the edge of any watercourse, stream or river, orwithin 50 m (164 feet) of any vlei, wetland, or spring.Furthermore, landowners are legally responsible for clear-ing aliens from riparian zones and for maintaining thesezones in an \"alien free\" state. With regard to the Upper Mvoti Catchment, the report (E.1.3.) notes that, The Act is difficult to enforce and remote sensing studies in a number of catchments reveal great variation in the applica- tion of the law and numerous cases of flagrant disregard. The general consensus of the community surveyed in the valley is that the water levels of the river have droppedUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 153Bernard Ecological Implications of Water Spirit Beliefs in Southern Africa... considerably in recent years, thus supporting the findings of the report. Similarly, I am working in another area in the northeast- ern Cape where there is a pool of great significance to the local Xhosa/Mpondomise people. This pool is so sacred thatno one is allowed to approach it unless being led there by children. The pool has recently become a popular trout fishing spot for many South African anglers, which has the potential to threaten its sacred status. Furthermore, this pool is now under threat from large agroforestry plantations that are being planted over an extensive area upstream in the river'smain catchment area, which includes a significant wetland that has been nominated as a RAMSAR site (see http:// www.ramsar.org/index_about_ramsar.htm#rd) worthy ofprotection. A hydrological survey conducted in this quater- nary catchment in 1996 to 1997, to assess the implications of afforestation for the river, predicted marked reductions instreamflow of 18 to 31 percent in the next 10 years (Forsyth and others 1997). At present, there are scarcely any mechanisms by which healers can appeal for protection of sacred water sites and ensure access to them. One option would be the introduction of \"culture significance\" legislation in line with sacred siteprotection laws that have been introduced in other coun- tries, such as Australia (Ritchie 1994). The South African National Heritage Resources Act (www.acts.co.za/ntl_heritage_res/National: 1), 1999, has already established a framework in which such protection could be accommo- dated. It states that, For the purposes of this Act, those heritage resources of South Africa which are of cultural significance or other special value for the present community and for future gen- erations must be considered part of the national estate and fall within the sphere of operations of heritage resource authorities...the national estate may include...landscapesand natural features of cultural significance. This may provide protection for sites, but in does not go far enough to ensure rights of access, particularly when it involves private land. Potential legislative protection could also be afforded through the concept of the Reserve, as outlined in the National Water Act of 1998. The notion of the Reserveconsists of two parts: 1. The quantity and quality of water required for basic human use (including religious and cultural needs). 2. The ecological Reserve, which is defined as the water required to protect the aquatic ecosystems of the water resource. In addition to the Reserve, the National Water Act has promoted the development of Catchment ManagementAgencies and Water User Associations through the develop- ment of the Water Conservation and Demand Management Strategy. Such structures may also provide a frameworkthrough which claims to protection and use can be negotiated.Conclusions____________________ In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated the scope and complexity of common African perceptions of water sources in Southern Africa and the need to recognize the importance of indigenous beliefs and practices in issues of riverinemanagement. The repository of much of this knowledge comes from indigenous healers, who are regarded as the custodians of very ancient traditional wisdom and knowl-edge. This transferred knowledge is augmented through spiritual insight and communication with the ancestral world, and passed on to future generations through rigoroussystems of training and apprenticeship. This knowledge is dependent on the availability and accessibility of resources. Without the plants needed to get spiritual insight, or with-out the presence of healthy water sources where the spirit forces reside, access to such knowledge will be denied. Moreover, knowledge is now under tremendous threat ofbeing discarded and forgotten, as many communities are abandoning their traditional ways in favor of western edu- cation and capitalist enterprise, where the priorities forindividual accumulation override the collective needs of the group, with resulting devastating effects on the environ- ment (both physical and spiritual) and the source of theirknowledge.

Proc. RMRS-P-27. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014This paper outlines the findings of questionnaire re- search undertaken by a conservation nongovernment organization (NGO), the Zambezi Society, to capture perceptions about wilder-ness and its values from people visiting four Zambezi River tourism destinations in Zimbabwe. The research was conducted during a tourism boom in the area when the Society was receiving complaintsthat the wild values of the river were being eroded by tourism malpractice. The research produced a visitor-generated definition of \"wilder- ness\" in the Zambezi River context; a list of the attributes that make a place wild; an indication of the high value of a wilderness experience to Zambezi visitors; a list of factors that detract from people'senjoyment of a wilderness experience; a list of the wild areas most valued by visitors to the Zambezi; and some detailed observations about the Zambezi tourism experience, including problems at VictoriaFalls. The Zambezi Society recognizes the vital role that tourism must play in ensuring the survival of wild areas in developing Africa. Itsresearch suggests that because such high value is placed on the Zambezi's wild nature by surveyed visitors, wilderness tourism should be promoted as the most appropriate and sustainable optionfor the area. However, this cannot take place without wilderness sensitivity being incorporated into Zambezi Valley tourism plan- ning, management, and practice. The Society proposes a series ofwilderness training workshops for the natural resource and tourism sectors in order to create awareness and establish guidelines for wilderness-sensitive planning, management, and practice at alllevels. The Zambezi Society is seeking sponsorship to implement this plan. Introduction ____________________ The Zambezi Society is a Zimbabwe-based nongovern- mental (NGO) membership organization devoted to conserv- ing the biodiversity and wilderness values of the ZambeziRiver in Central and Southern Africa, and to encouraging people to find ways of benefiting from the river's resources without destroying them. During the latter half of the 1990s, the Society began to receive numerous complaints and concerns from variousZambezi River: Wilderness and Tourism Research Into Visitor Perceptions About Wilderness and Its Value Sally Wynn sources, implying that tourism was having a negative im- pact on the Zambezi River's wilderness values. The reportswere wide ranging: unchecked commercialization, ad hoc development, tree cutting, border violations, unauthorized road and camp building, noise pollution, littering and abuseof camping sites, illicit tour and guiding activities, and so on. The overriding tenor was that the special \"wilderness value\" of the Zambezi River was being eroded by inappropriatetourism behavior and development. To provide a balanced response, the Society embarked on a research project in 1998 aimed at capturing peoples'perceptions about wilderness in the Zambezi context, as well as providing a workable definition of the term \"wilderness,\" its \"values,\" and its importance to visitors to the Zambezi. It was hoped that this information might also help The Zambezi Society to make a meaningful and practical contri- bution toward conserving Zambezi wild areas by influencingmanagement authorities and tourism practice. Methodology ___________________ Research was conducted by questionnaire interview in four main Zambezi Valley tourism destinations on the Zim- babwean side of the river: (1) Victoria Falls (fig. 1), (2) Kariba/ Matusadona National Park, (3) Mana Pools National Park, and (4) Kanyemba/Mavuradonha Wilderness Area. Mem- bers of the Zambezi Society were also asked to complete apostal questionnaire. A total of 1,524 people were interviewed via 633 question- naires. A wide variety of visitor types were chosen, encom-passing those staying in hotels, safari lodges/safari camps, self-catering/National Park lodges, on houseboats, and ca- noeing and camping. Of visitors interviewed, 44 percent were of local/regional origin, and 56 percent were international. Zambezi Society members interviewed were mainly local. Main Findings __________________ Visitors to the Zambezi Value Wilderness Highly Ninety-eight percent of those interviewed felt it to be important that wilderness exists. Eighty-four percent said they value wildernesspersonally. Seventy-seven percent said they came to the Zambezi Valley for a wilderness experience.156 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Wynn Zambezi River: Wilderness and Tourism Research Into Visitor Perceptions about Wilderness and Its Value Responses to the Questionnaire Provided a Fairly Comprehensive Definition of the Term \"Wilderness\" This may be summarized as: ...a natural, undeveloped and unpopulated landscape, which is scenically attractive or unusual, contains indigenous spe-cies, and induces an emotional state of mind in which the visitor may feel any or all of the following: in harmony with nature, freed from \"civilization,\" inspired, refreshed, invigo-rated, challenged, stimulated, humbled, or spiritually fulfilled. A detailed breakdown of responses to this question is provided in table 1. The definition had two basic compo- nents: physical values and nonphysical values. Physical Values of Zambezi Wilderness These appear to be especially valued by international visitors interviewed and include: Natural/unspoilt landscapes\u2014wide open spaces, and afeeling that little has changed. (This is a fallacy, as nature is always in a state of flux, but nonetheless, the illusion is a powerful draw for wilderness appreciators.)Wild species\u2014animals roaming free, indigenous plants. Lack of people\u2014including the signs of their existence,for example, pollution, litter, vehicles, noise. Lack of development\u2014wilderness is seen as an escapefrom/in direct contrast to urban civilization. Lack of commercialization\u2014commercial tourism devel- opment/activities, and so forth, seem to be considered inappropriate to wilderness areas, whereas low-impactstructures/activities in harmony with nature are con- sidered appropriate Nonphysical Values of Zambezi Wilderness These are often neglected in tourism planning, but are particularly important to local/regional visitors for whom wildlife is less of a novelty, and for Zambezi Society mem- bers. They include: Peace. Solitude. Isolation. A feeling of harmony with nature. Spiritual feelings. Challenge. Adventure. Areas of the Zambezi River Considered by Visitors To Be Most Important for Wilderness Appreciation These include: Mana Pools National Park (fig. 2)/Chewore Safari Area \u2014 includes the Sapi Safari Area and Middle Zambezi (veryhigh wilderness satisfaction level). Lake Kariba/Matusadona National Park\u2014especiallyaway from Kariba town (high wilderness satisfaction). Park/Mavuradonha Wilderness Area\u2014Zambezi escarpment mountainous terrain, dif- ferent from the Valley as such. Especially popular withlocal visitors (good wilderness satisfaction). Victoria Falls/Chirundu/Kanyemba\u2014relatively settled/urbanized, but with pockets of important wildernessnearby (for example, Zambezi National Park near Victoria Falls). (Wilderness satisfaction is lower here than in other areas possibly due to the impacts ofsettlement and developmental infrastructure.)

Depending ontheir perceived impact on wilderness, these activities were categorized into three groups (low/medium/high). Among the 10 most popular activities undertaken by visitors inter-viewed, seven fall within the low-impact category. Theyinclude: birdwatching, walking, photography, fishing (from land), picnicking. The remain- ing three\u2014sightseeing, gameviewing, and camping\u2014arecategorized as having medium impact. High-impact activi- ties are mainly undertaken by visitors to Victoria Falls, Lake Kariba, and Kanyemba. None of the most popularvisitor activities, nor those that are special to Mana Pools National Park (fig. 3), fall within the intrusive category. Thismay partly explain the reason for Mana receiving high ratings for wilderness experience. Main Factors That Detract From a Wilderness Experience These were identified in visitor responses to the survey. Table 2 det ails an o utline broken down by areas of inter- view. To summarize, the main detractions are: Too many people\u2014pollution/litter, unruly/insensitivebehavior (such as harassing wildlife with too many tourvehicles), drunken/noisy behavior on river cruises, and harassment by vendors/dealers. Noise\u2014human-generated (for example, loud radios/ music in campsites), unnatural, mechanical noise (for example, generators near lodges/camps, motorboats/ motorbikes/trucks/aeroplanes). Natural sounds appearto be quite acceptable. Overdevelopment\u2014too much infrastructure, too manyroads, lights, too many regulations. People appear toseek wilderness to get away from the hustle and bustle of urban civilization/development. Civilization detracts from wilderness. Commercial tourism\u2014There is a strong feeling from visitors that low-key/low-impact infrastructure/activi- ties designed to be nature sensitive are acceptable inwilderness areas. It is felt that commercial tourism is not, for example, big/luxury/high-rise hotels; insensi- tive architecture; advertising billboards on the edge of aWorld Heritage Site; inappropriate activities, for ex-ample, commercial sales outlets at the entrance to the \"rainforest\" at the Falls; and \"tame\" wildlife. Exploita- tion/extortion and harassment by vendors and dealersis seen as detracting from wilderness quality. These problems were of particular concern to visitors inter- viewed in Victoria Falls. Impacts on nature\u2014damage to ecosystems, tree cut- ting/poaching, and presence of exotic species. Some Hotels and Tour Operators May Be Contribut- ing to the Erosion of Wilderness Quality \u2014This was noted in highly commercialized tourism areas, such asVictoria Falls and Kariba town, where some tourism opera- tions offer choices of activities as part of package tours that have high impacts on wilderness. Such activities include:scenic flights, river cruises, motorboating, golf, casinos, and tourist \"traps\" (for example, moneymaking activities consid- ered inappropriate and insensitive to wilderness). Motor-boating on the Zambian side of the river opposite Mana Pools National Park, for example, is mentioned as a considerable detraction to the wilderness experience of visitors staying atMana. The presence of houseboats and the noise of their engines and generators are mentioned as detracting from the wilderness quality of the Matusadona National Park,especially in the Kariba Eastern Basin. Wilderness Satisfaction Is Lower in Victoria Falls Than in Other Areas of the Zambezi River Used in the Survey \u2014Sixty-nine percent of visitors interviewed in Victoria Falls were satisfied with the quality of their wilder-ness experience (as opposed to 92 percent in Mana Pools). It is possible that the quality of the wilderness experience inFigure 2\u2014Elephants at Mana Pools National Park (taken by Dick Pitman of The Zambezi Society).

Of People Interviewed in Victoria Falls, 58 Percent Were Visiting No Other Destination in the Zambezi Valley \u2014The Zambezi Society believes that by experienc- ing a much-impacted wilderness, visitors to the Zambeziwho only visit the Falls may be missing out on the true wilderness value of the River. This has implications for tourism marketing. Provision of Tourism Information or Interpretative Material Is Inadequate \u2014Visitors interviewed expressed this opinion, especially in Mana Pools and Kariba/Matu- sadona National Park. People Visiting the Wilder Areas of the Zambezi River Expressed Themselves More Ready to Contrib- ute Toward Wilderness Conservation Than ThoseVisiting More Heavily Developed or Impacted Ar- eas\u2014While less than half the visitors interviewed in Victoria Falls and 55 percent of those interviewed in Kariba wereprepared in principle to contribute financially to maintain- ing wilderness areas, 70 percent of those interviewed in Mana Pools National Park and in Zambezi Valley communallands expressed themselves willing to do so. The Zambezi River Is Visited by a Significant Pro- portion of Independent Travelers (in other words, people traveling without a tour operator or guide). This Tourism Category Has No Current Representa-tive Voice \u2014Most people interviewed (73 percent) were visiting the Zambezi independently. Only 27 percent of visitors interviewed in all areas were accompanied on theirholiday by a tour operator or guide. Although there are touroperator and professional guiding associations through which the interests of some Zambezi users might be represented, there is currently no association or organization represent-ing the views of the independent visitor to the Zambezi. Some Observations on Research Findings _______________________ The Zambezi Society survey clearly confirms the impor- tance of \"a wilderness experience\" to people visiting the Zambezi. In view of the economic and investment benefitsthat international tourism brings to the region, this would seem to underline the need to ensure that the river's wild values are conserved and to promote wilderness-sensitivetourism in preference to other Zambezi tourism options. However, there is a perception that setting aside wild places for the enjoyment of a few tourists and wildernessenthusiasts is a luxury that Africans can ill afford. Current land use pressures and other development priorities tend to push wilderness awareness, conservation, and managementvery low down on the planning agenda, and a tendency to maximize on short-term revenues at the expense of long- term sustainability is a problem becoming all too evident intourism \"hot-spots\" like Victoria Falls. This shows a singular lack of understanding, not only of the vital link between tourism and development, but of thetrue value of Africa's wild areas to the Continent's people.The developed world's astonishing record of environmental destruction now Africa's \"pristine\" wildernesses glo-bal assets of great value\u2014both biologically and in terms of their economic potential from sustainable tourism. The Zambezi River with its tropical diversity, forests, birds, andlarge mammals has wilderness qualities that are unique in the Southern African region, and unlike other wild tropical rivers like the Congo, the Zambezi is an attractive tourismdestination, being relatively accessible and safe. Governments of developing nations are not unaware of this. The collapse of Zimbabwe's tourism industry as a resultof recent political and economic turmoil has been a bitter pill to swallow. Its ripple effects have been felt throughout the Southern African region. In its efforts to recover, the indus-try is now considering new options, and is undergoing a process of creative planning and review that might not otherwise have occurred in the bustle of a thriving tourismmarketplace. The Zambezi Society believes that its research on wilderness is well timed to take advantage of the current climate of review. Recommendations ______________ The Zambezi Society's recommendations resulting from the research, therefore, have two main messages: 1. Market wilderness and promote Zambezi Valley wil- derness tourism. 2. Safeguard wilderness by incorporating wilderness sen- sitivity into all tourism planning, management, and practice for the Zambezi Valley. Marketing Wilderness Specific recommendations for wilderness marketing include: 1. Recognize the importance of wilderness and promote it. 2. Market a \"Zambezi wilderness experience\" and spe- cific, low-impact wilderness activities to selected tourismmarkets. 3. Target tourism markets that specifically appreciate wilderness. 4. Provide more information/interpretation for visitors on the Zambezi River and its wilderness (preferably available free of charge). Safeguarding Wilderness Through Sensitive Planning, Management, and Practice Specific recommendations include: 1. Incorporate \"the wilderness experience\" into tourism planning. 2. Safeguard wilderness quality by developing wilder- ness-sensitive guidelines for conservation and tourism. 3. Ensure that tourism activities and facilities in priority wilderness areas are appropriate and wilderness sensitive. 4. Monitor effectiveness of and compliance with guide- lines and visitor satisfaction with the wilderness experience.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 161Wynn Zambezi River: Wilderness and Tourism Research Into Visitor Perceptions about Wilderness and Its Value 5. Improve the quality of the wilderness experience at Victoria Falls. 6. Encourage wilderness visitors to contribute to main- taining wilderness areas. 7. Establish an association/organization to represent the interests of independent visitors to the Zambezi. Followup ______________________ The Zambezi Society recently presented the findings of its research on wilderness values to Zimbabwean tourismpolicymakers, planners, and operators, as well as to the planning authorities, custodians, and managers of wild places along the Zambezi River. The Society pointed out thepotential for wilderness-focused and wilderness-sensitive tourism all along the Zambezi Valley as being the most suitable, low-impact, sustainable option for Zambezi wildareas, and urged the authorities to incorporate this into their marketing strategies. However, the Society also under- lined that such promotion will destroy the river's uniquewilderness qualities unless wilderness-sensitivity is incor- porated into the planning, management, and practice of all existing and future Zambezi Valley tourism. The research findings were well received, and much inter- est has been generated. The Zambezi Society has been invited to contribute to the development process of Zim babwe's Tourism Master Plan, which is currently under discussion. The Society attended the 7 th World Wilderness Congress in South Africa in November 2001, sponsored by the WILDFoundation, and through this same sponsor was able to send the Acting Chief Warden of Zimbabwe's National Park's Department to the week-long, pre-Congress WildernessManagement Training Program. The Society specificallychose a candidate who would be in a position to influencefuture policy on wilderness management and tourism within this Parks Department, which is the statutory custodian ofmany of the Zambezi River's wild areas. As a result of the valuable learning experience afforded to its Chief Warden and through contacts made at the Congress, the Departmenthas lent its full support to The Zambezi Society's efforts to develop its own program of wilderness management train- ing for Zambezi wilderness custodians and managers inZimbabwe, Mozambique, and Zambia. The Way Forward: Training and Practical Guidelines _____________ The Zambezi Society is now seeking urgent funding to hold a series of preliminary practical training programs and workshops with custodians, managers, and tourism practi-tioners operating in Zambezi Valley wild areas. The objec- tive would be: 1.To underscore the significance and value of the Zambezi's wilderness areas. 2. To reexamine existing conservation and tourism poli- cies in light of The Zambezi Society research. 3. To examine some examples of wilderness conservation and management from other parts of the world and assess to what extent these might be applicable in the Zambezi context. 4. To develop some practical ways of encouraging wilder- ness-sensitive management and tourism in Zambezi wildareas in the immediate future. (The Zambezi Society would, for example, like to publish a series of Guidelines or Codes of Conduct for management and tourism practitioners, whichwould be widely distributed throughout the tourism andresource management sectors.)1635.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014At the root of our contemporary ecological crisis is a mindset that disregards the Lordship, Sovereignty, Power, Control, and Will of God in the universe. The Islamic world view andcivilization centers around the Oneness of Allah or God. Nature is Allah's creation, it is a sacred gift for our living planet, and it is through the wonders of nature that one begins to appreciate theunique power and singular majesty of God. The human being, God's trustee on Earth, is responsible for treating the environment with care, love, and respect. In her/his capacity as God's trustee, thehuman being must ensure that natural resources are used in a judicious manner so that future generations will benefit from God's bounties. The Islamic Approach____________ In Islam, nature is God's handiwork, which contains His bounties meant for human use and enjoyment within the limits set by Divine Law. Nature is therefore not a resource without an owner, for God is the Owner of nature. TheQur'an contains numerous verses ( ayat) that reassert this idea that the universe is Allah's creation and that His Dominion over all that is created is absolute (Ali 1991). For example: To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth And God has power over all things. (Surah Ali-Imran , [The Family of Imran], chapter 3, verse 189) And again: Unto God belongs all that is in the heavens and all That is on earth. (Surah Al Rum , [The Romans], chapter 30, verse 26) The Qur'an declares that the creation of the universe, of nature, and of the human being is purposive or teleologicaland that these are signs ( ayat) of God's Existence, Power, Wisdom, and Purpose (Ali 1991). It states: Behold! In the creations of the heaven and the earth, and the Alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for All who are endowed with insight.(Surah Ali Imran , chapter 3, verse 190)Preserving Paradise Through Religious Values of Nature: The Islamic Approach Hafiz Nazeem Goolam And again: And in the succession of night and day, and in the means Of subsistence which God sends down from the skies, Thereby giving life to the earth after it had been lifelessAnd in the change of the winds: These are signs For people who use their intellect. (Al Jathiyah [The Kneeling Down] chapter 45, verse 5) In the Islamic world view, the universe, the Earth and their contents are made subservient to the human being, butnot in the sense that the human being can do with it what she/he likes. Rather, the position of the human being is one of trusteeship ( khilafah ), and this position carries with it great moral responsibility. As the trustee of God on Earth, the human being is responsible for treating the environment with care, love, and respect, as well as ensuring that theplanet's natural resources are used in a judicious manner so that future generations will benefit from God's bounties. Again, the Qur'an speaks: O mankind! Worship your Sustainer, who has created you And those who lived before you, so that you may Remain conscious of your duty towards Him Who has made the earth a resting place for you and The sky a canopy, and has sent down water from the sky And thereby brought forth fruits for your sustenance.(Al Baqarah [The Heifer] chapter 2, verse 21-22) Indeed, leaf or Umsinsi, which is the em- blem of the Wilderness Leadership School, symbolizes the relationships between homo, terra, and Deus (the humanbeing, Earth, and God). To fulfill God's trust, in relation to both the environment and the community, the human being must abide by those values and principles of life and livingthat lie at the very core of God's eternal message to human- ity. What this means is that mercy, love, and compassion should guide the human being in her/his interaction with theenvironment and the community. She/he should hold in check greed and avarice and that all too human tendency to pursue selfish interests to the detriment of her/his fellowhuman beings. A moderate lifestyle that reflects balance and equilibrium is the most cherished value of the Islamic world view. This leads to the question: What is the purpose of the human being on Earth, what is the purpose of life? One cannot discuss this question in any detail in this paper, butsuffice it to say that, in the context of the environment and of nature, the Islamic world view postulates that the life of the human being is subject to a perpetual test by Godregarding the human being's behavior toward, and utiliza- tion of, all God-given, natural resources (both material and nonmaterial). Are there, then, any principles or values interms of which the human being should be guided by in her/ his utilization of the planet's natural resources?166 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Goolam Preserving Paradise Through Religious Values of Nature: The Islamic Approach One\u2014perhaps it is the essence\u2014of the fundamental prin- ciples of Islam is Balance or Meezan . This idea, applied to environmental ethics, requires an equilibrium between material progress or economic development on the one hand and the protection and conservation of the environment onthe other. Harith bin Khelef, the Chief Mufti of Zanzibar, pointed to the need of Islam to put human beings and other organisms in good order, balance. If not, then there would bemischief and disaster on our planet. Indeed, the fall of nations and kingdoms is, from an Islamic viewpoint, a consequence of the human being's ingratitude to God. Anexample is the parable of an ungrateful nation, the kingdom of Sheba in Southwestern Arabia. In the Qur'anic chapter, appropriately entitled Saba or Sheba, we find the following (Ali 1991): Indeed in the beauty of their homeland the people of Sheba had Evidence of God's Grace\u2014two vast expanses of gardenssaying, \"Eat of what your Sustainer has provided for you, and render Thanks unto Him: a land most goodly, a SustainerMuch-Forgiving.\" But they turned away from Us, and so We let loose upon them A flood that overwhelmed the dams and transformed their twoVast expanses of gardens into gardens yeilding bitter fruits Tamarisks and a few lote-trees. (Verses 15-19; see also Al Nahl [Bees], chapter 16, verses 112-113) The Islamic world view, through the principle or idea of Meezan (Balance), establishes an equilibrium between eco- nomic development and environmental protection. How-ever, the practical implementation of this idea has declined within the Islamic world. What are the reasons for this decline? Very briefly, five reasons can be outlined: 1. Ossification within religious civilizations, which very often creates a situation whereby the underlying values and true spirit are forgotten or set aside and, instead, static lawsand antiquated practices are projected as the defining char- acteristics of a particular faith. 2. The dominant pervasive power and influence of West- ern secular civilization in the contemporary world. The secularization of society, which has its roots in the European Renaissance, reached its peak in the twentieth century withthe acceptance that religion is a private matter and has nothing to do with issues in the public realm, including the community's relationship with the environment. 3. The rise of a secular world view has seen the dramatic expansion of a global economy, which emphasizes the maxi- mization of profits, the penetration of markets, and theattainment of high growth rates with little attention being accorded to balanced development and ethical values. 4. Many of the elites in the South, who are either the direct products of colonial education or the indirect products of neocolonial cultural and media indoctrination, possess meager knowledge of what their religious philosophies sayabout the environment or about the human being's role as God's trustee on Earth, or about the nexus between God (the Creator), the natural environment, and human values. As aresult, many planners, public administrators, academics, professionals, teachers, and journalists are in no position to address wilderness, environment, and development from areligious or spiritual perspective.5. Even if there are groups capable of articulating the religious world view, there is no guarantee that they will riseto the defense of the environment or espouse the cause of balanced development, especially if their own interests or others associated with them are involved. Vested interestslinked to wealth, power, and status have always subverted sublime values and altruistic ideals. This is why, in today's world, the greatest threat to the practice of harmoniousrelations with the environment is the demon of self-serving interests appearing in some guise. Indeed, the degradation of the environment is the result of the human being's disregard of God's Guidance on the Management of His Resources. I believe that there lieswithin a God-centered world view an indisputable strength. This is why there should and must be a concerted effort to educate society on the significance of a God-centered worldview, not just for the sake of the environment or for the sake of balanced development but, more importantly, for the sake of the future of humanity itself (Fatimah and Rahman 1995;Tyndale 2001). What is urgently and desperately required in our world is a paradigm shift from a materialistic, secularistic worldview to an integralistic, transcendentalist world view, a world view that all religions postulate (Hassan 1995). This paradigm implies, inter alia, that: 1. Human and natural resources are God-given bounties and constitutive of the Divine Trust ( amanah ) held by the human being. 2. The concept of accountability is not confined to public accountability or accountability to human superiors, but isextended to include answerability to God. 3. The idea that Allah is the True Owner and Manager of His Resources liberates the human mind from the false sense of autonomy or dominion over the Earth's naturalresources. As the late Dag Hammarskjold (in Muzaffar 1995: 8) once couched it: On the bookshelf of life God is a useful work of reference, always at hand but seldom consulted.

This paper draws upon both western and eastern religious traditions to suggest what features ofwilderness are sources of these benefits. Poets and nature writers are used to support and enrich the paper. The God of western monotheism is portrayed as eternal, unchanging, and omnipotent.Buddhism suggests that everything is constantly changing and that this is an aspect of duhkha and our dissatisfaction. For if everything changes, then everything we love will perish. Through wildernesswe can have intimate experience of powerful forces and ancient things, from the stars above and the mountains around, to the \"eternal\" cycles of nature. For many, these provide the closestapproach to direct experience of God's power and eternity, and the spiritual comfort these can provide. Just as we find features of wilderness that answer to our spiritual needs, so too our own psyches help to explain the peace of mind wilderness gives us. When we go into the wilderness we leave behind our normal cares and obligations, and live for a time a simpler lifewith simpler concerns, and we experience this change as a new- found peace of mind. We also challenge ourselves with material simplicity and physical exertion beyond our normal routine. Inreturn we experience a kind of self-transcendence and renewal akin to the \"rebirth\" known in nearly every spiritual tradition. Introduction ____________________ I am concerned with the wilderness as we imagine it, or in the current phrase, the wilderness we have \"constructed.\" Scientifically verifiable features of wilderness inspire manyof our spiritual experiences of it. If this were not true, then we would have these experiences as readily in a shopping mall as in wild places. Still, our minds contribute essentialcomponents to our spiritual experiences in wilderness, expe- riences to which we would remain blind if we lacked the needed sensitivity. As sight emerges only when somethingvisible encounters an eye capable of seeing, so too spiritual experiences require both an inner and an outer dimension. Who is the \"we\" who have these spiritual experiences of nature? First and foremost it is I, for this essay is necessarily autobiographical. My own wilderness journeys gave me the lens through which to see what others might find there aswell. But if this were no more than an autobiographicalSources of Spiritual Benefits of Wilderness: A Philosopher's Reflections Baylor Johnson report it would be of little interest. So, I have tried to find confirmation for my feelings in writers who have recordedtheir own responses to wild nature. Ultimately, I think the experiences of which I write are shared by many moderns, particularly those influenced by the history and literature ofEurope and its satellite cultures. I have traced some ele- ments of this experience beyond the western cultural tradi- tion, and to me the experiences seem so deeply natural thatI am tempted to think that anyone who is capable of opening himself or herself to nature must have them. I also know, however, that it is difficult to sort what we contribute toexperience from what we find there, and so I will content myself with this narrower claim: I hope to have captured some central elements of the spiritual experience that manymodern westerners have of wild nature. If these experiences are something that we share with our brothers and sisters born to other cultures, then that is good. But I do not claimto know enough to say that this is so. Although I do not want to claim too wide a scope for the spiritual experiences I describe here, the spiritual yearningsthat underlie them are transcultural. According to the teachings of Buddha, for example, at the heart of human existence lies duhkha . Though often translated as \"suffer- ing,\" a better rendering might be \"unsatisfactoriness\" (Hagen1997). Buddha himself began his quest for enlightenment when, after an extraordinarily sheltered childhood, he dis- covered that disease, aging, and death are unavoidable forall living beings. Though duhkha is a multifaceted concept, a core element is the fact of change. Nothing abides. We ourselves and everyone we love will age and die. Everyinstitution, every cause to which we devote our care and efforts will eventually decay and cease to exist. Wherever we seek, we can find nothing that remains stable and unchang-ing. As a result, all our mundane hopes are doomed to failure, for in the end, if everything changes, nothing can be accomplished\u2014not, anyway, as a permanent achievement. I think it is putting it mildly to say that this isn't a happy thought, as it is stating the obvious to say that the Christian idea of an eternal and unchanging God who blesses us witheternal life, reveals a western response to the same fear of impermanence. The solutions are different. Buddhism says that change and impermanence are ineliminable features ofexistence and counsels us on how to live in peace with them. Christianity says that they are illusions, and that the deep- est reality is eternal and unchanging. But though the solu-tions are different, the stimulus, the disquiet we feel before the threat of impermanence, is the same. The God of Christianity promises us eternal life. The God of the Old Testament, on the other hand, usually wore a sterner face. This is revealed nowhere more clearly than in the Book of Job (Holy Bible) where God's most faithful servant isvisited with terrible afflictions. Job's friends tell him that he must have sinned and so deserved his punish ment. But Job is168 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Johnson Sources of Spiritual Benefits of Wilderness: A Philosopher's Reflections clearheaded and knows he has done nothing to earn the suffering he endures. He calls upon God to give an account-ing of Himself, and unlike the rest of us, whose sufferings include the abysmal silence of the Universe, Job gets a reply. God comes in the form of a whirlwind and speaks a greathymn, much of it devoted to wild nature. Here are a few excerpts (Job 38: 4-7, 18-21, 31-32): Where wast thou when I foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched theline upon it? Whereupon are the foundations therof fastened? or who laid the corner stone therof; when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?... Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? Declare if thou knowest it all. Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldstknow the paths to the house thereof? Knowest thou because thou wast then born? number of thy days is great?... Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring Mazzaroth in thou guide arcturus with his sons?... The sense of this, I take it, is that Job is not the point of God's creation, but a weak, small, and ignorant fragment of the whole. Why should Job know the reason of his suffering? Why indeed should he think he should know? What he canknow is his modest place in the order of things, and when he knows that, he will understand that he should praise God for the scraps of grace and understanding he has been grantedrather than complaining that he does not understand whatGod alone can grasp. These images of the human condition and of the divine lead us toward the first group of spiritual blessings we findin wilderness. The God who speaks to Job from a whirlwind is mighty beyond Job's imagining. Later, the medieval phi- losophers declared Him\u2014God, I mean\u2014infinite in wisdom,power, and goodness. By definition, we cannot experience what is infinite, for \"infinite\" means \"without limit,\" and what is literally with-out limit exceeds the compass of our senses. This is why God must appear to Job in the form of a whirlwind, as he appears to Moses in the form of a burning bush. He must assumefinite form to be perceptible. Like Job and Moses, if we are to experience God we must find Him in finite form, or perhaps better, in analogous form.Neither the whirlwind nor the burning bush is God, but each is godlike, in a way\u2014in power and mystery perhaps. So, too, wilderness is godlike and answers to our craving for some-thing enduring in the midst of change. As God reminds Job of his finitude\u2014his ignorance, his weakness in comparison to the wonders of nature, the shortness of his life, and theinevitability of his death\u2014so the wilderness reminds us of all these things too. Yet, as God comforted Job despite His awesome presence, so experience of the enduring and awe-some faces of wild nature can comfort us and answer to our yearning to be part of something larger and grander than our puny, short-lived selves. In wilderness we encounter, if not God himself, at least an experience with divine qualities. Wild nature gives us the divine in concrete, finite form. Rocks and rivers, if not eternal,are at least very old, and if each season is new and quickly fades, still the cycle of the seasons is, by comparison with ourshort lives, forever. I live and die in a few decades, but the giant sequoias stand for millennia. So, too, the geese I see winging overhead are as mortal as I, but the pattern ofmigration they enact is ancient and recurring. Whether because the Buddhists are right and nothing is truly un- changing, or else because the theologians are right andeternity, although real, cannot be given to the senses, we can never experience the full eternity of the divine. In wild nature, though, we encounter things and processes that are,from the perspective of puny human life, ancient enough to serve as stand-ins. Immensity and power are also divine qualities found in wilderness. In the modern world few of us live with any real consciousness of the starry heavens above, but when we move into wilderness they replace the roadways of suburbiaas our guides and companions. So, too, the immensity of the mountains, the power of rivers, the glaciers, the sea, are known directly when we travel in the wild. We crave these.And in a strange sense we crave even the knowledge that all of them are indifferent to the human realm\u2014stern and unrelenting like the God of the Old Testament. These\u2014the eternity of wild nature, its awesome power, its indifference to human concerns\u2014are what aesthetic theo- rists have called the \"Sublime.\" Thoreau knew the experi-ence of the sublime as well as any writer ever has. He encountered it when he was among the first white men ever to climb Mt. Katahdin in Maine, later writing (Thoreau1972: 64): Vast, Titanic, inhuman nature has got [the beholder] at disadvantage, caught him alone, and pilfers him of some of his divine faculty. She does not smile on him as in the plains. She seems to say sternly, why came ye here before your time? Thisground is not prepared for you. Is it not enough that I smile in the valleys? I have never made this soil for thy feet, this air for thy breathing, these rocks for thy neighbors. I cannot pitynor fondle thee here, but forever relentlessly drive thee hence to where I am kind. Why seek me where I have not called thee, and then complain because you find me but a stepmother?Shouldst thou freeze or starve, or shudder thy life away, here is no shrine, nor alter, nor any access to my ear. Robinson Jeffers knew the sublime face of nature, too, and used it over and over again as a source of comfort. Here he is, for instance, in Their Beauty Has More Meaning , comforting himself against his own inevitable death (Jeffers 1963: 77). Yesterday morning enormous the moon hung low on the ocean, Round and yellow-rose in the glow of dawn;The night-herons flapping home wore dawn on their wings.Today black is the ocean, black and sulphur the sky,And white seas leap. I honestly do not know which is more beautiful.I know that tomorrow or next year or in twenty yearsI shall not see these things\u2014and it does not matter, it does not hurt;They will be here. And when the whole human race Has been like meRubbed out, they will still be here: storms, moon and ocean,Dawn and the birds. And I say this: their beauty has more meaning Than the whole human race and the race of birds.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 169Johnson Sources of Spiritual Benefits of Wilderness: A Philosopher's Reflections And here he is in a mood many of us have shared in recent days, searching for some solace before the stupidity andcruelty of human doings (Jeffers 1963: 84): Calm and Full the Ocean Calm and full the ocean under the cool dark sky; quiet rocks and the birds fishing; the night-herons Have flown home to their wood...while east and west in Europe and Asia and the islands unimaginable agoniesConsume mankind. Not a few thousand but uncounted millions, not a day but years, pain horror, sick hatred; Famine that dries the children to little bones and huge eyes; high explosive that fountains dirt, flesh and bone-splinters. Sane and intact the seasons pursue their course, autumn slopes to December, the rains will fall And the grass flourish, with flowers in it: as if man's world were perfectly separate from nature's, private and mad.But that's not true; even the P-38s and the Flying Fortresses are as natural as horse-flies; It is only that man, his griefs and rages, are not what they seem to man, not great and shattering, but really Too small to produce any disturbance. This is good. This is the sanity, the mercy. It is true that the murdered Cities leave marks in the earth for a certain time, like fossil rain-prints in shale, equally beautiful. E. B. White, took similar comfort, expressed in the follow- ing more gentle passage (in McKibben 1990: 85): With so much disturbing our lives and clouding our future...it is hard to foretell what is going to happen...I know one thing that has happened: the willow by the brook has slipped into her yellow dress, lending, along with the faded pink of the snow fence, a spot of color to the vast gray-and- white world. I know too, that on some not too distant night,somewhere in pond or ditch or low place, a frog will awake, raise his voice in praise, and be joined by others. I will feel a whole lot better when I hear the frogs. Perhaps Howard Zahniser, who did as much as any single individual to bring about passage of the Wilderness Act of1964, said it most directly (in Nash 1973: 214-215): To know the wilderness is to know a profound humility, to recognize one's littleness, to sense dependence and inter-dependence, indebtedness and responsibility. In wild places, then, we can participate in something that is, if not truly eternal, at least very long enduring in compari- son to human life, and this is a comfort in the face of our ownmortality and the impermanence of all we care about. It is vitally important to recognize that it is not the abstract idea of the enduring that we encounter in wilderness, but expe-rience of the enduring. Without the idea, our experience would be\u2014as Kant (1929: 93) famously said\u2014blind: \"Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.\" But we can have the idea anywhere and anytime. In wilderness we encounter the divine, or at least its analogue, because we come face to face with ancient thingsand timeless cycles there. You must be a clod indeed to sleep under the tent of stars every night and not be reminded of their age, and, indeed, of the immense mystery that enfoldsour lives. To climb down the Grand Canyon\u2014at least with a modicum of geological knowledge\u2014is to feel oneself descend- ing into the abyss of ages unfathomable. If we learn of thesethings through textbooks, we face them in the wilderness,and it is this face-to-face contact that makes a wilderness experience a spiritual experience. The passages quoted above do not speak only of the timelessness of wild nature. They speak too of its vast size and power, and even its indifference to man. These impres-sions are as powerful to a person in the wilderness as any other. It can be a dangerous and scary place. Storms, the great predators, the huge forces of flood and avalanche, andeven the very immensity of space all demand respect that edges easily into fear. Beyond that, they all remind us in a visceral way of our comparative weakness and vulnerability.As Zahniser says, wilderness engenders humility. But what is it in us that responds to this humbling? Why does some part of us crave knowledge of forces and powersthat belittle us? How is it a spiritual benefit to be thus humbled? Humility is, of course, a virtue. It is good to know one's proper stature, especially in this time of so much human hubris toward nature. But though this may be a good consequence of being humbled by wild nature, it isn't whatmakes us feel so good, so blessed when we sojourn there. The explanation of that, I think, is that wild nature humbles not only us as individuals, but all of human kindand all of its ambitions. To be insignificant in a human crowd is painful, for it reminds us that we have not achieved the fame and fortune that others have. To be insignificant inwild nature, by contrast, can be comforting, for wilderness dwarfs not only ourselves but fame and fortune, too. It provides a perspective from which we can dismiss concernwith all such things and be content with whatever concrete joys life affords us. And in wilderness these joys seem abundant despite the simplicity, and even danger and dep-rivation, that wilderness travel can involve. There is amystery to be solved here that is similar to the mystery of the comfort we find in nature's humbling of us. Why should the deprivation, exhaustion, challenge, and even danger we findin wilderness bring us spiritual joy and peace, a feeling of being fully alive? Surely many different things interact to produce the answer. What we have said above may form a background. In wilderness we may already be feeling the comfort of identification with places and processes much grander andmuch more enduring than our individual egos, and feeling too that the defeats and frustrations of our normal lives are much less important than they seem from an office cubicle.Beyond that, the challenges we overcome in wilderness are empowering and invest us with a sense of our capability and worth. It is important that these challenges do not typically throw one into competition with other people. Where we compete against one another, as willy nilly we must inmodern civilization, there must be both winners and losers, and the losers must outnumber the winners. When, as we usually do in the wild, we compete only against ourselves,success is much more likely, if only because a defeat of one kind\u2014failing to get to the mountain top, for instance\u2014can be a triumph of another\u2014for example, the wisdom of know-ing when to turn back, or the knowledge of how to cope with failure. Indeed, perhaps in wilderness we can temporarily forget about competition and focus instead on competence\u2014acquiring it, testing it, glorying in our possession and growth in it.170 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Johnson Sources of Spiritual Benefits of Wilderness: A Philosopher's Reflections This sense that the wilderness is a place of testing from which we emerge strengthened and cleansed in spirit is not,of course, a modern invention, a kind of urban cowboy play for effete office workers only. The worldwide tradition of vision quests and initiation rituals requiring wildernesssojourns is a reminder of this. So, too, is the story that Jesus tested himself by a journey into the wilderness, which resonates with an even older tradition. Consider this pas-sage from Wilderness and the American Mind (Nash 1973: 16): The Israelites' experience during the forty-year wandering gave wilderness several meanings. It was understood, in the first place, as a sanctuary from a sinful and persecutingsociety. Secondly, wild country came to signify the environ- ment in which to find and draw close to God. It also acquired meaning as a testing ground where a chosen people werepurged, humbled, and made ready for the land of promise. The demands and challenges of wilderness experience focus the traveler's attention in the same way as activities that promote what Csikszentmihalyi (1990) calls \"flow.\"Removal to wilderness has generally already pulled us away from the tensions and troubles of our anxious daily lives. And the life we lead in the wild is not only separate from thesources of our tension, it is also stripped down to basics. We live primitively (or at least did so until the first uncompre- hending fool dragged his cell phone along), and the things wemust do, though possibly challenging, are few and fairly obvious. But they are also important in obvious ways. We need to get to a camping place by sundown; we need our tentsto stand up to the storm. We need to get up and over the pass before that storm breaks. We feel, not the acid stomach created by social anxiety, but the healthy thirst and hungerfrom bodies taxed by exertion. All these elements\u2014physical removal from sources of social anxiety, challenges that are few, focused, and deeply felt, the feelings of competence and worth that we get frommeeting such obvious challenges\u2014cooperate to drive ordi- nary anxieties from our mind, leaving us feeling peaceful, worthy, and open to the spiritual meanings of humility andeternity described earlier. I am not sure whether this is the Bible's \"peace that passeth understanding\" (Holy Bible, Philippians 4: 7), but it is at least akin. I know that the beauty of wild nature is also important to the spiritual peace we find there, but this subject is so large that I shall pass it by with only this one sentence addition towhat others have said. The beauty of the wild commands our attention, pulls us outward and away from our egos, and like the sublime, nurtures the self-forgetting that every spiritualtradition extols. Appreciation of the beauty of wilderness reinforces an effect that begins when we are humbled by wilderness and seek refuge in its timelessness. All of thesepull us away from focus on ourselves as individual egos and toward identification with the larger world, toward, that is, the loss of self that spiritual humility demands. In summary, I have suggested that in wilderness we experience an image or analogue of the divine that speaks to deep-seated spiritual yearnings. Ancient rocks and seas, theseemingly timeless rhythms of life and the seasons comfort us. They say that while individually we and all our earthly hopes are mortal, still we are part of something everlasting.The vast size and awesome power of wild places, and eventheir indifference to us, is, oddly, another source of spiritual comfort. For by comparison with wild nature our personaltroubles, and even the troubling doings of the human race, seem petty enough to be forgotten. Another way of saying this is that wilderness encourages the self-forgetting that isextolled in every spiritual tradition. It pulls us away from our own small troubles and toward identification with a greater whole. This movement is strengthened by physicalremoval from the scenes and causes of our normal concerns, and by the demand that we focus attention on a few deeply felt and immediate concerns. Not least, though neglectedhere, the beauty of nature also consoles us, as all forms of beauty do, and pulls us outward away from self and into our surroundings. I want to close with some questions to which I can suggest only brief and partial answers. As McKibben (1990) has suggested in The End of Nature , the wilderness landscapes that provide our spiritual experiences are endangered, and along with them the sense of nature as a scene of awesome forces and timeless cycles, a place untouched as petty humandramas play out their insubstantial plots. What will happen to this sense of wild nature as a perceptible analogue of the divine, as global climate change and other environmentalthreats change the very face of nature? A lot of the answer depends, of course, on what one thinks will happen. My own expectations are pretty grim. If we have to watch the death,not only of selected species, as we do already, but of whole ecosystems, if reliable patterns of weather and climate change, if even ocean currents and levels themselves alterwith the melting of large permanent ice fields, then I think it will be hard to maintain the feelings about wilderness that I have discussed in this paper. Air pollution creates beautiful sunsets, and so dying landscapes may still have their own stark beauty. There will still be places where humans are few. Titanic forces will still be at work in the world. Our doings do not yet trouble thestars, and so those will remain as symbols of eternity. The mountains will not grow younger because we have increased the atmospheric concentration of CO 2. Rivers and seas will still batter us about, indifferent to our wishes. But these are further removed from the human sphere than the spring peepers E. B. White was waiting to hear. Ifthe frogs are dying, if the dawn that Jeffers beheld recurs, but its birds have become extinct, will we still feel enfolded within the greater rhythms of nature? When what survivesdoes so only by our leave, when the entire world is but a park, and a greatly impoverished one at that, will terrestrial nature seem to anyone divine? Can wild nature figure as arefuge from human mortality and failings when we know that the refuge is mortal and a victim of our failings? I am pessimistic about the answer. I fear that future generations will soon be deprived of the spiritual comfort we have found in wild nature. It will, of course, still be possible to care about wild nature. But this caring will be from adifferent perspective than I have described in this paper. It is, I think, quite possible to care deeply about what depends on you, but it is very difficult to see it as an awesome,everlasting analogue of the divine. Wilderness can no longer be our refuge from the human sphere once its inclusion in the human sphere is obvious. Ultimately, I think some of the spiritual benefits we derive from wilderness depend upon seeing it as other: wildernessUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 171Johnson Sources of Spiritual Benefits of Wilderness: A Philosopher's Reflections represents the natural versus the artificial, the everlasting versus the human and mortal, the all-powerful versus thepetty sphere of mankind. The approaching global environ- mental crises will make it impossible to maintain these dichotomies, as wilderness is revealed to be not a realmapart from the human, but a part of the human realm, and without these dichotomies, our descendants will be deprived of at least some of the spiritual experiences of nature I havedescribed in this paper.

Stories are the primary means our species uses to do this. Stories that rise to the level of myth exert powerful effects on behavior. Thedominant myths that explain our relationship to the natural word have two serious failings: our self-importance and a superficial and simplified image of who we are. These stories obscure more thanthey enlighten, thereby preventing us from addressing the causes of the current extinction crisis. Conservationists can and must fashion new stories that take account of our disproportionate impact on theEarth and its origins in our behavioral plasticity, and that offer rules for constraining our destructive behavior. For such stories to actually work in constraining human behavior, they must be deeplyinternalized and socially reinforced within the framework of exist- ing mythologies, both religious and secular. Two historical ex- amples of how this has worked are examined, and specific recom-mendations are made for how conservationists can maximize their cultural influence through storytelling and mythmaking. Introduction ____________________ When Margaret Thatcher was preparing for the Earth Summit in 1992, she called together a group of scientists toadvise her on the condition of the natural world. She wasuniformly told that things were grim and getting more grim. Extinction rates were climbing, ecosystems were unravel- ing, and humans were on a path that would lead to thedestruction of the Earth. Depressed, she asked if anyone had any good news. James Lovelock spoke up and said he thought it was impossible for humans to destroy the Earth.No doubt, he said, humans were causing a great extinction episode, but five times previously great extinctions had occurred and each time the Earth and life had recovered. ThePrime Minister was cheered and asked Lovelock about this recovery\u2014just how long would it take? Based on past epi- sodes, he answered, about 5 to 15 million years. Primeministerial depression resumed. The meeting in this story may have never happened, but it doesn't really matter. A story need not be true in everysense to make its point. This is especially true of the most important stories. But it's a truth that is often lost today.Our Real Challenge: Managing Ourselves Instead of Nature David M. Johns We are storytelling animals. We make sense of the world using story and metaphor. Even when we think we're beingvery literal, doing science for instance, rather than story- telling per se, we usually are relying on metaphor and story to understand and navigate as individuals, groups, andentire cultures. Stories are more than just a means of trying to describe the order of the universe, be it physical or social. They are also the primary way we create order and meaning. There is a real world governed by regularities, and we can discover those regularities and test the truth of our descrip- tions. But we must create meaning and purpose as individu-als and societies; that order is not provided by our DNA for the most part. It is nonetheless real for being created by us. Our lives are shaped by human-created order from birth todeath and on the far side of both events. The truth of this order is made real by our acceptance of it. We do not usually think of that acceptance as creating order. Rather, we regard thecreated order as natural as gravity. This sense of the natural and the proper gives the created order stability in the face of the challenge posed by alternatives that erode the createdorder as surely as entropy does complexity in the natural order. It is a perennial human problem (Rappaport 1999). So, story is central in our lives because we are wired for it and we are wired for it because it's adaptive. Because storiesare so central, it is important that we have good ones. If the map a story provides is bad and the rules inappropriate, our problem solving will suffer. We will suffer, and the Earth willsuffer. Good stories are stories that accurately reflect or other- wise take account of our circumstances. Good stories help us understand the regularities of the universe. Good stories help us create meaning, values, and a human order that sees beyond the short term and impulse. And, good stories rein-force as proper and right our caring for life and that which makes life possible\u2014the Earth and evolution for instance. There are lots of bad stories out there, and they are used to explain and justify our destructive behavior toward the natural world. In some of these stories we are God's gift to the universe, special, and destined to rule. In secular versions of this story we are special because we have reason, but still destined to rule as evolution's gift to the universe. In some versions, wedo great good and improve the world. In others, we are destructive and will bring ruin to creation and ourselves. In other versions, our drive to control and dominate is justnatural\u2014we aren't the only creature that affects its sur- roundings. The problem with all of these stories is that they do not accurately reflect or take account of our circumstances. They do recognize our disproportionate effect on the world, but they do not recognize our limitations and frailties, nor wherewe are headed. They also fail to recognize that our dispropor- tionate effect is a capacity, not a necessary aspect of ourUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 173Johns Our Real Challenge: Managing Ourselves Instead of Nature existence. While there are stories critical of human hubris, they are not aspects of the dominant cultures. Our disproportionate effect on the natural world is the result of our capacity for technological development and our capacity for changing our social organization. These twocapacities allow us to adapt to virtually any ecosystem, and, more importantly, to alter and even destroy ecosystems and species to suit our purposes. The changes in social organiza-tion that marked the neolithic transition to civilization are especially important, for they gave rise to a human social dynamic of competition, conflict, and ever increasing inten-sification of exploitation that drives further manipulation and domination of ecosystems. The transition to hierarchy and civilization may initially have been driven by populationincreases and other factors, but once complex societies are in existence, internal and external conflict in the service of maintaining and extending control become major drivers indevelopment (Adams 1966; Algaze 1993; Chang 1980; Har- 1989; Johnson and Earle 1987; Service 1975; White 1959, 1969, 1987). Despite the cost to nature, most people would argue that civilization and development have been, on balance, good things. Most would also argue that our behavioral plasticityand our capacity for culture are remarkable adaptive mecha- nisms and good things. But capacity for culture, which underlies the behavioral plasticity evidenced in changingtechnology and social organization, clearly has some serious downsides. These include our capacity for lying, denial, distraction, alienation, and myopia. We do not see, or we canignore, the destructive consequences of our actions, espe- cially if they are long-term (Ornstein and Ehrlich 1989). Even in the best of circumstances, we usually cannot fore-cast intergenerationally. Hierarchy further magnifies thesenegative attributes because it means rulers are usually insulated from the consequences of their actions. The ruled and the natural world pay the price. The price is high, both materially and spiritually. D. H. Lawrence (1968: 504) wrote that \"we are bleeding at the roots, because we are cut off from the earth and sun andstars.\" Our capacity for love\u2014that which bonds us to others, to life, to the Earth, withers \"because we plucked it from its stem on the tree of life\" and it can't \"keep on blooming in ourcivilized vase on a table.\" We find ourselves members of societies locked into an adaptive strategy that not only is bad for nature but bad for us in so many ways. But just as a badwound triggers a flood of endorphins so we don't feel the pain instantly, so the wound of our estrangement makes us oblivious to its causes. (Berman 1989; Shepard 1982) Thisallows business as usual to continue, which in turn keeps us estranged. It's not a vicious circle but a downward spiral. We need stories, then, that take account of all this and that can guide us in the creation of societies and policies that care for the natural world. Herman Daly (1996: 59), quoting in part David Orr, put it this way. We need to manage our-selves, not the planet or nature, because nature is not the problem. \"Our self-management needs to be 'more akin to child-proofing a day care center than piloting spaceshipEarth.' We need a playpen in which we can be free but also protected from the excesses of our own freedom.\" We make poor dominants. We are not smart enough to manage nature. To some, this sounds like a call for ecofascism. Perhaps it would be if we tried to impose it from the top down. I thinkany efforts in that direction would fail, and worse, would backfire. There is another way. The ethnographic record is abun- dantly clear: stories deeply anchored psychologically and culturally can guide human action even in the face of humandesires to the contrary, but mostly by affecting the desire in the first place. But it is not just any sort of story that can do this. Only stories that are part of a mythological structure,anchored in the sacred, have this 2001; Fulford 1999; Lakoff 1996; Levi-Strauss 1969, 1973, 1978, 1981). By sacred, I do not necessarily mean religious stories, although they often are. Sacred is the quality of being unquestionable\u2014the basic assumptions that each individualand all cultures necessarily possess at core. Sacred is that which is ultimately invoked to explain the meaning of it all. It is the basis for the human-created order and the particularinterpretation of the nonhuman-created order. Some of you may have trouble conceiving of a secular sacred belief. I offer Einstein. He said that among scientists existed a fundamen-tal belief that knowledge is good. He also noted that such a belief was not falsifiable, not subject to scientific testing. It was a basic assumption, used in turn to legitimize morespecific axioms and rules for behavior. Many nonreligious people hold similarly untestable beliefs that the universe is good, or bad, or moral, or living. Can we really consciously fashion stories that will be accepted and guide human behavior toward the natural world? Stories that would incline people, even motivatethem, to actively support policies doing the same? (The ultimate test in America might be whether we could devise a story that would get people out of their cars.) There is goodreason to think so and let me say why; first, by dealing withsome objections, and then by giving some examples. A first objection to such an effort is that the sacred has mostly been hijacked by ruling elites over the millennia tojustify the social order they construct\u2014orders that benefit them at the expense of everyone else and of nature. There is much truth to this. But the cultural arena remains contestedterritory more than the state or the economy. Wealth and political power are increasingly concentrated and built on the control and destruction of the natural world. Culturalautonomy itself is increasingly limited by the concentration of ownership of cultural institutions\u2014they are at root just another profit making business. Autonomy is further lim-ited because more and more cultural institutions are owned by corporations with a wide range of interests (nuclear power, weapons) they seek to protect by fostering legitimacythrough shaping cultural content. But most cultural tradi- tions, religious and secular, are diverse, home to both rigid dogma and hierarchical control on the one hand, and centersof creativity that are subversive of domination. Although conservation must be effective in the economic and political arenas, building this effectiveness depends on motivatingand mobilizing people\u2014getting them to act on conservation beliefs. Such beliefs are not now deeply enough anchored nor widespread enough to make the difference we need to makein policy. A second objection is that it is ridiculous to assume that we can engineer fundamental beliefs. People do not easilychange their world views once they have been internalized in the socialization and enculturation process (Erikson 1968;174 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Johns Our Real Challenge: Managing Ourselves Instead of Nature Wallace 1969). Even effecting intergenerational change is difficult and takes enormous resources. Not even companieswith billions to spend on public relations would try to start a new religion or equivalent\u2014although in the space of a century consumerism may well have come to rese mble one. Companies, in selling products or particular brands of prod ucts, do appeal to important human needs for belong- ing, emotional security, and status, but normally not theneed for certainty of order that the sacred provides. It might be argued that consumerism strengthens various higher order beliefs that have helped to make it possible\u2014human-istic or Christian notions of progress for instance. At the same time that material well-being undercuts religious fervor, it also has proved unsatisfying\u2014it doesn't fulfill theneeds it promises to. Sports team loyalty is a special case, because it can generate a sense of participatory community and even involves ritual. But it typically is made to carry agreater load than it can deliver in terms of meeting human needs, and ultimately feels more compensatory-like con- sumption\u2014than genuine. In other words, both sports andconsumption can be drugs used to create a state of well-being not anchored in actual conditions (Lasch 1978). I acknowledge the difficulties and do not think we have to change people's most fundamental or sacred beliefs. Rapapport (1999), in his analysis of the structure of mythic systems, identifies a hierarchy of beliefs and stories. At thepinnacle are beliefs that are sacred in and of themselves, in other words, the unquestioned. They are anchored in ritual and the deepest layers of socialization. Invariably, he foundthem to be about immaterial things\u2014literally. They were about the nature of God, the afterlife, trinities, the goodness of knowledge, or the evil of the loss of innocence throughknowing. Their primary function is to provide a foundationof certainty\u2014the unquestioned and the unfalsifiable\u2014that is used to sacralize lower order beliefs: general principles about how the cosmos, nature, and society work; specificrules for everyday behavior in particular situations and circumstances and problemsolving; and, rules for recogniz- ing certain states of the world as significant and requiringaction. Part of what makes the sacred sacred is that it is viewed as unchanging. But lower order beliefs are suscep- tible to change, the more so as one moves down the hierarchyof general to specific. Change occurs continuously, increas- ingly in our era by design. It is worth noting here that the hallmark of what we call fundamentalism is the belief thatlower order statements are in and of themselves sacred and not subject to change. Thus, some belief systems that regard divine creation as true can accommodate evolution becauseit is about the \"method\" of creation and thus a lower order belief susceptible to change; fundamentalists cannot. It is not their literalism that is the problem\u2014they too cannotavoid metaphor\u2014but their estimation that lower order be- liefs are in and of themselves sacred and unchanging. So, we do not need to change fundamental assumptions, the most sacred of stories. We need only change lower order stories and beliefs, and they are by their nature susceptible to change. To be successful in promulgating stories abouthow to behave better toward nature, we must make our stories compatible with the most sacred beliefs of particular groups. Sometimes even a word can make a difference,linking what we say to the maps and meanings people already possess. A few years ago, Michael Soul\u00e9 got tired ofexplaining to audiences what biodiversity is. He started using the word \"creation\" or the term \"living creation.\" Every- one, Christian and atheist, knew exactly what he meant. Let me give two examples in which deeply rooted beliefs about the material world, sacralized by a variety of sacredassumptions, guided social movements in successfully con- straining the behavior of dominant groups in the United States. Throughout the last two-thirds of the 19 th century, atti- tudes of economic laissez-faire were dominant in the United States and justified the ruthless exploitation of people andnature. Laissez-faire did not really exist, of course\u2014the state intervened constantly in the economy on the side of capital. But the doctrine was used to justify to the public thelack of state intervention in response to demands for decent treatment of workers and others. Organized resistance that eventually brought about reform had many roots\u2014populist,abolitionist, working class, middle class, and even upper class to a point. By the 1890s, demands for increased social and economic justice were making some headway, althoughit would be another 40 years before many goals were real- ized. This resistance and reform movement rejected laissez- faire as doctrine, called for regulation based on a differentstandard of justice, and changed policy significantly (Kolko 1967; Polyani 1944; Wolfe 1977). It was guided by nonelite cultural norms embedded in stories about justice. The powerof these stories lay not just in the fact that they resonated with the experience of the exploited by calling their exploi- tation evil, or identified an alternative state of society wheresuch exploitation was at least ameliorated, but also that they provided a guide to action (Sinclair 1915). Their power rested in the notion that these stories were right, in otherwords, they were situated within the context of larger storiesand values that were not questioned. More recently, in the United States there have been efforts to weaken the Endangered Species Act (ESA), one of thestrongest pieces of conservation legislation in the world. The Republican Party leadership in the House of Representa- tives was brought to power without the help of organizedconservationists and didn't need us to keep power. Indeed, they pandered to anticonservation interests. So our opposi- tion was not important to them\u2014they didn't have to listen tous. What helped to derail efforts to weaken the ESA was the Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN), a group of thousands of churches with more than a million members(Barcott 2001). Arguing that the natural world was God's handiwork and that it was therefore gross human arrogance to think that people could improve it by causing extinctions,paving it over, and so forth, the network undercut the sacred mantel that developers and despoilers often hide under. The beliefs of people leading this network in no way divergedfrom their basic core beliefs, although it clearly represented a change in the secondary and lower order beliefs, or a change in emphasis. (There clearly are elements in theChristian tradition that have been nature friendly, but they have never predominated.) Because these churches were part of the conservative coalition Republicans depended on,they could not ignore the EEN. The same Christian groups, normally aligned with Repub- licans on many social issues, helped to defeat legislation thatwould have permitted drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 175Johns Our Real Challenge: Managing Ourselves Instead of Nature Let me give one more example that does not demonstrate any effects I can prove, but does offer an example of how astory can get into the stream. Death is a profound event in the lives of humans. So much of our storymaking and telling is about trying to make some sense of death, trying to cometo terms with the loss of loved ones, and with our own. A few years ago Terry Tempest Williams (1991) wrote a book about the death of her mother from cancer, called Refuge . The story of her mother's death, her family, her own story of coming to terms with the dying and the death, did what the most powerful stories do: link the particular with the universal,and allow us to find a place in it. Hundreds of thousands read her book because of this, not because of their feelings or Williams's feeling about conservation. But in this book aboutdeath Williams also talks about life, the life of the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, threatened by rising waters. This refuge was not just a refuge for nature, but for her as well.The very place she sought solace and nurture in the face of her mother's death was itself being threatened. The inter- weaving of these stories of maternal death and nature toldnature's story to people who would have not otherwise sought it out and heard it. It allowed people to connect through something they were familiar with\u2014loss of a lovedone\u2014with the natural world, something they may not have been so well connected with, and taught them to see its value, to care. Conservationists were directly responsible for successful strategies to protect parrots in several Caribbean countries (Butler 1992). By making parrots a symbol of nationhoodand thereby linking protection of parrots to national pride, conservationists were able to achieve a significant decrease in poaching and generate positive behavior to protect parrothabitat. This is what we need to be much better at. We need to create, refashion, generate, and promulgate stories that will resonate with people to the point of becom- ing internalized. The likelihood of internalization will de-pend on several things. Our stories must: Be compatible with the varieties of existing sacred (highest order) beliefs, secular and religious. Work better than existing lower order stories; thanks toscience and people's experience it's becoming clear tomost that there's something seriously wrong with our relationship with nature; many current stories don't adequately explain why nor do they offer solutions. Speak to important emotional needs\u2014aspects of our life cycle including transitions, the problem of alienation, connection and identity; we need to be able to findourselves in them. Be emotionally honest; in speaking to our emotionalneeds they must arise from the genuine (Soul\u00e9 1988). Be good stories\u2014compelling, enticing, well-crafted. We desperately need powerful stories that will help de- velop broad-based support and action for conservation poli- cies. We also need stories that will motivate people in their individual lives to make decisions that will make conserva-tion possible. Policies that create protected areas will ulti- mately fail if we don't reduce consumption and population. We need stories that will lead us to: Limit our numbers. Limit our consumption.Leave much of the world off limits to human exploita- tion even though we want products nature can beconverted into. Practice humility. Recognize the intrinsic value of nature. We cannot confine our stories to the written and spoken word, although they remain in many ways foundational tothe development of all story and even ritual. But they are not enough in the world of mass, electronic, semiliterate culture. Two of the most critical media for us\u2014for anyone seeking tochange stories\u2014are film and music. Film is a medium that is broadly shared and can form the basis for genuine and broad social interaction. A film can beseen by tens, even hundreds of millions of people in a relatively short time. Film, when it works as it should, is the perfect mythmaking form. It compresses into 120 minutesstories that can meld the now with the eternal, the architec- tonic with the particular, the familiar with the unfamiliar. Films do this with all of their attributes\u2014script, acting,music\u2014but above all by color, costume, camera, composi- tion, and editing. We are primates, and vision is primarily how we know the world, literally and metaphorically. Toknow something with any sense, we almost always say, \"I see.\" The technique of film easily takes us in\u2014we gladly suspend our sense of reality to enter into a well-crafted story.We even give ourselves to poorly told and barely told stories. Film is nonetheless profoundly influential (Charney and Schwartz 1995; Kawin 1992; Nichols 1981; Rosenbaum1997). Music is another mass medium that has far surpassed writing in its ability to reach hundreds of millions of peoplein a relatively short time. Music ranges from 3-minutepopular songs to multihour operas, but storytelling is usu- ally an important element. But there is more. Music, espe- cially if danced to but even if not, comes closest to generatinga ritual-like experience. Ritual often includes singing and dance and these aspects anchor myth somatically, by virtue of the physiological states they induce through rhythm andrepetition (d'Aquila and Laughlin 1975, 1979; Lex 1969). Repetition is also im- portant in that the same piece of music can be performed orheard on different occasions, reinforcing the message and the social bond that strengthens the constraining aspects of message and belief. Ritual also anchors itself through par-ticipation: participation in ritual is physical acceptance to be bound by the order it embodies (Rappaport 1999). Live music performances or dances, with or without live music, sharesome elements of this aspect of ritual as well (McNeill 1995). Because of their intrinsic appeal, both film and music have enormous influence. People experience them as entertain-ment, not education. They are able, therefore, to engage in new or different ways of seeing things without the defensive- ness that is often engendered when people feel others aretrying to educate or persuade them. This is a fact we ignore at our peril. Both film and song have short lives with some few excep- tions. The market and narcissism have formed a happy marriage in which the value of the new as new is mutually reinforcing. Each year thousands of new songs and hun-dreds of new films are released. To be effective, we need to tell our story in many songs and films.176 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Johns Our Real Challenge: Managing Ourselves Instead of Nature Our stories cannot be fashioned mechanically. There re- ally is art involved. They must emerge organically. But wehave master storytellers. Indeed, the most widely read scientists in the world are among the best storytellers. Admittedly, there are fewer songwriters and filmmakerswho pursue a conservation agenda than writers or scholars or activists. We must address that weakness. But above all, we must make a conscious effort to craft stories that fit withthe highest order beliefs of key constituencies. References_____________________ Adams, Robert McCormick. 1966.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Resear ch Station.Abstract \u2014The preservation of wilderness and the wise manage- ment of resources are two aspects of conservation ethics spawned atthe turn of the nineteenth century. They grew out of the devastation reaped by economic expansion set in place in the United States during the early to mid-nineteenth century, as public concern overthe destruction of habitats and natural resources became more apparent. This dynamic continues today and not only demands a new look at the value of wilderness but also at the consequences ofcareless use and misuse of public and private property, of the dire consequences of unfettered growth, and of the overexploitation of finite nonrenewable resources upon which life on Planet Earthdepends. After a brief historical review of conservation in the United States, we suggest ways to alter the self-destructive course followed for three centuries. Value__________________________ What a m\u00e9lange of being and meaning the word \"value\" conjures when we consider wilderness: the spiritual and biological worth of wilderness; the moral principles that guide its protection; the tone and quality of its sounds andcolors; the priceless living systems; the beauty of it all. Ourintent here is not to redefine those values elaborated so brilliantly by philosophers, scientists, and social scientists over the past century. Instead, we hope to emphasize thatstanding in opposition to the value of wilderness are values of an ever-expanding global economy in which wilderness is deemed important because of its potential extractable re-sources and devalued to the degree that it prevents the use of these resources for human utilization. It is our view that the present course of the global economic system is not only opposed to conservation ideals but is contrary to the way the world was formed, an evolving world with internal limits that sustain rather than destroy the lifeupon which other life depends. To better understand the dire circumstances of wilderness today, we look first at the historical roots of conservation in the United States, particu-larly in the nineteenth century. It was then that the dynamicValue of Wilderness Revisited Lisi Krall John Organ Florence R. Shepard of economic expansion created the stem that would yield the two branches of conservation we recognize today:preservation and resource management. Secondly, we propose that our self-destructive course can be changed by making the eco-logical health of the planet the first order of business at all levels of society, and we offer suggestions for achieving this goal. Building a Land Ethic ____________ When settlers, such as Captain Arthur Barlow, first ar- rived by ship in the United States (1584), they felt they were approaching \"some delicate garden abounding with odorif-erous flowers\" (Huth 1957: 1). At that time, there were hundreds of nations of indigenous people living in this \"garden\" in very diverse habitats. Whether they were perfectecologists is debatable. What is undeniable is that American Indians, living in low density, were intimately related to the land. Their use of resources was ritually linked to theirspirituality and carried important ecological knowledge and respect for wild nature. In contrast, European settlers who first took up residence in America, often in separatist enclaves according to reli-gious dogma, were joined by one common belief; they did not value wilderness. In fact, they saw it as a threat to their spirituality\u2014evil, hostile, and unforgiving. They consideredboth \"savages\" and wilderness uncouth. Michael Wigglesworth described it as (in Huth 1957): A waste and howling wilderness/Where none inhabited/ But hellish fiends, and brutish men/the Devils worshiped. As colonization proceeded in the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries, orientation to the land varied between two extremes: (1) the pious, industrious, practical, and stern\u2014 an ethic that discouraged the pleasures of life; and (2) thewealthy, who enjoyed leisurely and lavish lives. Meanwhile, on the ecotones of civilization were those who chose simple subsistence and independence away from the pressures oforganized society. As the fertility of the land became rapidly depleted from north to south, the frontier boundaries pushed westward carrying along these diverse settlers with immi-grants drawn in by free land from all corners of the Earth. The rudiments of nature appreciation and conservation were barely visible in these fledgling years of our nation,although a nature aesthetic was slowly creeping into lan- guage. But, for settlers, the worth of the land lay not in its beauty but in unrelenting clearing and cultivation (Huth1957: 5): Then with the Ax, with Might and Strength/The trees so thick and strong.../We laid them all along.../Which we withFire, most furiously/To ashes did confound.180 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Krall, Organ, and Shepard Value of Wilderness Revisited Nature appreciation finally blossomed as the alarming contrast between pristine nature and the slash-and-burnlandscape became apparent. Natural history\u2014especially botany as a hobby of the elite\u2014flourished in the colonies, as well as in Europe. The influence of the \"Lake Poets\" ofEngland, with descriptions of the peace found in nature and the development of a theory of aesthetics that classified landscape into the sublime and picturesque, furthered na-ture appreciation (Shepard 1954: 25). During early colonialism, Imperial England dominated the seas and the fur trade as far west as the MississippiRiver. But the great western expanse beyond Ohio seemed uninhabitable and nonagricultural, and was not seriously considered for fulfilling the agrarian dream of free land.Benjamin Franklin, one of the few who not only saw the potential in the land but also understood exponential growth, predicted in 1761 that the birth rate, under theinfluence of an ab undant supply of vacant land, would double every 20 years (Smith 1970). The key figures in the creation of the Articles of Confed- eration and the Constitution were propertied gentry, who met secretly \"making history but not knowing the kind of history they were making\" (Ellis 2001). Although they de-fined the rights of people everywhere, they also set in place forces of economic expansion that conflicted with the legiti- macy of wilderness. The events that followed were explosiveand unpredictable. When elected to the presidency in 1801, Jefferson was determined to both find a waterway to the Pacific Ocean toestablish commercial markets with the Orient and to assess and exploit fur and other resources in the West. With permission from Spain, he commissioned the Lewis andClark expedition (1803-1806) to gather geographical infor-mation. A second covert goal was to usurp British sover- eignty over the trans-Mississippi West (Smith 1970). The Lewis and Clark expedition, although unsuccessful in find-ing a commercial waterway, opened up possibilities for west- ward movement. As potential for development in western lands became more apparent, and as United States bound-aries were extended with the Louis iana Purchase, a route for transport of materials and people became imperative. In 1820, William Ashley and Jedediah Smith pioneered an overland route\u2014through the Rockies, along the Platte River, and over South Pass\u2014that became the Oregon Trail. By the 1840s, the fur trade was waning but travelers passing alongthe Oregon Trail gave little consideration to farming the Great Prairies. The soil was deep and rich, but trees\u2014needed for fuel, fencing, and building\u2014were scarce. In search of the commerce of souls, gold, and materials, they were headed for the Pacific where settlements and missions had been estab- lished during the fur trade, primarily by Spanish missionar-ies and expansionists (Shepard 1954). George Catlin, a young Philadelphia lawyer who went West to paint portraits of American Indians in 1832, quicklyacquired a passionate respect for his subjects and the \"pris- tine beauty and wildness\" in which they lived. Articulating a prophetic understanding of the value of wilderness andindigenous cultures, he said (Shepard 1954: 155-56): Many...wilds in Nature's works...are destined to fall be- fore the deadly axe and desolating hands of cultivating man;amongst here ranks of living , of beast and human; we often find noble stamps...worthy of our preservation and protection.In a reverie he looked into the towns and cities of the East where he \"beheld buffalo robes hanging...for traffic...andthe curling smokes of a thousand stills,\" and he asked, \"O, insatiable man...Wouldst thou tear the skin from the back of the last animal of this noble race, and rob thy fellow man ofhis meat, and for it give him poison!\" He proposed \"a nation's Park, containing man and beast, in all the wildness and freshness of their nature's beauty.\" Contemporaries of Catlin, such as the Hudson River Painters, and American writers such as William Cullen Bryant, James Fennimore Cooper, and John GreenleafWhittier, who themselves were influenced by the Lake Poets of England, developed in their nature writing the rudiments of a preservationist ethic. Along with Catlin, artists such asThomas Moran, Thomas Cole, and Albert Bierstadt brought romantic landscape paintings to the easterners and Europe- ans who would never see the West. In spite of the logistical problems of wilderness and inter- mittent warfare for sovereignty between our fledgling na- tion, American Indians, and countries with holdings\u2014andlater our own Civil War\u2014the western movement continued full force. The tremendous breadth of unoccupied westward expanses, like some huge vacuum, sucked people into itsvast reaches from far and near in search of free land and a share of the takings. Early nineteenth-century America, honed in an era of rural people living in low density on a landscape with unlimited frontier, experienced an \"unprecedented era of economic and demographic growth\" (Oelschlaeger 1991: 97).From 1820 to 1860 (a period of unrestrained urbanization of America) the proportion of Americans living in cities grew from 5 percent in 1820 to 20 percent in 1860\u2014a four-fold increase. Westward movement increased in crescendo, leav-ing deep ruts in the Oregon Trail and a swath of denuded land 10 miles wide. Much deeper than the ruts was the disruption of American Ind ian cultures and ecological relationships on the prairies and in the mountain lands of the West As the West became progressively more accessible, and settlements in the East became less desirable, nature appre-ciation and beautification projects in cities grew to counter pollution and slums. Tourism became popular as those of means fled to the countryside for relief. The New YorkSportsmen's Association, like other hunters who noticed a decrease in wildlife, mobilized to halt exploitation and de- struction of wildlife for profit. And in the 1840s, the SupremeCourt passed a landmark decision that would become known as the Public Trust Doctrine, stating that all wild animals are the property of the people to be held in trust by thegovernment. This doctrine, reinforcing the utilitarian ben- efit of wildlife to which all people should have access, paved the way for State and Federal agencies established in thelate nineteenth and twentieth centuries to uphold this public trust. President Lincoln signed the Homestead Act in 1862 that held that freeborn Americans had a right to a piece of land to live on. Although it brought thousands of people to the West to claim their 160 acres, in the end, agricultural developmentwould n ot take the form of the agrarian dream embodied in the Homestead Act. Concentration and centralization of land and capital and the imperative toward mechanizationwould result in agribusiness. Agriculture would go the way of manufacturing.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 181Krall, Organ, and Shepard Value of Wilderness Revisited In 1862, in the midst of this upheaval, Henry David Thoreau, advocate of wildness, died of tuberculosis at the age of 45. A prolific writer\u2014his journals alone contain 2 million words\u2014 his ken was natural philosophy, a deep knowledge of the natural world as it related to human existence and spirit.He brought the human condition down to earth rather than reifying it. He foresaw the impact of civilization on nature, and warned that the preservation of the world rested inwildness. During his short lifetime, the population of America had grown from 7 to 31 million (Botkin 2001). In 1864, Lincoln signed a bill that placed the Yosemite Valley in the care of California. This action represented a decisive step toward the preservation that Thoreau had proposed. The purpose of the \"park,\" in the words of FrederickLaw Olmsted, a leading advocate of the bill, was \"as a playground for the nation...to be managed for the free use of the people\" (Huth 1957: 149-50). By this time, the pace ofeconomic expansion gave rise to a preservation reaction. Because of the precedent set by Lincoln, subsequent presi- dents would follow his example by signing bills and invokingexecutive power to set aside forest reserves, parks, and refuges for public use. Thus, presidents have contributed significantly to the cause of preservation when feet-drag-ging congresses influenced by commercial interests have blocked such legislation. By the second half of the nineteenth century, as Catlin had forewarned, the prairie was littered with the bones of near extinct bison that had numbered in the millions. Sport hunting was not a major cause of their decline. The decima-tion occurred primarily for political and economic motiva- tions. First, the demise of the bison would help solve the \"Indian Problem,\" the acculturation of the Plains Indians bydestroying their food source and making farmers of them.Secondly, it was a laissez-faire market reaction to the de- mand for bison hides for robes, their tongues as delicacies, and later, their bones for fertilizer. George Perkins Marsh, a man of tremendous intellect and breadth of experience, in his book Man and Nature , set out the potential for ecological destruction (in Oelschlaeger1991). He pointed out that the consequences of unmitigated growth\u2014the squandering of renewable resources, bad for- estry practices that compromised the health of watersheds,and species extinction\u2014would eventually curtail economic progress. Indispensable to market expansion was the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1868. With the application of steam power, it provided an effective means of a two-way exchange of resources, goods, and people. Not only lumber,but also prefabricated houses could be shipped to North Dakota or Nebraska or the Central Valley of California from industrial regions that secured the timber from somewhereelse. And as cities became more uninhabitable and fertile lands scarce in the East, western lands offered possibilities for grazing, dry-land farming, and farming with irrigation.During the decade after the Civil War, unprecedented growth spread like a cancer horizontally along railroad lines through- out the West, spawning unimaginative towns along its course(Jackson 1972). The second half of the nineteenth century was one of the most critical ecological times in the history of America. Untilthe 1860s, very little government attention was paid to resource depletion and species decline or extinction al-though hunters, bird watchers, and mountaineering groups were expressing concern (Botkin 2001). By the end of thecentury, not only bison but also bowhead whales and salmon on the east coast and sea otter and elephant seals on the west coast had dangerously declined. From this time to just beforeWorld War I, pub lic and political concern fomented environ- mental consciousness. At the same time, environmental orga- nizations like the Audubon Society and the Isaac WaltonLeague were chastised and challen ged by radical environ- mentalists such as Roslie Edge. Awareness of critical ecologi- cal problems spawned a full-fledged conservation movement. John Muir, an important actor at this time in conservation history, arrived in California when this movement was gestating (Fox 1985). Although he hated politics, he eventu-ally determined to do something about \"the gobble, gobble school of economics\" (Jackson 1972: 86). With national visibility from essays that emphasized the spiritual natureof wilderness published in eastern journals, he became a leading preservationist. At the turn of the century, he was a consultant to conservation-minded people such as GiffordPinchot, Theodore Roosevelt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George Bird Grinnell. He went nationwide with a struggle to stop the massive commercial exploitation of forest reservesand the transformation of the Yosemite Valley into an entertainment park. The ideals of the frontier spirit, personified in Theodore Roosevelt, were translated into national policies to protect wildlife and forests. Conservation became institutionalized as a household word, but under the direction of Pinchot,Roosevelt's chief forester, its connotation clearly became one of \"conservative use,\" the safeguarding and controlling ex- traction of resources for use by human society. The two sides of the conservation ethic were clearly demarcated in preservationist Muir and resource manager Pinchot, who parted company over their disagreements about the building of the Hetch Hetchy Dam. Although itsbuilding was approved by Congress in 1913, it solidified a block of environmental organizations that had emerged in the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Duringthis time, they cut their teeth on ethics, business manage- ment, and lobbying interests that helped make environmen- tal organizations the critical force they are today. In the 1930s, the New Deal Reformation combined social and conservation programs designed by President Franklin Roosevelt with the ecological insight of the Interior Secre-tary, Harold Ickes. The combined effects of a depression, drought, and depletion of land, which came home to rest graphically in a dust bowl, necessitated the revamping ofgovernment that became active as never before in the man- agement of national lands. Political parties changed sides and became polarized, one favoring social intervention, andthe other big business protection. Although citizen partici- pation was included in advisory boards, these boards were primarily constituted, as they are today, to support thestatus quo and to commercialize rather than protect public lands. After World War II, the government proceeded with its soil conservation and wildlife management programs. In his book, A Sand County Almanac, Aldo Leopold (1949) pro- fessed a new land ethic that would combine managementand preservation. He had a foot in both fields; a creator of the profession of wildlife management, he was also a founder182 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Krall, Organ, and Shepard Value of Wilderness Revisited and vice president of the Wilderness Society. The protection of wilderness demands, as Leopold stated, an understandingof the cultural value of wild things. It demands, as Frederick Jackson Turner stated in 1893, a realization that our Ameri- can democracy arose not out of transplanted English institu-tions, but out of a mobile people's constant, vitalizing contact with the great wilderness. Beginning with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962, that identified the destruction of wild species caused by the unmitigated use of DDT, reform environmentalism was reborn. Unprecedented legislation, including the Wilder-ness Bill and the Endangered Species Act that protected animals and habitats in their own right, was passed. Today, we benefit from the strong and thoughtful critiques and reformation plans conceived in those days and refined today by men and women working in such fields as conser- vation biology, deep ecology, environmental justice, andsteady-state economics. However, as time has progressed, necessity has directed much effort away from the source of the environmental problems and into mitigating their illeffects. This cursory review of the history of conservation in the United States shows us that resource management and preservation were conceived in the same crucible of conser-vation that arose from the exploitation of the rich continent we colonized. Sustainability of Nature __________ Wilderness today stands as the icon of generative life in the continual process of evolutionary refinement. But no matter how much faith we have in this natural model, we cannot save and sustain wilderness or restore the health ofthe human-altered habitats at the rate we are now exploit-ing both. To survive spiritually and materially, we must acknowledge our dependence on the natural world. The frontier is indeed lost to history. There is no more free land.We have exceeded the limits. Our goal must be reduction, not growth. We cannot turn the tide of ecological destruction and social disintegration without complete dedication and effort at all societal levels, from individuals to global economies. Such sea change requires a mindful reorientation to a worldof finite resources. History suggests, and many contempo- rary authors agree, that such transformation is only likely to occur if we are forced to it by disaster\u2014a very dismal prospect (McKibben 1989). We believe there are alternatives. Open discourse is necessary if democratic action is to occur. Essential to such discourse is a self-critical examina-tion of values held. Robert Brulle (2000: 278-282), with his suggestions for internal evaluation by environmental orga- nizations, sets out an excellent model for reassessing priori-ties throughout society. Brulle suggests that for collective action to be effective, groups and individuals must be bound by \"truth, morality, and authenticity.\" Expanding on thisassertion, we suggest that collective action must be founded on authenticity, truth, and spirituality, and that each of these action bases must be infused with a deep moralitydirected at the \"common good\" as defined by environmental theologian John Cobb (1966), one that serves society while maintaining the ecological health of the planet.When communities are founded authentically, the mem- bers work in a democratic rather than an oligarchic mode, atthe grassroots level from the ground up, not from the top down. They remain representative and unconstrained. From local to national, all groups are active politically, with anabiding interest in electing intelligent and ecologically in- formed public representatives. Truth, as much as we can discern it by drawing from \"special management, scientific,and legal capacities\" (Brulle 2000: 278), provides the basis for ethically grounded action. The present conservation biology movement is a good model in this respect, where themost recent scientific knowledge is combined with a deep valuing of the Earth. Pure science, solely as empiricism, however, is suspect if not connected to moral application.Beginning with the atomic bomb and proceeding into the horrors of our day, we must understand the misrepresenta- tion of objective, value-free science, which is only one pieceof the puzzle that is truth. The spiritual basis for ecological action, bound closely to ethics rather than religious institutions, must not be deval-ued because it cannot be proven empirically. Spirituality, infused with aesthetics and caring, provides the basis for action rising out of group consciousness and concern forPlanet Earth and all her creatures. We do need animistic, theological, or aesthetic theories in order to sense the emi- nent creative force in a pristine habitat that indigenouspeople referred to as The Great Mystery. Whether chaos theorist or ordinary wayfarer, we feel the overall harmony of a dynamic system always in the process of righting itself. Wemust trust our hearts. Aesthetics or beauty is not enough if unconditioned by moral considerations. Consider, for ex- ample, the awesome symmetry in that mushroom cloud andthe beautiful colors in striations of a strip mine or on the oilysurfaces of polluted, toxic ponds. Beauty and spirituality cannot be context free; they are grounded, like activism, in the roots of communities, biological and societal. Beyond agencies and organizations, we, in our daily lives, can make profound statements by living ecologically\u2014cur- tailing our procreation, reducing consumption, cherishingnature, preserving its supreme manifestations in wilder- ness, and resurrecting our spiritual attachment to Mother Earth, as understood by our Pleistocene ancestors (Shepard1998). Together we can erase consumer confidence as an indication of the health of a nation and replace it with ecosystem health as an indicator of the state of the planet.The reduction of population is a foremost global concern, we all agree. But we must also increasingly cherish the children we have and guide them in an ethic that cherishes wild oversynthesized and domesticated nature. It is useless simply to lecture to the poor about simplifying lives and limiting children. Their lives are already simpleand their children are their only assets. We must, instead, be dedicated to social and environmental justice; the rights of humans to healthy work and home environments and toequitable treatment and benefits\u2014to helping all peoples achieve a level of economic stability wherein they can make viable choices. Rather than the poor, it is we who are mostinvolved in this global consumption frenzy and who can in our lifestyle alter the course of society. And we must demand that the perpetrators of power and growth follow suit andhelp us. At base, we must not forget that most problems of environmental and social justice are an outgrowth of depletedUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 183Krall, Organ, and Shepard Value of Wilderness Revisited and mismanaged natural systems, a problem that we must own up to and transform. It should be clear to us that growth is not sustainable. No growth or diminished growth must be the goal. Nonrenew- able resources are exactly that; they end as dispersed energyand rubbish. Prudence dictates that we develop renewable energy sources, such as nonpolluting solar and wind power, to replace nonrenewable resources at the rate they aredepleted. Conservation practices\u2014small-scale improved tech- nologies, intensive but small-scale organic farming, pollu- tion control, recycling and making do, and refurbishingrather than tearing down and building anew\u2014are necessary priorities. Such practices renew appreciation for biodiver- sity and wilderness for which there are no substitutes. Restoration will undoubtedly be the watchword of the coming century, as the role of resource managers in main- taining the health of wild and domesticated lands increases.Although management of all natural systems, including wild lands, is necessary, we believe it is often overapplied. The prevention of further degradation of ecosystems\u2014espe-cially remnants that now remain relatively pristine\u2014is the first priority in considering resource extraction, control of pollution of air, water, and soil, and the restoration ofdepleted lands. We should understand by now there are no tradeoffs. Depletion of a habitat that developed over millions of years can never be adequately mitigated or restored. Andeven with the best science, we cannot foresee the conse- quences of our actions. Restoration is often needed to correct the effects of past mismanagement. Unfortunately, we stillcarry a belief in the superiority of \"Lord Man,\" John Muir's name for our species. Our confidence in our infinite power and wisdom goes against us when, in many cases, the bestalternative is simply to stop what we're doing. At the national level, using the great conservationists as an example, we can become radical, insisting that our state and national governments stop their imperialistic, materi-alistic expansion. Competence and intelligence, ecological enlightenment, morality, and courage are qualities we must look for in leaders and develop in ourselves as citizens. Someeconomists believe that applying no-growth policies in the long term will create a more stable, equitable, and just society, but we face formidable opposition in achieving nogrowth, both in ourselves and in the multinational world. In our personal goals, work, and businesses we can set limits to our own expansionary tendencies\u2014limits to howmuch we accumulate in our lifetimes and how much is enough to insure a moderate standard of living that will sustain us to our end without dependence on others. And weshould never exceed those limits. When assets grow beyond what is needed to live rightly, returning the surplus to the public trust or to worthwhile nonprofit organizations orcharities makes good sense. The same rules apply with small and large businesses. In the world of profit, competition creates large corporationslike giant octopuses with their tentacles reaching into every sector of the world economy. A no-growth policy would encourage corporations to use assets to improve the lot ofworkers and redistribute wealth among them. Government intervention is necessary to set upper limits to both personal and corporate wealth and increase minimum wages to en-sure this redistribution. Taxes, when properly applied, can expedite this effort, just as they can in limiting population.The same limits to growth must apply to governments and their agencies, and active citizen groups must constantly bethe watchdogs of governing bodies to keep them honest and representative. In a painfully real sense, we are no different from the pioneers who saw no limits to what the land could provide. The major difference is that today we have no intimate relationship to the land, and as a result we care less. Butthose of us who value complex and diverse relationships on Earth can strengthen our case by showing the worth of simplified, nonmaterialistic lives and the love of wild nature. Conclusions____________________ After the explosion of the first atomic bomb, the picture of the mushroom cloud rising, expanding, dispersing, carrying its load around the Earth, slowly sifting down deadly radia-tion, jolted us to a new level of reality. The power in the bomb was tremendous, but so were its lethal effects that could come home to rest on us. It was sobering for us to learn thatthe limitless power of the atom, unleashed, diminished our own freedom. On September 11, we were handed another image, of two technological forces colliding, an airplane like many others that command the skies and a highrise, a monument to commerce so sturdy it was expected to last thousands ofyears. When these two icons of power and profit met head on, they imploded, starting a process that sent them tumbling down, carrying with t hem thousands of martyrs who in their human way had simply gone to work that day. All the magnificence of that crea tion, technological as well as hu- man, lie intermingled in a decaying mass of rubble that camedown on itself. We should ask ourselves not how we shouldseek revenge but why we are so hated. We should think twice about retaliation that destroys people and ecosystems that can never be replaced by so-called \"aid.\" This icon of disaster is not unrelated to our wilderness problem or to the problem that two centuries ago threatened the bison. The two are directly related. We are capable oftaming, despoiling, and populating every inch of wild Earth. But unless we forestall the insidious, malignant growth mania that infects us, we will leave future generations atotally domesticated Earth, socially and biologically patho- logical, as well as absolutely boring. If wilderness is com- pletely tamed, the creative spirit will also die. As Thoreauforetold in 1854, \"We can never get enough of nature.\" We need wild places \"where we can witness our limits trans- gressed\" (Thoreau 1906).

Ecotourism is fast becoming \"egotourism,\" and the benefits are not flowing back to the host communities, especiallycommunities in rural areas where poverty alleviation is essential for the protection of the environment. Tourism in wilderness set- tings can make a valuable contribution by restoring an appreciationfor an authentic nature-based tourism experience. This will require repositioning ecotourism and adventure travel in the marketplace by introducing elements of exclusivity, perhaps at a premium price,so that the true value of the outdoor tourism experience will be measured by learning from nature rather than by boasting of luxury lodges in exotic locations filled with noisy, adrenalin- pumping activities Ecotourism: Curse or Blessing? ___________________ There are many different definitions of ecotourism, but most agree that it involves tourism into areas of greatnatural beauty or interest, with minimum impact on the environment and maximum benefit to local communities. The Ecotourism Society (1992) defined ecotourism as: ...purposeful travel to natural areas to understand the cul- tural and natural history of the environment, taking care not to alter the integrity of the ecosystem, whilst producing economic opportunities that make conservation of naturalresources financially beneficial to local citizens. Many commentators have criticized the use of the term ecotourism because it has been applied widely to cover all manner of tourism experiences with a vaguely \"green\" tinge,particularly nature-based tourism. The term ecotourism has many meanings. It can refer to a genuine attempt at environ- mentally sustainable tourism, or it can be used in a cynicalway to try to attract greater numbers of visitors to an area. For example, the term ecotourism does not differentiate between: 1. A large group of people visiting a private game reserve, arriving at their destination by aircraft, staying in luxury accommodations, expecting to be pampered with all theContribution of Wilderness to Survival of the Adventure Travel and Ecotourism Markets Peter B. Myles modern conveniences, and spending very little money at the destination because everything is prepaid before departure; and 2. A low impact ecotraveler, backpacking or camping to save money on accommodations, but spending money spon- taneously wherever they travel, pursuing a minimal impactexperience in a wilderness environment. These hypothetical examples illustrate that ecotourism can refer to a wide range of activities that might have different environmental impacts and attract people with different sets of values and motivations. Special interest andactivity holidays represent the single largest growth area within the tourism industry. Special interest travel is travel for people who are going somewhere because they have a particular interest that can be pursued in a particular region or destination. What sets special interest tourism apart from other forms of tourism isthat the whole point of the trip is to exercise the mind and/ or body in some fashion. It is interesting to note that in the year 2000, the year of millennium activity, global travelexperienced its best growth in a decade, as many tourists selected destinations that they had identified with some body, mind, and spiritual experience. Adventure Tourism ______________ Activity-based tourism is another form of special interest tourism. There are so many examples of stress-related behavior in society such as road rage, air rage, family killings, and school rampages. The question that needs to be raised is,\"why would anyone engage in a potentially dangerous activ- ity as a form of recreation?\" The common answer is, \"adrena- line rush.\" While those involved in high-risk activities maywelcome the initial adrenaline rush, such as whitewater rafting, bungee jumping and extreme sports, it is not pos- sible for them to sustain the rush for any length of time,hence, the adrenaline junkies. One cannot help wonder if most adventure tourists are not substituting one kind of stress for another. However, what is of greater concern is that many of these adventure tourism activities disturb the environment, caus- ing noise pollution, visual pollution, and in some cases, evenmud slides and avalanches. These activities are all mar- keted as ecotourism. Nearly 80 percent of the world's population is now urban. Therefore, it is logical that urban dwellers need rural expe- riences for a change in daily routine. There is an old saying that says \"a change is as good as a holiday.\" Humankindgenerally needs spells of solitude, peace, and tranquility, and an escape from heavily industrialized, overcrowded ur- ban environments in order to relax and recover. A wildernessexperience is far more therapeutic and ultimately beneficial186 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Myles Contribution of Wilderness to Survival of the Adventure: Travel and Ecotourism Markets to society than most of the ecotourism and adventure tour- ism activities currently offered. We need to put wildernessback into ecotourism experiences if nature-based tourism isto have a positive impact on society in general. We need toawaken a spirit of wilderness deep within the human psycheto restore sanity to the human race. \"Deep ecotourism\" and \"shallow ecotourism\" are terms that can be used to differentiate between ecotourism thatverges on a form of mass tourism, and genuine attempts atenvironmental tourism. Deep ecotourists should demon-strate in their lifestyles a true sense of values, that is, a philosophy of sustainability wherever they are. Spiritual Leaders________________ All the great spiritual leaders who founded religions needed times of solitude in exclusive areas not only for prayer and meditation but also for stress relief. They werephysically and mentally exhausted from the demands oftheir followers. They had to escape from crowds and get intouch with nature in order to recover. Mohammed went tothe mountain, Jesus had both a wilderness and mountaintopexperience, and Buddha recovered in retreats. Many peopledescribe certain places with almost a spiritual reverencebecause the space, tranquility, and solitude provide a thera-peutic benefit. They feel better after their visit. The karoo isalmost a natural wilderness area and has been described asa place \"where the land meets the sky.\" It is a place where thecrisp clean air invigorates stressed minds and tired bodies in a silent world where it is said \"you can hear God think.\" A Healthy Society _______________ Governments need to expand wilderness areas for the future mental and physical well-being of their citizens. However, keeping wilderness areas exclusive, pristine, andfree from crowds means that they should remain relativelyundeveloped. With limited infrastructure to generate in-come, it is difficult to make wilderness areas viable. Wilder-ness areas therefore need to be subsidized to survive, butthere is a cost benefit. A financial contribution by Govern-ment dedicated for the expansion of wilderness areas willyield a good return on investment. This is mainly because amore balanced, considerate, relaxed, friendlier, and stablesociety will ultimately be a far less destructive force andtherefore cost less in health maintenance, for example, lower medical bills. Sustainable Development ________ The delicate relationship between tourism and the envi- ronment was highlighted by the Manila Declaration of the World Tourism Organization (1997), which stated: The protection, enhancement and improvement of the various components of man's environment are among the fundamental conditions for the harmonious development oftourism. In the mid-1970s, sustainable development became a global buzzword, but since then it has become a concept much discussed, used, and abused.The World Commission on Environment and Develop- ment (1987) first introduced the so-called \"stewardship\" roleof sustainable development, aimed at maintaining resources in perpetuity and stated: Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Colin Hunter (1995) suggested in his Journal of Sustain- able Tourism that over the short and long term, sustainabletourism development should: 1. Meet the needs and wants of the local host community in terms of improved living standards and quality of life. 2. Satisfy the demands of tourists and the tourism industry, and continue to attract them in order to achieve the first aim. 3. Safeguard the environmental resource base for tour- ism, encompassing natural, built, and cultural components, in order to achieve both of the preceding aims. Perhaps the future survival of ecotourism as a unique, nature-based, outdoor experience has something to dowith the implementation of the second point suggested by Hunter, that is, have tour operators gone overboard in their quest to satisfy the demands of tourists and thetourism industry? Has greed transformed ecotourism into \"ego-tourism?\" In many cases, ecotourism and all other forms of responsible tourism are little more than market-ing ploys\u2014mass tourism disguised as responsible tour- ism. There is a need to review ecotourism to address some of its negative perceptions. Ecotourism and Protected Areas: Mutually Beneficial? _____________ Tourism uses landscape, flora, and fauna as important natu- ral attractions, while conservation of the built environ ment also provides tourists with sites of interest. Where conserva- tion interests have been successful in designated zones from which all human activity is excluded, tourism interests areforced to compete with other excluded interests in the zones adjacent to protected areas. Under such circumstances tour- ism is often easily outmaneuvered, or outbid by well-orga-nized interests such as mining or forestry. A rather unusual variation on this theme is where ecotourism acts as the forerunner to alternative develop-ments, as in the case of biotechnology prospecting, to seek out species that might provide genetic material to produce pharmaceuticals or other products. Bio-piracy is the theft ofplant and animal species by unscrupulous biotechnology companies, including the theft of intellectual property, such as local knowledge of herbs and medicinal plants. Most definitions of ecotourism include travel to \"natural areas,\" or refer to \"natural beauty\" and \"natural resources.\" Perhaps this is where ecotourism has deviated from itsoriginal purpose and the term nature-based tourism has become too wide in its interpretation. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) views a natu-ral area as: ...one where biological processes and geological features are still relatively intact and where the primary objective of thearea is to ensure that natural processes remain as the domi- nant force in the system.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 187Myles Contribution of Wilderness to Survival of the Adventure: Travel and Ecotourism Markets Reinventing Ecotourism__________ According to international tourism consultant Dr. Auliana Poon (2001), there is a paradigm shift occurring in the tourism industry the world over. The golden age of mass tourism, of unlimited growth and disregard for the environ-ment, and of standardized, rigidly packaged products and services is over. A new tourism is emerging: sustainable, environmentally and socially responsible, and characterized by flexibility and choice. A new type of tourist is driving it: more educated, experienced, independent, conservation-minded, respectfulof cultures, and insistent on value for money. Information technology is opening up an astonishing array of travel and vacation options for this new tourist. To remain competitive,tourism destinations and industry players alike must adapt. For many, the challenge is to \"reinvent tourism.\" Market intelligence, innovation, and closeness to customers havebecome the new imperatives. Taking a leaf from this book, perhaps we need to \"reinvent ecotourism.\" And this is perhaps what we are trying toachieve in Africa by introducing our own unique brand of \"Afrikatourism,\" that is, ecotourism that is unique to Africa. Afrikatourism: Ecotourism Unique to Africa _______________________ Afrikatourism, drawn from Open Africa's vision (1994), is a restorative, sustainable, and profitable tourism sector,particular to Africa's circumstances and characteristics. Itdefines an entirely new, responsible, and essentially African industry, with comm unity participation and conservation as its cornerstones. Afrikatourism highlights a niche for Africansupremacy in nature-interactive tourism. It can be found and experienced only in Africa. It also integrates perfectly with the political vision for an African Renaissance. Conclusions____________________ Ecotourism is, at its best, perhaps somewhere close to our ideals for responsible tourism. However, the difficulty is that there is nothing to prevent any operator, destina-tion, or other \"player\" in the tourism industry from usingany title they choose. Because there are no clear industry standards, there are no guarantees to the consumer that aparticular tour to a particular protected area complies to any acceptable guidelines for responsible ecotourism. \"Mass ecotourism\" is already emerging, and many will say thatecotourism is not delivering on its promises. Ecotourism is therefore in danger of losing its integrity, and perhaps there will come a time when deep ecotourists will be pre- pared to pay a premium price for the exclusivity of a true wilderness experience. In this regard, it is imperative that large areas are set aside for wilderness. To illustrate this point, the Eastern Cape is the poorest Province in South Africa in terms of the economy, but the richest in terms of biodiversity. Few people are aware thatthe Eastern Cape is the only Province in South Africa, and one of the few places on earth, where all seven biomes can be found as well as 29 Acocks Veld Types. However, 19 of theseveld types are threatened and fall well below the 10 percent of each vegetation type that should be set aside for pristine or near-pristine use proposed at the Rio Convention. Perhaps the answer lies in stimulating a desire amongst ecotourists and ecotourism operators for an authentic natu- ral experience. This may mean that we have to awaken a\"spirit of wilderness\" in the human psyche. References_____________________ Ecotourism Society. 1992. In: Study notes on responsible tourism.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014At this present historical juncture, many would argue that there is an obligation to change our societal attitudes toward the environment, as well as to reassess human values and lifestyleswith respect to ecology. To accomplish this task, societies must promote deep environmental awareness and respect for the Earth's natural systems and wilderness places. This environmental aware-ness effort must reach virtually everyone in the society, especially peoples from more developed countries (MDCs) who have the luxury of engaging in recreation and leisure. It is these recreationists who,while traveling in natural wilderness (or wildernesslike) settings, are most likely to come in close contact with nature, and thus acquire deeper environmental awareness. However, peoples from lesserdeveloped cou ntries (LDCs) must also be educated about the advan- tages of embracing sound forms of ecotourism as a viable means of economic advancement and long-term environmental protection. Broadly defined, environmental education portends the message that: Earth's environment is not an object to be subdued by people, Earth's resources are not free of cost, Earth clearly has carrying capacity limits, and finally, the past paradigm of human domination over the planet is no longer valid, given the inarguable signs (for example, global climate change) that we are beginning to exceedEarth's carrying capacity. Sound ecotourism activities (especially wilderness ecotourism) attempts to educate visitors from MDCs about the ecological andsociocultural impacts of their travels on the lands and peoples in various LDCs they visit, while at the same time educating indig- enous peoples about alternative means of attaining long-termsustenance from their local surroundings through various sustain- able development practices and ecotourism activities. Through a review of various case studies, this paper articulates the importanceof the educational initiatives involved in sound ecotourism as a means of promoting a widespread international environmental ethic among peoples from both MDCs and LDCs. Introduction ____________________ Early human attitudes toward the environment tended toward viewing Earth's resources as useful commodities that were more or less unlimited, or renewable, if not severely overused. Thro ughout history, human attitudes towardWilderness Ecotourism and Education as a Means of Promoting an International Environmental Ethic Laura M. Fredrickson nature and the environment have tended toward utilitarian, that is, useful, rather than decorative or luxurious. From theplanet's fertile soil, which produces the food that we eat, to the global hydrological cycle that ensures and regulates planetary moisture levels, most would agree that the Earth'sresources are essential to life as we know it. Yet few people are truly aware of the danger present in the prevailing utilitarian approach toward the environment. The Earth'sresources are limited and can be exhausted if overused or stretched beyond one's limit of adaptability. This attitude still prevails today among most development profiteers andpolicymakers concerned primarily with jobs and profits; the term \"cornucopian\" has been used to describe those who hold this type of environmental attitude. This sector views natureas a commodity to be developed and sold in the market place\u2014the tourism sector notwithstanding\u2014and the cost of maintaining the goods and services the environment sup-plies is frequently overlooked or viewed as a writeoff on some distant future debt. The other extreme on the continuum of human attitudes toward the environment has been described as \"green funda- mentalism\" (Lowenthal 1990), consisting of radical zealots and nature purists representing a societal reaction or back- lash to the many environmental abuses that resulted fromthe onset of the Industrial Revolution, especially the envi- ronmental assaults that have occurred since the 1960s. It is an attitude that embodies the feeling that any form ofhuman activity harms nature and fears a global integrated economy, assuming a nationalist, antifree market, antima- terialistic, economically self-sufficient, and protectionistattitude. In its most extreme form, green fundamentalism advocates an antidevelopment policy, halting all economic growth or curtailing present levels of economic activity in anattempt to protect the environment. Additionally, those who hold this attitude argue against private ownership of land and against human access to natural ecosystems, suggest-ing that these areas have to be protected from human impact, including nature travel and tourism. Some believe that the impact of tourism\u2014nature tourism notwithstand-ing\u2014should automatically be evaluated as negative, stating that the undesirable environmental externalities of tourism are inherently objectionable (Mieczkowski 1990). This eco-logical argument is supported by criticism of the sociocul- tural and economic problems associated with tourism. However, both of these positions are extremist and unten- able in the real world. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with development. To demonize any economic activity, such as ecotourism or nature tourism and travel, as automatically leading to decreasing environmental quality is shortsighted. Depending on the scale at which the development occurs and the degree to which local participation in the project occurs,USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 189Fredrickson Wilderness Ecotourism and Education as a Means of Promoting an International Environmental Ethic these are more the pivotal elements that determine the overall success or failure of a particular development project,with regard to decreased environmental quality. The critical challenge is to develop systems and projects that ensure economic survival in a world where long-range socioculturaland environmental deterioration may ultimately result in economic disaster. Mainstream environmentalists don't be- lieve in just any form of development\u2014but specifically insustainable development that operates within stringent environmental constraints that maintain and enhance eco- nomic prosperity and quality of life without environmentaldeterioration, in other words, development projects (includ- ing nature travel and tourism) that are done in an environ- mentally sound and aesthetic manner, enhancing theircurrent recreation value while still leaving ecosystems fully functional and unimpeded. The prerequisite for environmentally sustainable devel- opment is to remain within the limits of nature's carrying capacity, while minimizing the negative and maximizing the positive effects of human activity. Ultimately, the goal is toachieve economically efficient (working within economies of scale) sustainable development, and simultaneously a sus- tainable natural environment. Yet this approach\u2014the middle road approach\u2014must be undertaken in the spirit of bal- anced compromise, that is, recognizing the limits of both human ingenuity and the environment, and approachingdevelopment projects with a degree of educated respect, caution, and built-in flexibility. However, a firm pro-envi- ronment attitude must take precedence; one that accordsbasic priority to the ecology is imperative. For a society, the middle-road approach requires a shift in societal values and attitudes, in world economic systems, ininternational conservation agreements, and by the grantingand receiving of foreign aid for development projects. For the individual, it means curtailing our pursuit of economic and technological advancement so as to procure and maintain alifestyle based primarily on the acquisition of material goods. Ultimately, where uncertainty exists regarding a specific environmental decision associated with develop-ment, it is most wise to give the benefit of doubt to nature and to side with conservation. In other words, it is wisest to err in favor of the environment than in favor of unmitigateddevelopment. Importance and Application of Environmental EducationProgramming in Ecotourism Activities ______________________ As noted in the previous section of this paper, there is an obligation to change our societal attitudes toward the envi-ronment, as well as to reassess human values and lifestyles with regard to the basic ecology of the planet; perhaps most importantly is this attitudinal shift in the modernized West.One way in which to accomplish this task is to actively promote environmental education for peoples of all society, both those in more developed countries (MDCs) and those oflesser-developed countries (LDCs). Whereas many govern- ments in LDCs promote various forms of nature tourism and travel as a means of economic development and the mostprevalent connoisseur of this type of economic development are people at leisure, one must acknowledge the danger orcosts associated when marketing an area's unique flora and fauna, not to mention the drawbacks of marketing an area's rich cultural heritage\u2014when unmitigated, profiteering de-velopment is the driving force behind the enterprise. In essence, it is those people who are traveling and recreating in an outdoor setting that are most likely todevelop a sense of environmental awareness or ecological literacy (Orr 1992). The hope is that through repeated outdoor recreational experiences, the individual develops alevel of sensitivity to the range of human impacts that threaten natural ecosystems\u2014from seeing the effects of acid rain on a once lush evergreen forest to witnessing the lack ofbasic sanitation and its effect on a community of people in a remote village in the Himalayas. Seeing and experiencing these things will, over the long run, help the individual todevelop an environmental ethic, or earth consciousness, that takes into account not only the basic principles of ecology but then also applies them to the realm of socialsystems and ongoing cultural advancement. More specifically, participation in ecotourism activities, especially those based in remote or wildernesslike settings,combined with some degree of ecological training of ecotourism operators in LDCs, contributes to the develop- ment of an environmental ethic among the masses. Theinference is that this will translate into political activism on matters of the environment, both domestically and abroad (Gunn 1988a,b; Jackson 1988; Pigram 1980). Select Case Studies: Moving Toward Success Annapurna Conservation Area Project, Nepal \u2014The King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation established the 7,629 km2 (2,946 miles2) Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP) in December of 1986. Its status as a multiple-use area, as opposed to the more restrictive national park model, is an innovative concept in achieving environmental protection along with sustainable community development.Multiple use is accommodated in part by the subdivision of the area into zones, including special management areas, intensive-use areas, limited use areas and wilderness areas(Gurung and DeCoursey 1994). Moreover, the project em- braces traditional subsistence activities that are woven into a framework of sound resource management, supplementedby conservation, development, and alternative energy pro- grams, to minimize the negative impacts of tourism and enhance the living standards of the local people. The biological diversity of the Annapurna Region is equally rivaled by its rich cultural diversity. Since the first trekker came to the Annapurna area in 1957, the natural andcultural features of ACAP have made it the most popular tourist destination in Nepal, drawing more than 60 percent of the country's total trekkers. ACAP follows a grassrootsphilosophy of maximum peoples' participation, sustainabil- ity, and its role as a catalyst whereby the local people are involved in all aspects of the conservation and developmentprocesses, both as principal actors and prime beneficiaries. ACAP is spread out in five districts of the Western Devel- opment Region of Nepal and covers 55 Village Development190 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Fredrickson Wilderness Ecotourism and Education as a Means of Promoting an International Environmental Ethic Committees. ACAP is divided into seven units with conser- vation offices located in the field at Jomsom, in the north and Bhujung, Lwang, Sikles, and Ghandruk in the south. While the focus of Jomsom, Manang, and Ghandruk, which are also popular areas fortrekking, is on integrated tourism management and agro- pastoralism, the program priorities for Bhujung, Sikles, and Lwang are poverty alleviation and integrated agricultureand livestock development, agroforestry, and community development, respectively. The focus in Lho Manthang, Upper Mustang, which came under the jurisdiction of ACAPin 1992, has been on managing controlled tourism on a sustainable basis, and promoting heritage conservation, which is the major tourist attraction along with alternativeenergy, resource conservation, and community development programs. The Conservation Education and Extension Project (CEEP) has been implemented in the entire ACAP and formsthe backbone of all its conservation efforts in the region. Implementation of ACAP was achieved through the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), anongovernmental, theoretically autonomous, nonprofit or- ganization, described as very effective because of its interna- tional connections, autonomy, international fund-raisingcapacities and ability to bypass the cumbersome bureau- cracy frequently present in LDCs. The ultimate goal of the KMTNC is to see that the local people themselves, withminimal intervention from government and/or other institu- tions, manage ACAP. That is, ACAP was designed so that most startup costs would initially be borne by outside do-nors, but then financial stability would be gradually achieved through user fees charged to international visitors and placed in an endowment fund that would generate funds forfuture conservation efforts in the area. One of the majorinnovations of the ACAP is that local communities are expected to contribute, in money or in kind, at least 50 percent of the costs of any project, assuming that suchfinancial contributions not only indicate a serious initial intent, but ensure a long-term community commitment because of the vested funds involved (Wells and Brandon1992). Tourism-related components of ACAP that emphasize active ecotourism initiatives aimed at the visitor include: Establishment and maintenance of visitor informationcenters to disseminate advice to trekkers, using videos,brochure and publicity materials, and other interpre- tive/educational sources. Litter and pollution control through the installation of toilets and trash receptacles in lodges and through the distribution of brochures directed toward changing the behavior of high-impact tourists. Lodge owner training through a 1-week course, involving fuelwood savings and substitutes (as through the use of back boiler water heaters), hygiene, garbage disposal,and the formation of lodge management committees. Trekking guide training focusing on minimal impactcamping protocol (\"leave no trace\" principles). Formation of local Lodge Management Committees (LMCs) who are heavily involved in the decisionmaking process as to how excess funds are distributed and reinvested in the conservation project.Search and rescue arrangements for emergency heli- copter evacuation for visitors. Ecocamp site development in ecologically/culturally sen- sitive areas (based on \"leave no trace\" principles). Conservation-related components of ACAP that empha- size education aimed primarily at the local population include: Conservation education classes in schools. Conservation awareness camps for local villagers. Village cleanup campaigns. Formation of local natural history museums and visitorinformation services, including an environmental re-source library. Formation of extension and conservation educationinhouse for Community Forestry Groups (CFGs). Implementation of the policy of incremental access through limited access permits into trekking areas. Since ACAP was first implemented, many ecological and sociocultural improvements are evident: reduced firewood consumption, enforcement of kerosene-only policies (for cooking) in certain areas, a complete ban on hunting, cleaner lodges and enhanced sanitation systems, better waste man- agement, economic diversification, and improved revenueretention. Since 1989, ACAP has charged an average en- trance fee of 200 rupees (USD 9), yielding an annual revenue of 4 million rupees (USD 160,000), which has then beenreinvested into various conservation efforts, as well as educational and social welfare initiatives, such as microlending programs, trekking guide training programs,and women's literacy programs. The revenues generatedfrom ACAP are equivalent to approximately one-half the revenues of trekking permits for all of Nepal. Overall, a major accomplishment of ACAP has been the creation of anenvironmental ethos among locals and tourists (Buckley 1991). Sunungukai Camp, Zimbabwe \u2014On the banks of the Mazowe River is Sunungukai Camp, the first ecotourism project run by a small community of some 25 households infive rural villages (Kapandoro, Hodzi, Munando, Chida- ramumba, and Mapini). Opened in March 1993, Sunungukai is run by a locally elected committee, under the CommunalAreas Management Program for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), with funding and management training pro- vided by the Zimbabwe Trust. The philosophical underpin-ning of this ecotourism venture was to solve the threat of unsustainable exploitation of natural resources by ensuring that local people reap economic benefits on nonconsumptivetourism activities. Visitors to the area come to enjoy moun- tain hiking and scenic vistas overlooking the river, fishing for a variety of game fish, or photography and viewingwildlife. Local guides take people to see nearby bushman paintings or to consult the traditional healer. Visitors camp or stay in traditional round huts and can make arrangements toshare traditional meals with local residents. CAMP FIRE, as the umbrella organization, facilitates the formation of Community Based Organizations (CBOs) for thepurpose of natural resource management. Through the CAMP- FIRE p rinciples of decentralization and devolution, CBOs are formed and structures developed linking them to localauth orities, ensuring local participation in decisionmakingUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 191Fredrickson Wilderness Ecotourism and Education as a Means of Promoting an International Environmental Ethic and hands-on management of the area's natural resources. Besides receiving benefits from the revenues of the camp,some locals have been trained (and now work) as guides. Others make handicrafts and souvenirs to sell at the camp. Community workshops and meetings are held to ensure thatthe locals can voice their opinions on the impacts of the ecotourism in their area. Prior to the start of the project, access to and use of the area's natural resources in the Communal Lands of the Mazowe River Basin were unrestricted. This led to serious degradation of the natural environment. For example, de-mand for fuelwood led to the destruction of forests, poor agricultural practices led to serious soil erosion, and gold panning activities aggravated the problem of river silt-ation\u2014issues not that uncommon in other developing coun- tries. Add to this the problem of increased population den- sity throughout the whole of Zimbabwe, and you've got anarea that is teetering on the brink of ecological and cultural bankruptcy. The problem of environmental degradation is by no means confined to the Mazowe River Basin. On thecontrary, it is a national problem for Zimbabwe where over 70 percent of the population is rural and depends on land resources for its livelihood. Given that local communities were not compensated for nonuse of natural resources and the fact that the state had access to much needed resources under a principle of exclu-sion under the national policy of Protected Areas, the envi- ronment was severely compromised. Yet, if the clearing of woodland for agricultural production and harvesting of theforests for fuelwood and construction poles continued un- abated, the forest resources would have been completely depleted, and the river would have silted beyond repair.With the silting of the river, the fish population would havedeclined, which could have then triggered game poaching as a source of protein (a practice that is frequently found in other parts of sub-Sahara Africa). In general, mountingenvironmental degradation had a direct and negative im- pact on economic development in the Sunungukai area. Determined to bring change to their community, local villagers decided to establish an income-generating project. This was to build a camp, and a suitable site was identified in Kapandaro Village. An elected committee of local commu-nity members oversaw the construction and management of the site. Sunungukai Camp was built on one hectare (2.5 acres) of land, and the owner of the land is continuallyentitled to 10 percent of the camp revenues. Another 5 to10 percent goes to the Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe Rural Dis- trict Council (UMPRDC), which serves as a link between theproject and the central government and provides technical support on project implementation. Decisions about the re- maining revenues are made by the management committee. The camp consists of four roundavel lodges, each with its own grilling site, a reception/information building, commu- nal kitchen, and a caretaker's room. The layout of the campis based on traditional Shona architecture and was con- structed using locally available materials with local labor provided by the community. All the bricks used in construc-tion were made by the local people, and they provided thatching grass and poles for roofing. Cement, windows and doorframes were bought with cash provided by the Zimba-bwe Trust, and fencing materials (to keep out unwantedwildlife) was bought with donated funds from the New Zealand High Commission in Zimbabwe. Since its inception in 1993, the area has experienced a remarkable change in the way the community is actively involved in monitoring natural resource use and generatingan income from ecotourism. This has led to controlled gold panning and better use of other resources, such as poles and thatch used in building construction. Additionally, membersof the local community have received extensive training from the CAMPFIRE Association and other community conservation groups on natural resources management andecotourism opportunities. Most of the money generated thus far has gone to pay staff and to continue with renovations and facility upgrades. One of the most pressing problemsstill f acing beautiful Sunungkai Camp is that the area is not well marketed and remains somewhat underutilized. Future revenues are earmarked for marketing the siteinternationally and increasing the tourism management and training for the local labor force. Nonetheless, in the perspective of the community, \"it is now true to say that themajority of our people have an increasing realization of what the environment means to them and to future generations\" (Munasinghe 1995). Tourism-related components of Sunungukai Camp that emphasize active ecotourism initiatives aimed at the visitor include: Formation of Community-Based Organizations (CBOs)that initiate and organize local communities aroundeconomic empowerment and resource conservation projects. Tour guide training focusing on minimal impact camp- ing protocol and photographic safaris (\"leave no trace\"principles). Formation of the local Sunungukai Mana gement Com- mittee (SMC) who is heavily involved in the decision-making process as to how excess funds are distributed and reinvested in the conservation project. Eco-campsite development (no running water, no flush toilets, no electricity) in sensitive areas (based on \"leave no trace\" principles). Conservation-related components of Sunungukai Camp that emphasize education aimed primarily at the local population include: Conservation awareness workshops for local villagers. Village cleanup campaigns. Drafting of the Sunungukai Management Committee Peoples' Constitution that monitors community natural resource use regulations and implements sanctionsagainst offenders. Collection of user fees for use of natural resources bynonlocals. Toledo Ecotourism Association: The Toledo Guesthouse and Ecotrail Program \u2014The Toledo Eco- tourism Association (TEA) is comprised of Mopan, Kekchi, and Garifuna (Carib/African) villages in the forgotten south- ern district of Toledo in Belize. This program was formed toenable the local peoples to directly plan, control, and profit from ecotourism. Profits from the TEA program go to a general fund, which contributes to village health and educa-tion, rainforest conservation, and central office operation.192 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Fredrickson Wilderness Ecotourism and Education as a Means of Promoting an International Environmental Ethic More than 80 percent of all funds stay in the individual village that is visited. Established in 1990 after the Toledo Home Site Farming and Ecology Center organized a series of free, community- sponsored public workshops focusing on profiting from sound ecotourism, TEA has, from the start, been a grassroots organization. Villagers who attended these initial work- shops first developed the Toledo Guesthouse Program bybuilding four simple guesthouses throughout the southern district of Belize where visiting ecotourists could stay. The original four TEA guesthouses were built by local commu-nity members and were constructed from local building materials in a style that matched traditional Belizean home design. Each guesthouse was constructed of palm leaf roofs,wooden walls, and dirt or concrete floors, and each guesthouse contained only four bunkbeds, thereby minimizing the num- ber of people who could stay at one particular guesthouse. Additionally, the guesthouses were designed to be envi- ronmentally low impact. The guesthouses do not have elec- tricity but instead rely on traditional oil lamps. Restroomsconsist of nonflush, composting toilets, and the washroom consists of a basin of water and a dipper and towel for bathing. Different host families prepare traditional meals,and it is expected that visitors rotate their visitation to individual homes for meals so as to economically benefit a greater percentage of the local community. To date, there are roughly 18 guesthouses spread through- out the southern district of Toledo, and because each of the TEA villages are located within relatively close proximity toone another, visitors typically walk from one inland village to the next. Accompanied by local guides, the Toledo Ecotrail system allows visitors to travel through a diverse array oflandscapes\u2014from virgin jungles rich with over 500 speciesof tropical birds, 200 types of wild orchids and the elusive jaguar, to climbing in the foothills of the Maya Mountains that provide spectacular views of the rainforest below. Whiletraveling inland, tourists make their way from one village to the next, incorporating visits to ancient Mayan wonders that have survived over a thousand years, such as Lubaantun orUxbenka, both ancient Mayan ceremonial centers. In striking contrast, the Ecotrail system travels through the beautiful fishing village of Barranco, which is a finerepresentation of traditional Garifuna culture. In striking contrast to the Mayan villages inland, Barranco offers a coastal setting and a rich culture derived from theAmerindian/African heritage of the region. Days in the coastal village of Barranco can be spent fishing in dugout canoes or visiting the Temash River Forest Reserve; nightscome alive with Garifuna drumming and dancing. The main objective of the Toledo Guesthouse and Ecotrail Program is to provide visitors to the area a glimpse intoeveryday life as experienced by the Mopan, Kekchi, and Garifuna peoples. Visitors to the area have the unique oppor- tunity to observe traditional farming, cooking, weaving, andbasketry; enjoy traditional dances, music, and storytelling; and, learn arts a nd crafts, such as backstrap weaving, embroidery, and jippy-jappa basketry. Finally, all programming is locally supported and sanc- tioned by an elected village executive, who oversees the running of the program in each particular village. Addition-ally, there is a district executive, who is elected every 2 years, to manage and control the TEA program on a district level.The entire organization of 201 members, representing 10 villages, holds regular monthly meetings to decide long-term planning and strategizing. Apart from providing a rich and memorable experience to the visitor, another important objective of the ToledoGuesthouse and Ecotrail Program is raising monies to help fund alternatives to slash and burn agriculture, the number one cause of deforestation in the Toledo district. As previ-ously mentioned, approximately 80 percent of the monies raised through this particular program remain in each separate village and goes toward improving village healthand education initiatives, as well as providing individual families who participate in the program with a source of personal income. Tourism-related components of the Toledo Guesthouse and Ecotrail Program that emphasize active ecotourism initiatives aimed at the visitor include: Tour guide training focused on educating the visitorabout the daily life practices of indigenous residents andtheir local relationship to the environment. Low impact guesthouse design (no running water, noflush toilets, no electricity) villages. Rotational work basis for tour guides, educating visitors about the importance of balancing traditional work with that of ecotourism activities. Conservation-related components of the Toledo Guesthouse and Ecotrail Program that emphasize education aimed pri-marily at the local population include: Appointment of an elected village executive who ini-tiates and organizes local community members aroundeconomic empowerment and resource conservation projects. Conservation awareness workshops for local villagers about proper guesthouse construction using locally avail- able resources. Establishment of consistent user fees for individual households who host visitors to the Toledo district. Collection of user fees for use of natural resources bynonlocals. Appointment of elected district executives who are heavily involved in the decisionmaking process as to how excess funds are to be distributed and reinvested atthe regional level in various health, education, and conservation initiatives. Discussion and Conclusions______ In all countries of the world, both poor and rich, wilderness ecotourism (or wildernesslike settings) has the potential of playing an outstanding role in educating peoples from both MDCs and LDCs about the importance of adopting aninternational and universally accepted environmental ethic. This international environmental ethic must include such things as: The recognition of the complexity of nature and a repu-diation of the belief that we can scientifically under-stand and technologically manipulate nature without limit. Restraint in our behavior toward the natural world and restriction of our wants.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 193Fredrickson Wilderness Ecotourism and Education as a Means of Promoting an International Environmental Ethic The cultivation of a comprehensive sensibility toward nature that is equally far from the overly romantic,anthropomorphic view as from the utilitarian or cornucopian view of nature. Moreover, this type of paradigmatic change in humans' views toward nature will not come about without also recog- nizing that ecological protection and cultural preservationare inextricably linked, and maintaining both are integral to establishing long-term ecological integrity. Participation in sound ecotourism, combined with appro- priate environmental education and ecological training (for example, \"leave no trace\" principles), can contribute to the development of a deep environmental ethic among peoplefrom MDCs who travel internationally to visit wilderness settings in various LDCs, while also increasing the sociocul- tural concerns for the lives of peoples living in close contactwith these wilderness settings. In the long run, this trans- lates to political activism on matters of the environment, in addition to matters of social equity for persons in LDCswhose lives are inextricably linked to wilderness settings. Yet, at the same time, only minorities of people in LDCs are educated to behave responsibly toward the natural environ-ment. That is, the least environmentally concerned, due to their economic disadvantage, are residents of rural agricul- tural areas living in close proximity to wilderness (orwildernesslike) settings, and who are wholly dependent on the local flora and fauna for their sustenance. In many instances, inhabitants of these areas regard natural vegeta-tion primarily as a source of food and fuel, and wildlife as a source of meat\u2014or harbingers of destruction to agricultural crops. For many peoples in LDCs, the land is not an arena forleisure pursuits but a means of livelihood and survival. Inother words, the very concept of nature and wilderness in most LDCs is very different than the environmental ethic that drives much of the preservationist and conservationistactivities in MDCs. Through the use of decentralized political and economic decisionmaking processes utilized in ecotourism develop-ment projects, local indigenous community members of various LDCs are becoming vested caretakers and stewards of their cultural heritage and the natural environs thatsupport their given way of life. The three case studies described exemplify many of the positive outcomes of sound ecotourism activities. In conclusion, however, those of us from MDCs -\u2014who have the great luxury of travel to far off and distant wild- lands\u2014must ask ourselves the difficult question of whetherwe should stop traveling altogether. In the struggle to returncontrol of tourism activities to the local communities in LDCs, we must increasingly scrutinize our motives fortraveling, deciding whether we have the right as consumers to buy other cultures and environments, and yet still try to support responsible tourism. In an age where the media dominates and shapes our view of the world, it is imperative that we utilize ecotourism as a means to communicate with one another. In fact, there is nobetter way to understand the global environmental crisis that we all face than through people-to-people contact and firsthand interaction. Through one-on-one meetings withpeople we encounter through our travels, we discover uni- versal themes of human culture. In other words, we become acutely aware that no matter where we live, we are allconfronting similar situations. References_____________________ Buckley, M. 1991.

Only a feware recognized disease vectors, but many are seen as undesirable. City people prefer their homes free from centipedes, insects, spiders, scorpions, slugs, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, birds, bats, and mice.Some people have never seen any of these \"undesirables\" in their lifetime. Fumigation experts are regularly employed or pesticides and insecticides applied as sprays, sometimes in aerosol form.Mechanical and chemical means of maintenance eliminate many harmless and nonvisible life-supporting forms, while unclean dumps shelter insects and rodents\u2014food for city birds and homeless dogsand cats. The survival of growing cities depends on clean air and water, and on nature-conscious communities set on preserving areas as green belts, parks, \"nature pockets,\" and tree-lined squaresand streets. These attract wildlife and provide nature for some, while irritating others who prefer \"sterile\" surroundings. Efforts must be made so that city people do not become totally estrangedfrom the rest of the living world. Urban naturalists must encour- age people to notice, to observe, and to protect the forms of life that make a city alive and interesting, especially to tourists. It is desir- able to carry out systematic surveys to determine trends in behavior and attitudes toward plants and animals, most of which are at risk in fragile urban habitats, with constant influx of new dwellers fromrural areas into peripheral slums where they live crowded, threat- ened with violence, and lack basic facilities for healthy living. It is important to promote sustained efforts for teaching and applyingbioethics under such precarious conditions to ensure proper sur- vival for humans and other forms of life. Growing Cities__________________ The future of cities depends on choices about manage- ment of their green and wildlife heritage. Some make the wrong choices and tend to deteriorate, while others do allthey can to pull themselves up by the bootstraps. While Curitiba, Brazil, is an example of people-oriented, (Hawken and others 1999: 285-308), Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, is now entering a negative phase. Santo Domingo, the only \"gothic\" town in the Americas, with 1 million people in l978, had an averageWildlife in Growing Cities: Eco-Socio-Cultural Considerations Sophie Jakowska Dyrce Lacombe of 4 m2 (43 ft2) of green space per inhabitant. In 1986, an additional green area for a large urban park was added, totaling 4 million m2 (988 acres), but by that time the capital city had 2,700,000 inhabitants and thus it had only3 m 2 (32 ft2) of green area per person. The situation became worse when, in 2001, the city population reached 3 million, now with a total green area, including the greenbelt, of only about 8 million m 2 (1,977 acres)\u2014only 2.96 m2 (31.8 ft2) per person (Hernandez 2001). As we write this, parts of a valuable park are being trans- formed into installations for accommodating the Olympic games, at the dismay of local citizens. Some define it as \"crimen laesae patriae\" (Jakowska 2001f). At the same time,parts of the legally established green belt of the city of Santo Domingo with valuable natural vegetation is threatened unless it is possible to remove squatters to other areas. It isnot easy to convince people to move away from illegally occupied land where they have been left undisturbed for a number of years. Besides, there are no places to house themanywhere else. Their continued presence within the space designated by law as the green belt affects the perception of the significance of these spaces for the future of the growingmetropolis and promotes further law breaking that damagesnatural resources. Allowing things to continue as they are, with further intrusions into established parks by converting green space to other uses, makes it more difficult to achievenature consciousness among urban dwellers and to provide them with healthy living conditions, even with a strong educational effort (Jakowska, 2001a,b,c,d,e,g,h). More than 326 cities in the world, each with more than 1 million inhabitants, represent the chief source of environ- mental pollution. Urban history tells us that early in the 20 th century there were dreamers who proposed a network of clean, self-sufficient \"garden cities\" for the United States of America, where the best social aspects of city life couldcoexist with the beauty of nature. They felt an urgent need to replace ill-ventilated, unplanned, unwieldy, and unhealthy cities\u2014products of the industrial revolution. But cities to-day still do not sustain a more equitable society in harmony with nature and are more a caricature of the garden city ideal. Sustainable development, as conceived in theBrundtland Commission's report, Our Common Future , also remains an unfulfilled dream. In 1900, one-tenth of the world's population lived in cities; now, past the year 2000,half of the world's population are city dwellers. Major urban problems today are: air pollution, lack of drinking water, urban waste, transportation, poor city planning, and housing. In l996, in Istambul, 171 nations and 579 cities met for the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II). Little has been achieved for lack of political willand money. The reports prepared for Istambul+5 indicateUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 195Wildlife in Growing Cities: Eco-Socio-Cultural Considerations Jakowska and Lacombe that globalization had a detrimental effect on the poor in slums and squatter settlements (Tibaijuka 2001). Unsus-tainable resource use poses a threat to the continued exist- ence of cities. Perhaps it is easier now to starve in the countryside than in the city due to the destruction of agricul-ture as a direct source of food, resulting in food insecurity (Arputham 2001). Be Nature Conscious!____________ Nature consciousness is a form of ecological literacy that is a natural quality of some cultures and communities that consider caring for the Earth as part of their way of life. In crowded cities, where landless farmers seek their fortune, itis difficult to find this form of sensitivity and even harder to find ways to instill it. For many years, conservation-related groups and institu- tions have been trying to find paths to bring this \"caring for the Earth and its creatures\" into the way of life of people in cities and in rural areas. During the time when I started toserve in 1977, The World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Commission on Education, which has some of the best environmental education experts, tried changing names,approaches, and methods. Presently, and during the two terms served by Frits Hesselink, the Commission has called \"on education and communication,\" an approach promotedby the Chair and by the special efforts of Wendy Goldstein, the IUCN Communication Officer. Both have been using different means of communication, starting innovative net-works and internet consultations and debates, promoting films, television programs, and \"summits.\" The present chair of the Commission, Denise Ham\u00fa, is expanding thepromising ways of communication and maintains close linkswith members all over the world. Other similarly-minded organizations and institutions produce materials and pro- grams to increase the transmission of necessary knowledge. While we have better means of transmitting knowledge with electronic devices, what we cannot transmit, unless the destinataries have the right disposition, is empathy for theworld we live in and for all the creatures that share the Earth with us. When there is no link of affection between people and nature, the best of environmental education (such as,teaching about biodiversity) is totally meaningless. But it is necessary to insist, no matter how deficient, on environmen- tal awareness within school curricula on all levels, since it isnever too soon or too late to confront environmental issues. It is important to continue harping at the root causes of biodiversity loss and the need to live \"in peace\" with Nature,even though we cannot always find this peace with our own kind (Wood and others 2000). Certainly, in crowded growing cities it is apparently more urgent to preach the message of\"Peace with Nature\" (Jakowska l989) in order to transmit the message of the importance of biodiversity in protected areas to millions of urbanites estranged from nature. How to \"plug in\" the fashionable biodiversity into different methods of communicating and sharing values is the preoc- cupation of many authors of recent articles (Hesselink 2001a).Many good practical proposals have been offered (Hesselink 2001b). Education involves not only the intellect but also the spirit. If the heart cannot be engaged, worthless are our efforts topromote the need to preserve nature in all forms and circum- stances. This is especially difficult when interest clashes withgood intentions. Nature consciousness, when sincerely achieved, obliges one to face the global, counter-nature trends and rampant consumerism that stresses or destroys thecommon good while making a play of \"sustainability.\" Nature-conscious people need green areas, friendly city gardens, plots to grow fruit, vegetables, and flowers. Unfor-tunately, well-intentioned people who seek the help of spe- cialists to design their gardens often end up with manicured lawns, which are practically ecological deserts. The Polishpress recently pointed out that insects, including mosqui- toes, are just as important in an urban biotope as are the songbirds people enjoy. They serve as food to other species.But people who may wish to protect nature usually do not know what to do; the smaller the garden in the city, the greater the errors that are committed. People plan theirgardens mostly for their visual pleasure, and forget that living creatures always serve one another, dead or alive (Jakowska l979, 1996), and that the natural food chainsmust be preserved for them to survive. City dwellers think of supermarkets, not of food chains, and have no qualms when buying products that may include genetically modifiedorganisms. \"Food + Shelter = Survival\" is a simple formula expressing the essential needs in order to preserve life. Entire popula-tions live below that requirement, as starving homeless nomads, due to geopolitical circumstances. This may be said of plants, animals, and people. While other creatures con-tinue to serve under the most difficult circumstances, in the case of the human race, poverty down to the extreme tears down physical structure starting before birth, and continuesto erode the body, exposing it to stress and disease. With all our present advances in science and technology, with fascinating medical advances to ease pain and prevent the spread of epidemics that used to ravage humanity in oldtimes, we are still at a loss for the means to keep peace on Earth. Years of effort writing charters on human rights and creating laws and agreements to protect flora and faunafrom destruction have not given us the formula to save us from the calamities, disasters, and wars resulting from the wrong applications of the technologies that should be theglory of our creativity. The horrors of violence, products of the culture of death, are instantly known today in all parts of the world. May we all learn to achieve peace withinourselves, our families, with our fellow creatures, and pro- mote the civilization of love, which is the true destiny of humanity. Let us meditate with the young, whose time it isto start their nature apprenticeship, because it is never too late for us to learn (Jakowska l989). Fear Us Not! Live and Let Live_____ Fear is one major factor in our relations with others. It is a quality that contributes to self-preservation through reasonable caution. It may become hysteria, panic, and violence. Much of the cruelty that we commit againstliving creatures is due to ignorance of their true role in the world and the wrong interpretation of their nature or their action. It is proper to teach from childhood to becareful with wild plants or animals due to possible rash or196 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Jakowska and Lacombe Wildlife in Growing Cities: Eco-Socio-Cultural Considerations infection, but one ought to teach from the start the love for all creatures as co-owners of our Earth, companions in thesame spaceship, the Planet Earth, to which we are so much in debt. No creature that appears scary or repug- nant by individual criteria need be considered as hostileor ugly. Toads and bats have an unjust bad reputation, the first because of their wart-covered skin, and the second becausethey need to expose their teeth in order to perceive the environment. People associate bats with vampires, legend- ary creatures, while the one and only blood-sucking speciesof bats are never found outside Brazil or in urban conditions. Most people do not realize how vulnerable bats are, espe- cially in their first weeks of life, and how helpless they maybe, depending on the time of day when their metabolism may be down. Bat swarming may bring a whole town in Spain into a bat-killing frenzy, and as a first childhood experience itmay be traumatic for life, as we have seen in documentaries. Other species of city fauna may also look repugnant, but need not be hostile and will go away when left alone. It is correct to keep dwellings clean from \"vermin,\" especially the insect vectors of known major diseases. The kissing bugs of Central and South America were present foryears in cracks and crevices of homes, especially those of native materials. Their relation to the acute and chronic forms of illness caused by a trypanosome was not recog-nized until the start in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a hundred years ago, of the institute that bears the founder's name, \"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,\" with which the second authorwas associated as histology expert in the Entomology Department and where she continues her work in \"active retirement.\" These bugs, as well as mosquitoes (potentialvectors of different types of malaria, dengue, and yellowfever), are not welcome in homes for sanitary precautions. Similarly, different species of roaches that urban natural- ists (Garber 1987) delight in describing are undesirable fortheir \"dirty\" habits that destroy and contaminate food and damage household objects. I was surprised that my entomologist coauthor, who enjoys collecting and observing small ant-like embiids, could not put up with the sight of the large tropical roach, the \"palmetto bug.\" Its attractive (to me) nymphal forms, of all stages, livein the garden under stones just outside my kitchen. We moved into the house in 1977 and started gradually liberating the ground of a heavy coat of cement. I am proud to say I havenever used pesticides, weedkillers, or even chemical fertiliz- ers in my small, fully-enclosed city garden. The first Christ- mas, just as a sign of \"peace with nature,\" unexpectedly, thereappeared lovely, bright, pink flowers from crocus-like bulbs that had survived for years under the cement, patiently awaiting liberation. I have since planted them in other places,and they continue to delight me. Many \"unwanted\" plants appear in unexpected places\u2014 street drains, wall cracks, and on the edges of the sidewalks.Some are removed by the \"tidy,\" just as are the beautiful little trees and bushes cast in the garbage when they out- grow the garden. We call these \"orphan plants,\" and takethem in whenever we can place them in our care. Tropical climates provide for a greater variety of domestic flora and fauna. The speed with which vegetation growsafter destruction by people or by natural disasters leads to attitudes that do not promote friendship across evolutionarylevels. The household lizards of different species, whose chief enemies are playful well-fed cats with persistent hunt-ing instincts, are, in the absence of insect-eating bats, some of the best and \"simpatico\" pest controls. There is no reason to fear them. But many people have a natural fear of snakes,justified in places where, unlike on the island where I live now, there are no poisonous species and all of them are useful in rodent control, though unjustly destroyed. In theresidential part of Santo Domingo in the late l970s and early l980s, local species of snakes made frequent appearances in the closets of the residence of the French ambassador. Theywere collected and placed in safety by the best Dominican herpetologist, who was always willing to oblige. In some cultural settings it is hard to imagine this kind of attitudeand gentle treatment of a dangerous snake but, perhaps, it may be instilled gradually from childhood, teaching and learning to live in peace with the whole world, the greatdesire of all, especially in our age of violence (Jakowska l989). I know of giant centipedes, 12 inches long, first identified by Linnaeus with an elegant Latin name, living in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo. Their minor relatives of unidentified species, less than 2 inches long, keep hatchingseasonally in my house surroundings. We try to transfer them to safety whenever possible, and there is always a feeling of a \"life lost\" when we hear the familiar crunchwhile walking in the dark. There are also lovely spiders, hard working like the mythological Arachne, who build attractive webs from bush to bush, while others contributeto insect control in the home, capturing flies and nondesirable termites during swarming, and whose work we occasionally destroy where it would give a bad testi-mony to our housekeeping. In our \"live and let live\" community, there are scorpions of different kinds, interesting but potentially dangerous; ticks that infest the dogs; and ants of all sizes, from the micro-scopic ones forming a tightly packed circle around a single sugar crystal left on the sink, to some big, biting ones among the organic matter on the ground and under the stones. Antsalso feed (and are fed on by lizards) on the fallen mango fruit and figs we leave to the poor city birds who suffer the effects of their preference for \"sterile\" urban dwellings with tiled orcemented garden spaces. We have the pleasure of regular visits from the palm chats, national birds of the Dominican Republic, who come to feedon the fruit of the royal palm, the national plant of this country, which their ancestors originally planted in our garden about l977. The second smallest humming bird inexistence also lives on this island and occasionally visits our garden to drink the nectar of the flowers. Every day I have contacts with all forms of life besides the dogs and cats wehave as pets. My days are a constant canticle of the creatures and a prayer of thanksgiving for all the joys and benefits life continues to offer as I approach my 80 th birthday. Realistic Bases for Hope _________ Poverty, characteristic of the periphery of growing cities (Tibaijuka 2001) is not exclusively limited to humans. The forces that shape the state of the world today are mostly ofour making, and impoverish natural resources at every levelUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 197Wildlife in Growing Cities: Eco-Socio-Cultural Considerations Jakowska and Lacombe of evolution, as well as the nonrenewable ones which, when exploited directly or indirectly, affect all creatures. Nature has been betrayed by globalization, sustainability, green science, green production (Anastas and Warner 1998), green organizations, and green politics of doubtful interests,and, on a personal level, by the acceptance by most of us of a consumerist approach to life. Wildlife seems to have no place in this scheme of things except as a negotiable item, especially in countries that try to imitate First World habits. Robert Shapiro, chairman of the Monsanto Corporation, is quoted as saying in l997(Ayres l999) that the most fundamental issues facing the world at the start of the new millennium is \"living within your energy income, not expending more energy than thesun provides, and not putting out waste products faster than nature makes them harmless.\" Industrialists seldom speak in those terms and cannot afford to live up to such principles,which sound like \"small is beautiful\" (Schumacher 1999), or like the eco-village mentality (Jakowska 2001a,b,c,d,e,g,h). It seems in conflict with the present energy consumption ofMonsanto, largest producer of the herbicide Roundup, diffi- cult for Nature to absorb. With demographic predictions that world population will double around 2030, Shapiro warns that we will end up as \"a few islands of privilege and prosperity in a sea of misery and violence. The world is headed either for famine or for ecologi-cal catastrophe.\" It need not be so if we share \"good\" knowl- edge before, as someone said, it becomes an endangered species, and apply this knowledge to a remedial mode ofaction. But the public is easily confused by occasional, supposedly green, leaders and organizations which, for example, send out reports that the rising carbon dioxidelevel is good for us because it helps grow vegetables. But wealso know that it fosters the spread of malaria and crop- killing weeds and pests (Moser and Mathers 2001). These authors warn, in the official organ of the Union of ConcernedScientists, that scientists ought to debunk such statements by \"climate skeptics\" urging us to \"learn to distinguish the real science from the junk science\" in respect to the use offossil fuels and genetically modified organisms. Only through the acceptance of \"God's last offer \" to defend our world, rather than our bank accounts, might wehave any real chance of saving our world, not just ourselves (a foolish consideration), and regain the sense of personal and family security we care about so deeply (Ayres 1999).In making choices, we must select reliable consultants such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, Friends of the Earth, or other equally worthy organizations. As we face the prob-lem of violence that, especially in our times, pollutes nature and human souls (Jakowska 1998) and assaults the dignity that is the essential feature of humankind (Jakowska2000), we must turn to eco-spirituality, the humble way of caring for the Earth (Jakowska l996) and help the survival of as many creatures as possible that share our world, toensure our own dignified survival. We must draw upon Bioethics, the global bioethics built by recently deceased Van Rensselaer Potter on the \"Leopold Legacy,\" as indi-cated by the subtitle of his second major contribution (Potter 1971, 1988). The paper Potter wrote for the Policy Forum Section of the journal Science , was received by the Bioethics Core Group and Working Group of Affiliates in mid-May of 2001. It ends with the following statement:We are indeed losing the war to save the planet and the future of humanity. To win the war we need scientists who are not avoiding the ethical issues. Sustainability Science [the last word underlined by Potter] is not enough. We need tolaunch the Crusade of the 21 st Century under the banner of Bioethical Sustainability. May this dream come true! We must also seek alliances where inter-religious dialogue raises voices of hope in the struggle to save the planet (Hope and Young 2000). Some of our considerations were inspired by our personal experi-ences in the big cities of the Old and of the New World. References_____________________ Anastas, Paul T.; Warner, John C. 1998.

Proc. RMRS-P-27. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.Abstract \u2014Wildlands continue to be challenged with the pressures of modern society as more people use and impact these special areas. Complicated issues create situations where managers must strikea balance between offering a wilderness experience and protecting wilderness resources. Nine years ago, the Charles C. Deam Wilder- ness in the Midwestern United States provided just such a challengeto wilderness managers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Hoosier National Forest. This small wilder- ness had a very long list of problems that made this area bear littleresemblance to the wild area for which it was intended. Several management actions were implemented to move this area to a wilderness condition. These actions resulted in improved trailconditions, better opportunity for solitude, fewer impacts from horses, less depreciative behavior, reduced user conflict, and a stronger appreciation of wilderness by users. Managers found asurprising degree of success in implementing some controversial changes, and attributed that success to two factors: extensive involvement by the public in the development phase of thesechanges, and the implementation of several concurrent manage- ment actions. Introduction and Background _____ The Wilderness Act of 1964 defines wilderness in the United States as \"...an area where the Earth and its commu- nity of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself isa visitor who does not remain.\" Such an area is to be a place where natural forces are dominant and one may find oppor- tunities for solitude. This concept is supported by challeng-ing visitors to cope with nature on its own terms. Modern conveniences such as developed facilities, the use of me- chanical or motorized equipment, and roads are generallyprohibited. This wilderness character may be somewhat easier to achieve in the Western United States due to the remoteness,size, and original pristine condition of those areas. In con- trast, eastern wildernesses are sometimes located near large metropolitan areas with accompanying overuse prob-lems and evidence of past land abuses. Such factors often prevent a wilderness from providing the primitive characterManagement Actions to Protect Wilderness Experiences and the Resource Les Wadzinski for which it was intended. The Deam Wilderness, although created by Congress in 1982, was suffering from these ills,and managers were doing little to offer a wilderness experi- ence or resource protection. The Deam Wilderness is a relatively small wilderness located in south-central Indiana in the midwestern area of the United States. The area covers almost 13,000 acres (5,261 hectares) and is bounded on three sides by road andone by water. The terrain is rugged by midwestern stan- dards with steep ravines, and is heavily forested predomi- nantly with hardwood species and also nonnative pines. Inthe 1930s, it was occupied by 78 homes or farms and was laced with 57 miles (92 km) of roads. It is currently managed by the USDA Forest Service, and is part of the 198,000-acre(80,128-hectare) Hoosier National Forest. Popular recre- ation uses include: hiking, horse riding, backpacking, and deer hunting. Problems ______________________ The Deam Wilderness was plagued by a number of issues, with overuse as the overriding factor. A variety of seemingly unrelated conditions were occurring simultaneously, buttogether were degrading the wilderness experience and thewilderness resource. These conditions and their effects are summarized below. Lack of Public Land Indiana is a very poor State in terms of public land available for outdoor recreation, with only 4 percent of theland base titled to a government entity. This is in sharp contrast to Western States where public land ownership often exceeds 50 percent. In addition, the Deam is the onlywilderness in Indiana offering those seeking wilderness no other choice without traveling long distances. Indiana is also a densely populated state, resulting in a situation wherethere are many people wanting to use a small amount of public land. Location and Access Although wilderness is supposed to offer solitude, the location of this wilderness made it too easy for people to visit,thus encouraging overuse. The area is located adjacent to a busy State highway and a very popular reservoir, is within easy driving distance of several large metropolitan areas,and is bisected by a graveled county road. Another factor was an overabundance of access points into the area. Sixty-four access points were inventoried that further increased theease in which large numbers of people could visit (USDA200 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Wadzinski Management Actions to Protect Wilderness Experiences and the Resource Forest Service 1993). It was believed that visitors came to the Deam Wilderness simply because of the conveniencerather than for a wilderness experience. High Trail Density A wilderness should also offer challenge, but in this case over 109 miles (175 km) of trail were available in this small area, creating a trail density of 5.35 miles (8.6 km) of trail persquare mile (2.5 km 2) of land (USDA Forest Service 1993). Numerous short loops were everywhere and required little endurance or navigation skill to use. Such a density would bemore appropriate in an urban setting than a wilderness. Poor Trail Conditions Most of the 109 miles (175 km) of trail were not designated trails that were built and maintained by the Forest Service. Rather, they were \"user made\" trails that simply formedfrom repeated use by horse riders. As a result, many were located on steep slopes or poorly drained low areas, and on fragile soils creating severe erosion problems and muddyquagmires. Intense Horse Use For over 50 years the area was popular for horse riding. Horses can be extremely damaging to soil types found in thisarea. Their relatively small hooves, coupled with their great weight, create a gouging action as they use the trails. This problem is compounded when it occurs on wet and fragile soils or on steep slopes. In dry times, the trail tread is pockmarked, and in wet times it becomes a muddy bog. Theeffect is severe soil erosion and a very unpleasant experience for those using the trail for hiking. A large Forest Service public camp known as the Blackwell Horsecamp served as amajor trailhead and access point, and was the source for most of this horse use. Inadequate Management For whatever the reasons, previous managers of the area did not intensively manage the land. As a result, few rules or regulations were in place or enforced, no staff was as- signed, little money was budgeted, and no trail system wasdesignated or maintained. Users could ride their horses wherever they wished, litter was common, and crimes such as drug use, excessive drinking, and fighting were prevalent at the Blackwell Horsecamp. Lack of Wilderness Values The concept of wilderness was new to most people in Indiana, and many had no idea that a designated wildernesswas a special place that required special behavior. In fact, many complained about the lack of facilities and couldn't understand why the use of mechanical equipment wasprohibited. Many visitors were simply looking for a place to drink beer, ride horses, and shoot guns. They did not seem interested in the wilderness values of solitude, challenge, and closeness to nature.User Conflict Hikers objected to damage caused by the horses, and some reported that horses interfered with their enjoyment. Thehorse clubs, on the other hand, became inflamed at even the hint of regulation. A study by Watson, Niccolucci, and Williams (1993) indicated that separate trails for each usewas generally supported by hikers but not by horse riders. The Forest Service seemed caught in the middle as the hikers accused the Forest Service of siding with the horsepeople, and the horse clubs accused the Forest Service of being anti-horse. None of the groups were talking to each other. At a public meeting, the Forest Service suggested acompromise to limit horses to 60 miles (96.5 km) of desig- nated trail. The result was a roomful of angry people, all feeling betrayed by the Forest Service. As one managerdescribed it, Forest Service officials had \"their backs to the wall and a long way to the exit\" (Slover 1996). Other user groups, such as hunters and environmentalists, had theirown concerns as well. It seemed everyone wanted the wilder- ness managed, but only for his or her activity. Roads and Cemeteries Ideally, a wilderness should not contain roads or perma- nent reminders of human influence such as cemeteries.However, as in all things, there are exceptions and this wilderness had plenty of them. This wilderness is actually divided into two segments, separated by a county road. Thisroad functioned as an unofficial 5-mile (8-km) linear camp- ground and attracted more than its share of unsavory characters and law enforcement problems. There are also five cemeteries within the wilderness boundaries, with one of them privately owned and therefore exempt from wilderness regulation. A 1.5-mile (2.4-km) road leads to this cemetery, and access is guaranteed by thelegislation that created the Deam Wilderness. The owners of this cemetery regularly drive back there to mow it with power mowers and occasionally conduct a burial. The re-maining cemeteries have abandoned access roads in very poor condition but also are mentioned in the legislation as having access permitted. Several citizens not able to walklong distances have requested motorized access to these cemeteries so they could visit the graves of their loved ones. This was a particularly challenging problem due to the factthat very extensive work would be needed to bring the roads up to a usable condition, not to mention the conflict between wilderness values and the humanitarian need to allowgravesite visitation. Working Toward a Solution: Citizen Involvement ____________________ The challenges facing managers of this area were indeed formidable. In 1992, several new Forest Service staff mem- bers were hired and upon arrival immediately saw a greatneed for change. This author was personally motivated after viewing the scene at the Blackwell Horsecamp the first weekend on duty in May 1992. Over 300 horse trailers weresqueezed into a 40-acre (16-hectare) field, goats and pigs were running loose, teenagers were racing horses, loudUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 201Wadzinski Management Actions to Protect Wilderness Experiences and the Resource music and alcohol was everywhere, and many riders sported pistols. It looked like a scene from a movie about the WildWest. This horsecamp was the main entry into the wilder- ness and obviously contributed little to instill wilderness values. The new managers inventoried the problems and arrived at the list previously described. It quickly became apparent that many forces were at work in preventing this wildernessfrom being wild, and there would be no single or easy solution. Forest Service officials knew that a \"big picture\" approach was needed but were not sure where to start. Thebiggest obstacle to proceeding with any changes to date had been the animosity of the user groups, both among them- selves and with the Forest Service. For any changes to occurit would be critical to have support of the user groups, so the journey started there. Forest Service officials had several options. They could simply ask a few users for opinions and then decree some changes based on what they thought was best. However, the public meeting previously described proved that approachwas ineffective. Another option was to simply do nothing. After all, the wilderness had been managed in this manner since 1982, and in fact, some users liked it the way it was.Fortunately, Forest Service managers felt they had a greater responsibility. Yet another option was to embark on a methodical planning process that would involve the public,analyze multiple alternatives, and result in a clearly defined plan. It was no secret that if the users were part of that process they would be much more supportive of the outcome.For that reason, the Forest Service selected a process known as the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) as described in Stankey and others (1985). LAC is an alternative to carrying capacity, designed to determine how much change is acceptable before manage- ment actions are needed to mitigate impacts. In this case, a citizen's task force was formed to implement the process.Interested parties could apply to be on the task force, and people in leadership positions from the user groups were encouraged to apply. This process brought the wildernessusers together, and forced them to sit at the same table and work out their differences. The process ultimately resulted in implementing manage- ment actions designed to promote a wilderness environ- ment. The Forest Service cannot abdicate decisionmaking to nongovernment entities, so in this case the task force only provided recommendations. They developed three alterna- tive solutions, with a variety of management actions in each. One alternative favored recreation, another favored the re-source, and a third alternative offered a compromise of the two. The Forest Service went forward with additional public involvement using the compromise recommendation as a starting point. The process included numerous mailings and open houses to ensure that all citizens, not just those on thetask force, had an opportunity to comment. Based on this additional input, managers analyzed the alternative man- agement actions and incorporated most of the recommenda-tions. Ultimately, some of the more significant management actions were incorporated into an amendment to the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. This plan provideslong-term guidance for management of the forest that manag- ers are required to follow. Additional management actions were also implemented through rules and regulations and by incorporation into other action plans. Even though Forest Service officials were the final decisionmakers, there was good support from the public because they participated directly in the development pro- cess. Some actions were effective, some were not, and somewere influenced by factors beyond anyone's control. The management actions and their effects are discussed below. Working Toward a Solution: Management Actions ____________ Basic Strategy It was recognized early on that the area was being over- used, and mostly by people that were not really there for awilderness experience. Rather, they wanted a convenient place in the woods to recreate. Therefore, the strategy focused on redirecting many of those users to nearbynonwilderness areas. The Forest Service certainly wanted the Deam Wilderness to remain open and accessible, but only to those willing and desiring to cope with the inconve-niences and challenges of a wilderness experience. Designated Trails One of the first orders of business was to designate a formal trail system and limit the number of trail miles. This was a drastic change from historical use, but users surpris-ingly accepted the change. The total number of trail miles inthe wilderness was capped at 40 (64 km), down from the 109 miles (175 km) inventoried. It is encouraging to note that this number is far less than the 60-mile (96.5-km) \"compro-mise\" that initially met with such opposition. Managers attribute this success to the fact that the public had a chance to participate in the process. A 36-mile (58-km) route ofseveral large loops was officially designated based on the recommendations of the LAC task force, leaving a 4-mile (6- km) buffer for future uncertainties. Five of these miles (8km) were set aside for hikers only, although hikers may also hike off trail if they choose. The large loops were selected to provide a challenge and discourage those users that were notseeking a wilderness experience. Short, easy loops were provided nearby at a trail in a nonwilderness area to serve those users. The next step was to improve trail conditions, which was accomplished through additional funding. This included rerouting some poor trails, installing drainage devices, andhardening the trail with gravel in some instances. Signs were installed so users would know which trails were official. Horse users were then required to ride only on this designated trail system. A regulation was implemented requiring this, and riders found off trail were fined. This action forced riders to stay only on trails that were properlylocated and maintained, and could sustain the impact. For the most part, riders observe this rule although there is still some evidence of user-made trails.202 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Wadzinski Management Actions to Protect Wilderness Experiences and the Resource Staffing Changes To help accomplish the above actions, personnel were reassigned from other jobs to the wilderness. A large ForestService campground outside the wilderness was changed from a Forest Service operation to a concession, thereby freeing up Forest Service staff for wilderness work. A staffmember was appointed to the position of wilderness ranger and worked full time in the wilderness. Other technicians were assigned to help as needed. Duties consisted of enforc-ing rules, performing trail maintenance, and simply being visible so the public knew that the agency cared enough about the area to be present. Forest Service law enforcementstaff also increased patrols of the area. Use of Work Animals A horse and mule augmented the staffing. In accordance with wilderness law, even the Forest Service as the manag- ing agency may not use modern equipment for maintenance.Therefore, it is beneficial to resort to older and more primi- tive means of assistance such as the use of animals. All trail work is accomplished using a plow and grader pulled by amule, and equipment and supplies are packed in using the animals. Although a common feature in Western States, this wilderness was believed to be the first to use animals east ofthe Mississippi River. The horse is used mainly for patrol and provides two major benefits. First, it is an efficient means of travel and has beenvery helpful in search and rescue and enforcement of rules. Second, a nd perhaps more significant, it provides credibility with the horse community. When the Forest Service is a horseowner just like the users, the users are more apt to accept the Forest Service opinion on issues involving horse use. Redesign of Horsecamp The Blackwell Horsecamp was redesigned to decrease capacity but improve the experience. Large, fenced exclosures were installed to decrease the available area, thus limitingthe number of campers that could crowd into the camp. This action is allowing vegetation and badly needed shade trees to return to the area. Aging restrooms were replaced andsmall corrals were built. Law enforcement patrols were stepped up, and regulations were implemented and en- forced. In one short year, this campground turned from aparty spot to a family campground. To help serve those users who did not like the changes at the Blackwell Horsecamp, the Forest Service worked with adjacent private horsecampowners to provide access to the nonwilderness trails on the Hoosier National Forest. These camps offered more ameni- ties such as water, electrical hookups, short loop trails, andso on, and were able to attract and provide for those users not seeking a wilderness experience. Reduction of Access Points The problem of too many access points and the problem with camping along the county road was eliminated bylimiting wilderness access points to five trailheads. All others were closed, and parking and camping was limitedalong the county road only to those designated sites. While ultimately successful, there was initially a jurisdictionalconflict with the county. County officials and some citizens opposed the restrictions based on their belief they had control over a right-of- way extending beyond the edge of theroad. The Forest Service prevailed, and the restrictions remained in place. This action greatly reduced the number of people coming to the area for a nonwilderness experience.The Forest Service publicized information on alternative areas nearby where visitors could still find a roadside camp- ing opportunity. Improve Wilderness Awareness The problem of lack of wilderness knowledge or ethics was addressed through an educational program and facilities. For the first few years, the forest entered into an agreement with Indiana University to provide a wilderness educationspecialist. This person roamed the wilderness providing a wilderness message, and also had an active program in local junior high schools. Selected classes participated in a five-part series of field trips and classroom exercises, and at the end held a wilderness summit where students developed their own solutions to ongoing management issues. Afterthat program was completed, the Forest Service kept up the effort through volunteers and seasonal employees. The forest also moved an old log cabin from a remote location to an entry into the wilderness. The cabin serves as a visitor contact station for wilderness users, and is staffed by volunteers who provide a message on wilderness values.Other educational efforts included the development of bulle-tin boards and wayside exhibits at each major trailhead. There, visitors are able to obtain a wilderness ethics mes- sage, as well as information about the area and rules. A highquality map available for a modest fee was developed that showed the trails and topographic details of the area, and also included a wilderness message. A free handout map wasalso developed with a similar theme, and the same information is also available on the Hoosier Forest website at: www.fs. fed. us/r9/hoosier Develop Cemetery Access Policy The cemetery access issue proved to be particularly chal- lenging, but a workable solution was found. The portion of the Deam Wilderness legislation that addressed cemetery access was vague, and required a good bit of legal analysis.At issue was the conflict between wilderness values (no roads or motorized equipment) and the rights of families to visit their loved ones. It was determined that the ForestService did indeed have an obligation to provide access. The problem, however, was that hundreds of thousands of dol- lars would be needed to bring the roads to these cemeteriesup to driveable standards. The forest was reluctant to get into the business of rebuilding and maintaining an extensive road system in a wilderness, and did not have the resourcesfor such an undertaking. A cemetery visitation policy was developed and has been successful thus far. The forest first cleared all the roads tocemeteries to make them at least minimally passable during dry times. If a visitor requests motorized access, the forestUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 203Wadzinski Management Actions to Protect Wilderness Experiences and the Resource first determines that the request is legitimate. The forest will then set up a time to have a Forest Service officialprovide transportation to the cemetery using an all terrain vehicle or four wheel drive vehicle. This access is dependent on the weather, however, because the roads are not passablewhen wet. Fortunately, there are only one or two requests a year, and people seem to be satisfied with this arrangement. Other Management Actions Additional management actions have also been imple- mented to deal with the other issues raised during the publicinvolvement process. A 10-person party limit is in effect to promote the concept of solitude. Hunting is still permitted, but target shooting is not allowed in order to promote aquieter environment. Camping is prohibited within 100 feet (30.5 m) of water sources. Horse users are required to purchase a daily permit for $3 or annual permit for $25, withthe revenues used for trail maintenance. What's Next? ___________________ Overall, the Deam Wilderness can be said to be vastly improved from its 1992 condition. The trails are in muchbetter condition, erosion has been greatly reduced, it is possible to find solitude, and users seem at least a little more aware that the wilderness is a special place that requiresspecial treatment. Progress has been made on the goal of reducing use and impacts. However, the area is still a long way from being a true wilderness. Unlike the pristine western wildernesses, thisarea has a lot of healing to do because of the many years of human influence. Nature will have to play a lot of \"catch up\" to be the dominant force as described in the WildernessAct of 1964. Fortunately, the recent management actions implemented by the Forest Service are providing a good start to the process. Not so fortunately, though, some condi- tions remain that will make the job inherently difficult and may never be resolve d. For example, the lack of public land,proximity to large populations, and the cemetery issues will likely be around for some time. Most visitors appear to be happy with the situation and few complaints are received. Some dissatisfaction remains, such as the few hikers who don't want horses allowed at all,and the few horse riders that want more trails. All new concerns and sugges tions are considered, although the Forest Service inten ds to continue to use the current guidance unless new information or changed conditions become apparent. In summary, Deam Wilderness managers attribute the accomplishments thus far to the big-picture approach toproblem solving, and focusing on a variety of issues simulta- neously. One significant component of this approach was the high degree of public involvement. The situation would nothave changed without public support, even if new rules and regulations were applied. Rather, because the users them- selves actually helped form some of the policy, the ForestService was able to make the sweeping changes that im- proved the Deam's wilderness character. Wilderness man- agers plan to continue this approach, keeping in mind theultimate goal of providing a quality wilderness experience while protecting the wilderness resource.

For many people Antarctica is a place of mystery, a place of historic exploration, discovery, and suffering.Antarctica is where huge icebergs sweep by populous penguin rookeries, and where majestic albatross sweep along on wind curling off the polar plateau. These preconceptions are perhaps whyAntarctic tourism has grown substantially over the past two de- cades, now numbering nearly 15,000 visitors each year. Antarctic wilderness is vast, its flora and fauna not diverse, but plentiful andunique. The questions are now whether (1) tourism and wilderness are compatible, (2) tourism can support and conserve the Antarctic wilderness, and (3) Antarctic wilderness can support current orincreased tourism. This paper is an attempt to reveal and combine some of the known information, but also acts as a call for further empirical research, including that proposed by the authors. Antarctica: Tourism______________ We cannot build a barrier around the Antarctic and keep tourists or the science community out. The Antarctic Treatygrants us all freedom of access to Antarctica. With that freedom comes a responsibility which we all share (Landau 2000: 15). Travel and tourism is the world's largest industry, trans- porting 528 million people and generating $322 billion inreceipts in 1994 alone (WTTC, WTO, EC 1995). By 2005, estimates are that tourism will have a gross output of $7.2 trillion, create 305 million jobs, and account for 11.4 percentof the world's Gross Domestic Product (WTTC, WTO, EC 1995). Global tourism is growing 23 percent faster than the world economy, and by the year 2010, 937 million touristsare expected to travel each year (Shackley 1996). Tourism in Antarctica has traditionally been defined to include: Commercial sea-borne operations, accessing coastal sites. Private yacht visits.Antarctica: Tourism, Wilderness, and \"Ambassadorship\" Patrick T. Maher Gary Steel Alison McIntosh Continental overflights. Flights to King George Island, Patriot Hills, or the South Pole for land-based operations. Special interest tourism (adventure, scientific, ecotourism, private expeditions). Visits by media, government dignitaries, and other politicians. Base personnel on their free time (Benson 2000). However, argument over such an inclusive definition can and does occur in previous research (Bauer 2001; Benson2000; Enzenbacher 1992; Hall 1992; WTO 1999). Antarctic tourism is not a recent phenomenon: 130,000 tourists have visited since 1965, but it is small in scalecompared to global tourism. While often portrayed as a new pressure on the southern polar region, it is quite possible that tourism activity has simply been overlooked until thehuge growth of the past two decades. Lars-Eric Lindblad began large-scale, ship-borne tourism in 1966, but tourists had made landings on Sub-Antarctic Islands as early as1882, and by 1933 most large Sub-Antarctic Islands sur-rounding the continent had been visited (Headland 1994). In the 1990/1991 season, 4,842 tourists visited Antarctica. This total of Antarctic visitors was less than two-thirds of allthe visitors to Maria Island, the least visited tourist destina- tion in Tasmania, Australia's smallest State (Herr 1996). In the 1999/2000 season, 14,762 tourists traveled to the ice(IAATO 2001). This figure includes all land-based tourists, small ships, yachts, and even large cruise vessels that do not land passengers. Looking into the future, a total of 26,000tourists are expected for 2005/2006. Visitors to Antarctica today are from a wide variety of nations, but are still typically first-world citizens. In 2000/2001, 47 percent were from the United States, 13 percent from Germany, 10 percent from the United Kingdom, 8 percent from Australia, 4 percent from Canada, 3 percentfrom Japan, 2 percent from the Netherlands, and the re- maining 13 percent from other countries or nationality unknown (IAATO 2001). Typically, these tourists are ter-tiary educated, well traveled, have high disposable incomes, and are looking for a unique nature-based experience (Kriwoken and Rootes 2000). Geographically, visits to thecontinent are highly concentrated, with less than 0.5 percent of the continental area visited; this is an area measuring only 56,000 km 2 (21,622 miles2), which is roughly the size of Sri Lanka (Cessford 1997). Overall, the sites are widely dispersed around the continent, but the Antarctic Peninsula takes 90 percent of the tourist activity (Cessford 1997). Aquick comparison underscores the bias towards peninsula visits. The \"most visited site\" in the peninsula region is Port Lockroy, which receives upward of 7,500 visits per year,USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 205Antarctica: Tourism, Wilderness, and \"Ambassadorship\" Maher, Steel, and McIntosh while the most visited site in the Ross Sea region is Terra Nova Bay, which is currently seen by approximately 800tourists per year (IAATO 2001). Governance of Antarctica falls under the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Regulation of tourism has fallen to the ATSbecause the relatively minor levels of tourism activity and numbers in Antarctica make it uninteresting to large tour- ism organizations and regulatory bodies; in turn, the ATSsimply sees tourists as \"other visitors\" (Herr 1996). In 1961, the ATS was a group of 12 signatory nations, but today consists of 43 nations representing two-thirds of the world'spopulation. Although the ATS has treated tourism in Ant- arctica as a minor inconvenience, if Antarctica is now in the \"tourism period,\" as White (1994) has speculated, the ATSmay have no choice but to face tourism issues head-on. This creates an interesting dilemma: Should tourist activity be managed, exploited, or completely shut out? One of the original signatories, New Zealand, is a staunch supporter of a pristine and conserved Antarctica (Dingwall 1992), although it allows tourist cruises to depart from itsports. Another original signatory, Chile, has pushed hard to exploit the destination for its economic means (Pinochet de la Barra 1992). For political compromise and interna-tional relations, there is an increasing need for agreement on tourism issues. As Mickleburgh (1988) states, \"If we cannot succeed in Antarctica we have little chance ofsucceeding elsewhere,\" and, as suggested by Landau (2000) above, responsibility regarding access to Antarctica must be shared. Antarctic tourism can be meaningfully divided into the categories of ship-borne, land-based, and airborne tourism (Hall and Johnston 1995). These will be discussed immedi-ately below. Ship-Borne Tourism In 1970, Lars-Eric Lindblad built the Lindblad Explorer , the first polar vessel constructed specifically for tourist purposes (Benson 2000). Having gone through various name and ownership changes, the M/S Explorer still remains a leader in Antarctic tourism (Headland 1994). Two other important vessels in Antarctic tourism history are the Bahia Paraiso and the Kapitan Khlebnikov . The Bahia Paraiso was an Argentine naval resupply vessel that additionally carried tourists between Ushuaia and King George Island in the South Shetland Islands chain, and the Kapitan Khlebnikov was the first vessel to circumnavigate Antarc- tica after 2 months at sea (Splettstoesser and others 1997). On January 28, 1989, the Bahia Paraiso became grounded in Arthur Harbor near the U.S. Palmer Station, was then abandoned, and eventually sunk (Headland 1994). The logistics of rescue and tourist management during thisincident led to a closer examination of Antarctic tourism and, in turn, likely spurred the formation of IAATO in 1991 (Splettstoesser 1999). The Kapitan Khlebnikov , affectionately referred to as the \"KK,\" continues to carry passengers to the ice to this day. The KK is an ex-Russian research vessel, and some growth of tourism in Antarctica in the early 1990s can be attributed to the commercial availability of such Russian ice-strength- ened research vessels and icebreakers after their conversionto tourism use (Cessford 1997). Given the interest shown bytourists on these cruise vessels, it is likely that circumnavi- gation of the continent or at least partial circumnavigationwill increase in popularity. Such cruises allow visitors to see both the historic sites of the Ross Sea Region and the wildlife of the Antarctic Peninsula (Mason and Legg 1999). With closer proximity and less time crossing the South- ern Ocean, ship-borne tours to the Antarctic Peninsula are much cheaper and friendlier, in terms of comfort, thanthose from New Zealand or Australia to the Ross Sea Region (Hall and Wouters 1995). The ease of transport, distance, and a milder marine climate have led scientists torefer to the peninsula as the \"Banana Belt\" (Campbell 1993), and with the buildup of tourism, the peninsula has also been dubbed the \"Antarctic Riviera\" (Hart 1988). FromUshuaia, the Antarctic Peninsula can be reached in as little as 48 hours, whereas from New Zealand and Australia to the Ross Sea Region, the voyage may take as long as 10 days(Suter 1991). Also possible in the peninsular region are private yacht tours, with 237 tourists electing to take up this option in the1999/2000 season (IAATO 2001). Yacht tours create a diffi- cult situation for IAATO and the ATS because their num- bers are increasing and the activity of yachts is much moredifficult to regulate and monitor (Splettstoesser 1999). Yacht tours will remain popular in Antarctica because of price and flexible schedules, but to many ATS signatories such toursare much more of an environmental threat than any other type of tourism (Splettstoesser 1999). Land-Based Tourism The building of a 1,300-m (4,265-ft) hard runway at the Chilean Tiente Rodolfo Marsh Station, on King George Island in 1979/1980, signaled the ability for land-based andairborne tourism to be able to operate in the Antarctic (Benson 2000). On January 8, 1982, a group of 40 tourists flew to Marsh Station to stay prior to boarding a cruise(IAATO 2001; Swithinbank 1992). From 1982 to 1992, Chile operated the \"Hotel Estrella Polar,\" a converted 80-bed, military barracks at Marsh Station, which served as a restspot for tourists between cruise ships and tourists' flights to King George Island (Headland 1994). Both the Chilean military and commercial operators offered flights in to the\"hotel,\" and from there excursions to nearby attractions were conducted. Following the cessation of Chile's polar hotel operations, Argentina began flying tourists to its baseon Seymour Island, but today all such accommodations have reverted back to official use. The claim of sovereignty to the Antarctic Peninsula by Chile and Argentina have often ledto bolstered tourism or population efforts by these two nations (Hall and Johnston 1995). In 1989, the Australian House of Representatives Stand- ing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts (HRSCERA) heard a unique land-based tourism proposal. \"Project Oasis\" was submitted by Helmut Rohde and Part-ners and was a detailed plan to operate a facility near Davis Station in the Vestfold Hills (HRSCERA 1989). The project was to contain an airport, visitor education and researchcenters, accommodation, hospital, search and rescue capa- bilities, and ATS administration facilities (HRSCERA 1989). Estimates indicated that up to 16,000 people per year coulduse the facilities, with 2 flights per week to and from206 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Maher, Steel, and McIntosh Antarctica: Tourism, Wilderness, and \"Ambassadorship\" Australia. The maximum number of people projected to be onsite at any time would be 588 (344 tourists, 70 research-ers, and 174 staff) (HRSCERA 1989). \"Project Oasis\" never proceeded past the proposal stage, but it gave an interesting, and to some, alarming insight into the possibilities andimplications of future land-based tourism in Antarctica. Today, land-based tourism in Antarctica centers around one particular company, Adventure Network International(ANI). ANI operates a tented summer camp at Patriot Hills in the Ellsworth Mountains, which can accommodate 50 people and takes advantage of a natural, blue ice runway toland large Hercules aircraft (Benson 2000). From Patriot Hills, ANI operates a service, via Twin Otter and Cessna, to Vinson Massif, the South Pole, and numerous glaciers andEmperor Penguin colonies (Benson 2000; Kriwoken and Rootes 2000). Polar Logistics, the logistical arm of ANI, also operates flights from Cape Town, South Africa, to a blue icerunway at Holtfjella (Blue Ice I) located 200 km (124 miles) inland of the Russian Novolazarevskaya base in Dronning (Queen) Maud Land (Benson 2000; Kriwoken and Rootes2000). In 1997/1998, ANI carried 131 passengers to Antarc- tica with eight Hercules flights being made between Punta Arenas and Patriot Hills (Swithinbank 1998). Two yearslater, 1999/2000, ANI only carried 139 of the total 14,762 tourists to Antarctica, and estimates for the 2000/2001 rises to just 200 tourists (IAATO 2001). Airborne Tourism Ship-borne and land-based tourism may include elements of airborne tourism. Air travel from ships is limited to thosevessels equipped with helicopters such as the KK, with these helicopters being used to increase the range of sites avail- able for tourism (Cessford 1997). ANI's airborne tourism isprimarily a means of transporting visitors and goods rather than offering sightseeing as found on overflights (Benson 2000). This category of tourist travel currently consists prima- rily of continental overflights from Australia, and in the past from New Zealand and Chile. Overflights began in1956 with LAN Chile flying over the South Shetland Is- lands (Stonehouse and Crosbie 1995). In 1957, a rare landing was made by a commercial flight at McMurdoStation. No regular flights were made over Antarctica until February 1977, when both Qantas and Air New Zealand began operations (Kriwoken and Rootes 2000; Swithinbank1992). Both companies flew extensively through 1979, with a total of 16 flights in 1977/1978, 17 in 1978/1979, and 7 in 1979/1980, for a total of 11,145 passengers and 43 flights(Reich 1980). The journey involved in these overflights was 11 hours in duration from New Zealand or Australia; the actual overflight of the continent lasted a total of 90minutes (Reich 1980). Overflights ceased dramatically on November 28, 1979, when Air New Zealand DC-10 flight TE901 crashed into Mt. Erebus on Ross Island, killing all257 passengers and crew aboard (MacFarlane 1991). Resuming in 1994/1995, overflights are now being orga- nized by Croydon Travel in Victoria, Australia, and departingaboard Qantas Boeing 747s from Melbourne, Sydney, or Adelaide. Such flights fly for 11 to 12 hours at a minimum altitude of 3,050 m (10,000 ft) above sea level, or 610 m (2,000ft) above the highest ground within 185 km (115 miles) of theaircraft's position (AAD 1997; Benson 2000). As well, aircraft must run their engines at one-third full power in order toreduce noise and pollution (AAD 1997). In the first five seasons since resuming operations, it has been estimated that over 13,000 passengers have taken part. From 1996 to1998,over 10,000 passengers flew over the continent from Australia (IAATO 2001). Beginning in 1998/1999, the Chilean airline, Avant, offered overflights of the peninsula region, and carriedapproximately 1,000 passengers in its maiden season. Antarctica: Wilderness ___________ Antarctica, as a wilderness area, covers 50 million km2 (19.3 million miles2), including the surrounding Southern Ocean (Kriwoken and Keage 1989). The continent alone is 14 million km2 (5.4 million miles2), which is roughly the size of the United States and Mexico combined (Cessford 1997). Ofthe entire continent, 98 percent is covered with ice that is an average of 2 km (1.2 miles) thick (Rubin 1996). With Antarctica's ice sheet holding 90 percent of the world's freshwater supply, not only is it majestic in size and beauty, but also extremely important with respect to the global environ- ment (Kriwoken and Rootes 2000). Antarctica has a harshclimate, exemplified by the fact that the minimum tempera- ture ever recorded (-89.6 C, or -129.28 F) occurred at Russia's Vostok Station (Rubin 1996). In addition to theharsh physical climate, Antarctica is notable for its unusual ecology. Consider these facts: From diatom (a one-celled organism), to the largest of all animals (the Blue Whale), there is only one step in thefood chain. If one leaf of one Amazonian Palm was counted for mosses, fungi, lichens, mites, and insects, there wouldbe more species on it than are found on the entire Antarctic Continent (Campbell 1993). What the Antarctic ecosystem lacks in terms of diversity, it makes up for in numbers. Chester (1993), quoting the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), states there are the following populations in Antarctica: 1 million pairs of breeding king penguins 2.5 million pairs of Adelie penguins 7.5 million pairs of chinstrap penguins 3.7 million pairs of rockhopper penguins (mainly in the Sub-Antarctic) 315,000 pairs of gentoo penguins 12 million pairs of macaroni penguins 200,000 pairs of emperor penguins Between 250,000 and 800,00 Weddell seals 200,000 Ross Seals 30 to 70 million crabeater seals 400,000 leopard seals 600,000 southern elephant seals 2 million Antarctic fur seals These numbers do not even consider the numerous popu- lations of whales, albatross, petrels, krill, or even mosses and grasses found in the Antarctic. In addition, Antarctica is a weather factory of winds and ocean currents, whichthrough many series of events may have driven speciation even in the distant tropics (Campbell 1993).USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 207Antarctica: Tourism, Wilderness, and \"Ambassadorship\" Maher, Steel, and McIntosh Politically and managerially, wilderness in Antarctica is unique among other continents. Antarctica is a neutralterritory with no military presence other than that used to support scientific research (Mason and Legg 1999). Al- though claims of national sovereignty have been made,these have been held in abeyance for several decades, and Antarctica is currently under the international regime of the ATS. The ATS governs Antarctica above all nationalclaims, laws, and conflicts, creating a unique wilderness management situation. As described by Davis (1992: 39), the Antarctic Treaty is today \"one of the most successfulinternational regimes of our time.\" In terms of manage- ment for the Antarctic wilderness, there are several spe- cific international agreements, aside from the ATS, whichcover additional avenues of concern for Antarctica. The ATS was established by the United Nations, following the International Geophysical Year (IGY 1957-1958). Setup to allow for free scientific discovery, the ATS now indi- rectly encompasses much more, including tourism legisla- tion and environmental protection. The Antarctic TreatySystem provides legal status to all land and resources of the entire Antarctic continent (Hall and Johnston 1995). As a management regime, the ATS allows Antarctica to be recog-nized as a shared resource for all humankind to promote peaceful and scientific purposes (Rubin 1996). In 1964, the ATS adopted the first major Antarctic conser- vation regime, the Agreed Measures for Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna. Under this regime, two types of special conservation areas were considered: Specially Pro-tected Areas (SPAs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Specially Protected Areas preserve both unique and representative examples of the natural ecological systems ofareas, which are of outstanding scientific interest. Sites ofSpecial Scientific Interest protect any kind of scientific investigation or set aside undisturbed reference areas for the needs of a particular science. These sites can only bedesignated where there is a demonstrable risk of harmful interference. These designations are relatively small in size and number, with little management planning and effectiveimplementation (Lucas 1995). Thus, successive additional designations and governance of Antarctic wilderness has been and is necessary. The Protocol on Environmental Protection (Madrid Proto- col) is an agreement by ATS nations that deals with the specifics of environmental management, and promotes Ant-arctica as a scientific vessel for global understanding. The Protocol sets regulations regarding activities, duration, im- pact, protection, and adverse effects and change for a num-ber of areas. Essentially, it enhances environmental stan- dards set out in the ATS. Originally drawn up in 1991, the agreement was not ratified by all Antarctic Treaty Consulta-tive Parties, until Russia signed in 1997 and Japan in 1998. Annex V of the Madrid Protocol sets out the types of values to be considered when deciding whether an area warrantsspecial protection. It also describes the process for preparing and submitting a draft management plan through the Com- mittee for Environment Protection (CEP) to the AntarcticTreaty Consultative Meetings. Annex V is expected to come into force by 2002, and thus areas in Antarctica will fallunder a new system of protected areas, designated ASPA and ASMA. Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) are intended to protect: Areas to be kept free of human impact for comparative purposes Representative examples of major ecosystems Places with important or unusual animal or plant communities Type localities or only known habitats of species Places of value for scientific research Places with outstanding landform attributes Areas of outstanding aesthetic and wilderness value Places of historic value Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest will be combined as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs). Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) provide a framework for managing activities so as to improve coordi- nation of different activities and minimize environmentalimpacts. They may include areas where activities pose risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental impacts. They may also include places of historical signifi-cance. Antarctic Specially Managed Area status is avail- able under Annex V to assist in the coordination of activi- ties and the minimization of environmental impacts forareas of greater activity, or areas where more than one operat or is active. Before the Protocol, international concern about fishing rights and catch sizes led to the 1980 Convention for theConservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), while possible mineral exploitation led to the 1988 Convention to Regulate Antarctic Mineral ResourceActivities (CRAMRA) (Benson 2000). The idea of a Worldpark became a significant Antarctic conservation issue between 1981 and 1984 at successive IUCN meetings with Nongov-ernmental Organization (NGO) support (Lucas 1995). The Worldpark designation would have provided overriding pro- tection of Antarctica, although its failure likely sparkedsome of the debate that led to the Madrid Protocol. Many nations who have signatory status in the ATS also have specific domestic laws to regulate their citizen's activi-ties in Antarctica. Regulations in the United States, for example, include aspects of environmental protection, but focuse more on issues such as theft, land purchase, andgeneral conservation regulation. Research in Antarctica has regulatory bodies such as SCAR and the Council of Managers of National AntarcticPrograms (COMNAP), while the tourism industry is self- regulated, mainly through the auspices of IAATO. These regulatory bodies generally cooperate to issue guidelines,such as those for tourist behavior jointly agreed upon by IAATO and the ATS, as well as guidelines for the imple- mentation of a framework for Antarctic Protected Areas(COMNAP and the ATS). While there is cooperation, there is also occasional conflict that leads to difficulties in en- forcement. These conflicts emphasize the impression thatinternational agreements or regulations regarding Antarc- tica lack \"teeth.\"208 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Maher, and McIntosh Antarctica: Tourism, Wilderness, and \"Ambassadorship\" Antarctica: \"Ambassadorship\" ____ The mighty sea and monstrous icebergs are playing their giant's games under the grey and lowering sky, caressing or fighting, and in the midst of these marvelous manifestationsof nature, which are not made for man, we feel that we are merely tolerated, although a kind of intimacy may be created between us and our magnificent hosts (Charcot 1978: 289). Tourists enjoy an Antarctic experience with views and awe much like Charcot's, but what values do they then placeon the continent? Is a bond formed between the tourist and the continent similar to the tolerance and intimacy Charcot expresses? With no scientific results from tourist visits,what possible benefits do they have for the ice? Unfortu- nately, very little rigorous research has been aimed at answering these questions. Tourism may help to preservethe character of Antarctic wilderness (Suter 1991), but tourists may also simply leave their mark on the environ- ment and never think of it again (Campbell 1993). \"Ambassadorship\" is a difficult term to define. It can quite easily be synonymous with advocacy, stewardship, and the like. Quite often, and in other geographic settings, it is usedinterchangeably with these terms, but in the Antarctic context, \"ambassadorship\" appears to be the term of choice. As stated by the Honorable Mark Burton (2000: 6), \"ambas-sadorship\" is the process of advocating the \"preservation of the continent [by] those who have been to the 'ICE' and so have a first hand experience of the values [being sought] toprotect.\" With no empirical research on the specific definition and actions associated with \"ambassadorship,\" it is necessary totry to synthesize other theories and ideologies from a num-ber of disciplines. \"Ambassadorship\" appears in the litera- ture and studies of many Antarctic writers and tors (Heritage Expeditions 1997; Kershaw 1998; Suter 1991;Thomas 1994). Tourist operations draw a connection be- tween visiting the continent and subsequent \"ambassador- ship.\" Heritage Expeditions (1997: 7), for example, suggeststhat tourism creates \"ambassadors\" by raising awareness...through sharing with them the unique natural history of Antarctica and theSub-Antarctic, allowing Expedition members to visit historic sites and discussing with them the conservation issues con- fronting the Antarctic Continent. Yet this may or may not be the case. Research simply has not been conducted that would support or disconfirm this view. To date, research on \"ambassadorship\" in Antarctica fo- cuses on IAATO and what the tour operators' association is doing to conserve and protect the Antarctic wilderness(Splettstoesser 2000). IAATO works hard to create conser- vation-focused guidelines and to educate the tourist public. Individual tourists and their \"ambassadorship\" are onlybriefly examined by Marsh (1991, 2000) and Bauer (2001). There is little doubt that people (operators, national pro- grams, tourists) want to keep Antarctica pristine, but com-bining the commercial nature of tourism and the wilderness values being sought to protect is difficult. With little to no research findings available, the debate over tourism and itsjustification and place in Antarctica goes around in circles. Science accuses tourism of disturbing the wilderness andvice versa, everything is focused on the negative impacts, but what of the positive, the benefits and theoretically the\"ambassadorship\"? In conservation, benefits, and sociological literature, research has been done on similar or synonymous ideas,but are the results adequate to explain \"ambassadorship\"? Worldwide and polar case studies indicate that a conserva- tion benefit may accrue to parks or protected areas viatourism (Boo 1990; Marsh 2000; WTO 1999). Boo (1990) explains that tourists become emotionally attached to an area and will thus contribute funds to protect it or improveits conservation status. Cessford (1995) generated research findings that suggest that among tourists visiting the remote islands of Little Barrier and Tiritiri Matangi, thereis conservation benefit. Cessford (1995) indicates that insight into a particular ideal or having a particular expe- rience does, in fact, aid in learning about conservation,change visitor opinion, and create a commitment to conser- vation. Marsh (1991) has shown initial research findings in this area regarding Antarctic tourists, but his sample wasrelatively small and mainly consisted of a single national- ity. In addition to Cessford's (1995) study, the work of Cessford and Dingwall (1996) suggests that satisfactionand positive experience create a personal value shift. Boo (1990) concludes that for conservation management to succeed, tourism must be a tool to educate, thus creatingreal benefits for a geographical location. Findings from general benefits research (Anderson and others 2000; Bruns and others 1994; Driver and Bruns 1999; Kelly and Brown1981; Manning 1999) support the above studies. In popular literature (Rowe 1990; Searle 2000), the idea that wilderness holds value for people, and that peoples'values are affected by experiencing wilderness, is common.Research studies into the connection between outdoor recre- ation and environmental attitudes has been done (Dunlap and Heffernan 1975; Theodori and others 1998; Van Liereand Noe 1981), but with little concrete results transferable to an Antarctic context. Conclusions____________________ The authors of this paper propose research aimed at understanding \"ambassadorship\" as a cycle, inclusive of tourist's anticipation, onsite experience and behavior, and benefits realized through recollection. Such research wouldrelate to the tourist's travel process and answer the follow- ing vital research questions: What are the Antarctic tourist's expectations prior to visiting Antarctica? What is the tourist's pre-existing world view regarding the environment and conservation? What is the tourist's experience while in Antarctica? How does the tourist behave in Antarctica? What is the tourist's world view following a visit to Antarctica? What are the perceived benefits the tourist has follow- ing their visit to Antarctica? Do these perceived benefits extend beyond the indi- vidual (in other words, conservation benefits)? Are the perceived benefits put into action?USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 209Antarctica: Tourism, Wilderness, and \"Ambassadorship\" Maher, Steel, and McIntosh References_____________________ Anderson, D.

Basic ecological research on the phenomena that exist in protected areasis important, as is applied research that will contribute to protection of these resources. Research on animals, plants, soil, ecological processes and their interactions, as well as threats to these entitiesare all needed. Using research on recreation ecology as an example, this paper describes how a foundation of knowledge was built and suggests important lessons that can be applied to development ofprotected area research and educational programs. In particular, it seems important (1) for researchers to be protected area researchers first and disciplinary specialists second, (2) for research to be cumu-lative and long term, (3) for research to be conducted and integrated across varied scales, and (4) to engage and integrate a broad range of disciplinary specialties. Protected areas are designated because they provide a wide array of benefits to society, including the benefit ofpreserving nature for its own sake. The goal of protectedarea management should be to maximize these benefits. This requires understanding the resources within protected areas, increasing societal benefits that accrue from theseresources, and protecting these resources from threats. Research, education, and management are all necessary. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how ecologicalresearch can best contribute to the education of protected area managers and the improved management of protected areas, drawing particularly from the perspective of experi-ence gained in the United States. I will begin broadly, describing the breadth of research that seems worthwhile, offering remarks about where progress has been substantialand where it has not. Then I will use examples from my personal experience, conducting recreation ecology research, to make more specific observations and recommendationsregarding development of the knowledge base for high qual- ity protected area educational and management programs.Basic Ecological Research in Protected Areas_________________ Traditionally, most of the research conducted in protected areas has involved basic studies of the biological phenomenafound in protected areas. In most of the National Parks in the United States, for example, there have been studies of individual animal species and of plant communities. AtYellowstone National Park, individual scientists have spent much of their career studying grizzly bear populations, bison, and vegetation patterns. This type of research isprobably most common because it is most consistent with the disciplinary organization and orientation of academia. Most students are trained within departments that em-phasize basic rather than applied research and single rather than multidisciplinary studies. This research has contributed significantly to the educa- tion of protected area managers, the management of pro- tected areas, and the benefits that accrue to society. It should be encouraged and continued, as there is much morethat needs to be learned about ecological phenomena inprotected areas. Beyond being receptive to such research, however, there may be little need for protected area manage- ment programs to promote such research. Scientists work-ing within traditional biological disciplines will continue to work in protected areas, when they are the best places to study certain phenomena. However, there may be more needto promote basic research that (1) is of a long-term nature, (2) is interdisciplinary in scope, and (3) is designed to make use of wilderness as a baseline or reference, for comparisonwith more manipulated and disturbed landscapes. All of these types of research are critical to realizing the values and benefits of protected areas, but none are common.Existing institutional structures and funding mechanisms tend to present formidable barriers to research of this type. Threats-Based Ecological Research in Wilderness___________________ Recently, substantial ecological research has focused on threats to the integrity of ecosystems in protected areas,direct and indirect effects of human activities both internal and external to protected areas. This research is critical to developing the knowledge base needed to truly protect landsdesignated for protection. Research is needed to understand a wide variety of threats to diverse protected area resources.Ecological Research and Educational Programs to Support Protected AreaManagement: Lessons From the United States Experience David N. Cole214 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Cole Ecological Research and Educational Programs to Support Protected Area Management... Significant threats to wilderness lands in the United States, for example, include recreation use, fire management, live-stock grazing, introduction and invasion of alien species, diversion and impoundment of water, emission of atmo- spheric pollutants, and management of adjacent lands (Coleand Landres 1996). Research conducted by specialists from a wide variety of disciplines needs to be applied to the development of thisknowledge base. Moreover, as is the case with basic re- search, there is particular need to design long-term studies that utilize interdisciplinary approaches. In the rest of thispaper, I will discuss how research related to one of these threats\u2014recreation use\u2014has developed, particularly in the United States. Based on this perspective, I will offer somerecommendations regarding how research can best contrib- ute to the effective education of protected area managers. Development of Knowledge in Recreation Ecology______________ The field of recreation ecology is primarily concerned with assessing the responses of ecological systems to recreationaluse and disturbance, usually for the purpose of understand- ing how to manage recreation within protected areas. Al- though recreation ecology research can be traced back atleast to the 1920s (for example, Meinecke 1928), it was in the 1960s and 1970s that interest in recreation ecology intensi- fied. Management agencies\u2014such as the Forest Service andNational Park Service in the United States\u2014recognized that increasing recreation use threatened the integrity of both their facilities, such as campgrounds, and the biophysi-cal resources of the areas they were to protect. Increasingly,they funded research projects that described recreation impacts and suggested means of mitigating those impacts. Initially, studies were short-term, descriptive case studies that provided a wealth of site- specific insight for the funding agency but that did little to develop general knowledge. In the mid-1970s, the first syntheses of recreation ecology werecompiled (for example, Liddle 1975; Speight 1973; Wall and Wright 1977). Not surprisingly, these syntheses were largely confined to description of the impacts of different types ofrecreation on different impact parameters. There was little rigorous documentation of how impacts were changing over time, and little understanding of how impacts relate tofactors that influence the magnitude of impacts. Conse- quently, little of this research was capable of developing general principles and strategies to guide management. This began to change in the late 1970s and 1980s with the development of long-term, cumulative recreation ecology research programs, first in the Forest Service and then inthe National Park Service. With these programs it was possible to develop long-term studies to identify trends over time, as well as to replicate studies in different places toassess the generalizability of results. Multiple methodolo- gies were applied, providing richer insights than those provided by single methodologies. For example, in theirstudy of campsites at Delaware Water Gap National Recre- ation Area, Marion and Cole (1996) assessed changes over a 5-year period on long-established campsites, recently openedcampsites, and recently closed campsites, as well as on plots subjected to experimental trampling.By the late 1980s, general principles of recreation ecology were emerging. In a synthesis paper, for example, I (Cole1987) postulated that the magnitude of impact was largely determined by amount of use, type of use, season of use, and environmental conditions, and provided empirical examplesof the effects of each of these influential variables. I devel- oped simplified models, in which it was possible to manipu- late variables one at a time, to show the general influence ofthese variables on amount of impact (Cole 1992). Subse- quently, Kuss (1986), Leung and Marion (1996), and Liddle (1991) have summarized information about how impactvaries with environmental conditions. Equally significant has been work that relates empirical research findings to general management strategies. Thefactors that influence magnitude of impact can each be modified by management so that impact is minimized. A handbook that summarizes the likely effectiveness of alter-native management strategies, based on empirical research has been developed (Cole and others 1987). In their recent synthesis of recreation ecology, Leung and Marion (2000)organized much research around these management strat- egies. The content of low-impact (Leave No Trace) educa- tional messages have also been based on the results ofempirical studies (Cole 1989). Experience with descriptive studies of impacts has been used to develop monitoring methods, most notably in the work of Marion (1991). Finally,recreation ecology has provided a foundation for developing indicators and standards for contemporary recreation plan- ning frameworks, such as Limits of Acceptable Change(Stankey and others 1985). Once a discipline matures to the point where general principles emerge and management applications of thoseprinciples have been explored, education becomes mucheasier and more effective, and transfer of information to managers is facilitated. Starting in the late 1980s, now that principles derived from recreation ecology research hadbeen postulated and interpreted within management con- texts, more generally useful recreation ecology textbooks were written (Hammitt and Cole 1987; Hendee and others1990; Liddle 1997). The availability of textbooks and also popular books on low impact education for the public (Hamp- ton and Cole 1995) further increase the effectiveness ofeducation. Important Findings of Recreation Ecology _______________________ To illustrate the linkage between recreation ecology re- search and management of protected areas, six of the most important general principles derived from recreation ecol-ogy are described below: 1. Many of the impacts of recreation are positive feedback loops. For example, trampling eliminates veg- etation cover, which in turn reduces inputs of organic matter into the soil and alters the microorganisms that livein the soil. Because soil organic matter and microorgan- isms are critical to the establishment and growth of vegeta- tion, vegetation may be extremely slow to recolonizedamaged recreation sites, even in the absence of further trampling. Managers must sever this positive feedbackUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 215Ecological Research and Educational Programs to Support Protected Area Management... Cole loop by artifi cially amending soils with the organic matter and microorganisms that vegetation needs to establish andgrow. 2. Impact is inevitable with repetitive use. Numer- ous studies have shown that even very low levels of repeti-tive use cause impact. Therefore, avoiding impact is not an option unless all recreation use is curtailed. This means that managers must decide on acceptable levels of impact andthen implement actions capable of keeping use to these levels\u2014the approach at the core of the Limits of Acceptable Change and related planning frameworks. 3. Impact occurs rapidly, while recovery occurs slowly. This principle underscores the importance of proac- tive management, since it is much easier to avoid impactthan to restore impacted sites. It also suggests that rela- tively pristine places should receive substantial manage- ment attention, in contrast to the common situation offocusing most resources in heavily used and impacted places. Finally, it indicates that rest-rotation of sites (periodically closing damaged sites, to allow recovery, before reopeningthem to use) is seldom likely to be effective. 4. In many situations, impact increases more as a result of new places being disturbed than from thedeterioration of places that have been disturbed for a long time. This principle also emphasizes the need to be attentive to relatively pristine places and to focus attentionon the spatial distribution of use. It suggests that periodic re- inventories of all impacted sites are often more important than monitoring change on a sample of established sites. 5. Magnitude of impact is a function of frequency of use, type and behavior of use, season of use, environ- mental conditions, and spatial distribution of use.Therefore, the primary management tools involve manipu-lation of these factors. 6. The relationship between amount of use and amount of impact is curvilinear (asymptotic). Where use is light, even small differences in amount of use can have profound effects on amount of impact. Conversely, where use is heavy, even substantial differences in amount of use havelittle effect on amount of impact. This principle has numer- ous management implications and is also fundamental to many Leave No Trace educational messages. It suggeststhat it is best to concentrate use and impact in popular places and to disperse use and impact in relatively pristine places. Recommendations Based on Lessons Learned________________ Over the past several decades, advances in the educa- tional and management utility of recreation ecology re-search have been made. The progress that has been made is largely a result of (1) researchers framing their issues in terms of protected area management rather than moretraditional issues of ecological research and (2) researchers being given the opportunity to conduct sustained research programs that are accumulative. Progress would have beeneven greater if (1) research spanned a broader array of scales and (2) more disciplinary specialists were involved. There fore, my recommendations for a protected area re- search program in support of education and management revolve around the following four points:1. Researchers should be protected area research- ers first, with their allegiance to an academic disci-pline of secondary importance. What is critical is that the questions being addressed through research are framed within the context of protected area management ratherthan those of an academic discipline. For example, many of the biologists who first studied the relationship between amount of use and amount of impact, found that magnitudeof impact was linearly related to the logarithm of amount of use (for example, Dale and Weaver 1974; Hylgaard and Liddle 1981). The primary goal of their research was todescribe the relationship between use and impact. Trained to present their results in as succinct and elegant a manner as possible, they showed that their data fit a log-linearrelationship\u2014providing the most parsimonious description of the relationship\u2014and they were done. In contrast, I first studied the relationship between amount of use and amount of impact\u2014not for its own sake, but to understand the relative effectiveness of concentrating ver- sus dispersing use (Cole 1982). In my work, I have alsoconsistently found that a log-linear relationship can be fitted to data relating use to impact. However, by describing the relationship as curvilinear or asymptotic, rather than log-linear, the management implications of the relationship are much more apparent. Research leads more directly to the development of principles and to management application. A protected area researcher is also more likely to work in an interdisciplinary fashion and to seek opportunities to work collaboratively with management. Many protected area is-sues require integration of both social and ecological science. In addition, research can often contribute most to manage- ment if there is an iterative relationship between the two.Clearly, scientists within traditional academic disciplines cancontribute to the knowledge base needed to manage protected areas. However, I think that progress would be greater if resources are allocated first to scientists whose self-identity ishighly associated with protected areas. 2. Researchers should be given the opportunity to do accumulative work. Often research funding sources are such that scientists must jump around from one short- term, site-specific, low-budget project to another. Along with the tendency of many scientists to be opportunistic and toenjoy dabbling in many different areas, much research does not accumulate into a well-established body of knowledge that can be generalized into principles or applied to signifi-cant management issues. The limitations of earlier research cannot be overcome unless scientists have the opportunity to refine their techniques in subsequent projects. Ideas gener-ated by earlier work are frequently lost when funding for additional work is not there. The projects undertaken tend to not be very ambitious or innovative. For example, the opportunity I have been afforded to pursue a career in recreation ecology has allowed me to conduct long-term studies and to identify long-term trends inthe conditions of protected areas. I have been able to work at multiple spatial scales and to use multiple methodologies as a means of triangulation. I have been able to replicate studiesin different environments to assess the generality of earlier findings and to gain insight into how to adapt monitoring methods to different situations. I have been able to study allthe various factors that influence amount of impact, including amount of use, type of use, and environmental conditions. All216 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Cole Ecological Research and Educational Programs to Support Protected Area Management... of these opportunities increase the ability to move from research results to overarching principles and managementapplication, making transfer of knowledge through education to managers much easier. 3. Research should be conducted at multiple scales. Most scientists have focused on mesoscale phenomena, those that are readily observed. They have tended to study indi- vidual animals and species, populations of plants and ani-mals, and communities. As a result, we have generally done a good job of describing the impacts that occur at the human scale. However, lack of research at other scales hampers ourability to restore damaged sites or to gain perspective on the extent to which recreation impacts impair the integrity of large protected areas. Relatively little work has been done at the microscale, looking at soil biota, for example, or at soil-plant interac- tions. Many protected area managers have closed damagedsites and are attempting to restore them. But the physical, chemical, and biotic properties of soils on these sites have been altered. Physical impacts\u2014such as soil compaction\u2014can be temporarily alleviated through scarification, but soils are prone to being compacted again in the absence of vegeta- tion and desirable soil biota. Vegetation can be planted ondamaged sites, but plant growth can be poor and mortality high if soils are compacted and lack desirable soil biota. Solving these problems is hampered by inadequate researchat microscales. Inadequate research at large spatial scales is equally problematic. Our current inability to develop general prin-ciples regarding recreation impacts on wildlife may largely result from this inadequacy. Hundreds of short-term, site- and species-specific studies of behavioral responses to recre-ational disturbance have been conducted. However, the lackof research at population or community scales makes it impossible to know how significant these impacts are. Simi- larly, the intense impacts on vegetation and soil caused byrecreation at the scale of the site may be insignificant when viewed at larger scales. 4. Researchers, with tools from a wide array of disciplines, need to contribute to protected area re- search. Resources to be protected include air, water, ani- mals, vegetation, soil, and rock, not to mention culturalresources and human experiences. These resources are threatened by a wide array of influences, of which recreation is just one. A much wider array of scientific expertise needsto be devoted to these issues than is currently the case. Within recreation, for example, the preponderance of re- searchers with botanical training means that our under-standing of impacts on vegetation is much greater than our understanding of impacts on soils, animals, or water. Conclusions____________________ Effective management of protected areas is dependent on managers obtaining adequate training from educational institutions, with both education and management grounded in a solid research program. Both basic andapplied research is needed. Protected area research in the United States has made some advances over the past few decades, but is still woefully inadequate for dealing withthe array of issues that confront protected area managers. It has been most successful where (1) researchers areprotected area researchers first and disciplinary special- ists second, (2) research has been accumulative and long-term, (3) research has been conducted and integrated across varied scales, and (4) a broad range of disciplinary specialties have been involved and integrated.

Gazetting of these special places is accom- panied by a social expectation that the values contained within them will be sustained by the administrative agency charged withtheir stewardship. In the United States, we have learned much about managing wilderness and other similar areas. This paper summarizes (1) elements of protected areas that make dissemina-tion and application of social science particularly difficult, (2) some of the learning about this application, and (3) potential strategies for initiating wilderness research in Southern Africa, based on the United States experience. Introduction ____________________ The special places that comprise our National Parks, wildernesses, and protected areas represent a profound symbolic commitment of society to protect the natural worldfrom the excesses of human activity. These places alsoprovide opportunities for people to engage in the critical recreational, learning, spiritual and inspirational experi- ences required for healthy humans and their communities.Gazetting of these special places is accompanied by a social expectation that the values contained within them will be sustained by the administrative agency charged with theirstewardship. Moreover, we have learned that simply designating bound- aries around these exceptional landscapes is, by itself, insuf-ficient to sustain the superlative values contained within them. Natural processes occurring outside of their bound- aries often influence wildernesses and protected areas. Thehuman activity\u2014recreation, management actions, and com- munities\u2014located within them also may pose significant threats to these values. The economic, administrative, andpolitical policies frequently developed elsewhere often im- pact these special places. Good stewardship compels that these activities and influences be addressed through re-search, education, and management, so they do not threaten the values for which the areas were originally established.From Scholarship to Stewardship: Opportunities and Challenges in WildernessResearch, Education, and Management Stephen F. McCool Wilderness stewardship requires a vigilant public to pro- vide funds and oversight, a management organization thatapplies its technical expertise to safeguard important values and benefits, a research program that develops both basic and applied knowledge, and a tertiary education systemthat disseminates such knowledge to both professional man- agers and members of the public. Ideally, these components operate in an integrated, or at least compatible, fashion toensure that these special places receive the competent atten- tion they deserve. The research needed to sustain the quali- ties of these special places encompasses both the biophysicaland social sciences. Stewardship is as much about the management organization, the visitor, and threats to wil- derness integrity as it is about the landscape and its bio-physical structure, composition, and function, and thus requires different types of knowledge. The social sciences\u2014economics, anthropology, political science, sociology, geography, and psychology\u2014have long been involved in research and de velopment in, about, and for wilderness in the United States (U.S.). These scientific traditions, in combination with research in the biophysicalsciences, have led to important advances in wilderness stew- ardsh ip. These advances are both conceptual, such as new insights into the symbolic significance of wilderness orinnovative ways of defining the benefits of natural environ- ments, and practical, such as the design of planning systems that integrate various disciplines and types of knowledge inplanning and management. Beginning in the 1960s, many U.S. universities had devel- oped 4-year programs in recreation resources management,and some offered focused study on wilderness and National Parks. In many cases, faculty in these programs often engaged in research on wilderness issues, frequently fundedby grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts supplied by Federal Government agencies. The mandate within the U.S. Wilderness Act of 1964, to provide \"outstanding oppor-tunities for solitude and a primitive and unconfined\" expe- rience, stimulated a great deal of research and debate over how to best manage recreational use of wilderness. Whilemany social scientists have broadened their research inter- ests beyond solitude and recreation over the last decade, this research experience, and its consequent impacts on highereducation, provide important lessons for other countries that have wilderness and protected areas and are developing research and education programs on this topic. I was asked to reflect on that experience while preparing this paper. As a social scientist who has participated in both research and higher education dealing with wilderness for35 years, I have had the opportunity to conduct a variety ofUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 219McCool From Scholarship to Stewardship: Opportunities and Challenges in Wilderness Research, Education, and Management research and to provide educational opportunities for some of today's wilderness managers. First, I will describe some ofthe particular elements of wilderness and protected areas that make development, dissemination, and application of knowledge especially challenging. These elements provide acontext within which managers manage and scientists re- search. Second, I will briefly describe some of the learning that has occurred in the pursuit of excellence in wildernessscholarship and stewardship. In the concluding section, I tread out onto thin ice, suggesting several strategies that newly initiated wilderness research programs may want toconsider to advance the effectiveness of their scientific effort and its relationship with not only broader society, but with higher education as well. These observations are necessarilyimpressionistic and based solely on my reflections as a wilderness scientist engaged in scholarship, education, and stewardship. Characteristics of Wilderness and Protected Areas That Make Development and Dissemination of Knowledge Challenging __________ Wilderness research and education occur within a poorly understood, unpredictable, and volatile political and social environment that influences what questions scientists ex-plore, the methodologies scientists employ, how results are interpreted, and the constraints and effectiveness of re- search applications. There are four particularly notableelements of this environment that need to be recognized inany research, education, and applications program. Wildernesses Are Embedded in a Dynamic Social and Biophysical Context We are all familiar with the complexities and volatility of social and political systems in an era of change, turbulence,and transformation. The notion of congressionally estab- lished wilderness in the United States emerged during an era of widespread social reform that marked the beginningof many political, economic, and social changes, and thus reflected changing social relationships with wild landscapes. Also important are significant global changes in climate thatwill likely lead to changes in biophysical conditions and processes in wilderness. The dynamic environments in which wilderness is embed- ded means that management goals often lack the agreement among stakeholders necessary to provide the consent re- quired for management organizations to find and organizeresources for stewardship. There is also frequent disagree- ment among scientists about cause-effect relationships. Such disagreements lead to uncertainty about future conditionsand contexts, creating anxiety at the least, and often paraly- sis in decisionmaking. Traditional, expert-driven, scientifically based planning processes used alone (that assume a single decisionmaker,operating in a closed setting, attempting to optimize attain- ment of a single goal, with unlimited time and informationavailable) are inadequate to deal with management chal- lenges typified by these settings (Forester 1989; Stankey and others 1999). These factors suggest that wildernessplanning must emphasize learning and adaptation to deal with uncertainty, and collaboration and consensus building to address conflict. Wilderness Ecosystems Are Loosely\u2014 Rather Than Tightly\u2014Coupled Within a wilderness area, cause-effect relationships are often typified by temporal and spatial discontinuities, and linkages frequently demonstrate a probabilistic rather thana deterministic character. In these situations, the system is termed \"loosely-coupled.\" Tightly coupled systems are those with linkages that are highly time dependent and invariantin terms of sequences of actions (Perrow 1999). They lack capacity to tolerate delays and are rigidly structured in terms of how objectives are achieved. Wilderness systemstend to be of the former type: there are a variety of means of achieving objectives, there are often temporal delays be- tween actions and consequences (such as, tourism promo-tion and increases in visitation), and sequences for actions are often unknown or make little difference in outcomes. In loosely coupled systems, relationships between causes and effects, for example, recreation-setting attributes and visitor experiences, are only probabilistic. That is, managers provide only the opportunity (through manipulation of set-tings) for visitors to experience certain outcomes; they do notdetermine what those outcomes will be. The delays and the second- and third-order effects make understanding system processes and implementing effective management actionsdifficult, simply because of the complex relationships exist- ing between causes and effects. Thus, loosely coupled systems are not only difficult to understand, but challenging to manage. Learning about them requires adaptive approaches; management will be treating actions as experiments to understand outcomes. Wilderness Ecosystems Tend to be Nonlinearly Dynamic Small events, floods, fires, or developments, often lead to large effects. For example, we understand that relatively small levels of recreation use can result in disproportionatelylarge biophysical and social consequences (Cole 1987). There may be thresholds beyond which significant consequences occur. This nonlinear characteristic requires managers toidentify potential thresholds a nd determine if exceeding them leads to irreversible effects. It requires that we con- sider both the resistance of systems to im pacts and their resilience in response to disturbance. It may require more conservative approaches to management actions that poten- tially lead to long-lasting effects. Understanding this char-acteristic is important in management, but it is also impor- tant for science to discover this relationship.220 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003McCool From Scholarship to Stewardship: Opportunities and Challenges in Wilderness Research, Education, and Management Combined Social-Biophysical Systems Are Characterized by Uncertainty Social-biophysical systems are not only complex, but be- cause we do not fully understand how they function, or the consequences of management interventions, decisionmaking is characterized by uncertainty. Uncertainty may be definedas not knowing all the effects that follow from decisions, nor the probability distribution of those we are aware of. Adap- tive, even experimental, approaches to management arecalled for in these situations. Monitoring of consequences is also an important component of management. The combined effect of these characteristics makes both the conduct of science and the consequential learning de- manding. The implications for both science and education are extraordinary, requiring a transformation in how issuesand challenges are framed, how science is conducted, and how the public and potential managers are educated. In these situations, collaborative, interactive approaches tomanagement and science may be effective. Such approaches involve a variety of stakeholders, different forms of knowl- edge, and potentially different scales of analysis. The focusof management in the dynamic environment characterizing today's wilderness may be learning. This means that hy- potheses are indeed tentative statements, evolving as welearn in response to new knowledge and changing models of how systems function. For example, our experience with the concept of carrying capacity suggests, after about threedecades of research, that the relationship between use level and biophysical impact is far more complex than assumed by this approach (Stankey and McCool 1984). By examining ourresearch findings through new lenses, we may discoveralternative and more useful approaches to managing visi- tors and their impacts. Learning is a process where there is an accumulation of knowledge, there is deliberation about the meaning of that knowledge, new insights are gained about the interactions between people and their environment, and we act upon thatknowledge. Because wilderness management is basically a \"messy\" problem, the mental models (Senge 1990) we use to organize and behave in the real world will not only have tochange, but must remain adaptive in response to social change and new knowledge. In summary, protected area management situations are rich in challenge, ripe for theexperimentation needed for learning, and fruitful locations to enhance our understanding of how people can interact with resources in a sustainable way. This learning occurs ata variety of scales, and the lessons from it may serve as a foundation for new research programs. Lessons Learned From Social Science Research in, About, and for Wilderness_____________________ The United States has been blessed with a relative abun- dance of scientific and technical expertise, managerial expe- rience, and a tertiary educational system that is well inte-grated. Currently, the Federal Government administers nearly 650 designated wilderness areas covering about 47million hectares (nearly 105 million acres) of land. This experience is only about 40 years in length, and thereforemay still be thought of as in a formative stage. However, the lessons learned in the United States experience may serve as a foundation for other countries struggling to protect wilder-ness values. The learning that has occurred involves both the content of research and the context within which man- agement, education, and research occurs. Content Lessons Knowledge About Wilderness Experiences, While Growing, Is Still Limited in Scope And Depth \u2014We have not discovered or understood the depth, quality, or richness of the recreational, inspirational, spiritual, or learn-ing experiences that occur within these special places. The power of wilderness to create these experiences is well known, at least anecdotally. For example, conservationpioneer John Muir (1911: 110) argued: Climb the mountains and get their good tidings, Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. Thewinds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves. As age comes on, one source of enjoyment after another is closed,but nature's sources never fail. While Muir and others like him have long provided rich, powerful, anecdotal, and emotional based descriptions of wilderness experiences, science has taken a number ofempirical, and largely quantitatively based, approaches to better understanding them (Borrie and Birzell 2001). These approaches have evolved over time. As one approach hasbeen found wanting, we have learned, other models andprocesses have been developed, applied, and evaluated. While science has dramatically increased our knowledge of the dimensionality of wilderness recreational experi- ences, the capacity of these places to inspire the human spirit, provide the tranquility and serenity needed to main- tain human health, lay a foundation for human progress,and educate about natural processes has generally not received the same level of attention. The anecdotal and emotional based metaphors long used by conservation writ-ers and naturalists do not necessarily match with the more abstract empiricist descriptions of the scientist\u2014at least the empirical findings are not as rich. More importantly, ourability to apply these findings in routine decisionmaking about wilderness and visitors has been hampered by the lack of articulate, yet salient, guidelines for incorporating thesevalues and benefits. Perhaps in our haste to protect the biophysical aspects of wilderness, we have adopted an em- pirically based research and management paradigm forpracticing stewardship that is not necessarily appropriate for wilderness experiences. While the results of some research approaches may be transferable from one wilderness to another, this has gener- ally not occurred in the United States. Each wilderness is often viewed as unique, implicitly requiring new studies ofbiophysical and social processes and expectations. As a result, management may not fully account for the funda- mental power and capacity of wild places to affect humanbeings in decisionmaking, leading not only to significant andUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 221McCool From Scholarship to Stewardship: Opportunities and Challenges in Wilderness Research, Education, and Management contentious conflicts but also to inadvertent marginaliza- tion of the power of wilderness in helping create not onlybetter people but also a better world. We Have Learned That Human Behavior in Pro- tected Areas Is Extremely Complex \u2014The constellation of motivations influencing choices to visit wilderness and other protected areas results in human behaviors that aredifficult to understand and appreciate. Such understanding is a necessary prerequisite to management of the people who visit wilderness, not only in terms of implementing actionsthat are effective, but also in sustaining opportunities that are valuable and beneficial to participants. Understanding what makes a visit to a wilderness a \"quality\" one has doggedscientists since the Wilderness Act was passed in 1964. While a considerable amount of this research has been focused on use density and perceptions of crowding, Man-ning and Lime (1999) argue that research is needed to identify other specific indicators of quality. As a result of learning that human behavior is complex and not necessarily predictable, there is a much greater appreciation for models and approaches that are not as reductionistic as the \"hypodermic needle\" approaches thatassumed that all that was needed to change peoples' behav- ior was a dose of appropriate information. Such approaches to management not only led to simplistic information cam-paigns but also have been largely ineffective (Cole and others 1997; McCool and Cole 1999; Vander Stoep and Roggenbuck 1996). We Have Learned That It Is Critical That the Objec- tives for Protected Areas Be Specifically and Explic-itly Stated \u2014Objectives are needed to set the management agenda and develop social consensus around our visions of the future. How would we know we have accomplished what we have set out to do without specific and explicit objectives?However, broadly and vaguely stated objectives continue to plague management of wilderness and protected areas. Such broadly written objectives (such as, \"protect the re-source,\" or \"provide a diversity of recreation opportunities\") serve as poor benchmarks against which to identify what outcomes specific wildernesses should provide, determinethe acceptability particular management actions, and mea- sure progress. Vaguely written objectives tend to hide dis- agreements that do not arise until different interpretationsoccur. Long ago, Shoemaker (1984) argu ed that objectives should have five characteristics: (1) specific; (2) output oriented;(3) quantifiable; (4) time bound; and (5) attainable. Unfortu- nately, many wilderness management objectives do not meet any of these criteria, leading to a situation wherealmost any management action can be judged successful regardless of the anticipated and unanticipated conse- quences that result. Of course, administrators may oppose objectives that meet these criteria because the specificity forces them to become accountable for their achievement. We Have Learned That the Producer and Consumer of a Recreational Experience Is the Same Individual \u2014 Recreationists seek certain values and benefits when theychoose a wilderness area to visit. The outcomes of these benefits are influenced by the social, managerial, and bio- physical conditions experienced during an engagement withinthe area, and by expectations developed prior to the visit. These propositions form the basis of such managementapproaches as (1) the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (Driver and others 1987), which seeks to provide diversity in setting attributes, and (2) normative appr oaches to wilder- ness quality (Manning and Lime 1999), which attempt to define what indicators of wilderness mana gers need to iden- tify. Both approaches implicitly recognize that managersprovide opportunities for certain outcomes, experiences, and levels of quality. But both also implicitly assume that these outcomes are produced and consumed by the individualrecreationist. In a sense then, wilderness and protected area managers provide a setting (\"warehouse\") consisting of a variety ofattributes (\"factors\") from which visitors create experiences (\"products\") of varying quality. Not all factors will be used by all visitors to create any given experience. However, somefactors, or attributes, such as use density, may be used more than others. Thus, we need to understand how visitors use setting attributes. Managers serve as important intermediaries in this pro- duction process, for it is they who provide the setting at- tributes, regulate access to them, monitor their condition,and respond accordingly. Such a critical role in the produc- tion process requires research to further identify the charac- ter and intensity of linkages between setting attributes andrecreational experiences. Context Lessons We Have Learned That It Is Important to Employ Time and Personnel Judiciously in Framing Wilder- ness Problems Appropriately \u2014The wicked and messy character of wilderness and protected area managementrequires that problem framing take on special significance. The dynamic and fluid character of wilderness management situations, as well as the crisis-driven nature of many issues,often leads to inadequate problem definition. As Bardwell (1991) observes, in these conditions more resources are needed to understand the problem. An example of inad-equate problem definition concerns defining use impact problems as that of exceeding a biophysical or social carrying capacity. Such a problem definition is an exceedingly reduc-tionistic way of conceiving how the multiple expectations of visitors, the presence of competing management objectives, and the complex relationships between use and impactinteract. As a result of defining use impact problems as exceeding an area's carrying capacity, we have engaged in an often fruitless endeavor of establishing such \"carryingcapacities\" for protected areas. Rather than focusing limited resources on determining the desired, appropriate, or ac- ceptable conditions required in organic legislation or asinterpreted by visitors and administrators, the search has often been for \"magic numbers\" reflecting an inherent capa- bility to support recreational use. We Have Learned That Protected Areas Occur Within the Context of Regions or Systems of Areas,and Management Actions in One Area Affect What Happens in Another \u2014Wildernesses and protected areas exist within the context of a system of areas (McCool 2001;McCool and Cole 2001): what happens in one area, in terms222 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003McCool From Scholarship to Stewardship: Opportunities and Challenges in Wilderness Research, Education, and Management of the condition of site attributes, management actions, and use characteristics, affects what happens in other areaswithin the region or system. For example, when a policy limiting recreational use is implemented in one area, visi- tors may be displaced to other areas. These other areas maythen experience use impact problems, and they may or may not have adequate managerial capacity to address these problems. Social science research has frequently focused on visitors to specific sites. While this research is often helpful in addressing site-specific questions, the lack of complemen-tary regional scale research inadvertently leads to homog- enization of opportunities over a region and eventually suboptimization of recreational experiences, because cur-rent site users are preferenced in such studies. Other users (visitors who are dissatisfied, people that prefer other types of settings, and future visitors) are generally not repre-sented in such studies. McCool and Cole (2001) argue that management of wilderness must consider both regional and local scales to avoid homogenization of experiences anddisplacement of problems. Cooperation and coordinated management have typified a number of transagency man- agement efforts, and such effort has led to more streamlinedadministration. Cooperation and coordination are neces- sary but not sufficient conditions for ensuring that a diver- sity of recreation opportunities exists at the regional level. We Have Learned That to Make Progress in Under- standing the Social Dynamics of Protected Areas, WeNeed Research That Is Cohesive and Integrative Over Time, Space, and Methodology \u2014We have begun to un- derstand how quickly and unpredictably things change.What visitors once felt was desirable, may now be onlyacceptable. What visitors now feel is unacceptable may in the future be desirable. The current dominant research paradigm is to conduct individual case studies of visitors tospecific areas at one point in time. Studies that examine visitors over time, or research that investigates populations and how they interact with wilderness over time, are scarce.In Watson's (1999) recent review of trends in wilderness visitors, he could cite only a few studies in which visitors to a specific wilderness had been repeatedly studied over time.In the majority of these studies, such visitors had only been sampled twice. In general, the period between sampling was lengthy. For example, Lucas (1985) studied visitors to theBob Marshall Wilderness in the State of Montana, but the period between sampling was 12 years. Such studies sample visitors to the areas at two, or rarely, three points in time, but such visitors are most likely different individuals. Thus, these studies are not really studies of trends in how specific visitors access, use, or feelabout a wilderness, but are more likely samples of different people at different periods of time. Thus, scientists are confronted with the plausible hypothesis that differencesfound are a result of sampling different visitors rather than changes in the visitor population. While one-shot case study designs are interesting, their results tend to reinforce the status quo. In the case of visitor studies, they tend to privilege current users over past and future users in decisionmaking. For example, studies ofvisitors to an area will generally not sample those who find current conditions unacceptable. Since these conditions areunacceptable, these individuals do not visit the site, and thus are not sampled. We Have Learned That While It Is Easy to Compart- mentalize Management Actions and the InstitutionsThat Implement Them, Stewardship Requires More Integration of Disciplines and Functions \u2014Compart- mentalization of functions is a common bureaucratic ap-proach to ensuring that routine tasks are dealt with compe- tently and efficiently. In wilderness and protected area management, we often segregate wilderness functional ar-eas (recreation, fire, wildlife management) into different organizational components, or separate planning from man- agement and management from science (Hof and Lime1997). While this approach to governmental management has some important benefits, it may result in duplication, inconsistent or even conflicting actions, or in gaps in ourknowledge and application. As a result, we may be surprised when management actions lead to unanticipated conse- quences, and find that the organization has limited capacityto respond. We have learned in this respect that agency environments and cultures influence how problems are defined, prioritiesset, and management is implemented. Often agency cul- tural norms are so much a part of what an agency does, they are difficult to identify from within. Values, such as profes-sionalism and empiricism of strongly held cultures, perme- ate decisions. Conclusions____________________ Probably most fundamental of the lessons learned is the importance of problem framing. How research questions andmanagement challenges are defined determine what solu- tions are identified. Often, this stage in the research process gets short shrift as scientists attempt to respond to manage-rial crises, publication timetables, and tenure decisions. Managers may define a problem in such a way that it is a symptom of a more fundamental, systemic level challenge.Research on the symptom may not lead to appropriate managerial reforms, or may lead to research results that are simply too abstract for definitive application. The particular social and political environment in which wilderness and protected area management occurs must be more explicitly recognized in research programs. This is nota call for the politicization of research. Rather, it is a recognition that these special places and the actors that shape and influence them are ultimately not only the clientsfor research and education, but they also reflect and symbol- ize the social values that influence management, research, and education priorities. Research, management, and edu-cation often take place in highly politicized environments, where the test of their utility is often how well they serve certain purposes that may not be directly relevant to wilder-ness management. This does not invalidate research. It only makes its design, conduct, and application more demanding and requires it to be responsive to social needs. Obviously,these factors vary from nation to nation. What research is conducted, how, and where it is applied are major questions confronting development of any newscience program. There has been a tendency in the UnitedUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 223McCool From Scholarship to Stewardship: Opportunities and Challenges in Wilderness Research, Education, and Management States for wilderness social science research, particularly in higher education, to be opportunistic rather than program-matic. Given the highly decentralized nature of U.S. higher education, wilderness, and protected area management, this is to be expected. While we have learned a great dealfrom wilderness research in the United States, one can only speculate how a more structured investment in research would have advanced the state of the art of both scientificscholarship and managerial stewardship. Of course, there must be opportunities to engage in research determined by a cohesive plan of action, as well as research that is respon-sive to unforeseen issues and challenges. Such goals can be achieved by following an approach that contains several strategies. I suggest these strategies as if Iwould have the opportunity to build a national wilderness research program in a setting where little such work had been conducted previously. These strategies represent noparticular agency philosophy or plan; they are my thoughts alone. They are designed to address the need to build a political constituency; develop ownership in research byscientists, wilderness stewards, and affected publics; pro- vide a financial footing; increase capacity; and ensure sa- liency and timeliness. Strategy 1: Build a Strategic Plan A strategic plan identifies a vision, mission, and way to the future. It would be designed to allocate research funding to problems and questions of national significance, as well as to those that confront individual managers. By involving vari-ous stakeholders\u2014scientists, managers, and interestedmembers of the public\u2014a cohesive plan of research can be developed in which the learning from various research projects build upon each other. Part of this process wouldconsist of meetings with stakeholders to not only generate issues, questions, and information needs, but also to build ownership in the research process. Part of the strategicplanning process would be \"situation assessments,\" formal- ized documents that synthesize existing literature with tentative propositions that direct individual research pro-grams and projects. Done with the input of the public, the outcome would be a set of problems framed to ensure social and managerial relevancy. From this process, a series ofresearch programs could be developed, each of which focuses on a question that is addressed over the long term, thus ensuring a cohesive science process. Strategy 2: Develop a Wilderness Research Center Staffed by a Small Complement of Scientists This strategy is designed to provide focus and identity for the wilderness research program, develop a centralizedsource (initially) for credible information, and stimulate research partnerships with university, governmental, and nongovernmental entities. The center, if appropriatelyfunded, would have funding to spread its efforts to relevant scientists, thus leveraging scarce research support. This process then involves broader amounts of scientific exper-tise and allows managers from different units to participatein research programs. By so doing, additional ownership in wilderness research is developed. In addition, the credibilityand relevancy of research is expanded. Strategy 3: Develop Teams of Scientists to Investigate Research Questions, andPartnerships to Apply and Evaluate Results Few questions and information needs are solely the do- main of a single discipline. Many problems require scientists from different disciplines to jointly frame questions, identifymethodologies, interpret findings, and apply results. Involv- ing science teams, again, increases the breadth of involve- ment and provides the foundation for better results. Such ateam orientation will also help build the capacity of the center to conduct research\u2014which initially may be problem- atic if the scientific expertise is not available. Partnerships can be developed in any number of ways, but one method that might be particularly useful is through the use of wilderness management and research demonstrationareas. In these situations, research is conducted, imple- mented, and evaluated in a public setting for a specific resource in order to encourage learning and adaptation.Such areas have only rarely been used in wilderness re- search in the United States, but where they have, knowledge and science has been advanced. Strategy 4: Ensure the Continuing Financial and Technical Capacity to Conduct Research and Apply Findings The abundant and attractive physical resources often existing within a country are often not matched by the availability of long-term funding to support research. Aresearch program\u2014versus individual questions\u2014implies a long-term commitment. One way of achieving this commit- ment is to build financial endowments from which theinterest can fund research. This method of financing insu- lates the research center from year-to-year differences in political philosophies. Building an endowment does requirea considerable financial commitment\u2014but through some innovative financing and a politically active constituency, it may be possible.

Descriptive at first, but increasingly sophisticated as theories andmethods evolved, science has been the underpinning of the protec- tion and sustainable management of Yosemite National Park and the Yosemite Wilderness. As visitor use increases, it will be criti-cally important that the wilderness resource and the wilderness experience be perpetuated unimpaired for future generations. This paper traces the role science has played in the history of the Park,in the current management of the Yosemite Wilderness, and the role it might have in the future. Introduction ____________________ Science has been instrumental in the management of Yosemite since before its designation as a National Park in1890. It has played a role in the various legislative acts that designated the area as a National Park, and subsequently as a unit of the National Wilderness Preservation System.That role intensified as back-country use increased in the1970s and wilderness was designated in Yosemite in 1984. Since then, the wilderness management system there has been adjusted and refined as research and managementmethods have evolved. This trend should continue into the future. Historical Perspective: Yosemite National Park and Yosemite Wilderness_____________________ Yosemite has come full circle from when it was managed by Native Americans for subsistence and shelter. It has passed through a period of legislation that established andadjusted the boundaries of the Park for visitor benefit and enjoyment, and finally to designation of a majority of the park as wilderness to preserve wilderness resources andvalues.Role of Science in Sustainable Management of Yosemite Wilderness Jan W. van Wagtendonk Native American Management Native Americans have been present in the Yosemite region for over 3,000 years. During this time they did more than inhabit the landscape, they also shaped its ecologicalrelationships (Anderson 1996). They tilled the soil for bulbs and corms, burned meadows for basketry materials, hunted for deer and other game, and gathered seeds and acorns. Allof these practices were based on an inherent scientific knowledge of ecology. The wilderness that faced the first European invaders was, in part, a landscape managed forthe needs of diversity and abundance (Anderson and Nabhan 1991). Early Park Legislation Early legislation relating to Yosemite includes: The1864 act that set aside Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove as a State Reservation. The 1890 act that established Yosemite National Park. The 1906 joint resolution that ceded the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove back to the FederalGovernment and changed the boundaries of the park. The 1916 act that established the National Park Service. Each of these acts was based, to a greater or lesser degree, on scientific information. Yosemite Valley Grant Act of 1864 \u2014The act that granted Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to the State of California was the first act by a national govern- ment to establish a park. Huth (1948) considered theYosemite Valley Grant Act as the birth of the \"National Park\" idea. The act specified that the purpose of the park was for public use, resort, and recreation, and that it shouldbe inalienable for all time. Although the legislation was not directly based on scientific studies, the impetus behind the act was to prevent destruction of the scenic and naturalvalues of the Valley and the Grove. Yosemite National Park Act of 1890 \u2014The nation's first preserve consciously designed to protect wilderness values was established in 1890, when the mountains above Yosemite Valley became a National Park (Nash 2001).John Muir received much of the credit for bringing about the establishment of Yosemite National Park. Although not considered scientific writing by today's standards,Muir (1890a,b) wrote eloquently about the treasures and features of the proposed park. These descriptions were based on Muir's detailed observations of natural phenom-ena of the area including meadows, rivers, mountains, and glaciers (fig. 1). Nowhere is his scientific expertise more evident than in the passages in which he describes the226 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003van Wagtendonk Role of Science in Sustainable Management of Yosemite Wilderness Figure 1\u2014The area above Yosemite Valley is a vast wilderness landscape of domes, mountains,glaciers, rivers, and waterfalls. value of protecting the wilderness above the Valley as an integrated harmonious unit rather than protection of an unsustainable fragment. Joint Resolution of 1906 \u2014Preceded by the cessation of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove by California to the Federal Government, the Joint Resolution of 1906accepted those lands as part of Yosemite National Park andadjusted the boundaries of the new park. The cessation was deemed necessary because development and commercial- ization were impacting scenic and natural values. Theboundary adjustments were based on a report by Chittenden (1904) and included deletions and additions, with a net result of a 30-percent reduction. He conducted a 2-weekstudy of the park and concluded that lands containing substantial private claims, mineral-bearing ores, or com- mercial timber should be excluded from the park and addedto the forest reserves. The addition included the remainder of the Tuolumne River drainage, making it possible to manage the entire watershed. National Park Service Organic Act of 1916 \u2014Fifty- two years after the Yosemite Grant Act, 44 years after theYellowstone National Park Act, and 26 years after the Yosemite National Park Act, the National Park Service was finally established. The new bureau had the responsibilityfor managing the National Parks to: Conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment ofthe same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations (Sellars 1997). Science was not specifically mentioned in the act and could not be inferred from the language in any of the sections(Sellars 1997).Wilderness Legislation Two acts were instrumental in designating wilderness in Yosemite: The Wilderness Act of 1964, which established the National Wilderness Preservation System. The California Wilderness Act of 1984, which specifi- cally designated the Yosemite Wilderness. Wilderness Act of 1964 \u2014Although the Wilderness Act originated out of dismay over trends affecting roadless areas on National Forests, it also was applied to lands of the National Park Service because of concerns about the erosionof roadless blocks within units of the National Park system (McCloskey 1994). The National Park Service was never an active proponent of the Wilderness Act (Sellars 1997). For theNational Park Service, opposition to the Wilderness Act centered on the question of discretion. The 1916 Organic Act gave no clear guidance on the question of how much parkwilderness should be protected. The scenic, natural, and cultural features were to be protected, while at the same time providing for their use and enjoyment. As administrativelyinterpreted, the Organic Act gave discretion to the Park Service to strike a balance between maintaining wilderness and providing facilities that were accessible by modern meansof transportation. The Wilderness Act changed that by speci- fying that wilderness zones in parks would have added protection from roads, commercial facilities, motorized ve-hicles, and mechanized equipment. The Act also specifically mentioned science as one of the purposes of wilderness. California Wilderness Act of 1984 \u2014Legislation to ex- tend wilderness was introduced in every Congress between 1974 and 1982. Not until the debate concerning the ad- equacy of Forest Service recommendations for wilderness inthe State was resolved in 1984, did the California Wilder- ness Act finally become law. The Act designated 646,700 acres (261,710 ha) of Yosemite Park as Wilderness and 3,500acres (1,416 ha) as potential wilderness additions. Congress directed the Park Service to produce maps and descriptions of the Wilderness area as soon as practicable after passageof the Act. This task was assigned to the Park's Science Office and completed with input from all staff associated with wilderness. A Geographic Information System (GIS)analysis of the boundary, based on 7.5-minute quadrangle maps, showed that there were 704,624 acres (285,151 ha) of Wilderness and 927 acres (375 ha) of potential wilderness inthe Congressionally designated Yosemite Wilderness, com- prising 94.2 and 0.1 percent of the park, respectively. Science in Support of Management of Yosemite Wilderness __________ During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the proposed wilderness areas of Yosemite experienced a dramatic in-crease in use (fig. 2). When a scientist was assigned to the park in 1972, work began immediately on a program to support management of the proposed wilderness. By thetime the California Wilderness Act passed in 1984, the USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 227Role of Science in Sustainable Management of Yosemite Wilderness van Wagtendonk results from this research had already been applied. Evolv- ing use patterns and new research techniques prompted a resurgence of research designed to refine and improve man-agement of the Yosemite Wilderness. Early Programs For many years, use figures were determined from volun- tary campfire permits from which subjective estimates of total use could be made. Implementation of a mandatorypermit system in 1972 for all overnight users alerted man-agers of the magnitude of wilderness use and its rate of increase. Within 1 week after the program was established in Yosemite that year, the scientist was assigned the task ofinspecting conditions in the backcountry and assessing use. From these initial observations, a plan was developed to investigate impacts, determine use limits, and design asystem for controlling use through permits. In addition, investigations into the role of fire in wilderness ecosystems were to be initiated. Visitor Impacts \u2014Holmes and others (1972) inventoried trails and campsites in the backcountry for human-causedimpacts and found hundreds of campsites around popular lakes, trampled vegetation in heavily used areas, and eroded and multiple trails throughout the proposed wilderness.Guided by results of the survey, Parmeter (1976) conducted studies of human impacts on vegetation, soil, water, and microclimates. Experiments were also conducted to quan-tify direct impacts from trampling and urine (Holmes 1979). These studies concluded that although impacts increased as use increased, the relationship between use and impactswas influenced by many other factors and that the determi- nation of acceptable impacts was a subjective decision. On the other hand, Keay and van Wagtendonk (1983) found a positive relationship between use levels and inci- dents with black bears and recommended that use be re- duced in areas of high conflict. Availability of food fromhuman sources, however, was believed to be the primary cause of the conflict. Hastings and Gilbert (1987) also stud- ied the interactions of bears and humans and offered aFigure 2\u2014Visitor use nights in the Yosemite Wilder- ness increased rapidly in the early 1970s and thendropped to about 50 percent of the peak level.250,000 200,000 150,000 100,000 50,000 0Use Nights Year196719701973197619791982198519881991199419972000partial solution; a bear-resistant food canister that could be carried by backpackers. Social impact studies were also conducted to determine the relationship between use levels and the wilderness experience. Lee (1977) and Absher and Lee (1981) inter-viewed visitors about their attitudes toward crowding, re- source impacts, and satisfaction. They also observed the same visitors in the backcountry and concluded that therewas no relationship between expressed attitudes and behav- ior. Enjoyment was affected more by human behavior and resource condition than by total number of people encoun-tered (Absher and Lee 1981). For example, visitors were willing to encounter more people if they were friendly than if they were not. Use Limits and Permits \u2014Since use had obviously ex- ceeded acceptable levels in some areas, interim use limitswere applied while the ecological and sociological studies were being conducted. In 1973, overnight capacities were set for travel zones within the proposed wilderness based on thearea of the zone, the number of miles of trails it contained, and its ecological fragility (van Wagtendonk 1986). The larger an area, the greater its ability to absorb use, andbecause trails disburse use, more trails allow additional visitors to be accommodated. Ecological fragility scores were used to reduce the limit of a zone based on its rarity,vulnerability, recuperability, and reparability. Zone use limits were implemented through permits that were issued to each backpacking party. If a proposed zonehad reached its capacity, the party was directed to camp in another location. Adjustments were made to the use limits based on data that showed that 8 percent of the parties didnot get permits and that, on average, trips were shortenedby one-half day (van Wagtendonk and Benedict 1980). The use limits were effective in shifting use from peak summer months and from heavily used travel zones without reduc-ing overall visitation (van Wagtendonk 1981). Based on 4 years of data collected from the permits that related zone to trailhead use, a trailhead quota system was imple-mented in 1977 (van Wagtendonk and Coho 1986). Trailhead quotas allow visitors the maximum amount of freedom and ensure that the wilderness resource and experience aremaintained. Refined Programs After the initial surge of research, management of the Yosemite Wilderness proceeded with only minor adjust- ments made each year based on observations and feedbackfrom wilderness rangers. By the mid-1980s, however, long- term monitoring of trail and campsite impacts indicated that conditions were changing and that efforts might benecessary to restore certain areas (Sydoriak 1989). Restora- tion programs were followed by additional monitoring of campsites and meadows that were being grazed by recre-ational packstock. New methods of sociological research also made it possible to integrate resource, social, and manage- rial components into carrying capacity decisions. Trail and Campsite Restoration \u2014As a result of moni- toring programs, campsite restoration programs were startedin 1987 at three subalpine lakes in the Yosemite Wilderness (Hadley and Moritsch 1988). Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003van Wagtendonk Role of Science in Sustainable Management of Yosemite Wilderness evaluated the effectiveness of the revegetation efforts at those lakes and found that transplanting locally collectednative plants contributed to vegetation recovery on some sites. The effects on species richness were clearer than those on species cover. Based on these results, the campsiterestoration was expanded to other areas of the wilderness. Trail restoration efforts were also underway. Severely eroded trails and trails with multiple ruts were prevalent in many heavily used areas. Figure 3 shows an area near Tuolumne Meadows as it appeared in 1973. Restoration experiments were begun that year by Palmer(1979) and were completed in 1988 (Alexander 1989). Figure 4 shows the area as it appeared in 2001. Eagan and others (2000) restored the natural hydrology and soils to asimilar 0.8-mile (1,300-m) section of abandoned trail that had two to six 11.8-inch (0.3-m) deep ruts. Fill material from nearby ephemeral drainages was used to bring theruts up to grade. Plants from locally collected seeds and transplanted sod from between the ruts were used to replant the trails. Both were equally effective, but thetransplants were less costly. These restoration projects showed that it is possible to restore areas that had not recovered naturally. Campsite and Grazing Monitoring \u2014The 1972 and 1986 surveys showed the value of repeated monitoring fordetecting changes. A third 10-year monitoring cycle was completed in 1999 using a subset of sites and measure- ments (Boyers and others 2000). The initial results indi-cate an overall improvement in conditions due to the restoration program, decreased use, and increased visitor education. While the number of moderately and heavilyimpacted sites decreased in comparison to the two previoussurveys, lightly impacted sites increased. Some of these sites are probably new, although many are restored sites that are still discernable. The monitoring program alsoalerted managers to the fact that off-trail use is increasing. Figure 3\u2014Multiple ruts in a trail near Tuolumne Meadows as it appeared just prior to restoration experiments in 1973.Figure 4\u2014The same area near Toulumne Mead- ows as it appeared in 2001 after restorationefforts were completed in1988.Although recreational livestock grazing impact surveys had been conducted in Yosemite in the 1930s through the 1960s, no systematic method of monitoring using standard measurements existed. Moore and others (2000) began astudy in 1994 to establish a relationship between grazing intensity and meadow response. They found a consistent negative relationship between utilization and productivity,and a variable response between utilization and species composition. These findings will be incorporated into a meadow monitoring plan for use by wilderness rangers. Carrying Capacity Decisionmaking \u2014As new socio- logical theories and tools became available, Yosemite man-agers decided to take a new look at carrying capacity issues. Echoing the results by Lee (1977), Manning (2001) found that visitors to Vernal Falls had an absolute tolerance forfour times as many people in the viewscape as their stated preference (fig. 5). Specifically, they wanted to integrate resource, social, and managerial considerations into theirdeliberations. Although conceptualized by van Wagtendonk (1979) as early as 1976, the managerial component of carrying capacity had not been incorporated into previousmodels. Newman and others (2001) are currently conduct- ing a study that includes all three indicators of quality into a decisionmaking framework. The first phase of the projectwill inventory and map selected setting attributes of wil- derness experiences using a Geographic Information Sys- tem. Workshops with managers and scientists were held todefine indicators and standard of quality. The second phase will ask visitors to evaluate tradeoffs among compet- ing setting attributes or indicators using surveys andconjoint analysis. This research will enable managers toweigh the effects of use limits based not only on the effect visitors will have on resources and each other, but also on the effect the management action might have on either.

Future Direction ________________ Science has been an integral part of the management of the Yosemite Wilderness since before its designation. Thisrole is expected to continue as increasing population pres- sures increase demand for recreational experiences. Dra- matic growth has occurred in communities within 2 hoursdriving time of Yosemite National Park, much of it in populations that have not been traditional users of wilder- ness. Science will be called upon to help managers meet thechallenges of a shifting cultural base. The appropriatenessof new technologies will have to be investigated from legal, environmental, and sociological points of view. Perhaps most importantly, the changing role of wilderness in societywill need exploring. Callicott (2000) suggests that wilder- ness areas might best be considered biodiversity reserves where species that do not coexist well with humans could beprotected. Such designations would necessitate a science program of both basic and applied research in the field of conservation biology. If, on the other hand, the vision forwilderness is more in line with Foreman's (2000) view that wilderness should continue to provide opportunities for primitive recreation while at the same time protectingbiodiversity, the science program will have to also include a sociological component. Either way, science will play an essential role in the management of wilderness. References_____________________ Absher, J. D.; Lee, R. G. 1981.

Principle Component Analysis and Multiple Regression were used to develop environmental characteristic models that arestraight forward to interpret. High elevation and high latitude were key to the distribution of wilderness quality, conifers, and cycads. The most important determinants of species richness,however, were found to be low latitude and \"good\" climate (high precipitation and constant warm temperature). Understanding factors that influence presence of wilderness today will help planfor its protection on a large scale. Appreciating how the same factors affect the distribution of species richness will aid in conser- vation of biodiversity, particularly that in protected wilderness requiring pristine habitat. Introduction ____________________ Wilderness inventories and assessments frequently use biophysical naturalness as an indicator of wilderness qual- ity. For example, the Australian National Wilderness Inven- tory (ANWI) describes biophysical naturalness as \"the de-gree to which the natural environment is free from biophysical disturbance caused by the influence of modern technological society\" (Lesslie and Maslen 1995). However, it is proposedthat biophysical naturalness is not an adequate measure of biodiversity and, consequently, can underestimate the true biological value of environments with wilderness qualities.Furthermore, within the study of wilderness science it is contended that there is insufficient regard for biodiversity issues although it is assumed that wilderness offers uniquebiological protection opportunities. It is argued that more accurate measures of biological values should be incorpo- rated into wilderness assessments in addition to the ap-Investigating the Environmental Cause of Global Wilderness and Species RichnessDistributions Crewenna Dymond Steve CarverOliver Phillips praisal of biophysical alteration. It is proposed that a reason for the lack of incorporation is the paucity of available biodiversity information, particularly at a large scale. Fur-thermore, this may be exacerbated by a lack of understand- ing of the contribution of wilderness environments to biodi- versity and how certain environments are conducive to thepersistence of wilderness. A research analysis strategy has been designed to deter- mine the extent to which environmental factors explainvariation in the distribution of species richness and wilder- ness at the global scale. Also, this research explores whether species richness makes a contribution to the distribution ofwilderness and vice versa. This research began with analy- sis at the global scal e, and so it was considered important to determine precisely which environmental factors might beresponsible for the distributions of wilderness and species richness. There has been considerable research into the causes of species richness variation, for example, latitudi-nal gradients (Rohde 1992) and water energy dynamics(O'Brien 1998), and although theories are still being de- bated there is at least some consensus about the main causes in this variation. In the field of wilderness science we havenot attempted to explain the patterns of wilderness distribu- tion, although we may be able to intuitively describe the characteristics of the environments in which it currentlyexists. It is important to distinguish between factors respon- sible solely for wilderness, such as remoteness, and those related to species richness, such as soil type, and those thatmay serve to affect both. These key variables have been isolated and are shown in the conceptual model (fig. 1). Figure 1\u2014Conceptual model: factors identified as important for the distribution of biodiversity and wilderness.Soil BIODIVERSITY WILDERNESSSolar energy Remoteness NaturalnessAspect Latitude Altitude Evapotranspiration Precipitation Temperature Population232 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Dymond, Carver, and Philips Investigating the Environmental Cause of Global Wilderness and Species Richness Distributions Global Hypotheses ______________ Using the global biodiversity and wilderness conceptual interaction model (fig. 1) as a starting point, it was possible to define a series of research hypotheses and these are summarized in table 1. These hypotheses have determinedthe content of this analysis. However, because it is not clear which factors are most important, the process has been inductive, allowing the data to shape the conclusions with-out being confined by the hypotheses. Method for Global Analysis _______ Table 2 lists the data used for the global analysis. While nationwide or even continental databases of species rich-ness doubtless exist, for example the North American Breeding Bird Survey, such information is rarely available from a single source for the whole World. The national datafrom Groombridge (1994) proved to be the most appropri- ate source of global species richness data for this analysis.We considered it important to use taxa that have been relatively well inventoried, and for this reason mammalsand birds were chosen. However, some indicator of phytodiversity needed to be incorporated because case stud- ies at smaller scales included tree and plant diversity. As aresult, the flowering plant (angiosperms) and conifer and cycad (seed-bearing plants) groups were also incorporated from the Groombridge (1994) data set. The use of national species richness data necessitates some consideration of the relationship between species and area. While there are grounds for presuming a linear rela-tionship between species richness and area on a logarithmic scale (MacArthur and Wilson 1969), there has also been considerable debate about nonlinear relationships betweenthe richness of individual groups and area (for example, Rahbek 1997). In this work, however, the log 10 of species richness has been regressed against the log 10 of country area, as an independent variable. Thus, we can quantify the extent that species richness depends on area for these groups. The residual values produced from the regressionmodels indicate how far removed from expected each of the Table 1\u2014The basic research hypotheses generated from the conceptual model.

In further analyses, these residual values have been used as the measure of speciesrichness. Only one global wilderness database has been published (McCloskey and Spalding 1989) (fig. 2). However, its classi-fication criteria are very strict, as clearly seen by the absence of wilderness in the contiguous 48 States of the United States, although there are many protected wilderness areasthere. Individual nations that protect wilderness define allocation criteria that are applicable to their country. For example, some countries enable cultural issues to be incor-porated. This process means that there is a wide difference between the real nature of wilderness in each of the coun- tries that have protected it. A worldwide wilderness assess-ment, such as McCloskey and Spalding (1989), is useful because it applies the same criteria ubiquitously. However, this inventory does not facilitate the identification of areaswith wilderness qualities that are less remote from human features. To be able to identify wildernesslike environments in every country, a \"sliding scale\" of wilderness, or decreas-ing levels of wilderness quality, need to be determined. In conjunction with the World Conservation Monitoring Cen- tre (now UNEP-WCMC), Lesslie (personal communication)has replicated the procedures for the Australian National Wilderness Inventory (Lesslie and Maslen 1995) using the Digital Chart of the World as the major data source (DefenseMapping Agency 1992). The product is a grid-based continu- ous wilderness database that defines 22 wilderness quality classes and can be seen in figure 3. Unlike the ANWI, theglobal wilderness grid was not constructed using biophysical naturalness as one of its four criteria, as there is a lack of global data of this type. Data for each of the environmental factors are available from grid-based maps, commonly at a resolution of 0.5decimal degrees (dd) or 30-minute interval. The species richness data are only available nationally, which meansanalysis must occur at this scale. To compensate, a series of summary data have been compiled for each climatic and geographical factor in order to account for the wide variationin conditions experienced within the countries. The sum- mary statistics of mean, minimum, maximum, and range were calculated for each variable. For the population data,density and rural population density were calculated using the Global Land Cover Characterization (USGS and others 2000) and rural to urban population proportion data (UnitedNations Population Division 1998). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to each of the groups of summary variables to reduce the totalnumber of variables to be tested. For example, mean, range, maximum, and minimum elevation data were reduced to a single axis or factor. This new axis accounts for the variationfound within the four summary statistics. In this way, the variation is integral to the analysis and not unnecessarily oversimplified. Because the climatic variables of tempera-ture, precipitation, and evapotranspiration (actual and po- tential evapotranspiration and water deficit) are closely related, we decided that they should all be entered into aPCA model to derive one axis that summarizes all of these variables. In this way, the assumption of linear regression that the predictor variables are independent is upheld. Thenew axes from the PCA were used in a series of backward stepwise multiple regression models to investigate the con- tribution of each environmental factor (independent) onspecies richness and wilderness (dependent factors). This facilitates the analysis of whether species richness directly affects wilderness and vice versa. Furthermore, the regres-sion coefficients (B) from the models indicate by how muchand in what direction (positive or negative) the independent factor is influential. Figure 2\u2014Reconnaissance inventory of the amount of wilderness remaining in the world (McCloskey and Spalding 1989). Each wilderness polygon must be 400,000 ha (1 million acres) in size and at least 6 km from features such as roads or other development (reprinted with permission of AMBIO, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences). 234 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Dymond, Carver, and Philips Investigating the Environmental Cause of Global Wilderness and Species Richness Distributions Results of Global Analysis________ Results From Analysis With all Climate Variables Combined Table 3 summarizes the results of the regression models by showing the dependent variable, the predictor variables remaining after the final step of the model, and the adjustedR 2, which indicates how much variation is explained by the predictor variables. The results indicate that climate is important for the distributions of mammalian, avian, and angiosperm species richness. Latitude is identified as apredictor for the pattern of mammalian, avian, and seed- bearing plant species richness. We could argue that climate and latitude are the most important determinants of speciesrichness, as they are identified most frequently in these models. The results indicate that the models are much better at predicting the causes of mammalian and avian speciesrichness (variation explained is 42.0 percent and 36.2 per- cent, respectively) than of phytodiversity (flowering plants, and co nifers and cycads, 16.7 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively). This may be due to the quality of the data used for these groups, as both the mammal and bird groups are proportionately better inventoried than the other twogroups. The normal probability plot of the residuals from the angiosperm regression revealed that this group does notshare a linear relationship with area, as assumed. Without this relationship with area, the regression procedure will not be able to explain this group well. Conifers (seed- bearers),unlike the other groups, have a particular geographic distri- bution, with species richness being higher at low latitudes and very few of their form found in the tropics. For cycadrichness the reverse is true, but there are few species in this subgroup. The group is therefore biased toward temperate locations, and again the procedure used here is not good atdealing with this pattern.For wilderness, an interesting trend in the determinants emerges through this analysis. At high levels of wildernessquality, both from the McCloskey and Spalding inventory (1989) and Lesslie's continuum (2000), a combination of climate, elevation, and population are significant predic-tors. For categories 1 and 2, latitude is also identified as an important determinant. Consultation of maps of the various wilderness quality classifications indicates that Lesslie'scategories 1 and 2 are higher in wilderness quality thanMcCloskey and Spalding's polygon wilderness. The maps also reveal that quality category 3 most closely approxi- mates the polygon inventory. At this level, latitude ceases tobecome important, and predictors of the Lesslie continuum once again match the McCloskey and Spalding predictors. Climate, elevation, and population continue to drive thedistribution of the quality categories of 7 and 11. At cat- egory 15, the explanatory power of the model peaks at 37.9 percent, and latitude replaces climate as a predictor vari-able. For the lowest quality wilderness (17-21), elevation is the only predictor that significantly shapes the distribu- tion, indicating that this also determines the nature andextent of human activity that is the basis for this evalua- tion of wilderness. Results From Analysis With Climate Variables Included Independently The use of a single-climate axis does not facilitate the identification of the individual facets of climate included in the research hypotheses. In addition to the first model run, the results of which are shown in table 3, a second run of theregression models was carried out where each of the climate variables were entered separately. Instead of combining temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration into onePCA axis, each of these factors, consisting of their respective summary variables, were inputted into their own PCA runFigure 3\u2014Global grid-based wilderness continuum at a resolution of 0.5 decimal degree (30 minute) (Lesslie 2000, personal communication).

To test whether wilderness quality can actually explain any of the variation in the distribution of species richness and vice versa, each must be incorporated as independentvariables into the regression process. To do this, the models where climate is represented by one independent axis were rerun with the addition of species richness in the dependentwilderness models and wilderness in the dependent species richness models. The results indicate that high quality wilderness (category 3) does explain a small percentage ofthe variation in species richness of the mammal, flowering plant, and conifer and cycad groups, respectively. An addi- tional 5.9 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.5 percent of the varia-tion is explained. We might expect an environmental state, like wilderness, to influence the patterns of species richness in the same waythat temperature makes a contribution. However, it is difficult to be sure of any contribution of species richness to wilderness. It is perhaps only through the analysis of differ-ent groups of species that this might become meaningful. However, the results indicate that for high levels of wilder- ness quality, mammalian and angiosperm species richness,in particular, do explain some of the variation in the propor- tion of wilderness at these qualities. For example, mamma- lian richness adds 10.9 percent to the success of the model topredict the variation in the distribution of wilderness qual- ity category 2. The situation is reversed when the conifer and cycad group is used as an independent predictor of wilder-ness because it only adds to the explanatory success ofmodels of low wilderness quality. Here, it contributes a further 17.6 percent to the success of the wilderness quality 17 category. Discussion_____________________ The results reveal that different factors are responsible for the distribution of each of the species groups, and some groups are better explained than others. For wildernessquality there is also a fluctuation in the ability of the models to explain the distributions. As quality changes, so do the factors that are considered contributory. The second run ofmodels, where climate variables are entered individually, reveal that only certain aspects of climate contribute to the explanatory power of the models. It is hard to ascertainwhich of the hypotheses set at the beginning of the research are appropriate without considering the direction of the relationships between the predictor and dependent vari-ables. Included in tables 3 and 4 are an indication of whether each of the predictor variables contribute positively or nega- tively to the distributions. The models show that latitude negatively contributes to the distribution of mammalian and avian species richness; low latitude is important for these groups. Latitude does notseem to be important for angiosperm richness, whereas \"good\" climate, and in particular high precipitation, is im- portant. The model revealed that temperature negativelycontributed to angiosperm richness, which is unexpected, but the B coefficient was very low (B = 0.0062). Climate wasalso important for mammals and birds, and high precipita- tion was confirmed as important. The pattern is reversed forthe conifer and cycad group; latitude positively contributes to richness, high elevation, high precipitation, and low temperatures. At high levels of wilderness quality (categories 1 and 2), high elevation, high latitude, low precipitation, and low population all contribute to variation. By definition, wilder-ness is devoid of human features and, therefore, of resident population, so it is to be expected that low population is important in the models. As wilderness quality decreases,high elevation and low precipitation continue to be impor- tant contributors to the distributions. For models with climate variables entered together, the lowest wildernessquality categories (17-21) are only explained by elevation. We can conclude that mammalian, avian, and angiosperm richness prefer low latitudes, whereas high wilderness qual-ity is associated with high latitudes. Altitude was not found to affect the patterns of species richness for these three groups but was an important predictor variable for all of thewilderness categories. Evapotranspiration (actual and po- tential axis) was not found to be influential to the variation in species richness groups but was repeatedly recognized asimportant for wilderness. Further interpretation is needed here to elucidate the real meaning of the PCA axis that summarizes this complex interaction. High temperaturewas found to influence patterns of angiosperm richness but not mammalian or avian richness. In general, temperature was not found to affect the distribution of wilderness. Incontrast to the other species richness groups, the seed- bearing plants (conifers and cycads) were positively influ- enced by latitude and elevation and prefer low tempera-tures, indicating an affiliation for poor climate. It is possible,therefore, that optimal conditions for this group are charac- teristics akin to those for high wilderness quality. Different environmental characteristics appear to shape the distribution of wilderness and the species richness of the groups investigated. At the onset, it was hypothesized that approximately opposing characteristics were responsible forpatterns of wilderness and species richness, and it has been shown that to some extent this is true. It has also been found that wilderness environments contribute in a small way tothe variation in species richness for some groups. Counter- intuitively, species richness also plays a part in the distribu- tion of wilderness, but we suggest that this may be morecorrelation than causation. The fluctuation in environmen- tal conditions preferred by the different taxa examined is to be expected and illustrates how important the use of morethan one group is to this investigation. National species richness data has constrained this work, and it is expected that should grid-based biodiversity information become available, it will enhance the accuracy of research of this kind. A grid-based wilderness continu um has been useful in improving the quality of global wilderness distribution data. Further Research _______________ The next step in this research is to identify factors that influence the relationships between species richness and wilderness quality at smaller scales. Access to the 1998,United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service,USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 237Dymond, Carver, and Philips Investigating the Environmental Cause of Global Wilderness and Species Richness Distributions Southeast Alaska Inventory, has facilitated analysis of the effect of distance from human features on species richnesson Prince of Wales Island, Tongass National Forest. More indepth field data have been collected to investigate the impact of recreation trails, as a common wilderness impact,on species richness.

His family's weekend home, \"the Shack,\" provides the narrative backdrop for describing Leopold's perceptions of wilderness. This paper traces the evolution of Leopold'swilderness concepts through natural history, contemporary history, and cultural history. It also describes his influence on conservation jurisdiction and the globalization of wilderness concepts. By examining both the natural history of the Shack vicinity and the pivotal historic periods Leopold lived in and stemmed from, many of his insights into conservation can be better understood. Two factorsstick out that affected his attitudes the most: Leopold came from a culturally rich European-American background (Flader 1994), and was tremendously influenced by his journeys. Illuminating the largercontexts of Leopold backgrounds, it becomes evident that the history of the conservation movement in America cannot be told without looking beyond the nation's geographical and cultural borders. As I will show in my paper, quite a few of the motives behind wilderness conservation developed in Europe as a part of the Romantic Movement. Along with the mass immigration from Eu-rope, many of these motives were exported to the United States where they matured and became \"America's best idea\" (L\u00f6tsch 2001). Aldo Leopold was one of the leading figures to carry this ideainto effect by way of wildlife management, restoration ecology, and wilderness conservation. Method ________________________ I traveled to the Aldo Leopold Memorial Reserve (LMR) many times between 1989 to 1999 and also visited the Shack and the University of Wisconsin Arboretum. Myinitial reason for visiting involved the publication of the German translation of A Sand County Almanac . As I researched some of the foundations of this book I becameinterested in the history of conservation. Subsequently, Leopold, his quotes, insights, and teachings funneled into my growing awareness of the interconnectedness of his-tory, culture, and ecology. This became the subject of numerous articles of mine between 1989 and 2001. As a staff editor and freelance writer for the magazines Natur and Natur & Kosmos , I often report on the development and practical consequences of various concepts of wilderness inThe Shack Revisited: Aldo Leopold's Perceptions of Wilderness From a Historic,Legal, and International Perspective Till M. Meyer Germany and abroad. In this paper, I am also summarizing many of those details and correlations that I found through my journalistic investigations. Introduction ____________________ \"If there are cracks in time, Aldo Leopold fell through one,\" a book reviewer wrote in the journal American Forests (Kaufman 1991). Indeed, Leopold began his journey throughtime in the historic realm of the \"Wild West\" (fig. 1). Then, strongly influenced by conservation politics and attitudes of the 1930s and 1940s in America and Europe, he proceededto leave his imprint by creating the conceptual foundations of wildlife management and restoration eco logy. Aldo Leopold's most challenging visions were the ideas that environmental degradation and local loss of species do not necessarily present a one-way street, and that wilderness and civilization need not antagonize each other. The major tools tochange the course\u2014wilderness conservation, restoration ecol- ogy, and wildlife management\u2014were pioneered by him. Figure 1\u2014Leopold poses in full cowboy regalia, in Springerville, Arizona, age 22. He arrived here by stagecoach on July 18, 1909, bringing his notion of the West as a wild wonderland, as wellas a set of acute senses, a restless curiosity, and an ample young ego (Meine 1988) (photo cour- tesy of the Aldo Leopold Foundation archives). USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 239The Shack Revisited: Aldo Leopold's Perceptions... Meyer Whereas wildlife management is a widely practiced art and science in many countries today, restoration ecology is not. Leopold's perhaps most influential achievements came after his untimely death in 1948. His classic, A Sand County Almanac , was first published in 1949. This book had considerable influence on conservation, environmen- tal awareness, and institutional policies during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Finally, with the turn of the millennium,Leopold evolved into a leadership figure of postmodern resource management, not only in the United States but in many other countries as well. For instance, Germany's firstInternational Master of Science Program in Sustainable Resource Management opened as recently as October 2001, at the Technical University of Munich. The course work includes wildlife management and restoration ecology. The program owes its existence partly to the initiative of United States-educated wildlife biologist and Leopold scholar,Wolf gang Schr\u00f6der (2001, personal communication). This new program presents but one example of the long-lasting transatlantic traffic of conservation ideas. Natural History _________________ \"Wilderness is a resource which can shrink but never grow,\" wrote Leopold (1949: 199) in A Sand County Almanac . Al- though this remark is widely cited by many wildernessenthusiasts, it should be noted that later in life, Leopold did everything in his power to invalidate this axiom. By spear- heading the art and science of environmental restoration, heattempted no less than to prove that environmental destruc- tion could be reversed and, consequently, lost wilderness could be rehabilitated. The Shack and the land on which it stood had belonged to a bootlegger, who, according to Leopold (1949: viii), \"hated the farm, skinned it of residual fertility.... We try to rebuild with shovel and axe what we are losing elsewhere.\" This andthe following sentence summarize what later would become the central thesis of ecological restoration: \"The time has come for science to busy itself with the earth itself. The firststep is to reconstruct a sample of what we had to start with\" (in Flader and Callicott 1991: 211). To initiate these pro- cesses of healing the land, Leopold suggested that it wouldbe necessary to retain representative samples of intact ecosystems as a sample of normality. Leopold acknowledged the ecological-scientific value of wilderness as places ofreverence for ecological restoration and that one could not study the physiology of Montana in the Amazon, as each biotic province needs its own wilderness for comparison ofused land to unused land. Today, the concept of \"place of reference\" is a backbone to modern restoration ecology, as it presents a genetic resource base for restocking, a place togain understanding of ecological processes, and a measuring rod for restoration success. In 1935, Leopold purchased 80 acres (32 ha) of derelict farmland on the Wisconsin River. This land included the burned remnants of a farm building and an old chicken coop, which later would become \"the Shack\" (fig. 2). Thesame year he began to work as director of the University of Wisconsin Arboretum. In this position, he strove for a reconstruction of the original Wisconsin rather than acollection of imported trees (Meine and Knight 1999). Bothprojects, the farm restoration and the University Arbore- tum (fig. 3), marked the beginning and signal moment of the conservation movement and the first systematic at-tempt to reassemble disturbed ecosystems (Jordan 1990; Jordan and others 1987). With the purchase by Leopold began a new attitude toward the land, whereby landownersstarted to reverse the process of land deterioration and to build it back to something like presettlement condition. Leopold would hardly recognize his farm today. It is a diverse landscape with woodland, oak savanna, prairie, andwetland, managed as the 1,400-acre (566.5-ha) Aldo Leopold Memorial Reserve (LMR). Following is a partial list of plants that can currently be seen on the LMR. They were notrecorded by Leopold, who kept meticulous notes, so they were probably not there during his occupancy: Indian paint brush ( Castilleja Leopold in front of the Shack, 1942, showing the added bunk wing (photo by A. Carl Leopold). Figure 3 \u2014Charles Bradley, Nina's husband, examines prairie plants raised to supply seeds forrestoration (photo by Till Meyer). 240 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Meyer and mammals that can be seen more frequently within the boundaries of the LMR are: canadensis ) (Ross and Ross 1998). Such successes in conservation and restoration ecology can be easily attributed to Aldo Leopold and his ecological insights and foresights. They also represent the results of the continuing efforts of his children, especially his daughterNina (fig. 4) and her family and friends, as well as many members and affiliates of the Aldo Leopold Foundation. I want to reflect throughout most parts of this paper on someof the historical and cultural (nonecological) roots of these conservation successes. Sometimes I find myself musing about the possibility that the wild irises, indian paint-brushes, and cranes found at the LMR might represent more than what we had thought up to now. Acts of divine cre- ation\u2014yes, very likely. Examples of the great Americannatural and national heritage\u2014yes, for sure. Increasingly however, I feel that they also may owe their existence to the rich cultural heritage that America shares with the \"OldCountry.\" Aldo Leopold probably would have had some sympathy with the interdisciplinary approach which I'm about to takeon the following pages. During his trip to Germany in 1935 (fig. 5), at a quiet moment in his hotel in Berlin, he jotted down the following words under the heading of \"Wilderness\"(Meine 1988: 359): One of the anomalies of modern ecology is that it is the creation of two groups each of which seems barely aware of the existence of the other. The one studies the human community almost as if it were a separate entity, and callsits findings sociology, economics, and history, the other studies the plant and animal community, [and] comfortably relegates the hodge-podge of politics to 'the liberal arts.' Theinevitable fusion of these two lines of thought will, perhaps, constitute the outstanding advance of the present century. Contemporary and Cultural Figure 4\u2014Nina in her backyard prairie garden (photo by Till Meyer).Figure 5\u2014Leopold in Berlin, 1935, where he visited the renowned School of Forestry in Tharandt nearDresden (photo courtesy of the Aldo Leopold Foun- dation archives). History ________________________ The year 1935 was a busy one for Aldo Leopold. He helped to organize the Wilderness Society, worked as the Director of the Wisconsin Arboretum, and traveled to Germany formore than 3 months (Meine 1988). As the Leopolds reno- vated the chicken coop and created a weekend home, they called it \"the elums,\" then \"Jagdschloss\" (hunting chalet),and finally \"the Shack\" The outhouse was referred to as \"the parthenon.\" These humorous namegivings not only illustrate the gay family atmosphere of the Leopoldsbut also show that they were (and still are) a culturally sensitive bunch, open to influences from the Old Country. \"This sand farm in Wisconsin,\" Leopold (1949: ix) wrote in A Sand County Almanac , was \"worn out and then aban- doned by our bigger-and-better society.\" These words are a concise, almost poetic comment on the roaring twenties, towhich he also referred to as being heedless and arrogant. USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 241The Shack Revisited: Aldo Leopold's Perceptions... Meyer Ecoculturally, this period was characterized by the first assault on land by mechanized agriculture. In the UnitedStates, the Dust Bowl, and to some degree the Great Depres- sion, can be considered historic consequences of the atti- tudes and practices that Leopold criticized. After his trip to Germany in 1935, Leopold noted that one of the most insistent impressions received from traveling in Germany was the lack of wilderness in the landscape(Flader and Callicott 1991). Meine writes, \"This realization haunted Leopold and strengthened his determination to avoid the same fate in America\" (Flader and Callicott 1991:226). Leopold wrote, I hope that we may begin to realize a truth already written bold and clear on the German landscape: that success in mostover-artificialized land uses is bought at the expense of the public interest (Flader and Callicott 1991: 228). In A Sand County Almanac, he referred to his German experience: Ability to see the cultural value of wilderness boils down, in the last analysis, to a question of intellectual humility. Theshallow-minded modern who has lost his rootage in the land assumes that he has already discovered what is important; it is such who prate of empires, political or economic, that willlast a thousand years (Leopold 1949: 200). And: In human history, we have learned (I hope) that the conqueror role is eventually self-defeating. Why? Because itis implicit in such a role that the conqueror knows, ex cathe- dra, just what makes the community clock tick, and just what and who is valuable, and what and who is worthless incommunity life. It always turns out that he knows neither, and this is why his conquests eventually defeat themselves (Leopold 1949: 204). Leopold wrote these sentences shortly after WWII, thus not only remarking on the cultural roots of ecological degrada- tion but also on the attitudes of the political leaders of NaziGermany. Meine even suggests, however subtly, that the prevalent political attitudes in Germany of 1935 furnished a strongmetaphor to Leopold's own political and ecological attitudes: For him, a further 'lesson in naturalism' was the ties that bind together our communities\u2014human and natural\u2014areoften poorly recognized, understood, or appreciated, and that they are severed at our own risk. Turned around, that meant that when we conserve our communities, we conserve our-selves as well. It is a lesson we still struggle to heed (Meine 1994: 9). Leopold's sensitivity regarding the cultural arrogance of man vis-a-vis the land emerged neither in Wisconsin nor in Germany, but while he was in New Mexico and Arizona, where he began his career as a forester in 1909. Leopold'sconcern about soil erosion developed while he was in the Southwest and later found focus in Wisconsin. He returned to the United States determined to avoid the overly artificialmanagement of land and wildlife that so profoundly un- settled him in Germany (Flader and Callicott 1991). Appar- ently, Leopold applied to one region that which he hadlearned from another. Even though he romanticized the American Wild West to a degree early in his career, he also criticized the ignoranceof this era that led to unwise land use. He did this at a timewhen conservation was practically unheard of in America, and when the Wild West's classical heroes, the cowboys, theloggers, the forty-niners, the hunters, and the trappers, were mystified in many parts of North America and Europe. That these characters of the Wild West more often than notacted as agents of environmental destruction had escaped most Wild West aficionados. In fact, large-scale mining, grazing, hunting, and logging at the turn of the century hadalready left many a mark on the land. Sadly, Leopold (1949: 148-149) wrote: Man always kills the things he loves, and so we the pioneers have killed our wilderness. Some say, we had to. Be that as it may. I'm glad I shall never be young without wild country tobe young in. It can be safely said that Leopold's wilderness attitudes were also a result of the historic periods that occurred decades before his lifetime. When he graduated from Yale in1909, National Parks such as Yellowstone (1872), Yosemite (1890), Mount Rainier (1899), Crater Lake (1902), and Wind Cave (1903) had already been established. Conservationwas \"in the air,\" and legal protection of wild nature was supported by a considerable part of American society. Dur- ing the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909), forinstance, more than 312,500 miles 2 (809,371 km2) of Na- tional Forests, National Monuments, National Parks, and wildlife refuges were proclaimed as public domain. Rooseveltalso appointed several prominent commissions, through which he shaped a coherent national conservation policy (Meine 1988). From abroad, these conservation successeswere seen with envy. In 1913, James Bryce, Historian and British Ambassador to the United States, called National Parks, \"America's best idea\" (L\u00f6tsch 2001). Much of the motivating force behind \"America's greatest idea\" came from inside America, from the rapid exploitation of American landscapes and resources by European settlers in the 1800s, as well as the rise of industry and the automo-bile culture in the late 1910s and 1920s (Meine 2001, personal communication). Leopold (Flader and Callicott 1991: 131) wrote, Do not forget that the good roads mania, and all forms of unthinking boosterism that go with it, constitute a steam- roller the like of which has seldom been seen in the history of mankind...and unless the wilderness idea represents themandate of an organized fighting and voting body of far- seeing Americans, the steamroller will win. \"America's greatest idea,\" however, also had distinct for- eign components to it. On the following pages, I want to talk mostly about some of the motivating forces for the Wilder- ness Movement that came from outside America. The story of the American Conservation Movement would only be half told if it were examined just by looking within the bound- aries of the United States. The picture becomes more com-plete when the evolution of conservation in America is also regarded as the outcome of a transatlantic mixed bag of ideas, historical forces, and cultural frictions. Leopold's ancestors came to the United States from Ger- many between 1834 and 1848 (Meine 1988). Historically, these journeys were a part of a greater immigration patternfrom Europe; between 1820 and 1929, 32,129,908 Europe- ans immigrated to the United States, 5,881,032 of these were of German nationality. They, in fact, comprised the242 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Meyer The Shack (Helbich 1985; Wittke 1939). Sauk County, Wisconsin, which now harbors the LMR, had aparticularly high immigration rate from Germany. By 1890, over 60 percent of the population of this County were German born (Zeitlin 1977). It should be noted here thatLeopold's ancestors first settled in Iowa. The reasons behind this immigration were manifold. Dur- ing the late 18 th and early 19th century, immigrants often left to escape political suppression and economic injustice\u2014 societal obstructions, such as virtually impenetrable class distinctions, paralyzed thoughts, speech, and movement.Even at the end of the 19 th century, Germany still consisted of a loose conglomeration of several dozen distinct territories ranging from free cities and dwarf duchies to giant statessuch as Prussia. There were plenty of Kings, Dukes, Earls, and Lord Mayors to impose restrictions. Pastimes such as hunting, fishing, or even walking leisurely in the woodsoften were highly punishable as trespassing acts of tradi- tional feudal rights. These humiliations and deprivations of physical and intellectual freedom in the Old Country re-sulted in the establishment of a great many \"free thinking societies\" in the \"New Country,\" which were often associated with the Turnverein (gymnastic societies). Its objective wasto stress physical and social improvement (Wittke 1939; Zeitlin 1977). It would be misleading to think that 19 th and early 20th century nature lovers in Europe were kept from enjoying nature altogether. Some more advanced cultural centers had begun to build metropolitan parks such as the \"EnglishGarden\" in Munich, which was completed around 1816. These English Landscape Gardens were especially designed for the enjoyment of all the people and not just the old guard,thus marking the societal changeover of the period (Freyberg2000). Janson (1977) writes that the English Landscape Gardens were carefully planned to look unplanned, with winding path, irregular spaced clumps of trees, and littlelakes and rivers instead of symmetrical basins and canals. They were designed to seem as unbounded, and full of surprise and variety, as nature itself. In many ways, EnglishLandscape Gardens anticipated the aesthetic and demo- cratic appeal of what would later become part of wilderness conservation and restoration ecology in America. It should also be noted that English Landscape Gardens increasingly became regarded as a sort of aesthetic antidote to the \"over-artificialized\" landscapes. Leopold acknowledged: And this calls to mind what is perhaps the first element in the German deficit: their former passion for unnecessary outdoor geometry... Most German forests, for example, though laid out over a hundred years ago, would do credit to anycubist.... I also saw many a creek and rivulet laid out as a dead snake, and with masonry banks to boot. I'm depressed by such indignities, and I have black misgivings over the swarm ofnew bureaus now out to improve the American countryside (Flader and Callicott 1991: 227-228). The passion for unnecessary outdoor geometry is very much a part of German forestry tradition. Lowood (Harrison 1992: 123) states: The German forest became an archetype for imposing on disorderly nature the neatly arranged constructs of science. Witness the forest Cotta chose as an example of his new science:over the decades, his plan transformed a r agged patchwork into a neat chessboard. Practical goals had encour aged mathematicalutilitarianism, which seemed, in turn, to promote geometric perfection as the outward sign of the well managed forest; in turn, the rationally ordered arrangement of trees offered new possibilities for controlling nature. Heinrich Cotta (1763-1844), parenthetically, was a forest scientist and founder of the School of Forestry in Tharandtnear Dresden, which Leopold had visited in 1935. \"Mathematical utilitarianism\" and the \"rationally ordered\" naturally presented pet peeves for many romantics of thesame period in which Cotta lived. This dualism comes out very well in the lamentations of the poet Caroline von G\u00fcnderode (1780-1806). In her poem Former Times, New Times, she writes: A rough and narrow path that crossed the earth,/overseen by mountains and the gleaming skies above,/A gorge on itsside was hell,/and many a path would deviate into abyss and into heaven.//All this has changed now,/The skies have fallen,/ the gorge is filled up, and covered with reason.//The highs offaith have been demolished./Purpose is walking on the flat- tened earth,/And it is measuring the universe in feet and yards (Wolf 1981: 10). Even though aesthetic, intellectual and physical frustra- tions were a continuing motive behind immigration, towardthe end of the 19 th century, it became overlaid more and more by mass unemployment, poverty, and social upheaval, which resulted from the Industrial Revolution. The shadier as-pects of the Industrial Revolution, sometimes referred to as the \"Machine Age,\" also presented considerable motivating power for the Romantic Movement. In Europe and later inthe United States, with the rapid spread of cities, factories, and their attendant social dislocations, people came to question whether the Industrial Revolution really repre-sented progress. Locked in the drudgery and grime of manu-facturing communities, more and more people followed po- ets and philosophers in embracing nature as an avenue of escape. The Romantic Movement, for example, in its praisefor the strange and mysterious in nature, by definition preferred landscapes only suggestive of human occupation (Runte 1987). Caroline G\u00fcnderode's English contemporary, George Gor- don, alias Lord Byron (1788-1824) writes in similar, yet less metaphorical verse than G\u00fcnderode: There is a rapture on the lonely shore,/There is society, where none intrudes,/By the deep sea, and music in its roar/ I love not man the less, but Nature more,/From these our interviews, in which I steal/From all I may be, or have beenbefore,/To mingle with the Universe, and feel/What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal (from the poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage Canto iv, verse 178, quoted in James Fenimore Cooper's The Deerslayer [1963: 9]). This neatly illustrates attitudes\u2014a European romantic's (Byron's) poetic atti- tude toward wilderness was used to describe the wildernesslonging of (Cooper's) American legendary frontiersmen, Leatherstocking. This legend is then later re-imported to Europe, where Leopold noticed that, \"the Germans are stillreading Cooper's Leatherstocking and Parkman's Oregon wild-west movies\" (Flader and Callicott 1991: 227). He wondered why this fascination with wilder-ness did not have practical consequences, and \"why people did not flock to [the] forest to camp out, as in America\" (Flader and Callicott 1991: Aldo Leopold's Perceptions... Meyer This predisposition to admire nature originated in the Romantic era. Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto (1995) noted that Euro-peans who traveled to America during earlier periods were hardly inclined to awe at landscapes, and that only after transformation by the sentimental cult of the 18 th century did the American landscape find its place in romantic imagi- nation. This change of attitude from the rationalistic and detached to the passionate and enraptured was notablyexcited by the 1789 French Revolution and its \"marvelous promise of freedom\" (Cardinal 1975). It tremendously influ- enced a wide variety of fields such as literature, art, science,and politics, and lasted well over one hundred years before it disintegrated with the \"Stahlgewitter,\" (the Steel-Storm of WWI) (Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto 1995). Incidentally, the end of the 19 th and beginning of the 20th centuries also saw the publishing of the Encyclopedia of the German Language by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm (1960) in 16 Volumes (1838-1960). Most of it was published and compiled posthumously. Volume 14 features a seven-column entry on the meaning and usage of \"Wildnis\" (which is the Germantranslation of \"Wilderness\") and quotes more then 160 ex- amples and sources. In the history of literature, the Grimms are considered representatives of the \"Hochromantik\" (HighRomantic). More widely of course they were renowned for their fairytales (published 1812-1815). Much less known is the fact that they both also cared for the conservation ofwilderness for national identity. In 1812, the brothers pub- lished a journal entitled Altdeutsche W\u00e4lder , or Old German Forests , which explicitly linked German forests to the genesis and continuity of authentic German culture (Harrison 1992). The entry for wilderness in the Grimm's encyclopedia was compiled in 1913, just 1 year before politics brought an endto the Romantic era. A closer investigation of this entryreveals that many of the quoted authors such as Heinrich Heine, Gottfried Herder, Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, Bettine von Brentano, and Richard Wagner are considered representa-tives of the Romantic era. The fact that many authors have noted that it is virtually impossible to think of German fairytales without thinking of a forest (Schama 1996) fur-ther suggests that a vague, perhaps even subconscious, longing for wilderness preoccupied many Europeans when they finally decided to immigrate to the United States. Theexodus from Europe was slowed down significantly in 1924 when America introduced an immigration quota for Europe- ans (Henningsen 1974). The composer Richard Wagner (1813-1883), mentioned above, was considered both a revolutionary (for partaking in the German Revolution of 1848) and archetypal representa-tive of the Romantic era. He also was a wilderness buff and an avid mountaineer. In 1853, during a lengthy trip through the mountains of Switzerland, Wagner talked enthusiasti-cally about the \"sacredness of wild country.\" His opera Rhinegold (premiering 1873), for instance, bemoans the deflowering of pristine and untouched nature by material-ism and an unrelenting lust for gold (Palm-Beulich 2002, personal communication). Wagner was also characteristic of the romantics' inclination to somewhat idealize America.His strong and enduring interest in the seductions of the New World, emigration to the United States, and the gold rush is easily demonstrated (H\u00f6risch 2001) and not particu-larly original. Wagner had a thorough knowledge of the works of a number of authors, such as Goethe, Achim Heinrich Zschokke,Karl Gutzkow, and Gottfried Keller, who were fascinated by America before the gold rush, and independently of it. That America had it better in many respects than the tired oldcontinent of Europe became an often quoted maxim of Wagner's youth thanks to the following verses of Goethe (1749-1832) from 1831 (H\u00f6risch 2001: 58): To the United America you have it better/Than our continent so old./You have no ruined castles,/No basalt hard and cold.//Within nothing daunts you/In the prime useless memories haunt you,/nor any futile strife.//Enjoy\u2014and use\u2014the present!/And if your progeny writes,/May their tales not tell of ghouls,/or damsels, thieves, or knights! To sum up, the Wilderness Movement in the United States was in part fired up by the same motivating forces that acted earlier on the Romantic Movement in Europe (Meyer 2001). Both the movements were expressions of heartfelt deficitsand frustrations born out of the Industrial Revolution and an overload of old tie-down-traditions. Both were the prod- uct of a growing sense of alienation from nature and a loss ofauthenticity; and both finally, presented an \"avenue of escape\" from the various dire aspects of society. In curious ways, both the Romantic and the Wilderness Movementswere reacting against a society that was changing too slowly and at the same time changing too fast. Through letters from immigrants that reached the Old Country (Helbich 1985; Wittke 1939), news spread rapidly that America was indeed a great place to live. Societal values such as democracy and freedom (also fostered by manyromantics) were in a promising fledgling state in many partsof the New World. Also, stories that told of spectacular scenery and the promise of bountiful natural resources added to the sense that a veritable paradise lies just acrossthe ocean. It is easily understood that many a frustrated soul of the Romantic Movement longed to sail to America, which pre-sented a \"projection screen\" (Naumann 2001) for ideals and desires that could not be fulfilled in Europe. This makes the Romantic Movement in Europe a contributory branch to theAmerican Wilderness Movement, as Nash (1982) suggests. But there is one major difference between the American Wilderness Movement and the European Romantic Move-ment, which should be noted: The latter traditionally con- sisted of longing, but not quite arriving. Cardinal (1975) notes that Romanticism is rooted in a sense of rift betweenthe actual and the ideal. Romantic painting, poetry, litera- ture, music, and dance were all, in a sense, expressions of unmet desires, practicing the cult of the unreachable, whichwas so characteristic of the Romantic Movement (Fern\u00e1ndez- Armesto 1995). The Wilderness Movement, in stark contrast to this, was and still is, aimed at identifying, protecting, and recreating real places and not imaginary ones, however sophisticated. This is what makes the Wilderness Movement so uniquely Americanafter all: Americans just don't have a tradition of enduring centuries of frustrated longings without doing anything about it! The constitutional right to the Pursuit of Happiness is ingrained in the movement to preserve Wilderness. This almost, but not quite, answers the question why National Parks, and consequently wilderness, evolved to be\"America's best idea.\" There was more: Runte (1987) notes244 RMRS-P-27. 2003Meyer The Shack Revisited: Aldo Leopold's Perceptions... that unlike established European countries, which traced their origins far back into antiquity, the United Stateslacked a long artistic and literary heritage. The absence of reminders of the human past, including castles, ancient ruins, and cathedrals on the landscape, further alienatedAmerican intellectuals from a cultural identity. By the 1860s, in response to the constant barbs about these defi- ciencies from Old World critics and New World Americanapologists, many thoughtful Americans had embraced the wonderlands of the West as replacements for manmade marks of achievement. The agelessness of monumentalscenery instead of past accomplishments of Western Civili- zation was to become the visible symbol of continuity and stability in the new nation. The constant barbs were almost a trademark for many German newcomers. Many Ameri- cans took offense that amongst them (the immigrants) were many Catholics, some socialists, and no few cultural chau-vinists (Helbich 1985). In other words, the alleged and perceived lack of culture in America partook in giving rise to the culture of wildernesspreservation. Leopold (1949) felt that the ability to see the cultural value of wilderness boiled down, in the last analysis, to a question of intellectual humility. One cannot help butspeculate that Leopold too must have been aware of Euro- pean cultural chauvinism. Legal Aspects __________________ Among many wilderness enthusiasts, Leopold is known for initiating administrative protection for the world's first designated wilderness area, the Gila Wilderness Area in New Mexico, established June 3, 1924. As much as Leopoldbelieved in the scientific and ecological value of wilderness,he had a special interest in wilderness for recreation. This partiality is evident not only in Leopold's writings but also in the Wilderness Act, the legislation which established theNational Wilderness Preservation System in 1964. The Wilderness Society, of which Leopold was a founding mem- ber, played an important role in the creation of this act. In 1984, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) adopted some of the phrasing and contents from the Wilderness Act as a model for creating a new subcategory for protectedareas: Wilderness Area, IUCN category 1b (IUCN 1984). This not only illustrates a breakthrough in international conservation thinking, it also shows that the social assets ofwilderness finally became recognized on an international level. Today, this recognition of the value of wilderness for societal reasons very often adds the needed impetus toprotect wilderness, since moralistic or scientific argumenta- tion alone often does not present ample enough reason for lawmakers to support wilderness (Easley and others 1990). According to Leopold (1949: 194), some of the basic criteria for an outstanding wilderness recreation experi- ence were the exclusion of mechanized tools, motorizedvehicles, and good roads. He explained why this was impor- tant: \"Recreation is valuable in proportion to the intensity of its experiences, and to the degree to which it differs from and contrasts with workaday life. By these criteria, mecha- nized outings are at best a milk-and-water affair\" (italics are Leopold's). About gadgets he said: \"I'm not such a puristas to disdain all of them, but I do claim, that the presence orabsence of gadget inhibitions is a delicate test of any man's outdoor education\" (Meine and Knight 1999: 44). Indications of Leopold's bias against gadgets can readily be seen at the Shack today (fig. 6), where electricity and plumbing are still absent. Leopold (1949: viii) would oftenrefer to the Shack as \"the weekend-refuge from too much modernity.\" Though he readily used many modern conve- niences during his everyday life, Leopold valued equally theability to go without them, and fostered a \"healthy contempt for the plethora of material blessings\" (Leopold 1949: ix). The special psychological and physiological faculties thatenable humans not only to endure but also to enjoy wild places make wilderness conservation a social asset. Leopold wrote: Wilderness is a resource, not only in the physical sense of the raw materials it contains, but also in the sense of a distinctive environment which may, if rightly used, yield certain societal values (Meine and Knight 1999: 107). Kellert (1996) describes nine basic values of nature: (1) utili- tarian, (2) naturalistic, (3) ecological-scientific, (4) aesthetic,(5) symbolic, (6) dominionistic, (7) humanistic,(8) moralistic, and (9) negativistic. Two of these, dominionistic and negativ- istic, deserve some attention here because they are doubleedged and easy to misunderstand. Nevertheless, I find that they especially pertain to Leopold's perceptions of wilderness. About the negatavistic value Kellert (1996: 26) writes: Dreading certain aspects of nature may be essential in developing a sense of awe, respect, and even reverence for the natural world. For nature has the power to humble, over- whelm and even destroy human life. People would hardlymanifest a healthy deference for the natural world if it lacked the capacity to frighten or intimidate. Has there ever been a god who did not possess the power to terrify as much as express love and compassion? In regard to the dominionistic value Kellert (1996: 20) states: Survival, even in the modern era, is still a tenuous enter- prise necessitating some degree of human capacity for endur-ance and mastery. The ability to subdue, and the skill and Figure 6\u2014The Shack in 1991. Although modern conveniences such as electricity cannot be found atthe Shack, many species of plants and wildlife that were absent in Leopold's time can be discovered in the surrounding landscape (photo by Till Meyer). USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 245The Shack Revisited: Aldo Leopold's Perceptions... Meyer prowess honed by an occasionally adversarial relationship with nature, remain essential ingredients in developing the human capability to survive. Perhaps this may explain why people often feel compelled to keep this aspect of the humanspirit alive even when it seems superfluous.\" Leopold (1949) thought that public wilderness areas were primarily a means of perpetuating, in sport form, the more virile and primitive skills in pioneering and subsistence. Thecultivation of these primitive skills did not have much tradition in Germany. The current legal definitions of wilderness reflect most, if not all of the nine basic values described by Kellert. Leopold's original attempt to define wilderness emphasized negativis- tic and dominionistic values. Comparing this with the legaldefinition of wilderness in the U.S. Wilderness Act, as well as with the IUCN Wilderness Category, certain similarities emerge. Also, the phrase \"should offer outstanding opportu-nities for solitude\" was used in both the U.S. Wilderness Act and the IUCN category, suggesting that there must have been some legislative cross-fertilization. The societal value of wilderness becomes more evident because the Wilderness Act requires that visitor freedom should be a management goal (The Wilderness Society1984). This reminds us once more of the romantic roots of the Wilderness Movement. The ideas that human beings should not be alienated from nature (public access) and that per-sonal freedom should be valued were ingrained in the Ro- mantic Movement as well. Here we should recall that the Romantic Movement, together with the immigration wave ofthe late 19 th and early 20th centuries, were both efforts to escape mentally, as well as physically, unbearable condi- tions such as crowded cities and streets and restrictedfreedom to move about. The idea that a respite from crowds, cities, streets, and restricted living conditions could be earned by declining certain conveniences of civilization is very much a part of theAmerican Wilderness Movement. Many Americans recog- nize that wilderness stands for self-restraint (Freimund 2001, personal communication), but it does not stand forrestriction. While self-restraint has definite societal value, restrictions exerted by power of authority do not carry much ethical value. This difference is important to notice. Eventhough the IUCN categories universally recognize wilder- ness as a place to offer \"outstanding opportunities,\" most countries do not yet do this (Martin and Sarathy 2001).Germany is one such country. It has resisted repeated efforts to make wilderness a part of its legal conservation frame- work (Voss 2001, personal communication). Reichholf(Stampf 2000) points out that many conservationists in Germany even harbor misanthropic motives, as they regard conservation as a tool to protect nature from the people and not for the people. Reichholf also suggests that there is a latent tendency for devotion to authority in many German conservationists. Kellert (1996) noted that many Germansexpressed an unusual willingness to subordinate the practi- cal needs of people to maintain pristine nature or to protect wildlife. Thus, quite inadvertently, many German conservation- ists fell back into the Romantic \"cult of the unreachable,\" mentioned previously, and the pre-Romantic and prerevo-lutionary subservience to authority. At the same time, they fail to recognize some of the more important humanisticaspects of their Romantic heritage. The hard-gained free- dom to move about, the intensely romantic notion that manshould not be alienated from nature, is jeopardized by relentless conservation jurisdiction and attitudes, as is the great ideal of the age of enlightenment\u2014that people shouldbe treated as responsible citizens. The currently revised Federal Act of Nature Conservation is attempting to do away with this anachronism by paying more attention to recre-ational use of protected natural areas. Yet it still does not recognize wilderness as a management category for pro- tected areas (Deutscher Bundestag 2001). This jurisdic-tional deficit was also noted at the 7 th World Wilderness Congress and ultimately publicized as Resolution #25 on November 8, 2001 (Sarathy and others 2001). Acknowledgments ______________ Aldo Leopold was first brought to my attention in 1977, by my instructor, Bill Perine, during a course in wildlife manage- ment at Hocking Technical College, Nelsonville, Ohio. At thattime, however, I did not yet know about A Sand County Almanac . That book was pointed out to me in 1983 by Wolfgang Schr\u00f6der, a professor of wildlife management at theUniversity of Munich. Leopold biographer, Curt Meine, then helped me get in touch with Brend Haglund from the Sand County Foundation in Madison, Wisconsin, who in turnhelped me to establish contact with the Leopold family in Baraboo. To all of the above people, I owe my sincere gratitude. I extend my warmest thanks to Nina Leopold Bradley and the late Charles Bradley, who let me spend many nights at the Shack and let me use their guestroom and shower whenever I had had enough of fiddling with the fireplace inthe Shack. I also sincerely appreciate the financial supportof Natur & Kosmos magazine and the Deutsche Verlags Anstalt (DVA). Without their support, my trip to the 7 th World Wilderness Congress in South Africa would hardly have been possible. I thank my colleague and friend Vivienne Klimke for first bringing my attention to the IUCN Wilder- ness Category in 1997 and Gerhard Trommer (University ofFrankfurt) for his suggestion that I should approach my studies on Leopold and on wilderness more systematically and less journalistically. For their final comments and suggestions before comple- tion of my paper, I thank especially Curt Meine (Interna- tional Crane Foundation), Buddy Huffacker (Leopold Foun-dation), and Wolfgang Schr\u00f6der, Technical University of Munich. The bulk of patience and help was given to me by my Ohio friend Julianne Matsko during her visit to myhome in Munich just a few weeks prior to the 7 thWorld Wilderness Congress. Also I thank my friends, Hermann and Stefanie Siebers-Gfaller, who provided some helpfulcritical advice on German history. They also assisted me on several other instances during my quest of backtracking Aldo Leopold's footsteps and bringing ecology into contextwith the liberal arts and humanities. I would also like to thank Janet Sproull (U.S. Forest Service/Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute) for her initiative, coopera-tion, and patience that made this paper possible. Finally, I should mention that my initial visits to the United States and my prolonged exposure to the manydifferent \"American Ways of Life\" would not have been possible without the generosity of my parents, Linde and246 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Meyer The Shack Revisited: Aldo Leopold's Perceptions... Werner Meyer, and the hospitality of my Ohio relatives, Jean and George Luechauer. One of their ancestors,Katharina Luechauer, arrived in the United States in 1923 from Donndorf, Germany. This was the year before United States borders were tightened to European immigration andwas also the year before Aldo Leopold finally succeeded in persuading the U.S. Forest Service to designate the world's first legally protected wilderness area.

Thispaper considers the role of friluftsliv in maintaining traditional cultural relationships with the Norwegian landscape, in the light of more recent developments, particularly international adventuresports (such as snowboarding) and the adoption of friluftsliv in schools. This paper uses examples to illustrate how friluftsliv traditions find diverse expression in nature-based experiences basedon informal social relations and the family, and how it is shaped by everyday access to the natural and cultural landscape. This is contrasted with contemporary trends to institutionalize friluftslivand contemporary outdoor recreation-based equipment and expen- sive travel. The comparison suggests that attention should be paid to how institutional and commercial forms of friluftsliv may erodethe role of tradition in maintaining a strong connection between cultural identity and environmental sustainability, and provides some insights into how environmental education can be consideredas a lifelong, communal process rather than something concen- trated in the school. Introduction ____________________ For me, contact with nature and participation in sports and friluftsliv (open-air life) were a natural part of growing up. I first learned to see friluftsliv as something to be taught through my studies at the Norges Idrettshogskole (Norwe- gian University of Sports). There I met my advisor, Nils Faarlund, and as a result of our initial meeting I saw for thefirst time the link between friluftsliv and nature protection. I have tried, through teaching friluftsliv in tertiary col- leges and the Trondheim Tourist Association, to fosterinterest in friluftsliv. My studies in biology helped me to understand some of the negative ecological effects of outdoor recreation and left me determined to find ways to preventthem. From time to time, I have found it difficult to balance the use of the outdoors in an ecophilosophical way (best described as \"the way is the goal,\" where the way is tomaintain harmony with nature) against my misgivings about exposing plant life to more damage and increasing disturbance to wildlife as a result of this increased traffic.Because I recognize that humans are part of nature, and also because I have come to understand that there is a connection between taking action to protect nature and experiencing the joy of being in nature, I remain committedto using education as a means for socialization into friluft- sliv and to encourage active protection of nature. Taking a historical view of the factors which influence an individual's involvement in friluftsliv and of the opportuni- ties for socialization into friluftsliv, we find that things are very different from even one generation ago. The simplicityof friluftsliv is challenged by a higher standard of living and by the amusement parklike repertoire of outdoor offerings. Socialization into friluftsliv as a normal part of everyday lifecan no longer be taken for granted. We can no longer assume, for example, that families go on walks on Sundays, as was the case during my childhood\u2014today there are many alter-native leisure activities. Friluftsliv can be reinforced in these changed circum- stances through the realization that these changes havegone too far. More and more of those now living apart fromnature have a sense that something is missing in their lives, as if life without nature is meaningless. In this situation the greatest challenge is to find and implement effective ways tosocialize children into friluftsliv. What Is Learning?_______________ Life-long-learning\u2014humans are in a continual learning process. Experiencing is the basis for learning\u2014one learnsthrough experiencing surroundings and through experienc- ing the cooperation between the environment and oneself. The basis of the internal learning process is reflection. Theresult of learning is an acknowledgment that is exhibited in experiencing the mastering of the surroundings and the ability to think in new ways and to behave in new ways.Organizational development\u2014the learning organization is an organization that is able to change based on self-acquired knowledge and experience (Senge 1990). Humanity, seen as a variety of organizations that live under different life conditions, has developed a variety of cultures because it has always had the ability to function asa learning organization. Meetings between cultures have opened ways for exchange of knowledge and experience. This development has acquired new inspiration. Culture changes have principally been shown to be irre- versible. This also applies to cases where attempts have been made to stop or reverse the development to an earlierstage. This, therefore, puts much responsibility on those who are in a position to lead the change processes. They must be able to see the short- and long-term consequences of theirchange tactics.Norwegian \"Friluftsliv\"\u2014\"Environmental Education\" as a Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Dahle Norwegian \"Friluftsliv\"\u2014\"Environmental Education\" as a Lifelong Communal Process If we focus on the long lines of the \"history of learning\" we, here in the year 2001, are perhaps returning to an under-standing of learning where the essential basic principles in the learning process can be reflected in the history of human- kind. With the exception of a short period in human history,where organizations' responsibility for self-learning was replaced with the introduction of institutions that had sepa- rate responsibility for knowledge administration, groups ofpeople have taken a general responsibility for learning. Humans have sought knowledge and have had knowledge delivered in order to survive and to further develop society,their own cultures, and themselves. Learning has been a strong and necessary force for indi- viduals and for a \"self-subsistence society \" (Kval\u00f8y 1975). Inmodern times, learning has been disconnected from the natural knowledge-seeking situation. The learning situa- tion is constructed and \"the teacher\" has responsibility forteaching the students \"knowledge and ways\" taken from the teacher's own understanding of reality. What is correct and what is acceptable, sound general knowledge, and what is\"the custom\"? In extreme situations this understanding of learning led to missionaries traveling to other continents, to towns andoutlying areas in order to first unlearn established knowl- edge and thereafter to force learn vigorous cultures\u2014a foreign knowledge. The Norwegian Prime Minister Bondevik, in his 2000 New Year's speech, certainly asked the Sami people for forgive- ness. But does Bondevik understand what he was reallyasking forgiveness for? Behind the \"Norwegianification\" of the Samis is a way of thinking about learning and develop- ment that has permeated the modern world for many gen-erations and that shows its best failures in the most extremecircumstances. With this apology, Bondevik recognizes, not only an injus- tice against a people, but also a way of thinking aboutdevelopment and learning that has entailed injustices and the deterioration of the life quality of the individual and peoples in all parts of the world. I believe that learning is animportant life skill for humans, when learning is based on the individual's power to create their own life and to give this life quality based on their own understanding and with abackground in their own resources. Of course in a modern society there must be institutional- ized learning of knowledge and skills. It is a misunderstand-ing, however, to believe that an institution such as a school can take responsibility for people's development and train- ing in all areas. Friluftsliv, for example, is a cultural phe-nomenon where the school can hardly be the central arena for socialization. The connection is simple, friluftsliv first and foremost in arenas outside the school. What Is Friluftsliv? ______________ The mystery of music. Rhythm, melody, harmony. People need language in order to receive information. Music for feelings. Rhythm steers our life. People have a need to take part in something, to shareexperiences. Rhythm lies in our heartbeat\u2014the rhythm of life. Rhythm imitates what we hear around us. The sound of nature. Relief in experiencing wide horizons in nature. Naturesounds\u2014orchestrating nature. Music is the difference between life and death. The melody we are all touched by. Music comes from the heart. Before, the experience of music (before it could be recorded) was only here and there. Music must be simple, it must be remembered in order to be sung byeveryone. Music gives identity. Music is the language of the soul. In music we hear the song of life, nature's song. Consonance-dissonance in the meeting between people.Through music we experience earlier events. Without being able to sing or play we understand the language of music. Welearn music as we learn language. Music resonates with hormonal power and sexuality. Harmony brings forth pas- sion. There is a connection between the response to music andthe life we live. Modern music does not let us forget the core of music\u2014rhythm. Music soothes people as a part of nature. Life's rhythm (Martin, personal communication). In his hunt for the mystery of music, Martin is searching to understand human nature and its relationship withnature. It perhaps should be obvious to a group working with friluftsliv that the explanation of the mystery of friluftsliv probably lies in humans and their relationship with nature.Music therefore has some things in common with friluftsliv\u2014 friluftsliv being understood as an expression of people's joy of being in nature and that the experience can be expressedand shared with others as part of an international common culture. A master's student defending his thesis closed the defense by asking, \"Why has 20 years of research in friluftsliv not managed to capture the essence of the phenomenon of friluftsliv?\" Perhaps the student is right, or perhaps he hasnot found the right sources. But the question at least isinteresting. What is the essence of the cultural phenom- enon\u2014friluftsliv? I believe that friluftsliv, first and foremost, is about feeling the joy of being out in nature, alone or with others, feeling pleasure and experiencing harmony with the surround- ings\u2014only being in nature and doing something that ismeaningful for me\u2014here and now. What Is the Essence of Norwegian Friluftsliv? _____________________ A description of people's practice of friluftsliv can be structured in the following way: The clearly dominant form of Norwegian friluftsliv is that people, starting from theirown home or cabin, go out into nature on walks alone or together with others, family and friends, in order to come back later in the day to their own home or cabin. The motivesfor these walks are often many and complex\u2014to experience nature, to be sociable, physical activity, and so forth (Dahle 1989). The walks are often longest on Saturdays or Sundays,but are often taken during the week. This is \"daily walk friluftsliv.\" When the typical Norwegian friluftsliv person goes out, they are often on foot or, in winter, on skis. A small group bicycle, and even fewer use other means of transportation such as boats, canoes, and skates. In addition to the naturewanderer satisfying the previously mentioned motives, a relatively large group, as a part of their walk, want toUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 249Norwegian \"Friluftsliv\"\u2014\"Environmental Education\" as a Lifelong Communal Process Dahle practice other interests such as fishing, hunting, berry picking, mushroom gathering, photography, looking at plantsand birds, and so on. Another important part of the practice of Norwegian friluftsliv is a tour over several days, staying overnight intents or cabins. These trips are during the weekends and vacations, \"vacation friluftsliv.\" The motives are the same as for \"daily walk friluftsliv.\" The Norwegian tour culture has been passed on from generation to generation, and it has its own rituals, which must be learned. Following are some examples of the Norwe-gian friluftsliv tradition: Day trip 1: Breakfast together on Sunday morning. Everyone knows that the family is soon on its way to the woods. The thermoses are filled with coffee or tea for the adults and, with hot chocolate for the children. The neces-sary clothing and equipment for the temperature and weather are found. Some extra clothes are put in the backpack. In a short time, without any particular discussion or planning,the family is out walking in the forest. We meet neighbors and acquaintances, stop for a chat. We look at and talk about phenomena in nature and the cultural landscape. We takeoff and put on clothes. Then comes the social high point of the trip: we sit down, take out the thermoses and lunch, perhaps light a fire, and talk in friendly tones about things that havehappened, future plans and dreams. Then the trip home starts. We have become warm and sweaty. It is good to get home, to take a shower, and to have dinner together, fol-lowed by \"lounging\" on the sofas or on the throw rugs. Friluftsliv needs the family to continue to be a living cultural phenomenon and the family needs friluftsliv to ensure good forms of being together (B\u00f8rge Dahle) . Day trip 2: In Tuesday's newspaper there was an article on where \"Wednesday's exercise\" would meet. This is this week's tour. Most of the group are single retirees. For most, \"Wednesday's exercise\" is perhaps their most importantsocial network. Every Wednesday at 10:30, throughout the year, 40 to 70 happy walkers meet. The tour goes to one of the cabins in the forest. The path varies from time to time. Theseare people who have practiced friluftsliv throughout a long life, and friluftsliv is the basis for their experience of the quality of their life, also in this last phase. Overnight tour 1: A group of women teachers have talked for a long time about taking a common tour in themountains. They have used many work breaks to plan, they have looked forward to it, but have also considered the challenges. They have to find a time that suits leaving theirchildren and husbands. They ask themselves, am I in good enough condition\u2014do I need to train a little bit before the trip? Now the day is here. The backpack is carefully packed. Some experienced mountain backpackers still have their old \"pink\" anorak (wind jacket)\u2014this makes the group feel confi-dent. But some have a new multicolored anorak and are pretty excited about how the tour will be. They get on the train. At last they are on their way to the first DNT (Norwe-gian Tourist Association) cabin. They walk and talk excitedly. They worry about their husbands and children, stop often, eat and talk, look at the magnificent landscape. Now they feelfree, they manage to forget children, husbands, and theworries from a long and tiring school year. They get a four- person room in the cabin, where the conversation continues.They put on clean sweaters they have knitted on their breaks and go down to be served dinner, coffee, and cake in front of the fireplace, massage their sore thighs, and are ready for thenext day. Friluftsliv gives us breathing room in a busy world. Friluftsliv gives us an experience of freedom (B\u00f8rge Dahle). Overnight trip 2: He has read books about hunting and fishing during the entire winter. He has tied some flies. Hedoesn't meet his old school friend very often, but the yearly fishing trip holds them together. They can talk for a long time on the telephone. The conversations have to do with lastsummer's fishing trip and mostly about the big one that got away. What will next summer's fishing trip be like? The day is here. This year both take their sons with them. They drive a long way to get to this year's spot. They buy food on the road. With heavy bags they arrive at the \"fishing water.\" They set up camp. It doesn't take long before all ofthem are at the water with their fishing poles in hand. It has been 30 years since they met at elementary school, but now it is as if time has stood still. Family, colleagues, economicproblems, and stocks are forgotten. There is only one thing important in the world. The situation is here and now\u2014the boys that need to be taught, the friend from school, thefishing pole, and the trout that will soon take the fly. Friluftsliv gives us excitement. Friluftsliv gives us dreams. Friluftsliv is a gift from me to my children (B\u00f8rge Dahle). Norwegian friluftsliv tradition can be characterized through many such stories, but there are common elementsin the stories. What characterizes this cultural phenomenonand what separates it from an international leisure time culture in nature is, among other things: Experiencing nature is key. Practicing friluftsliv is not dependent on large costs for traveling and equipment. The natural and cultural landscape used is easily acces- sible from permanent residences and cabins. The passing on tradition is strongly anchored in natural social groups such as family and friends (Dahle 1989). Friluftsliv is not dependant on organizations\u2014it is possible for individuals to choose their own time and place for practicing it. In addition to the Norwegian tradition of friluftsliv, we also see that the international leisure activity culture in nature has spread in Norway. The international \"outdoorsactivities\" are first and foremost activity motivated and tied to facilities in nature. The activities are most often organized through commercial interests or institutions that run educa-tional programs or short courses. The leisure activity culture is often a part of the commercial travel industry and is organized as long trips, expeditions, or \"adventures.\" Theysell an experience package. The international activity culture has gained much of its inspiration from well-known persons who have made expe-ditions. Central in Norway are the role models of Nansen and Amundsen on their Polar expeditions, climbing expedi- tions to Mount Everest, \u00c5sheim, Ausland, Ulvang and D\u00e6hli.They have also gained inspiration from military survival250 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Dahle Norwegian \"Friluftsliv\"\u2014\"Environmental Education\" as a Lifelong Communal Process and from travel writings of canoe expeditions through, for example, Canada's deep wilderness areas. It is unfortunate, but understandable, that universities and colleges that have a special responsibility for arranging individual Norwegian day trips and for celebrating friluftslivhave let themselves be inspired by the international leisure activity culture. Leisure activity culture and \"expeditions\" through the education of teachers has been further takeninto the state school system. Under the theme friluftsliv, ski days are arranged with Telemark and snowboards, along with canoe expeditions and surviving/overnighting in snowcaves in the mountains. Is this the way to learn the key elements of Norwegian friluftsliv tradition? What is worrying the institutions protecting friluftsliv is that young people to a greater degree than earlier are missing traditional friluftsliv, and they are participating more in the international leisure activity culture. To whatdegree this concern is based on qualified research results or only on a feeling of a situation is somewhat unclear. The leisure time patterns of youth must be mapped. Manyfunction to different extents in different cultures. The adult's view of what is the dominant youth culture varies in relation to which arenas the adults look to forthemselves. It is not possible to ignore the fact that some leisure activity leaders and friluftsliv leaders, because of their own interest areas, \"stay put\" in arenas that aredominated by activity trends. The forms of activity for the selected arenas for these leaders become very visible. There are often large groups of people who gather at such places.Other arenas, such as traditional friluftsliv, for these lead- ers can be much more visible. Remember that traditional friluftsliv is unorganized and is practiced in small localnature areas spread over the whole country. What is possible to assert is that childen socialized in the Norwegian friluftsliv return to this tradition when they themselves establish families (Dahle 1989). The same phe-nomenon can be seen in sports. Sports culture is a youth culture where the largest group of \"sports youth\" are those who have quit sports when they turn 19 (Center for Children'sResearch, UNIT). Young people who are active in sports in their youth often return to their childhood friluftsliv after they finish their sports career. Perhaps, therefore, there is no basis for much worry about the leisure time patterns of young people seen in relation to maintaining our friluftsliv. This can be described as apedagogic error of linkage if we mean that friluftsliv must adjust to the modern youth culture such that the basic values for these cultures are to be recognized in new varia-tions of the Norwegian friluftsliv. The effect of such a strategy will most likely be the opposite of what is desired\u2014 the Norwegian friluftsliv tradition will be weakened. In order to maintain Norwegian friluftsliv tradition, the most effective way will be to ensure that children are socialized within traditional friluftsliv while they are at anage when their leisure time is spent together with their parents. Traditional friluftsliv is open for all and can be practiced throughout one's lifetime. Seen from health, qual-ity of life, and economic perspectives, it makes economic sense that the public sector should first and foremost invest in initiatives that give families with children good opportu-nities for enjoying traditional friluftsliv.Meanwhile, it is important to differentiate between pri- mary socialization arenas and arenas that support a social-ization process around friluftsliv. The primary socialization arena, in this connection, will be practicing of traditional friluftsliv in a family connection. Important initiatives can be: Those that stimulate families with children to practice \"daily walk friluftsliv.\" Those that stimulate families with children to practice \"vacation friluftsliv.\" An important initiative will be to help parents to be good \"guides\" for their children. This can be done by, among otherthings: Inviting parent groups to courses in tour guiding (for their children, families, and friends). Arranging tours where family is invited. Having child care centers and schools arrange tours where the family is involved. Preferring areas that stimulate families with children to go on tours (such as Children's World of Nature in Rennebu) (Dahle 1989). Giving special prices for families with children who are taking trips between cabins in the mountains (perhaps heavily reduced prices for children at DNT's cabins, asnow we have free fishing licenses for children under 16). Developing programs especially for single parents. Arranging for courses in photography, mushroom gath- ering, and so on. Arenas that support the socialization process for friluftsliv could be: All forms of physical activity, especially done outdoors. All forms of physical activity that improve children's coordination so that their ability to go out into nature is improved. All forms of activity that increase knowledge and the experience of being out in nature (for example, play in \"hundred meter forest\" will increase physical capacity,improve coordination, and increase a child's knowledge about and experience of being out in nature) (Fj\u00f8rtoft 2000). \"Outdoor pursuits.\" Important institutions that could participate in such work are: Child care centers and schools. Friluftsliv organizations. The authorities must direct the use of resources at the most effective initiatives to ensure that the traditional friluftsliv tour is available to most people. The authorities must also direct their resources at the organizations that areable to develop effective programs that maintain or increase the practice of friluftsliv in the population. We will probably see in the future that there is potential for increasing \"vacation friluftsliv.\" It would then be impor- tant to stimulate the Tourist Association to work with creating tour opportunities for families with children. Theleisure activity culture will increasingly present new trends, and commercial interests will keep these activities alive. Public resources must be directed at broad groups of peopleUSDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 251Norwegian \"Friluftsliv\"\u2014\"Environmental Education\" as a Lifelong Communal Process Dahle and the groups that have a weak position in the fight for leisure resources. (Swedish surveys from the end of the1980s show that the Swedish Social Democratic Govern- ment used about 90 percent of their resources on leisure sector activities that were used by about 10 percent of thepopulation.) It will always be the case that strong groups push forward with their special interests. An important side of the Norwegian friluftsliv tradition is that all social groups participate. Of course, high status groups in some special arenas also dominate friluftsliv, but traditional friluftsliv is one of the few arenas for physicalactivity with participation from a broad base of the popula- tion. Traditional friluftsliv does not need physical facilities; everyone can practice it close to home, at the time they want,and with the equipment they feel most comfortable with. What Is \"Knowledge Status\" for Norwegian Friluftsliv? ___________ A great deal of work has been carried out to try to understand Norwegian friluftsliv in a historical perspective, particularly when it comes to an understanding of friluftslivin relation to the Romantics, friluftsliv as a part of the Norwegian identity, Nansen's meaning of friluftsliv, and so forth. I believe that historically we have put too little weight on the Norwegian people's general close relationship to nature throughout time\u2014perhaps especially country people's rela-tionship. The understanding of this \"people of nature's\" closeness to nature is a pretty good basis for understanding what happened in the building of the Norwegian identityrelated to friluftsliv and Norwegian nature, for the positionNansen gained and has as an ideal by the Norwegian people, but perhaps most importantly, for the weight friluftsliv had and still has in Norway. That friluftsliv still has a large following in Norway can first and foremost be explained by the fact that friluftsliv is a deeply established common culture, where the practice offriluftsliv \"tacit knowledge\" is still passed on from genera- tion to generation. Additionally, our settlement structure is decisive. At the beginning of this new century, all Norwegians still have a very short distance to nature and cultural landscapes where friluftsliv can be practiced. The patterns of friluftsliv by theNorwegian people have been constant and are still relatively stable. It is still the simple foot tour and ski trip based on motives of enjoying nature, health, and camaraderie, and ondeveloping nature interests that are strongly dominant. The \"people's friluftsliv\" is still highly alive, but a lifestyle with stress has meant that some people's practice of friluftsliv issubstantially reduced. Pressure on the traditional patterns of friluftsliv has been great in past decades. The general development of societyand new and varied leisure time are some of the more important reasons for this. But pedagogic institutions have also worked to create new forms of friluftsliv activities. A\"sportification\" of friluftsliv has occurred. In the competition for students, colleges, folk colleges, and sports institutes have needed to target themselves at youth groups, and theyhave chosen to emphasize trends in outdoor activities and \"adventure\" tours, even to foreign countries.Throughout, the pattern of friluftsliv has shown itself to be relatively stable. This can be explained by the fact thatyouth groups have never been and are not currently a decisive factor for Norwegian friluftsliv. It is the age groups before and after adolescence that are dominant and decisivein friluftsliv. Friluftsliv is an activity form that is practiced from birth to the grave. Teenagers try out many new leisure time opportunities, either in sport or other leisure activities. Some youth groups, in spite of everything, are very active in the traditional friluftsliv, but they are disorganized and are not very evi-dent. Some youth groups are partly active in friluftsliv, and some are occasionally active. But this pattern is normal and should not be worrying to those who protect Norwegiantraditional friluftsliv. It can also seem as if the pattern of friluftsliv is changing more than it really is. This can be a result of the media's needto focus on the extreme \"elite\" friluftsliv. It is also probably not too bold to assert that the \"celebrity culture,\" especially within the media, is also \"stuck\" in the modern youthculture. We have accumulated a great deal of experience in pedagogic work with friluftsliv over the last 30 years. Differ-ent pedagogic methods have been tried. \"Conwaying\" has become a term and in many ways its own culture within friluftsliv. It represents its own \"school\" in friluftsliv peda-gogy that has been shown to function very well in certain pedagogic situations. Perhaps the use of conwaying should be differentiated to a greater degree for different targetgroups. (Note: \"Conwaying\" is defined as sharing the expe- riences of free nature in accord with the patterns of thought/ paradigm and values of the Norwegian tradition of friluftslivin smaller groups for the joy of identification, as well as forinspiring route-finding in modernity toward lifestyles where nature is the home of culture.) The \"conwayers\" position in too many instances has been too dominant in the learning situation. Participation in the practice of friluftsliv demands a fundamental education, a resonance for nature, that requires a free and independentdevelopment over time. The core of this development as a sounding board for nature is the experience of being in a rich natural and cultural landscape. We must create a good\"learning room\" for friluftsliv. \"Advice\" for Further Work With Friluftsliv ______________________ It will not succeed and will result in a dead end if, through administrative strategies and pedagogic activities, we try to change the traditional friluftsliv patterns by adapting themto values that have their basis in some of the most conspicious parts of modern youth culture. Teenagers have their \"sag- ging pants\" and snowboards, but they also go on skiing andfishing trips. When it comes to people's health and quality of life, it is positive that new activities and forms of play will increas-ingly pop up. But some forms of activities that have nature as an arena must, when it comes to nature and the environ- ment, be concentrated to limited areas. There will be continually increasing fights for access to nature and cultural landscape areas. The pressure will be a252 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Dahle Norwegian \"Friluftsliv\"\u2014\"Environmental Education\" as a Lifelong Communal Process result of increased leisure time, increased wealth in the Norwegian population, and increased tourist traffic basedon the use of nature. The leisure use of nature areas in the future must, therefore, be limited when it comes to forms of use. General rights must be limited to certain uses of nature.Established uses of nature that have a gentle effect on nature and that have broad roots in the people must be prioritized. Remember that changes in culture are irrevers-ible. A strongly rooted culture that is too weakened or is given a new content will take a long time to build up again to a \"self-sustaining\" culture, such as Norwegian friluftslivis today. Friluftsliv should continue to be available to all. The individual's physical condition and personal wealth shouldnot be deciding factors for participating in friluftsliv. With the development of sport in mind, all attempts that could threaten the \"daily walk friluftsliv\" or \"vacation friluftsliv\"should be opposed. Friluftsliv must not be for the elite. A \"sportification\" of friluftsliv will be destructive. Let friluftsliv avoid becoming a spectators sport. Additionally, an international and ecological perspective should be taken regarding the social and ecological conse- quences of friluftsliv that is based on extensive travelactivities, use of nature areas, and consequent unfortunate assaults on local cultures. Places of teaching, administra- tive institutions, and organizations that are supposed totake care of friluftsliv should make their responsibility evident and focus on the Norwegian friluftsliv tradition. It is natural that persons who work especially in the field offriluftsliv (colleges, sports institutes, or research and ad- ministrative environment) often consist of people who have a particular interest in friluftsliv. They often have specialphysical abilities and possibilities to practice a broad spec- trum of forms of friluftsliv, including some that are ex-treme or very resource demanding. These people often appear in professional and social situations that support their way of thinking and behaving. Their understandingand analysis of the friluftsliv phenomenon can be different from what, therefore, is the reality. Dogmatic opinion and self interest is taken to some degree into their professionalwork, and certain opinions, values, and ways of behaving are carried over to the recruitment process. It is important to undertake frequent critical evaluations of our own activities within administrative, organizational, and pedagogic institutions that work with friluftsliv. There should be a continual dialogue about what is the core oftraditional friluftsliv and examination of this core in rela- tion to our own activity. Without a clear understanding of friluftsliv's core content, it will be difficult to develop effec-tive socialization and recruiting strategies and learning programs for a friluftsliv that is to adapt to the new chal- lenges that will always result in a changing society.

Tax- onomy (or biosystematics) is the basic underpinning science of all biology\u2014and thus of all environmental management. Without soundtaxonomy, no knowledge is available on living organisms, and if you don't know what you have, you cannot determine how to manage, conserve, or sustainably use biological resources. The Global Net-work is comprised of a number of interlinked regional Locally Organized and Operated Partnerships (LOOPs) of developing coun- try institutions, supported by a consortium of developed countryinstitutions. Its purpose, through South-South cooperation and North-South partnerships for institutional strengthening and hu- man resource development, is to enable developing countries toachieve self-reliance in taxonomy to support regional and national programs for eradication of poverty, via sustainable agricultural development and use of natural resources, and by full implementa-tion of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The network's success is attributable to two key components. The first is local ownership of the process, including governmentalendorsement of the need for such a capacity-building network, whereby needs are identified and prioritized by member countries themselves. The second is a tried and tested mechanism whereby alack of individual country capacity is overcome by pooling, optimiz- ing, and sharing regional capacity on a reciprocal basis between member countries. It provides a very useful model for other capac-ity-building initiatives in developing countries, as well as for North- South and South-South collaborative partnerships for capacity building. Introduction ____________________ Whether it is called taxonomy, systematics, or biosystem- atics, this branch of science is dedicated to discovering, identifying, naming, and classifying organisms and elucidat- ing their re lationships. As such, the discipline is fundamen talOvercoming the Taxonomic Impediment to Sustainable Development: BioNET-INTERNATIONAL, the Global Network for Taxonomy\u2014A Successful Networking Model for Capacity Building in DevelopingCountries Nicholas King to our attempts to understand biodiversity, and the sustain- able use thereof, and assess the impacts of any form of activity involving, or using, natural resources. What began at the Stockholm Conference on Man and the Environment (1972), as a mildly keener appetite for tax- onomy, was transformed at the Earth Summit in Rio (1992)into an insatiable hunger, just as the scientific resources to satisfy it began to become scarce. Today, it is doubtful if there are any scientists within the realms of zoology, botany,ecology, agriculture, or impact assessment who do not have some taxonomic requirements. Identifications in particular are urgently needed in ever-increasing quantities world-wide by natural scientists of every inclination\u2014not the least of those in the biodiversity-rich but resource-poor countries of the developing world. Without correct identification, allaccess to knowledge pertaining to that organism is denied. In these nations, whose biodiversity is seen to be vital to the world's well-being and constitutes the Earth's richest genetic resource, there is little, and in some cases no, taxo- nomic capability. This is largely a consequence of history and of recent financial policies of developed countries. From early colonial days, and especially from the turn of the centuryuntil very recently, the taxonomic needs of these developing countries had been met by free taxonomic services provided by the major world centers of expertise. These services, withparticular emphasis on providing authoritative identifica- tions and related advice, continued uninterrupted as colo- nialism fell away and countries gained their independence.While these services lasted, there was no cause or motiva- tion for developing countries to invest their scarce, high- level manpower and financial resources in developing ex-pensive taxonomic capabilities. It would have been economic folly, perhaps, in view of competing demands on national budgets, to attempt to create sufficient local capabilities inthis very specialized field while such services were freely available elsewhere. Sadly, this comfortable arrangement was not to last. In 1993 to 1994, as a result of a worldwide recession and the advent of new financial policies that required developed country institutions to become income earning and self- supporting, the free services of the expert centers were with- drawn. They were replaced by a system of graduated charges for identifications and for all other services rendered, which,while favoring developing countries and being modest rela- tive to the actual costs of providing them, proved to be beyond the means of developing countries.254 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003King Overcoming the Taxonomic Impediment to Sustainable Development: BioNET-INTERNATIONAL... As a result, developing countries found themselves to varying degrees devoid of taxonomic services at the verytime when they most needed them, that is, when they, as adherents to Agenda 21 of Rio, and as signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity, were attempting to meettheir international obligations as well as national needs for development. They were faced with a taxonomic crisis, and a taxonomic impediment was created to the pursuit of na- tional programs for food security, sustainable agricultural development, conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity, human health and control ofdisease, and impact assessment. This was not unexpected. It had been foreseen in the late 1980s when donor assistance had been sought in vain tosubsidize the services needed. It was indeed out of growing concern for a solution to the forthcoming crisis that in 1991 an answer that proved acceptable to donors, expert centers,and developing countries alike was devised in the form of a global network for taxonomy. This was launched in June 1993 in the form of BioNET-INTERNATIONAL, an initia-tive for enabling developing countries to establish and sus- tain realistic self-reliance in taxonomic services, and to do so in the technically best and most cost-effective way. Purpose _______________________ The Global Network for Taxonomy, in the form of BioNET- INTERNATIONAL, is focused on assisting developing coun- tries to acquire and maintain the scientific skills, the collec-tions of organisms and their related knowledge, and the technologies needed to provide the vital taxonomic support for national programs for conservation and sustainable useof their natural resources and biodiversity and sustainableagricultural development. The Global Network is also a facilitat ing mechanism for the broader interventions needed to assist d eveloping countries to achieve full imple- mentation of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Global Network is a mechanism based first on subre- gional self-help, that is, South-South cooperation, to mobi-lize, pool, and optimize the use of existing resources, and second, on North-South Cooperation to transfer knowledge, skills, and technologies to developing subregions. The Glo-bal Network concept also envisages the provision of essen- tial taxonomic services to developing countries during their transition to self-reliance, with donor support being provided to the LOOPs as integral parts of national sustain- able development programs. Structure ______________________ The Global Network is comprised of a series of interlinked subregional networks (Locally Organized and Operated Partnerships [LOOPs]) of developing country institutions, supported by a consortium of developed country expertinstitutions (known as BIOCON) and managed by the BioNET-INTERNATIONAL Consultative Group (BICG) and its Technical Secretariat (TecSec) (fig. 1).Organization ___________________ Locally Organized and Operated Partnerships (LOOPs) The LOOPs are the very core of the Global Network. They are based on the United Nations concept of Technical Coop-eration Networks (TCNs) and are dedicated, through South- South cooperation, to mobilizing, pooling, and optimizing the use of existing taxonomic skills and resources within thesubregions for the benefit of all LOOP members. The Global Network subregions accord closely to those prescribed by the United Nations. Management of LOOPs is founded on fourfunctional levels: 1. National Institutes (NIs) are the relevant bodies within individual countries that work together as a national net- work and implement work programs. 2.National Coordinating Institutes (NACIs) are the single institutes in member countries designated to coordinate the activities of the National Institutes (NIs). 3. The LOOP Coordinating Committee (LCC) is the gov- erning body of the LOOP and is comprised of the NACIstogether with any other invited bodies. 4.Network Coordinating Institutes (NECIs) are the single member institutes of the LCC, elected to coordinate andmanage the affairs and work of the LOOP. Consortium for North-South Technical Support (BIOCON) This consortium (BIOCON) of the world's major centers of taxonomic expertise and resources is designed to provide theinformation, skills, materials, and technologies needed by developing country subregions to achieve realistic self-reli- ance in taxonomy. It is the source of technical support fordonor-funded programs for capacity building and human resource development in the BioNET-INTERNATIONAL LOOPs of the developing world ( North-South cooperation. This consortium is being created worldwide as developed country institutions begin to collaborate to make their di- verse resources available. The first subregional consortium,EuroLOOP, with some 100 institutions spread throughout 25 countries was established in 1994 and is now expanding as it embarks on the task of inventorying the resources it hasto offer to developing country LOOPs. A second BIOCON LOOP is contemplated in the Australasia region to serve the needs of the Pacific and Asian LOOPs of the Global Network. Figure 1\u2014Conceptual model of the global network.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 255King Overcoming the Taxonomic Impediment to Sustainable Development: BioNET-INTERNATIONAL... LOOPS Work Programs __________ The subregional LOOPs are initiated with four priority work programs: Establishment and Enhancement of Information and Communication Services The need often exists to update and expand hard copy library resources at designated centers of excellence (CEs) ofLOOPs (such as with major reference works, taxonomic monographs, and relevant serial journals), and information technology infrastructure may need to be provided to theseCEs for intercenter networking and linkages with the Net- work Coordinating Institutes (NECI) and TecSec. Data- bases and database access arrangements with major worldcenters need to be established, and Internet access, includ- ing e-mail facilities, are often required. Broadly speaking, an efficient information service provid- ing all relevant new and existing knowledge is needed covering traditional taxonomy, molecular techniques, new records, current biodiversity distribution maps, quarantinepest lists, incidence and threats of alien invasive introduc- tions, and relevant information on natural enemies and biological control. To facilitate this, TecSec has recentlyformed a strategic partnership with the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization based ECOPORT ini- tiative (http://www.ecoport.org) as the primary future toolfor capture, management, and dissemination of taxonomic information and knowledge for all levels of user groups. Taxonomists and Technicians Training This, the most substantial program of the LOOPs for the foreseeable future, will involve: Updating and upgrading of existing expertise throughappropriate training of the present subregional special- ists at local subregional academic and scientific centersand/or at overseas universities and institutions. Also, supplementary training is needed in specialized taxo- nomic areas, such as specific groups of economic impor-tance, agricultural pests, invasives, natural biocontrol agents, and endangered species. In particular, invasives are by definition a transboundary problem, and requiremultilateral collaboration for proactive solutions. Such solutions are a classic \"weakest link\" problem, being at the mercy of the lowest national capacity to implementagreed activities on control of invasives' movements and establishment. Training of technical support staff in preparatory tech- niques and curatorial practices, collection management, database management and information retrieval sys- tems, illustrative techniques, and development of elec-tronic products. Electronic teaching courses and train- ing material need to be provided to the CEs, and TecSec has recently commissioned production of training manu-als on CD-ROM in order to facilitate this.Rehabilitation of Collections and Establishment of New Resources These major programs address the inadequacies and needs of existing preserved and living reference collections and facilities, including buildings, storage units, working ameni- ties, security, curatorial techniques, and the sustainabilityof the physical condition of collections and their attendant records. These programs also address the taxonomic needs of collections to optimize their value as working resources forLOOPs. Development and Application of New Technologies These programs aim to make new and existing user- friendly taxonomic tools, for example, electronic aids toidentifications, and compendia, available to LOOP special- ists, and to enable LOOPs to commission and/or develop products that are tailor made for their own requirements.More electronic and paper-based identification aids need to be commissioned, and new tailormade products need to be developed jointly by overseas specialists and subregionaltaxonomists for their own requirements. The achievement of BioNET-INTERNATIONAL's objec- tives within the 10-year time horizon can only be contem- plated because of, and through, the use of new technologies \u2014 not the least electronic aids to identifications. These require first and foremost the availability of keys written by worldexperts for the groups of organisms concerned, which can then be converted into electronic forms suitable for a whole spectrum of users\u2014from the upstream researchers and tax- onomists to more downstream practitioners in areas such as human and animal health and disease services, conserva- tion biology, plant protection and biological control, quaran- tine, control of invasives, and development planning. These technologies make taxonomy more available to, and more useable by, a much larger community of scientists and technicians, and enable them to become competent in iden-tifying the organisms of relevance. Experience has shown that as such keys become available their impact leads to a demand for others, and as these keys ultimately depend onthe skills of the traditional taxonomist, the demand for these experts is also increasing. The need for taxonomists has never been greater, and their role in improving the welfareof humankind and of future generations has never been as well perceived as it is today.

Funding and the Future __________ A very supportive group of donors, including the United Nations Development Program (UNDP TC/DC) and thebilateral agencies of Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the intergovern- mental agencies of the Commonwealth Secretariat, haveenabled the Feasibility Studies and LOOP Formulation Workshops needed to establish subregional LOOPs. In this way, these LOOPs have been created with full and formalsupport by the governments concerned. They are thus ac- corded some priority in the national development plans of those who own them. Donor funds are now forthcoming fromsuch agencies as the Swiss Development and Cooperation Agency (SDC), the Department for International Develop- ment (DFID) of the United Kingdom, and the EuropeanUnion's Center for Technical and Rural Cooperation (CTA) to enable the implementation of the work programs ofestablished LOOPs. In addition, a contribution of SFr 2.9 million by the SDC to the BioNET-INTERNATIONAL FUNDhas enabled the initiation of a BioNET-INTERNATIONAL Fellowship Scheme, an Information Support Service, and has assisted the operations of the Technical Secretariat andNetwork Coordinating Institutes. The response of the international donor community to further substantial funding proposals suggest that the basicGlobal Network could be in place within the next 3 years, and full development may be completed by 2005. By that time, there should be established within the subregions ofthe developing world a substantial taxonomic resource to support national and regional programs of sustainable development. Finally, in the last few years, a number of related interna- tional initiatives have developed as recognition of the taxo- nomic impediment has spread. The Conference of the Par-ties (CoP) on the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has formulated the concept of a Global Taxonomy Initiative (GTI) to promote a concerted effort between internationalfunding agencies, national governments, and NGOs to link taxonomic capacity building to the effective implementation of the CBD. BioNET-INTERNATIONAL is working closelywith such initiatives to harness synergies and prevent duplication of efforts in building the required taxonomic capacity. Together such international initiatives may beable to overcome the Taxonomic Impediment.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 257Teresa C.

Park experts considered temporary trail closure the most suitable measure to allow recovery of the exces-sively damaged area. Nevertheless, during periodic visits to the trail, it was clear that the expected recovery had not taken place. To the contrary, problems became even more severe at the mostaffected sites even after 10 years of restricted access. The problem appears to be a lack of financial resources, the constant change in park management, and insufficient INP staff training. During the previous 10 years it was difficult to convince the public that trail closure was necessary. This area attracts many visitors. Large-scale erosion has been a serious management problem. Tem-porary trail closure to protect it from visitor impacts was in reality a substitute for more labor-intensive, effective actions that would conserve natural resources while also permitting public use. Introduction ____________________ Among the recreation management strategies to mini- mize impact, access restriction has been the most popularmeasure among Brazilian park administrators. Usually these actions have been adopted as emergency measures before the actual causes of the problem have been identified.However, conditional closing of large park areas has often prevented other strategies from being adopted. Alternative actions, including those more appropriate for recovery ofwild areas, have not usually been considered. Lack of human and financial resources has aggravated the protection of natural areas. The justification for area closures is more often that these impacts are generated from public use. When an area is opened for visitation, environmental alterations are fore-seen and are inevitable. Many times the only alternative considered has been complete closure, often including camp- sites. Hammitt and Cole (1998), however, specified thatpermanent area closures should occur only where this dras- tic measure is the only option for recovery. Before public use of natural areas became intense, trail, campsite, or area closures within some National Parks didClosure of Trails: A Restoration Strategy or Lack of Management? Teresa C. Magro not generate public reaction or discussion. Currently, signifi- cant increases in public use of parks and recreation areas have generated pressure, and public access is often reestablishedquickly. Public p ressure to expand access to new areas and new activities, often from those involved in \"radical\" sports, has also increased. There was once a certain public lethargy regarding public use of National Parks, but now the situation is far more dynamic, with greater public participation. Public displea-sure is commonly expressed when certain restrictive resto- ration measures are established, especially if they become permanent. Examples of this displeasure include electronic\"chat groups\" such as the S\u00e3o Paulo Excursion Center (c\u00e9u@yahoogroups.com) and the S\u00e3o Paulo State Mountain- eering Federation (femesp@yahoogroups.com). At Itatiaia National Park (INP), restriction on long-dis- tance trail access was implemented in 1990 for some of the more popular trails. However, those users with access per-mission (researchers, conservationists) noted that recovery was extremely slow, and in some places the erosion problems had increased. Methodologies for public use management,such as Limits of Acceptable Change (Stankey and others1985) or Visitor Impact Management (Graefe and others 1990), have clearly shown that the most efficient way to solve the problem is to identify the root causes beforemethods are adopted for environmental restoration. In the case of INP, failure to understand contributors to trail degradation on the Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarter Trail re-sulted in the selection of a less efficient and unpopular solution (Magro 1999). Trail closure failed to demonstrate significant trail recovery, as this report will illustrate. Study Area _____________________ From Initial Settlement to a National Park The Federal Government acquired the lands of INP in 1908 for the creation of two colonial towns. These towns were com- posed mainly of European immigrants, most commonly from Finland. Due to steep hillsides, these towns were not suc- cessful, and the land was returned to the Ministry of Agricul- ture. In 1929, a Biological Research Station was created thatwas administered by the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro (IBDF 1982). In 1937, this land became the first Brazilian National Park, Itatiaia National Park (INP). It is located insoutheast Rio de Janeiro State, directly south of Minas Gerais (22nd 15'S and 22nd 25'S and 44th 35' W - 44th 45' W), and the Park covers an area of 30,000 ha (116 miles). The Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarter Trail, where the study was performed, was open for about 100 years, and initially represented the only way to INP Administrative Headquar- ters (altitude about 700 m or 2,297 ft) and to the Park plateau258 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Magro Closure of Trails: A Restoration Strategy or Lack of management? (maximum altitude of 2,787 m or 9,144 ft). This trail was used initially by those who moved to the town of Mau\u00e1, andwas used by visitors who hiked or scaled one of the highest peaks in Brazil, Agulhas Negras. Later, cattle that invaded the high altitude pastures and the military that used it fortraining exercises degraded this trail. Most of the time, INP administrative maintenance practices amounted to weeding and cleaning of trails. Improvements, such as opening andcleaning of drainage channels, were rare event s. Such activi- ties, when they occurred, were more frequent before the opening of BR-485, an alternative road that would eventuallybecome the main access to the plateau. The specific objectives of INP, established in the 1982 management plan (IBDF 1982) were: (1) to protect frag-ments of the Atlantic Rainforest, (2) to provide opportuni- ties for recreation and tourism in a natural way, (3) to protect ecological diversity, (4) to provide opportunities for environ-mental education, (5) to control erosion and conserve water and air resources, (6) to conserve natural scenic beauties, (7) to provide opportunities for scientific research, (8) to protect animal species in the area, and (9) to make possible public use activities linked directly to area resources, as compatible with other objectives mentioned above. By 1990, the trail had suffered serious erosion problems, with some travel being very risky. The management solution adopted by INP administration was to close the trail tovisitor use. Garcia and Pereira's technical report (1990) was used as justification for this action. These specialists in soils considered the main problem with the Rebou\u00e7as-Headquar-ter Trail to be furrow erosion that caused severe gouging. According to these authors, the largest erosion caused along this trail was 7 m (23 ft) in depth and started from a pointthat was not drained properly. Until 2001, the Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarter Trail could be used only with special permis- sion from INP. Another backcountry area was temporarily closed to the public in 2001 after a fire consumed about 600 ha (2.3 miles 2) of natural vegetation. Again, a technical report on this fire was used as justification for area closure. According toRibeiro (2001), closing the burnt area to visitation was a crucial measure to guarantee recovery until an action plan was developed. The report recognized that closure hadimpacts on the local economy, such as with hotels and specialized guides, and suggested that this strategy be used only temporarily. This recent closure, as well as closure ofthe Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarter Trail, generated a lot of criticism and protests from excursionists and mountaineers. Methodology ___________________ Institutional Capacity to Administer the Area We considered the administrative or institutional capaci- ties as the ability of INP to successfully solve challenges related to the Park mission. The fundamental maintenanceobjectives for Brazilian National Parks, according to the National System of Parks and Conservation Units (MMA 2000) are: pr eserving nat ural ecosystems of great ecologi- cal relevance and s cenic beauty, facilitating scientific re- search, developing educatio nal activities and envi ronmentalinterpretation, and increasing public contact with nature, which includes ecotourism. Once the INP mission was defined during park creation in 1937, management actions should respect these goals. How- ever, considering the current situation in restricted areas,INP administration has not been successful. We observed that the lack of Park financial resources, constant adminis- trative changes, and insufficient training of Park staff havecontributed to this failure. Administrative documents were analyzed to identify Park management activities that could have contributed to attaining their mission. Thirty-four annual reports were consulted, which con- tained details of management actions executed from 1937 to 1983. In addition to these documents, three former ParkDirectors were interviewed: Mr. Wanderbilt Duarte de Barros (1940 to 1956), Mr. Pedro Eymard Camelo Melo (1991 to 1995), and Carlos Fernando Pires of Souza (April to Septem-ber, 1995). Visitor registrations at the \"Apple Tree Shelter\" were used to estimate trail users from 1928 to 1934, and from 1936 to 1950, and information related to the frequency andform of use of the Rebou\u00e7as- Headquarter trail was obtained. In these books, INP service and trail maintenance activities were also noted. Results and Discussion __________ Park Maintenance and Administration The first INP administrators presented annual reports to the Forest Service. These documents contain information that shows changes in management and the historical devel-opment of public use in this area, including current condi-tions. These documents establish approximate dates for construction of existing trails, shelter construction, and area maintenance. Using this data, we were able to correlatesome problems with the Annual Maintenance Reports (AMRs). Annual Maintenance Reports from 1937 to 1983 were consulted. From 1940 to 1960 there was a certain regularity and uniformity for the presentation of information. Unfortu- nately, the regular reports stopped in 1970. Documents for1953, 1961, 1972 to 1978, and 1980 to 1982 were not present in the official files. To obtain complementary information, we consulted other documents, such as requested services,employee problems, or visitor complaints, in addition to spreadsheets with visitor numbers. Less simple than AMR analysis, but indispensable for our conclusions, was infor-mation about institutional parameters. In the first years of INP, emphasis was on areas near the administrative building, such as the gardens, surroundingreforestation and general maintenance. This was probably due to two factors: the need for headquarter establishment and the agricultural focus of the previous immigrant colony.Area recovery occupied much time; besides planting arbo- real species, the gardens, filled with rosebushes, had to be maintained. Seedlings produced in the Park nursery forrestoration and horticulture, including many exotic species, were donated to local institutions and to the Forest Service Administration in Rio de Janeiro. These activities demandedtime and consumed many resources.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 259Magro Closure of Trails: A Restoration Strategy or Lack of management? The need to maintain the administrative headquarters and permanent infrastructure in good condition was alsoimportant. The Vargas Presidency (from 1930 to 1945) used the Park as a showplace for diplomats who visited Brazil. When the Federal Capital was in Rio de Janeiro, INP andSerra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park represented an excellent view of wild Brazil. Many authorities and diplomats entered the Park while visiting Rio de Janeiro, as verified by reportsand the visitor registration books. Other community services were also noted, such as an elementary school, church, electric and phone facility main-tenance, internal roads, and access to the city of Itatiaia. Horses and mules were used in Park maintenance and surveillance, and feeding of these animals was often bynatural foraging as well as by raising corn. The garden, whose maintenance was time and labor intensive, was reformed in 1943, to simplify and conserve operations. On the other hand, few maintenance activities on the plateau were required, and those that were focused mainly on the studied trail. When this trail was the fastest way tothe plateau, it was maintained with certain regularity. However, when the highway was opened with access to the Agulhas Negras, the importance of the trail decreased.Employee records indicated that maintenance of the Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarter trail was sporadic after BR-485, the new road to the plateau, was opened. Severe erosion, especially the 7-m (23-ft) gully that had motivated trail closing happened by 1979, according to an employee annual report. Beginning in 1971, the AMRs donot mention trail maintenance activities. Employees prob- ably cleared vegetation, mainly in forest areas, but the activity was not constant. Contributing to erosion were firesthat hindered vegetation recovery. Is Visitation in Itatiaia National Park Really a Problem? Serrano (1993) found a series of historical documents regarding the first Park users. Using Park registrations, about 2,700 people entered INP from 1925 to 1947. Unfortu-nately, this number does not accurately represent visita- tions because many people did not sign the visitor books. In addition, several documents that contained this type ofinformation have been lost. Within Park registrations, ori- gin or nationality was possible to verify, and most visitors at that time were foreigners (70 percent). Between 1937 and 1947, INP AMRs showed an average of 30,049 visitors annually. There were only 4,523 visitors in 1946, but there was a jump of 10,000 visitors in 1947. Asobserved by Wanderbilt Duarte de Barros, a former INP administrator, soon after the Second World War visitation of INP increased markedly. From registrations and other documents, we estimated visitation from the creation of INP (fig. 1). The data corre- sponding to 1951, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1972, and from 1976 to1985, however, were not found in INP files. Visitation values from 1990 to 1997 are more reliable (fig. 2) due to better control at the main Park entrances. However, the valuesreflect people that paid to enter INP and not the total number of visitors. Those under 10 years old, adults above 70years, school excursions, researchers, and authorities are exempt from paying the entrance fee. People who hiked the Itatiaia plateau represented about 10 percent of total Park visitors. This is due not only to the attractiveness (waterfalls) of the surroundings of the head-quarters, but also the limited infrastructure for receiving visitors and the difficulty of access to the plateau. Access can be better in autumn and winter with the onset of rain. The Itatiaia National Park is strategically located be- tween Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Belo Horizonte, and attracts a larger number of tourists than the Park canhandle. But visitation can be considered low when compared with other Brazilian Parks, such as Igua\u00e7u or Tijuca Na- tional Parks that receive about a million visitors annually.However, the visitation in Itatiaia is limited to few sites, on weekends, holidays, and school vacations. Part of the low capacity of INP is due to the small staff and limited financialresources. Military Training and Cattle There are controversies regarding the effects of military training on current conditions on the Rebou\u00e7as-Headquar- ter Trail. The Agulhas Negras Military Academy has been Figure 1\u2014Total visitation in Itatiaia National Park from 1937 to 2000. Registrations corresponding 1951, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1972, and 1976 to 1985 were not found (source: INP Administration). Figure 2\u2014Visitation to Itatiaia National Park from 1990 to 1997.

Park employee depositions have indicated that many impacts were causedby troops, numbering more than 500 men at a time, who used the plateau for military training. A colonel interviewed for this research argued that the training did not happen ontrails, but was dispersed and occurred mainly in the Rebou\u00e7as Shelter. However, we found old artillery pieces, such as rifle cartridges and a cannon reducer, on the trail, indicating thatsome activity happened on the trail and its environs. Use of heavy boots, bulky equipment, and food by the military during training has aggravated problems here.Certainly the continuous use of the trail contributed to soil compaction and trailbed damage in the most susceptible passages, where it is steep with high soil clay content. The use of the area as a natural cattle pasture and the constant fires that happened during the drought also con- tributed to the damage in some less resilient sites. Inaddition, frost also exists here, leaving the vegetation more drought and fire susceptible, and less resistant to trampling by cattle. Dusen (1955) studied the flora of Itatiaia in 1902,and indicated that fire was used as a technique for maintain- ing cattle pastures. The researcher observed the effect that fires had on vegetation, and he noted that the common frostsusually dried and damaged local flora. Some plants occurred in great abundance in burned areas, while in the areas without burning, there were only two sterile species. Dusenconsidered that plant development favored the burned areas because the black soil would absorb larger amounts of heat, in comparison with areas that were not burnt. Successive trampling and soil compaction by cattle, along with decreased trail maintenance, were probably respon- sible for soil structure destruction and increased susceptibil-ity to erosion. Cattle tracks concentrated water toward themain trail, reducing drainage. Another factor linked to trail damage was mule and horse use for transport in the area. Besides the use of horses to carry luggage, constructionmaterials were also transported. According to the 1949 AMR, mules made 1,460 trips to transport the construction material required to build the Massena Shelter, located onthe INP plateau. Political Changes and Park Administration Finally, we considered the Park as a whole\u2014its history, use, management, and politics, including political adminis- trative changes during the last decade. The Itatiaia Na-tional Park had been endowed with a representative infra- structure, employee houses, well-equipped hiking shelters, a restaurant for the staff, laundry, museum, and a set ofroads and trails to permit multiple use. When Rio de Janeiro was the Federal capital, more attention was given to INP, and it was easier to obtain the necessary financial resources. In 1964, the Federal capital was moved to Bras\u00edlia, and the importance of INP decreased markedly. Once the capital was no longer Rio de Janeiro, the Park stopped attractingnational and international attention. Park administration began to receive fewer resources, and had less political weight with politicians in Bras\u00edlia. According to reports by former employees, the situation in INP worsened during the Military Regime (1964 to 1985) because many bureaucratic positions, such as in the BrazilianInstitute of Forest Development (IBDF, now the BrazilianEnvironment and Renewable Natural Resources Institute, IBAMA), were held by generals or military officers with notraining or understanding of the environment. With no sensitivity to conservation of natural resources and without the necessary technical knowledge required to manage apark, problems began to multiply. There was no fuel money for park surveillance vehicles, no new employees were re- cruited after older employees retired, and there was nomoney for maintenance. In addition, park vandalism in- creased due to lack of surveillance and the increase of unemployment. During this period, 12 new National Parks were created, and it was necessary to divide the maintenance resources between the new National Parks and 15 Parks already inexistence. Employee recruitment was centralized and only performed in Bras\u00edlia. This estrangement between Federal bureaucrats and the INP administration (who previouslyanswered only to their superiors in Rio de Janeiro) pre- vented efficient INP management. Federal Government bureaucratic growth during the Mili- tary Regime caused IBDF to become swollen with many employees, complicating simple decisions. This meant that while INP lacked active employees, many supervisors andadministrators remained in Bras\u00edlia or Rio de Janeiro, decreasing park efficiency. Money collected from entrance and parking fees went to Bras\u00edlia and was effectively lost\u2014few of these fees were returned to INP for improvement and maintenance of existing infrastructure. Budget cuts were more drastic during the New Republic, starting in 1985. Even with the increased concern by the Federal Government for the environment, there were large budget cuts, with \"bureaucratic downsizing,\" necessitatedafter the excesses of the Military Regime. Employee num-bers were reduced so that today there are only 33 permanent employees to take care of 30,000 ha (116 miles 2), and most of these are administrative employees. In addition, there hasbeen very little investment in employee training and ongo- ing education, which has also harmed the efficiency of area maintenance. Happily, this situation is reversing currently. Conclusions____________________ There was not a substantial recovery in the Rebou\u00e7as- Headquarter Trailbed following its closing in 1990, and in some places problems were accentuated. We consider twomain reasons for lack of success: (1) no attempts were made to increase vegetation recovery, and (2) the trail was never really closed, remaining open for special groups and militarytraining. Analysis of documents and administrative reports revealed events that allowed continuous trail use and poor decisions made by INP administrators. Besides physicallimitations, institutional parameters are necessary for the evaluation of public use impact in natural areas. These factors, planning, and maintenance techniques are essentialif correct decisions and appropriate practices are to be established.

Some of the trails will take a long time to recover,and some may even show worse conditions after a few years. The ability to choose the best strategy to restore vegetation and soil quality will help managers save scarce financial resources that canthen be used in other conservation actions. A seedbank test, to- gether with soil analysis, seems to be helpful in this task. Most currently used management actions are not specific to differentsites on the same trail. In this study, results of a seedbank test showed the sites that recovered best were those with soils contain- ing a high concentration of organic material and nutrients. Some-times only the presence of organic material was enough to enable recovery, showing that fertilization is not always necessary. We also identified areas where more active restoration was needed, includ-ing soil transplanting. Considering all the results, we were able to recommend the best management strategy for each site, and which we expect to achieve the best results in trail recovery. Introduction ____________________ Closure of trails and camping sites are used to help recov- ery of highly impacted sites where continued use would belimiting to the success of recovery management practices. Despite the use of specific techniques, which may range from soil quality enhancement to seedling transplanting andirrigation, the results vary considerably from area to area. In general, restoration techniques, other than simply closing areas, are costly. These expenses vary from highcosts, such as the establishment of an irrigation system to promote plant growth, to low costs, such as fence or barrier construction (Hammitt and Cole 1998). When managementpractices are based on evidences of their success, the recov- ery of impacted sites can be faster and more efficient. During the past few years, several scientists have investigated howthe factors inherent to an area respond to management practices. This knowledge can provide useful indicators for the selection process of the most adequate recovery tech-nique for individual sites.Seedbank as a Tool for Choosing the Better Strategy for Trail Recovery Teresa Cristina Magro Jos\u00e9 Leonardo de Moraes Gon\u00e7alves Zabinski and Cole (2000) addressed this question in a study that identified the limiting factors to revegetationsuccess in impacted recreation sites. They selected high altitude sites, with characteristics of moderate to high stress, short growth period, and poor soils that could be limiting toall revegetation stages. Results showed that revegetation was limited by a combination of several factors. One factor was availability of propagules, since there was an increasein seedling numbers when seeds were added. There were noticeable limitations during seed germination and seedling initial establishment, suggesting that environmental condi-tions are important to this stage's success. Soil treatments had no significant effect on seedling numbers and growth, indicating that microclimatic differences, including lightpatterns and water drainage, may be the primary limiting factor. Cole and Spildie (2000) also provided additional informa- tion about factors limiting natural recovery rates and the efficacy of selected techniq ues in accelerating recovery. They evaluated the influence of specific techniques: (1) soilamendment through organic matt er use, specifically sew- age and soil inoculation; (2) transplanting and seeding using native local species; and (3) application of a superficial litter layer on the establishment, survival, and growth of thevegetation. Campsites investigated were closed and signed, and no apparent indication of use was observed during the study period. The results obtained indicated that, in general,adopted recovery techniques were highly effective. The su- perficial litter layer did not have a clear effect and varied with plant growth seasons. According to the authors, cli-matic conditions could have influenced the results obtained. Hammitt and Cole (1998) suggested that recovery periods are highly variable. The recovery period includes vegetationreestablishment, and in some cases, even recovery of the soil's physical conditions, such as elimination of soil compaction. The results from the studies above, in conjunction with our field observations, lead us to believe that local conditions strongly determine the success or failure of restoration techniques. In addition to local conditions, the intensity ofwhich soil characteristics are modified may also yield differ- ent results. In all restoration projects in mining areas or trails, the preliminary and foremost step to guarantee plantestablishment is the recovery or enhancement of the soil's physical and chemical conditions. Generally, soils of severely impacted areas have low or- ganic matter and high soil compaction, which restrict plant development. Furthermore, a poor or nonexistent seedbank will influence the results of recovery strategies. Campsitesand trails that are closed with no other improvement mea- sures taken can exhibit a negative result and a longer recov- ery time.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 263Magro and Goncalves Seedbank as a Tool for Choosing the Better Strategy for Trail Recovery Study Area _____________________ In 1937, Itatiaia National Park (INP) was the first park created in Brazil. It is located southeast of Rio de Janeiro State and directly south of Minas Gerais (22 15'S and 22 25'S and 44 35'W - 44 45'W); the Park covers an area of 30,000 ha (116 miles2). The study was conducted in the Itatiaia plateau, which presents an annual average temperature of 11.4 C (53 F), a maximum temperature of 21.4 C (71 F) in February, and a minimum temperature of -6.4 C (20 F) in July. Intense frosts are common during the winter season, often with hailand rare brief snowfalls (IBDF 1982). The average precipi- tation is approximately 2,400 mm (94 inches). The region's original vegetation has been under intense human influ-ence, mainly between 1908 and 1918, when there was an agrarian colony where the INP area is today. Meadows in the plateau region have been successively burned to improvecattle pasture (IBAMA 1994). Vegetation in the uplands is typical of the meadow ecosys- tem, considered a fragile ecosystem for anthropogenic uses.Its floristic com position varies according to ecological condi- tions, consisting predominately of grasses but also containing a great number of bromeliads, cactuses, and orchids (IBAMA 1994). There are some endemic species, such as the brome- liad Fernseca itatiaia , a , and Hydrocotyle quinqueloba study was conducted at Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarter trail, which was opened approximately 100 years ago and was the only access from INP administrative headquarters (altitude about 700 m [2,297 ft]) to the park plateau (a maximumaltitude of 2,787 m [9,144 ft]). Horses were used to carry luggage, equipment, and materials for shelter construction. Researchers and the first alpinists in search of one of thehighest peaks in Brazil, Pico das Agulhas Negras, most intensively used the trail. Trail maintenance was achieved through weeding and construction of rainwater drainagechannels. Also, military operations were stationed in the area for decades, with up to 500 troops. Nowadays, these activities are restricted to few troops. Trail use by touristshas been prohibited since 1990 due to its degradation. Besides the factors listed above, the use of the area for cattle ranching and the constant fires during the dry seasonhave contributed to environmental impacts in less resistant areas. In addition, the occurrence of natural frosts in the region causes vegetation to be dry and more susceptible tofire and cattle trampling (Magro 1999). Methodology ___________________ Field surveys were carried out during 1995 and 1996 at Itatiaia National Park. Seedbank germination tests and soilanalysis were conducted Escola Superior Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz in Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. Transects were installed along a 6,500-m (4-mile) section, selected from thetotal 22 km (13.6 miles) Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarters trail.Trailbed Characteristics Part of the soil samples collected for the seedbank trials were used in the physical and chemical analyses. Severalsoil characteristics were evaluated: pH in CaCl2, organic matter, available P (2) (P-resin), exchangeable base-forming cations (K, Ca, and Mg), exchangeable H and Al, sum ofbases (2), cation exchange capacity (T(4)), base saturation (V(5)), Al saturation, particle size analysis, bulk and particle soil densities, and total soil pore spaces. Soil textural classes were classified by percentages of sand, silt, and clay found (Curi 1993). The identified classes were described as (a) sandy clay loam: soil with 20 to 35percent clay, less than 28 percent silt and 45 percent or more sand; (b) clay loam: soil with 27 to 40 percent clay and 20 to 45 percent sand; (c) sandy clay: soil with 35 percent or moreclay and 45 percent or more sand; and (d) clay: soil with 40 percent or more clay, less than 45 percent sand, and less than 40 percent silt. To measure the topsoil's mechanical resistance, a Lang penetrometer was used. The penetrometer is a standard, cone-tipped rod that is pushed into the soil. A ring isdisplaced while the rod is driven into the soil and a scale at the top of the rod gives the measurement. Numbers 1 to 19 indicate the resistance level to penetration. The higher thenumber, the harder the topsoil (1-4 64.5-71.7 Kgf/cm2 = hard). The a verage of five measurements in each sampling unit was calculated. Measurements of soil compaction were not takenin vegetation sampling areas to avoid damage or distur-bance to plants being used in monitoring studies. Parallel declivity was measured in degrees along the trail, following a walking direction. Declivity was measured by placing an Abney level on top of a piece of wood parallel to the trail. Perpendicular declivity was taken transversely to the trail's walking direction, also in degrees. Seedbank To evaluate the vegetation's regeneration capacity along the bed trail, germination tests were conducted using seed- bank samples collected in permanent sampling units during 1996. In each plot there were three samples in a 20 x 20 x 5 cm area. The topsoil layer was scraped in case branches; stones and live or dead plants were found. Part of the collected seedbank soil was submitted to physical and chemi-cal analyses. The resulting data were then compared to the seedbank germination results. Samples were submitted to germination tests and kept in rectangular aluminum trays (15 x 27.5 cm [6 x 11 inches]), totaling 39 plots (13 treatments x 3 repetitions). Trays were air exposed and sprinkler irrigated twice a day. The numberof germinated plants in each tray were counted weekly and classified as: (1) monocotyledonous, (2) dicotyledonous, or (3) moss. Observations lasted 14 weeks and were concluded as soon as the number of plants per tray began stabilizing or decreasing. Contamination in the nursery was prevented by periodi- cally monitoring three control trays containing washed and sterilized sand, distributed among the samples.264 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Magro and Goncalves Seedbank as a Tool for Choosing the Better Strategy for Trail Recovery Results and Discussion __________ Trailbed Characteristics Compaction, topsoil erosion, and the decline of vegetation cover along trailbeds contributed to a substantial reduction of organic matter content in the soil. In high declivity areas, the establishment of new plants was difficult, in part, due toremoval of seeds and plantlets by the rain. The few seedlings able to survive could not find favorable establishment condi- tions because of low water and nutrient availability, causedby soil erosion and compaction, which in turn, reduced the water infiltration rate. Table 1 shows that samples with the least bare soil tended to be less steep areas and also have less superficial soil compac- tion. Physical characteristics are shown in table 2. These rela- tionships will be discussed later with the results obtained in the seedbank analysis.Settergreen and Cole (1970) observed that recreational use pressure affects soil characteristics differently; thesedifferences will define certain limitations to normal vegeta- tion growth and development. The most significant differ- ences were soil compaction and the elimination of vegetationcover that protects the soil surface. Soil compaction and stone buildup in heavily visited areas have characteristics similar to those of impervious surfaces, therefore reducingwater infiltration capacity and increasing erosion caused by runoff. These authors believe that topsoil compaction has a greater effect on smaller grasses and herbaceous speciesthan on trees and shrubs. Results obtained by Takahashi (1998) indicated that soil resistance to penetration 5 to 10 cm (2 x 4 inches) deep in Salto Morato Natural Reserve, in the State of Paran\u00e1, was the variable that best distinguished the trail from an area with no use. This result corroborates other findings demon strating that soil's resistance to penetration is a sound and valuable indicator for monitoring soil conditions.

Trail management practices will also determine whether continuous use may cause an undesirable level ofimpact for specific site conditions. Management options include construction of rainwater drainage channels, peri- odic maintenance, construction of ramps in flood-prone claysoils, as well as others. The intensity of compaction can also be a good indicator of management practices in an area. Despite constant use onthe Rebou\u00e7as-Headquarters trail, some areas presented serious erosion problems, whereas others were perfectly conserved. This is due to the trail's large soil spatial variabil-ity and to declivity. Seedbank Identified species are listed in table 3; some of them were identified only at the family level. Germination test results confirmed field observations regarding the trail's regenera-tion potential. In sites where runoff removed topsoil, germi- nation was not significant (point 9) because it also removed seeds and nutrients essential to plant development andgrowth. On the other hand, large soil surfaces were covered by vegetation in sample points 6, 7, 8, and 13 (table 4). Because the germination of Phyllantus tenellus and Chanaesyce hirta was detected in the sterilized sand control tray, the possibility of soil contamination with seeds from adjacent areas exists. The majority of species in the seedbank germination test grew either in clusters or parallel to the soil, a strategy that favors their development in the trailbed. These strategies allow some plants to better survive trampling, as noted byLiddle (1991) and Cole (1993), and could explain the higher frequency of Plantago and Guaphalium spathulatum Lam. in the center of the trail. The following species belonging to the Plantaginaceae Family were identified: Plantago dielsianaPilger, Plantago guilleminiana Decaisne, Plantago hirtella Kunth, and Plantago tomentosa Lam. Tables 5 and 6 show that at locations with higher germi- nation success, the chemical analysis revealed soils with medium and high P, K, Ca, and organic matter contentsessential to good plant development. Also, soil organic mat- ter and nutrients were not carried by runoff in these three points because of the low parallel declivity of the trail: 0, 1,0, and 1, respectively (table 1). Table 7 shows the results of the analysis of correlation between the number of plants in the seedbank and the mostimportant physical and chemical soil characteristics forplant growth. Parameters were analyzed using Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation. There was a positive correla- tion between (1) seedling density and organic matter contentand (2) P availability in the soil. The correlation between the number of plants and soil compaction was not evident in this analysis probably due to other more limiting soil character-istics. Chappell and others (1971) verified that N and P contents were not significant in three zones under different trampling intensities. Similarly, the pH, C/N ratio, ironcontent, and ammonium-nitrate balance were not signifi- cant in these areas. Takahashi (1998) verified a high correlation between the natural regeneration of vegetation and carbon content and soil density. On the other hand, the author did not find a strong correlation between regeneration and soil compac-tion intensity. According to her, it is likely this factor has not yet caused a noticeable regeneration decline in the studied area. One management practice used in compacted and low regeneration areas is topsoil scarification to stimulate a rapid plant cover development. In dry areas, a water in-crease has a beneficial effect on plants in compacted soils; however, compacted soils may continue to be a limiting factor to seedling establishment (Liddle and Greig-Smith1975). These authors recommend lessening the tension in the trail's topsoil layers as a recuperation technique, even though the subsoil might still be compacted.Table 3\u2014Seedling occurrence in the nursery experiment.

Compaction Bulk density Organic material P K Ca g and Goncalves Seedbank as a Tool for Choosing the Better Strategy for Trail Recovery Conclusions and Recommendations ______________ The low presence of vegetation along Rebou\u00e7as-Head- quarters trailbed is due to a poor seedbank (nonexistent insome parts) and to a soil poor in nutrients and organic matter. The fact that seeds did not germinate in some trail parts, even though they germinated in trays, is probablyassociated with highly compacted soils and a nutrient- impoverished en vironment. Topsoil removal in the germina- tion tests decreased trailbed compaction, which in turn, mighthave favored ger mination of some plants. To recover vegeta- tion in trails with little or no seedbank present, we recom- mend direct seeding or planting of seedlings collected innearby areas, following topsoil scarification (approximately 20 cm [8 inches]). Pl anting should be conducted with good soil temperature and humidity conditions. Establishment of moni- toring plots to evaluate vegetation recovery is recommended. Management and Future Use______ For trail recovery and maintenance we recommend these practical suggestions: Bed relocation at problematic sites \u2014Even with trail use evenly spread on trails, there are sites in goodcondition and sites in critical shape. Some trail sites should simply be abandoned, while others should be opened, avoiding, however, high declivity areas some-times prone to erosion. Runoff should be diverted away from the trailbed, thereby reducing eventual soil losses and providing better conditions for vegetation recovery. Trail and bifurcations' recovery \u2014Some trail and bi- furcation recovery practices include monitoring reveg- etation, soil scarification, seeding, fertilizing, and trans- planting. In addition, barriers or burlap installed onseeded or transplanted areas can increase recovery success and at the same time discourage area use.

What was once domi- nated by the equivalent of electronic brochures has developed into interactive information resources that together provide a widerange of useful information. Web sites specific to the concept of \"wilderness\" are dominated by United States organizations. The term \"protected areas\" is better suited to find the sites of the majorglobal organizations that influence the conservation of wilderness. While there are many good sites on the Web, it is still challenging for a person to find relevant topical information at a global orregional level. Search results also suggest that the technical net- work developing around the terms \"wilderness\" and \"protected areas\" remain separate. We evaluate several scenarios for thedevelopment of a more coherent global presence of protected areas and wilderness on the Web. We also suggest the development of a global clearinghouse that approaches the global supply of informa-tion about wilderness and protected areas from the user perspective rather than from the agenda of the organizations that are producing the information. Introduction ____________________ Freimund and Queen (1996) argued that Web-based mass communication could have a profound effect upon develop-ing a wilderness constituency and culture. After reviewing many wilderness related Web sites on the World Wide Web (WWW), they called for an integrated online strategy tofacilitate communication across the Internet. The end result of this strategizing was the creation of the Wilderness Information Network (http://www.wilderness.net). This Website has been very effective in bringing information about wilderness areas to the World. With over 6,000 hits per day, the Web site has provided an important niche to peopleinterested in wilderness information. In this paper, we wish to reexamine the presence of wilderness on the WWW. Our goal is to identify which sitesare being used and what the purpose of these sites are, including mission, audience, and financial support.Where in the World Wide Web Is Wilderness? Charles Besancon Wayne A. Freimund In 1996, there was a sense that many people needed to be persuaded of the benefits of the Web. Given the success of the Wilderness.Net project and the proliferation of wilderness-oriented Web sites, we no longer feel that need. Resources _____________________ Searching for Wilderness on the World Wide Web It is no surprise that the resources on the WWW have proliferated at an amazing rate. Human behavior, on the other hand, has not dramatically changed, and most Web visitors are only willing to scan a couple of pages of resultsfrom a search when seeking information. Given the increas- ingly commercialized use of the Web, Webmasters have become increasingly savvy on techniques to improve thechance of being rated toward the top of a search. In other words, the sites that appear at the top of a search engine do not necessarily reflect the value of the site. To address these issues, researchers at Stanford Univer- sity have developed Google.com. Google uses a rating system that is based on the number of times a site is linked to and the popularity of the sites doing the linking. For example,the Wilderness.Net site rates very high because it is linked to by many well-established wilderness organizations or agencies. Likewise, it provides links to other sites that arehighly used and rated. Google has remained detached from the influence of advertising or other commercial interests to provide a site that is a high-integrity research tool. Thus, asearch on Google, while not perfect, often returns a set of discrete sites that are specifically related to the topic and are highly used. Wilderness Sites \u2014Our first search was simply on the word \"wilderness.\" The top site returned was from theWilderness Society. The second was Wilderness.Net, which provides access to a consortium of wilderness organizations, including the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute,the Arthur Carhart Wilderness Training Center, and the University of Montana's wilderness programs. The next two sites were not related to wilderness in terms of land designa-tion. The remainder of the sites in the top 10 included: the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, Wilderness Inquiry, the Chicago Wilderness Page, the Wild Wilderness HomePage, and two non-American sites\u2014the Wilderness Society of Australia, and the Canadian Park and Wilderness Soci- ety. Included in the top 10, therefore, were a host of interests(federal and university) represented by Wilderness.Net, six advocacy organizations\u2014with two of those being non-United States, an adventure travel organization, and two sitestotally unrelated to wilderness as a land use.USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003 269Where in the World Wide Web Is Wilderness? Besancon and Freimund International Wilderness Sites \u2014To add context to these initial results, we searched on the words \"interna-tional wilderness.\" The first site retrieved was the WILD foundation, followed by the International Journal of Wilder- ness, Wilderness.Net, and the Wilderness Society's Globalpage. These sites were followed by Sunrise Expeditions to Arctic Canada, the Word of Life Fellowship International Wilderness Ministries, International Wilderness First Aid,North Carolina Outward Bound, and the Listening Point Foundation. Again, the top results were dominated by United States organizations that represent a wide variety of inter-ests in wilderness. Protected Areas Searches \u2014Recognizing that many other large international players in wilderness conservation did not surface near the top of these searches, we decided to narrow our lexicon from \"wilderness\" to \"protected areas.\"Through this term we accessed a very different set of results. At the top of the list was the array of resources offered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) World Commission onProtected Areas. The Marine Protected Areas site provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) followed. Next was the United Nations Environ-ment Programme (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre and the Protected Areas Conservation Trust of Belize, Central America. This initial search was filled out by theScience and Management of Protected Areas Association, which is based in eastern Canada. Searching on the term \"protected areas,\" therefore, provided a list of sites more fo- cused on protection mechanisms than the wilderness concept. Review of Selected Protected Area Web Sites To better understand the design and range of content now available on the Web, we conducted a review of se- lected sites. The sites were chosen based on the largeamount of information to be found there and the relative importance of the organization or coalition that compiled the information. The sites reviewed here represent the bestglobal Web sites the authors could find for detailed infor- mation about protected areas (including wilderness). The specific Web sites listed should not be considered the onlyresources available or the best. They simply reflect sites that ranked highly using the Google search engine and some we discovered by following links on other Web sites.The sites selected for review were the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), Wilderness.Net, World Heri- tage Information Network UNEP World Conser- vation Monitoring Centre (WCMC). As a first step in our review, we tried to answer the fol- lowing questions: What is the mission of the sponsoring organization? What is the function of the site? How is the site organized? Who is/are the audience(s)? Who funds the organization/Web site? How can we categorize the site? World Commission on Protected Areas (http:// wcpa.iucn.org) \u2014This site is sponsored by the WorldCommission on Protected Areas, part of the IUCN. The mission of the commission is to: ...promote the establishment and effective management of a worldwide representative network of terrestrial and marine protected areas, as an integral contribution to the IUCN mission. Members of the WCPA are the audience for this site, and the site includes many documents for download, including guide-lines for creating and managing protected areas, funding them, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. This site details plans for increased interactivity, but in itscurrent form, acts as an online brochure for WCPA. Wilderness.Net (http://www.wilderness.net) \u2014This site is managed by the Wilderness Institute at the Univer- sity of Montana, U.S.A., with support from the four Federal agencies that manage congressionally designated wilder-ness in the United States, and their training (Arthur Carhart Wilderness Training Center) and research (Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute) organizations. The missionof the site is to \"heighten the wilderness dialog worldwide.\" The Web site is organized by content areas, including educa- tion, research, and the National Wilderness PreservationSystem. Audiences include managers, scientists, educators, students, legislators, and the general public. Many interac- tive features can be found here, including a library of full-text research publications, lesson plans for students and teachers about wilderness, wilderness news, and discussion forums. World Heritage Information Network (http://www. unep-wcmc.org/whin/index.html) \u2014This site is spon- sored by the World Heritage Convention through the UnitedNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The mission of the site is to act as: ...a clearing-house for information about the natural and cultural sites identified as being of \"outstanding universal value\" and inscribed on the World Heritage List by theIntergovernmental World Heritage Committee. The clearinghouse is set up as a searchable index of partner Web sites that house information about World Heritage sites. Interactive features on the site include the ability toadd your resource to the searchable index of World Heritage sites and to search other partner sites. EarthTrends (http://earthtrends.wri.org) \u2014This site is sponsored by the World Resources Institute (WRI), \"an environmental think tank that goes beyond research tofind practical ways to protect the Earth and improve peoples' lives,\" and acts as an environmental information portal. The content is organized around themes includingcoastal and marine ecosystems, climate and atmosphere, and biodiversity, and protected areas. For each theme there is a searchable database, data tables, country pro-files, maps, and features. UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) (http://www.unep-wcmc.org) \u2014The WCMC Web site was another ambitious undertaking involving many interactive features including databases and online map-ping, as well as many static Web pages with supporting information. The content is organized around resources, habitats, species, regions, climate change, protected areas,270 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-27. 2003Besancon and Freimund Where in the World Wide Web Is Wilderness? conventions, and agreements. This site also hosts the Pro- tected Areas Virtual Library. This library is a database ofinformation about all areas that meet the guidelines put forth by the IUCN in 1994. This database does not currently operate as intended, but comes with a disclaimer explainingits shortcomings and plans for the future. The interactive maps on this site are of high quality and utilize the latest in online map browser technology: ARCIMS. Looking at the matrix of Web sites we reviewed (table 1), it is evident that the era of \"brochure\" Web sites is over. All of the Web sites reviewed contain a great deal of informationand most utilize built-in search engines, enabling Web site visitors to quickly find what they are looking for. The intended audiences for these sites range from the organiza-tion members (WCPA) to the WCMC that hosts very special- ized content for technical audiences, including avian biolo- gists. EarthTrends and Wilderness.Net contain informationfor many different audiences. Two of the sites listed offer the added feature of Web pages and documents in languages other than English. Three of the sites have interactive resources that help to build community among Web site visitors (Wilderness.Net, EarthTrends, and WCMC). These community-building re-sources include discussion forums, Listservs, and news delivered through e-mail. Other interactive resources we found were online databases and geographic mapping en-gines (WCMC). In general, we found good resources containing informa- tion on many topics. However, the fact that so many re-sources exist creates in itself a problem. Fulfilling specific information needs from within such an array of possibilities can be frustrating or impossible. It is now like walking intoa library that has no librarian. Wilderness Versus Protected Areas Disconnect As mentioned earlier, there seems to be two discrete sets of results when using Google to search for \"wilderness\" and \"protected areas.\" While the term \"wilderness\" refers tomore than land-base d protected areas, \"protected areas\" is more likely to lead to sites explaining protection mechanisms. Individuals seeking high-quality information about mecha- nisms for protection of wilderness, policy documents, and so forth, may not understand this distinction.Toward a Strategy of Protected Area Information Coordination The libraries of documents on these sites reflect the affiliations and work being conducted by the host organiza- tions. While the content is often excellent, and in many cases is supplemented by Web links to other organizations withsimilar content, the onus of responsibility for finding good information is put on the Web site visitor, the very person for whom the information was put online in the first place. What is missing is a coherent, searchable global resource or some other form of guide to the galaxy of wild lands and the Internet. The WHIN project comes the closest to makingthis need a reality, at least for World Heritage sites. By collecting information about World Heritage resources on the Internet, and indexing those sites, the WHIN projectallows Web visitors to search through one interface\u2014many hundreds of external Web pages and documents. A coherent, searchable global resource could take re- sources from any content source, gather those resources in one location, and organize the content based on content type, audience, and level of intended specificity. In addition, sucha resource could help to simplify and indeed blur the lines between the institutions and organizations that produced the information. This is especially important to the uniniti-ated who may not be familiar with all of the jargon inherent in a complex concept like wilderness. The current challenge is to develop an efficient structure for the many types of wilderness or protected area Web sites that exist. Such a structure would organize and add value to individual sites. The demand is there; currently the onus ison the suppliers to provide a more efficient resource that willbe visitor centered and contribute to the global community engaged in the conservation of wilderness and protected areas worldwide. Investing in a Global Resource A discussion of the development of a global protected area and wilderness network must include attention to the institutional capacity, demands, and commitment it would require. Communicating with a global audience must becentral to the institution's mission. The technical sophisti- cation to understand what kind of commitment they are engaging in is also needed.

Besancon and Freimund toward a global audience may appear at first glance to be a nice thing to do but not a central necessity for manyorganizations, especially when budgets are tight. Commit- ting to the development of a Web-based information re- source also requires a substantial commitment to ongoingmaintenance. For whom is there an incentive for such activity? Each of the Web resources reviewed above would meet these institutional capacity criteria. Each year, participants in protected areas seminars call for improved access to the information and creative ideas to problem solving that are generated around the World. Is-sues related to inventory, monitoring, planning, the use of science, visitor management, and education are among the types of issues that there is a global bank of knowledge totap. Unfortunately, people have a difficult time accessing the information. Developing countries, even those with Web access, are often hampered by slow connections and anoverwhelming amount of data to sift through. Technical Capacity Assuming that institutional support for a global protected area information network could be established, there are then a series of technical constraints that would need to beevaluated before deciding how such an information resource could be practically developed. These are the nuts-and-bolts issues that mediate the interaction between the user (infor-mation demand) and the technicians and institution who become the providers of the supply. The developer of the supply must consider cost, infrastructure, human resources,and the ever-changing hardware and software. From a userperspective, issues of speed, applicability, and comprehen- siveness are critical to making a site meaningful. Overall Cost: Initial and Long Term \u2014These criteria refer to how much money it would take to operate a Web site. Initial costs are usually higher than long-term maintenancecosts. Infrastructure \u2014Refers to the capacity of the institution to work in the electronic age. Questions asked here include: Does the institution operate networked computers? Do they currently operate a Web site? Does the building where the institution is housed have a high-speed internet connection? Human Resources \u2014This is potentially one of the great- est expenses in Web site operation. As the level of complexity of the Web site grows, so too does the need for more highlyspecialized persons (both in number of employees and skill level) to develop and manage the site. Hardware and Software \u2014As the complexity of the site grows, more specialized hardware and software is necessaryto maintain operations. This includes additional Web serv- ers, database servers, backup systems, and all the affiliated software, both to operate the hardware and develop the Webcontent. Usability Speed \u2014Refers to the speed of the Web site. It tells how fast users can find information they are looking for. Applicability \u2014Refers to how useful the information is for the audience. The assumed audience for this column is individuals seeking information at a regional or nationallevel. Comprehensiveness \u2014Refers to the depth of informa- tion one may find at the Web site. Again, the assumed audience for this category is individuals seeking information at a regional or national level. Possible Scenarios Following are a series of scenarios (table 2), listed in terms of their complexity, that will be used to illustrate those practical considerations associated with building Web-based resources: The first scenario (links Web site) is a Web site com- posed of many Web site links in the form of a comprehen- sive categorized list of links to international protected area Web sites and other related resources. The overallcost of creating a Web site of this type is very low, with greater initial costs at startup (that is, purchasing Web server, initial development time) and lower long-termcosts. The infrastructure, human resources necessary, and hardware/software needs would be moderately low for this type of project. In terms of usability, the sitewould produce fast results for end users and would have a great deal of applicability, but because of the single resource found here (links only), the overall value of thistype of resource, in the absence of any additional re- sources, is negligible. The second scenario (searchable index of other sites) is the development of a Web site that allows the end user to search the entire contents of other protected area Table 2\u2014Evaluation of four approaches to organize wilderness and protected area data worldwide.

Web sites. The site acts as a search engine that, instead of searching the entire WWW, only searches protectedarea Web sites chosen by the Web site administrator. The overall costs of this site are slightly higher than the links Web site, but far less than the following scenariosthat involve interactive databases. The third scenario (regional protected area networks) is the development of a comprehensive, database-driven,dynamic Web site with protected area information of all types for a given region, country, or continent. The best existing example for what this might look like is theWilderness Information Network (Wilderness.Net). The overall costs for this scenario are high because consider- able hardware, software, and human resources arenecessary to complete it. The only criteria that receives a lower score for this scenario is \"speed\" because of the intensive use of database queries to provide informa-tion. Somewhat slower speed is to be expected of Web sites with this level of comprehensiveness. This type of Web site is envisioned as part of a larger strategy toprovide these \"regional\" sites that would eventually encompass protected areas throughout the World. Some of the higher costs can be offset because considerablework has already been completed for Wilderness.Net (wilderness areas in the United States), and this work can be adapted and made to fit situations in otherregions and countries. The last scenario (master protected areas database and site) encompasses all of the other scenarios togetherunder one \"master\" Web site as an entry point. Under this scenario, the system of regional protected area Web sites is assumed to be in place and functionally workingtogether through shared databases and close coopera-tion among all institutions and government entities. In addition to what has already been mentioned in the above scenarios, language translations would be avail-able for Web site visitors to utilize. The one factor in this scenario that received a somewhat lower score (besides\"speed\" for the same reasons as in scenario three) is \"applicability,\" because many users of this site may onlyneed information from one geographic region rather than the entire system of worldwide protected areas. In other words, this site may provide too much informationfor some users, thus making it too unwieldy for them. Conclusion_____________________ It is now possible and practical to routinely view wilder- ness and protected area conservation in a global context.Resources are currently being developed to provide growing access to information resources at regional and organiza- tional levels. A global resource would assist in integratingthe communication communities that are currently cen- tered on Wilderness, Protected Areas, and other land use designations. It would also promote discussion and under-standing of the finite scope of the Earth and the role of land conservation within it. Offered here are four scenarios for potential action, each requiring varied amounts of institu-tional support and technical capacity. We urge the global conservation communities to engage into a dialog that could promote one of these or a similar scenario. There is a growingdemand for informed decisionmaking. In many cases, the information is available but inaccessible. It is now time to begin organizing that information and efficiently putting itinto the hands of the people who need it on a daily basis.
