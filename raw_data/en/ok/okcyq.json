For a f ull list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Gardasil s uspension for injection. Gardasil suspension for injection in a pre - filled syringe. Prior to agitation, Gardasil may appear as a clear liquid with a white precipitate. After thorough agitation, it is a white, cloudy liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICUL ARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Gardasil is a va ccine f or use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of : - premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), premalignant anal lesions, cervical canc ers and cancers causally related to certain oncogenic Papillomavirus (HPV) - warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specif ic HPV types. See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information o n the data that support this indication. The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with off icial recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology In dividuals 9 to and including 13 years of age Gardasil can be administered acco rding to a 2 - dose schedule (0.5 ml at 0, 6 months) (see section 5.1). If the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months af ter the f irst dose, a third dose should always be administered.3 Alternatively, Gardasil can be administ ered according to a 3 -dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2, 6 months) schedule. The second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose sh ould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within a 1- year period. Individuals 14 yea rs of age and older Gardasil should be administ ered according to a 3 -dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2 , 6 months) schedule. The second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose sh ould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within a 1-year period. The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with off icial recommendations. Paediatric population The safety and ef ficacy of Gardasil in children below 9 years of age have not been established. No data are available (see section 5.1). It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the vaccination co urse with Gardasil (see section 4.4). The need for a booster dose has not been established . Method of administration The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred site is the deltoid area of the upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh. Gardasil must not be injected intravascul arly. Neither subcutaneous nor intradermal administration has been studied. These methods of administration are not recommended (see section 6.6). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Individuals who develop symptoms indicative of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of Gardasil should not receive f urther doses of Gardasil. Administration of Gardasil should be postponed in individuals suf fering from an acute severe febrile illness. However , th e presence of a minor inf ection, such as a mild upper respiratory tract infection or low- grade fever, is not a contraindication f or immunisation. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. The decision to vaccinate an individual should take into account the risk for previous HPV exposure and potential benef it f rom vaccination. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. Syncope (f ainting), sometimes associated with f alling, can occur following, or e ven bef ore, any vaccination, especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. Th is can be4 accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia, and tonic - clonic limb movements during recov ery. Therefore, vaccinees should b e observed for approximately 15 minutes after vaccine administration. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. As with any vaccine, vaccination with Gardasil may not result in protection i n all vaccine recipients. Gardasil will only protect against diseas es that are caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and to a limited extent against diseases caused by certain related HPV types ( see section 5.1). Theref ore, appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used. Gardasil is for prophylactic use only and has no ef f ect on active HPV inf ections or established clinical disease. Gardasil has not been shown to have a therapeutic ef fect. The vaccine is therefore , not indicated for treatment of cervical cancer, high - grade cervical, vulvar , and vaginal dysplastic lesions or genital warts. It is also not intended to prevent progression of other established HPV - related lesions. Gardasil does not prevent lesions due to a vaccine HPV type in individuals infected with that HPV type at the t ime of vaccination (see section 5.1). The use of Gardasil in adult women should take into consideration the variability of HPV type prevalence in dif ferent geographical areas. Vacc ination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. Since no vaccine is 100 % eff ective and Gardasil will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against existing HPV infections, routine cervical screening remains critically important and should follow local recommendations. Safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have been assessed i n individuals aged from 7 to 12 years who are known to be inf ected with human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) (see section 5.1). Individuals with impaired immu ne responsiveness, due to either the use of potent immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic defect, or other causes, may not respond to the vaccine. This vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation disorder be cause bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Long -term f ollow -up studies were conducted to determine the durat ion of protection (see section 5.1). There are no safety, immunogenicity or ef ficacy data to support change during vaccination with Gardasil to other HPV vaccines which do not cover the same HPV types. Therefore, it is important that the same vaccine should be prescribed for the whole dose regimen . Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction In all clinical trials, individuals who had received immunoglobulin or bloo d- derived products during the 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose were excluded. Use with other vaccines Administration of Gardasil at the same time (but, for injected vaccines, at a dif ferent injection site) as hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine did not interf ere with the immune response to the HPV types. The seroprotection rates (proportion of individuals reaching >10 mIU/ml) % for concomitant vaccination and 97.5 % for hepatitis B vaccine only). Anti - HBs geometric mean antibody titres were lower on co - administration, but the clinical significance of this observation is not known. 5 Gardasil may be administered concomitantly with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) icant interf erence with antibody response to any of the components of either vaccine. However, a trend of lower anti - HPV GMTs was observed in the concomitant group. The clinical significance of this observation is not known. This is based on the results f r om a clinical trial in which a combined dTap - IPV vaccine was administered concomitantly with the first dose of Gardasil (see section 4.8). The concomitant administration of Gardasil with vaccines other than the ones above has not been studied. Use with hormonal contraceptives In clinical studies , 57.5 % of women aged 16 to 26 years a nd 31.2 % of women aged 24 to 45 years who received Gardasil used hormonal contraceptives during the vaccination period. Use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to af f ect the immune response to Gardasil. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Specific studies of the vaccine in pregnant women were not conducted. During the clinical development program, 3,819 women (vaccine = 1,894 vs. placebo = 1,925) report ed at least one pregnancy. There were no significant diff erences in types of anomalies or proportion of pregnancies with an adverse outcome in Gardasil and placebo treated individuals. These data on pregnant women (more than 1 , 000 exposed outcomes) indicat e no malf ormative nor f eto/ neonatal toxicity. The data on Gardasil administered during pregnancy did not indicate any safety signal. However, these data are insuf ficient to recommend use of Gardasil during pregnancy. Vaccination should be postponed until completion of pregnancy. Breast -f eeding In breast - feeding mothers given Gardasil or placebo during the vaccination period of the clinical trials the rates of adverse reactions in the mother and the breast - fed infant were comparable between the vaccination and the placebo groups. In addition, vaccine immunogenicity was comparable among breast - feeding mothers and women who did not breast - feed during the vaccine administration. Theref ore , Gardasil can be used during breast -f eeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmf ul effects with respect to rep roductive toxicity (see section 5.3). No eff ects on male fertility wer e observed in rats (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the ef f ects on the ability to drive and use machines have been perf ormed. 4.8 Undesirable effects A. Summary of the safety profile In 7 clinical trials (6 placebo - controlled), individuals were administere d Gardasil or placebo on the day of enrolment and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter. Few individuals (0.2 % ) discontinued due to adverse reactions. Safety was evaluated in either the entire study population (6 studies) or in a6 predefined subset (one study) of the study population using vaccination report card (VRC) -aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of Gardasil or placebo. The individuals who were monitored using VRC - aided surveillance included 10,088 ind ividuals (6,995 females 9 to 4 5 years of age and 3,093 males 9 to 26 years of age at enrolment ) who received Gardasil and 7,995 individuals (5,692 females and 2,303 males) who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions observed were injection - site adverse reactions (77.1 % of vaccinees within 5 days following any vaccination visit) and headache (16.6 % of the vaccinees) . These adverse reactions usually were mild or moderate in intensity. B. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions Clinical Trials Table 1 presents vaccine - related adverse reactions which were observed among recipients of Gardasil at a frequency of at least 1.0 % and also at a greater frequency than observed among placebo recipients. They are ranked under headings of f requency using the following conv Very Rare ( 1/10,000)] Post- Marketing Experience Table 1 also includes additional adverse events which have been spontaneously reported d uring the post- marketing use of Gardasil worldwide. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their f requency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Co nsequently, the frequency of these adverse events is qualif ied as \"not known\".

In males, dizziness was not observed at a greater frequency in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients. In addition, in clinical trials adverse reactions that were judged to be vaccine - or placebo -related by the study investigator were observed at frequencies lower than 1 %: 7 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: cases (0. 06 % ) of urticaria were reported in the Gardasil group and 20 cases (0. 15 % ) were seen in the adjuvant - containing placebo group. In the clinical studies, individuals in the Safety Population reported any new medical conditions during the follow - up. Among 15,706 individuals who received Gardasil and 13,617 individuals who received placebo, there were 39 cases of non - specif ic arthritis/arthropathy reported, 24 in the Gardasil group and 15 in the placebo group. In a clinical trial of 843 healthy ado lescent males and f emales 11 -17 years of age, administration of the first dose of Gardasil concomitantly with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component] and poliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine showed that there was more injection -site swelling and headache r eported following concomitant administration. The dif fe rences observed were < 10 % and in the majority of subjects, the adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in intensity. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions af ter authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benef it/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare prof essionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reportin g system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose There have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of Gardasil. In general, the adverse event prof ile reported with overdose was comparable to recommended single doses of Gardasil. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Viral Vaccine, ATC code: J07BM01 Mechanism of Act ion Gardasil is an adjuvanted non - infectious recombinant quadrivalent vaccine prepared from the highly purified virus - like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. The VLPs contain no viral DNA, they cannot infect ce lls, reproduce or cause disease. HPV only infects humans, but animal studies with analogous papillomaviruses suggest that the ef ficacy of LI VLP vaccines is mediated by the development of a humoral immune response. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be r esponsible f or approximately 70 % of cervical cancers and 75-80 % of anal cancers; 80 % of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); 45 -70 % of high - grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3); 25 % of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN 1); approximately 70 % of HPV related high - grade vulvar (VIN 2/3) and vaginal (V aIN 2/3) intraepithelial neoplasia and 80 % of HPV related high - grade anal (AIN 2/3) intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90 % of genital warts and 10 % of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1). CIN 3 and AIS have been accepted as immediate precursors of invasive cervical cancer.8 The term \"premalign ant genital lesions\" in section 4.1 corresponds to high - grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), high - grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/3) and high - grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/3). The term \" premal ignant section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade anal intraepithelial neo plasia (AIN 2/3). The indication is based on the demonstration of eff icacy of Gardasil in females 16 to 45 years of age and in males 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year old children and adolescents. Clinical Studies Efficacy in women 16 through 26 years The ef ficacy of Gardasil in 16 - through 26 year-old women was assessed in 4 placebo -controlled, double - blind, randomi s ed Phase II and III clinical studies including a total of 20,541 wo men, who were enrolled and vaccinated without pre - screening for the presence of HPV infection. The primary efficacy endpoints included HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18 - related vulvar and vaginal lesions (genital warts, VIN, VaIN) and CIN of any grade and cervical cancer s (Protocol 013, FUTURE I), HPV 16- or 18 -related CIN 2/3 and AIS and cervical cancers (Proto col 015, FUTURE II), HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18 - related persistent infection and disease (Protocol 007), and HPV 16- related persistent infection (Proto col 005). The primary analyses of ef ficacy, with re spect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18), were conducted in the per - protocol ef ficacy (PPE) population (i.e. all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrollment, no major protocol deviations and na\u00efve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)). Efficacy results are presented for the combined analysis of study protocols. The ef ficacy for HPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16 - related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015. The eff icacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015. The median duration of follow - up for these studies was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, and 3.0 years for Protocol 005, Protocol 007, Protocol 013, and Protocol 015, respectively. The median duration of follow -up f or the combined protocols (005, 007, 013, and 015) was 3.6 years. Results of individual studies support the results from the combined analysis. Gardasil was ef ficacious against HPV disease cause d by each of the four vaccine HPV types. At end of study, individuals enrolled in the two Phase -III studies (Protocol - 013 and Protocol - 015), were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.7 years). Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Grade 2/3 (moderate t o high - grade dysplasia) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) were used in the clinical trials as a surrogate marker for cervical cancer. In the long - term extension study of Protocol 015 , 2,536 women 16 - 23 years old during vaccination with Gardasil in the base study were followed. In the PPE population no cases of HPV diseases (HPV types 6/11/16/18 related high grade CIN) were observed up to approximately 1 4 years (median follow - up of 11.9 years) . In this study, a durable protection was statistically demonstrat ed to approximately 12 years. Ef f icacy in women na\u00efve to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Efficacy was measured starting af ter the Month 7 visit. Overall, 73 % of women were na\u00efve (PCR negative and seronegative) to all 4 HPV types at enrolment . The ef ficacy results for r elevant endpoints analysed at 2 years post -enrolment and at end of stud y (median duration of f ollow -up = 3.6 years) in the per - protocol popula tion are presented in the Table 2. In a supplemental analysis, the eff icacy of Gar dasil was evaluated against HPV 16/18 -related CIN 3 and AIS .9Table 2 : Analysis of efficacy of Gardasil against high grade cervical lesions in the PPE population Gardasil Placebo % Efficacy at 2 years (95 % CI)Gardasil Placebo% Efficacy*** at end of study (95 % CI) Number of cases Number of individuals* Number of 8493 7 8464 100 (30.6, 100.0) *Number of individuals with at least one f ollow -up visit af ter Month 7 **Based on vi rologic evidence, the f irst CIN 3 case in a patien t chronically inf ected with HPV 52 is likel y to be causally related to HPV 52 .

In the second CIN 3 case observed in a patient inf ected with HPV 51 at D ay 1 (in 2 of 9 specimens); HPV 16 was detected at a Month 51 biops y (in 1 of 9 specimens) and HPV 56 was detect ed in 3 of 9 specimens at Month 52 in tissue excised during LEEP. ***Patients were f ollowe d f or up to 4 years (median 3.6 years) Note: Point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person -time of f ollow -up. At end of study and in the combined protocols, the eff icacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related 1 was 95.9 (95 98.4), the 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related CIN (1, 2, 3) or AIS was 96.0 % (95 % CI: 92.3, 98.2), the e ff of V 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related VIN2/3 and VaIN 2/3 was 100 % (95 % CI: 67.2, 100) and 100 % (95 % CI: 55.4, 100), respectively , the e against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- genital warts was 99.0 % (95 % CI: 96.2, 99.9). In Protocol 012 the eff icacy of Gardasil against the 6 month def inition of persistent inf ection [samples positive on two or more consec utive visits 6 months apart (\u00b1 1 month ) or longer ] related to HPV 16 was 98.7 % (95 % CI: 95.1, 99.8 ) and 100.0 % (95 % CI: 100.0) f or H PV 18 respectively , af ter a f ollow -up of up to 4 years ( mean of 3.6 years). For the 12 month def inition of persistent inf ection, eff icacy HPV 18 respectively . Ef f icac y in women with evidence of HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 infection or disease at day 1 There was no evidence of protection from disease caused by vaccine HPV types f or which women were PCR positive at day 1. Women who were already inf ected with one or more vaccine - related HPV types prior to vaccination were protected from clinical disease caused by the remaining vaccine HPV types.10Ef f icacy in women with and without prior inf ection or disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 The modified intention to treat (ITT ) population included women regardless of baseline HPV status at Day 1, who received at least one vaccination and in whom case counting started at 1 month Postdose 1. This population approximates to the general population of women with respect to prevalenc e of HPV infection or disease at enrolment . The results are summarised in Table 3.

The ef f icacy f or HPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is based on data f rom protocols 005 (16 - related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015. Pat ients were f ollowed f or up to 4 years (median 3.6 years). Note: point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person -time of f ollow -up. Ef f icacy against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VIN 2/3 was 73.3 % (95 % CI: 40.3, 89.4), against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related VaIN 2/3 was 85.7 % (95 % C I: 37.6, 98.4), and against HPV 6-, 11-, 16- , 18- related genital warts was 80.3 % (95 % CI: 73.9, 85.3) in the c ombined protocols at end of study. Overall 12 % of the combined study population had an abnormal Pap test suggestive of CIN at Day 1. Among women with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were na\u00efve to the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, ef ficacy of the vaccine remained high. Among women with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were already infected with the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, no vaccine ef ficacy was observed. Protection Against the Overall Burden of Cervical HPV disease in 16 - Through 26-Year - Old Women The impact of Gardasil against the overall risk for cervical, HPV disease (i.e., disease caused by any HPV type) was evaluated starting 30 days af ter the f irst dose in 17,599 individuals enrolled in the two P hase III efficacy trials (Protocols 013 and 015). Among women who were na\u00efve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1, administration of Gardas il reduced the incidence of CIN 2/3 or AIS caused by vaccine - or non - vaccine HPV types by 42.7 % (95 % CI: 23.7, 57.3) and of genital warts by 82.8 % (95 % CI: 74.3, 88.8) at end of study. In the modified ITT population, the benef it of the vaccine with respect to the overall incidence of CIN 2/3 or AIS (caused by any HPV type) and of genital warts was much lower, with a r eduction of 18.4 % (95 % CI: 7.0, 28.4) and 62.5 % (95 % CI: 54.0, 69.5), respectively, as Gardasil does not impact the course of inf ections or disease that are present at vaccination onset.11 Impact on Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures The impact of Gardasil on rates of Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures regardless of causal HPV types was evaluated in 18,150 individuals enrolled in Protocol 007, Protocols 013 and 015. In the HPV na\u00efve population ( na\u00efve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pa p test at Day 1) , Gardasil reduced the proportion of women who experienced a definitive cervical therapy procedure (Loop Electro - Excision Procedure or Cold - Knife Conization) by 41.9 % (95 % CI: 27.7, 53.5) at end of study. In the ITT population the corresp onding reduction was 23.9 % (95 % CI: 15.2, 31.7). Cross - protective eff icacy The ef ficacy of Gardasil against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/3 or AIS caused by 10 non - vaccine HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) structurally related to HPV 16 or H PV 18 was evaluated in the combined Phase III efficacy database (N = 17,599) after a median follow -up of 3.7 years (at end of study). Efficacy against disease endpoints caused by pre - specified combinations of non- vaccine HPV types was measured. The studies were not powered to assess eff icacy against disease caused by individual HPV types. The primary analysis was done in type - specif ic populations that required women to be negative for the type being analy sed , but who could be positive for other HPV types (96 % of the overall population) . The prim ary time point analysis after 3 years did not reach statistical significance f or all pre -specif ied endpoints. The final end -of- study results fo r the combined incidence of CIN 2/3 or AIS in this population after a med ian f ollow -up of 3.7 years are shown in Table 4. For composite endpoints, statistically significant ef ficacy against disease was demonstrated against HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 16 (primarily HPV 31) whereas no statistically signif icant ef ficacy was observed for HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 18 (including HPV 45). F or the 10 individual HPV types, statistical signif icance was only reached for HPV 31.

The primary efficacy endpoint s include d the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18 -related and the combined incidence of HPV 16- or HPV 18-related persistent infection (6 month definition), genital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancers. The median duration of follow - up for this study was 4.0 years. In the long- term extension study of Protocol 019 , 685 women 24 -45 years old during vaccination with Gardasil in the base study were f ollowed. I n the PPE population , no cases of HPV diseases (HPV types 6/11/16/18 related CIN any grade and Genital Warts) were observed through 10.1 years (median f ollow -up of 8.7 years ). Efficacy in women na\u00efve to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) The primary analyses of ef f icacy were conducted in the per - protocol eff icacy (PPE) population (i.e. all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment , no major protocol deviations and na\u00efve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)). Ef f icacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit. Overall, 67 % of individua ls were na\u00efve (PCR negative and seronegative) to all 4 HPV enrolment . The ef ficacy of Gardasil agains t the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18 - related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AI S, and cervical cancers was 88.7 % (95 % CI: 78.1, 94.8). The ef Gardasil incidence of HPV 16- or 18 -related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancers was 84 .7 % (95 % CI: 67.5, 93.7). Efficacy in women with and without prior inf ection or di sease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 The Full Analysis Set population (also known as the ITT population) included women regardless of baseline HPV status at Day 1, who received at least one vaccination and in whom case counting started at Day 1. This population approximates to the general pop ulation of women with respect to prevalence of HPV infection or disease at enrolment . The ef ficacy of Gardasil agains t the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18 - related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any gr ade, AIS, and cervical cancers was 47.2 % (95 % CI: 33.5, 58.2). The ef combined incidence of HPV 16- or 18 - related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancers was 41.6 % (95 % CI: 24.3, 55.2). Efficacy in women (16 to 45 years) with evidence of a prior infection with a vaccine HPV type (seropositive) that was no longer detectable at vaccination onset (PCR negative) In post hoc analyses of individuals (who received at least one vaccination) with evidence of a prior infection with a vaccine HPV type (seropositive) no longer detectable (PCR negative) at vaccination onset, the efficacy of Gardasil to prevent conditions due to the recurrence of the same HPV type was 100 % (95 % CI: 62.8, 100.0; 0 vs. 12 cases [n = 2572 from pooled studies in young women] ) against HPV 6 -, 11-, 16-, and 18 -related CIN 2/3, VIN 2/3, VaIN 2/3, and genital warts in women 16 to 26 years. Efficacy was 68.2 % (95 % CI: 17.9, 89.5; 6 vs. 20 cases [n = 832 from studies in young and13 adult women combined] ) against HPV 16- and 18-related persist ent infection in women 16 to 45 years. Efficacy in men 16 through 26 years Ef f icacy was evaluated against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, external genital warts, ef f icac y of Gardasil in 16 - through 26 year- old men was assessed in 1 placebo - controlled, double - blind, randomi s ed Phase III clin ical study (Protocol 020) including a total of 4,055 men who were enrolled and vaccinated without pre - screening for the presence of HPV infection. The media n duration of f ollow -up was 2.9 years. I n a subset of 598 men (GARDASIL = 299; placebo = 299) in Pr otocol 020 who self - identif ied as having sex with men (MSM) ef f against anal intraepithelial neoplasia and anal cancer, and intra - anal persistent infection was evaluated. MSM are at higher risk of anal HPV infection compared to the general population; the absolute benef it of vaccination in terms of prevention of anal cancer in the general population is expected to be very low. HIV inf ection was an exclus ion criterion (see section 4.4). Efficacy in Men na\u00efve to the relevant vaccine HPV types The primary analyses of ef f icacy, with re spect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18), were conducted in the per - protocol eff icacy (PPE) population (i.e. all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment , no major protocol deviations and na\u00efve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)). Ef ficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit. Overall, 83 % of men (87 % of heterosexual subjects and 61 % of MSM subjects) were na\u00efve (PCR negative and seronega tive) at enrolment . Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN) Grade 2/3 (moderate to high - grade dysplasia) was used in the clinical trials as a surrogate marker for anal cance r. The ef ficacy results for relevant endpoints analysed at end of study (m edian duration of follow -up 2.4 years) in the per - protocol popula tion are presented in the Table 5. Ef ficacy against PIN grades 1/2/3 was not demonstrated. Table 5: Efficacy of Gardasil against external genital lesions in the PPE * population of 16-26 year old men Endpoint Gardasil Placebo % Efficacy (95 %CI) N Number of cases N Number of cases HPV 6/11/16/18 - related external genital lesions External genital lesions 1394 3 1404 32 90.6 in the PPE population received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment , had no major protocol deviations, and were na\u00efve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7). At end of study analysis for anal lesions in the MSM population (median duration of follow -up was 2.15 years), th e preventive eff ect against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related AIN 2/3 was 74.9 % (95 % CI : 8.8, 95.4; 3 /194 versus 13/2 08) and against HPV 16- or 18- related AIN 2/3 86.6 % (95 % CI : 0.0, 99.7; 1/194 versus 8/208). The duration of protection against anal cancer is currently unknown. In the long - term extension study14 of Protocol 020 , 917 men 16 - 26 years old during vaccination with Gardasil in the base study were followed. In the PPE population, no cases of HPV types 6/11 related genital warts, HPV 6/11/16/18 external genital lesions or HPV 6/11/16/18 high grade AIN in MSM were observed th rough 11.5 years (median follow -up of 9.5 years). Efficacy in men with or without prior infection or disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 The Full Analysis Set population included men regardless of baseline HPV status at Day 1, who received at least one vaccination and in whom case counting started at Day 1. This population approximates to the general population of men with respect to preval ence of HPV infection or disease at enrolment . The e f ficacy of GARDASIL against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related external genital warts was 68.1 % (95 % CI: 48.8, 79.3). The e f ficacy of GARDASIL against 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related AIN 2/3 and 16- 18-related AIN 2/3, in the 39 CI: - 1.8, 83.9; 8/275 versus 19/276 cases), respectively. Protection Against the Overall Burden of HPV disease in 16 - Through 26 -Year -Old Men The impact of Gardasil against the overall risk for external genital lesions was evaluated af ter the f irst dose in 2,545 individuals enrolled in the P hase III efficacy trial (Protocol 020). Among men who were na\u00efve to 14 common HPV types, administration o f Gardasil reduced the incidence of external genital lesions caused by vaccine - or non - vaccine HPV types by 81.5 % (95 % CI: 58.0, 93.0). In the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population, the benefit of the vaccine with respect to the overall incidence of EGL was lower, with a reduction of 59.3 % (95 % CI: 40.0, 72.9), as Gardasil does not impact the course of infections or disease that are present at vaccination onset. Impact on Biopsy and Definitive Therapy Procedures The impact of Gardasil on rates of biops y and treatment of EGL regardless of causal HPV types was evaluated in 2,545 individuals enrolled in Protocol 020. In the HPV na\u00efve population (na\u00efve to 14 common HPV types), Gardasil reduced the proportion of men who had a biopsy by 54.2 % (95 % CI: 28.3, 71.4) and who were treated by 47.7 % (95 % CI: 18.4, 67.1) at end of study. In the FAS population, the corresponding reduction was 45.7 % (95 % CI: 29.0, Immunogenicity Assays to Measure Immune Response No minimum antibody level associated with protection has been identified for HPV vaccines. The immunogenicity of Gardasil was assessed in 20,132 (Gardasil n = 10,723; placebo n = 9,409) girls and women 9 to 26 years of age, 5,417 (Gardasil n = 3,109 ; placebo n = 2,308 ) boys and men 9 to 26 years of age and 3,819 women 24 to 45 years of age (Gardasil n = 1,911, placebo n = 1,908) . Type - specif ic immunoassays, competitive Luminex - based immunoassay (cLIA), with type -specif ic standards were used to assess immunog enicity to each vaccine type. This assay measures antibodies against a single neutralizing epitope for each individual HPV type. Im mune Responses to Gardasil at 1 month post dose 3 In the cli nical studies in women 16 to 26 years of age, 99.8 %, 99.8 %, 99.8 %, and 99.5 % of individuals who re ceived Gardasil became anti -HPV 6, anti -HPV 11, anti -HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18- seropositive, respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3. In the clinical study in women 24 to 45 years,1598.4 %, 98.1 %, 98.8 %, and 97.4 % of ind ividuals who re ceived Gardasil became anti -HPV 6, anti - HPV 11, anti -HPV 16, and anti -HPV 18 seropositive, respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3. In the clinical study in men 16 to 26 years, 98.9 %, 99.2 %, 98.8 %, and 97.4 % of individuals who received Gardasil became anti -HPV 6, anti -HPV 11, anti -HPV 16, and anti -HPV 18 s eropositive, respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3. Gardasil induced high anti - HPV Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) 1 month Postdose 3 in all age groups tested. As expected for women 24 to 45 years of age (Protocol 019), the observed antibody titres were lower t han that seen in women 16 to 26 years. Anti- HPV levels in placebo individuals who had cleared an HPV infection (seropositive and PCR negative) were substa ntially lower than those induced by the vaccine. Furthermore, anti -HPV levels (GMTs) in vaccinated individuals remained at or above serostatus cut - off during the long -term f ollow - up of the P hase III studies (see below under Persistence of Immune Response o f Gardasil ). Bridging the Eff icacy of Gardasil f rom Women to Girls A clinical study (Protocol 016) compared the immunoge nicity of Gardasil in 10 - to 15 -year-old girls to those in 16 - to 23 year old women. In the vaccine group, 99.1 to 100 % became seropositive to all vaccine serotypes by 1 month Postdose 3 . Table 6 compares the 1 month Postdose 3 anti -HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs in 9 - to 15 year-old girls with those in 16 - to 26 - year old women. Table 6 : Immunogenicity bridging between 9 - to 15-year-old girls and 16 - to 26 -year- old women ( per- protocol population) based on titres as measured by cLIA 9- to 15 -Year -Old Girls (Protocols 016 and 018) 16- to 26 -Year - Old Women (Protocols 013 and 015) n GMT (95 % CI) n GMT (95 % CI) HPV 6 915 929 (874, 987) 2631 543 (526, 560) HPV 11 915 1303 (1223, mMU/ml (mMU = milli-Merck units) Anti- HPV responses at Month 7 among 9 - to 15 -year- old girls were non - inferior to anti -HPV responses in 16 - to 26 -year- old women for whom eff icacy was established in the P hase III studies. Immunogenicity was related to age and Month 7 anti - HPV levels were s ignif icantly higher in younger individuals below 12 years of age than in those above that age. On the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the ef ficacy of Gardasil in 9 - to 15 -year-old girls is inf erred. In the long - term extension study of Protocol 018 , 369 girls 9 - 15 years old during vaccination with Gardasil in the base study were f ollowed. In the PPE population, no cases of HPV diseases (HPV types 6/11/16/18 related CIN any grade and Genital Warts) were observed through 10. 7 years (median f ollow -up of 10.0 years). Bridging the Eff icacy of Gardasil f rom Men to Boys Three clinical studies (Protocols 016, 018 and 020) were used to compare the immunogenicity of Gardasil in 9 - to 15 -year- old boys to 16 - to 26 -year-old men. In the vaccine group, 97.4 to 99.9 % became seropositive to all vaccine serotypes by 1 month Postdose 3 . Table 7 compares the 1 month Postdose 3 anti -HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs in 9 - to 15 -year-old boys with those in 16 - to 26 -year-old men. 16Table 7 : Immunogenicity bridging between 9- to 15 -year- old boys and 16 - to 26 -year-old men ( per- protocol population) based on titres as measured by cLIA 9- to 15 -Year -Old Boys 16- to 26 -Year -Old Men n GMT (95 % CI) n GMT (95 % CI) HPV 6 884 1038 (964, mMU/ml (mMU = milli-Merck units) Anti- HPV responses at Month 7 among 9 - to 15 -year- old boys were non - inferior to anti -HPV responses in 16 - to 26 -year- old men for whom ef ficacy was established in the P hase III studies. Immunogenicity was related to age and Month 7 anti - HPV levels were sign if icantly higher in younger individuals. On the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the ef ficacy of Gardasil in 9 - to 15 -year-old boys is inf erred. In the long - term extension study of Protocol 018 , 326 boys 9 -15 years old during vaccination with Garda sil in the base study were f ollowed. In the PPE population, no cases of HPV diseases (HPV types 6/11/16/18 related External Genital Lesions) were observed through 10. 6 years (median f ollow - up of 9.9 years). Persistence of Immune Response of Gardasil A subset of individuals enrolled in the Phase III studies was followed up for a long - term period for safety, immunogenicity and eff ectiveness. Total IgG Luminex Immunoassay (IgG LIA) was used to assess the persistence of immune response in addition to cLIA. In all populations (women 9 - 45 years, men 9 - 26 years) , peak anti -HPV 6, anti -HPV 11, anti - HPV 16, and anti -HPV 18 GMTs cLIA were observed at Month 7. Af terwards, the GMTs declined through Month 24 - 48 and then generally stabili sed. The duration of im munity following a 3 -dose series has been observed for up to 14 years post -vaccination . Girls and boys v accinated with Gardasil at 9 -15 years of age in Protocol 018 base study w ere f ollowed up in an extension study. Depending on HPV type, 6 0-96 % and 78-98 % of subjects were seropositive by cLIA and IgG LIA respectively 10 yea rs af ter vaccination (see Table 8). Table 8: Long - term immunogenicity data ( per-protocol population) based on percentage of seropositive subjects as measured by cLIA and IgG LIA (Protocol 018) at 10 years, in girls and boys 9-15 years of age cLIA IgG LIA n % of seropositive subjectsn % of seropositive subjects HPV 6 409 89 % 430 93 % HPV 11 409 89 % 430 90 % HPV 16 403 96 % 426 98 % HPV 18 408 60 % 429 78 % Women va ccinated with Gardasil at 16 -23 years of age in Protocol 015 base were f ollowed up in an extension study. Fourteen years af ter vaccination, 9 1 %, 91 %, 98 % and 52 % were anti -HPV 6, anti - HPV 11, anti -HPV 16 and anti -HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 98 %, 98 %, 100 % and 9 4 % were anti -HPV 6, anti -HPV 11, anti -HPV 16 and anti -HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG LIA,17 respectively. Women va ccinated with Ga rdasil at 24 -45 years of age in Protocol 019 base study were f ollowed up in an extension study. Ten years after vaccination, 79 %, 85 %, 94 %, and 36 % were anti -HPV 6, anti - HPV 11, anti -HPV 16 and anti -HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 8 6 %, 79 %, 100 % and 8 3 % were anti -HPV 6, anti -HPV 11, anti -HPV 16 and anti -HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG LIA, respectively. Men va ccinated with Gardasil at 16 -26 years of age in Protocol 020 base study were followed up in an extension study. Ten years a fter vaccination, 79 %, 80 %, 95 % and 40 % were anti -HPV 6, anti - HPV 11, anti -HPV 16 and an ti-HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 92 %, 92 %, 100 % and 92 % were anti -HPV 6, anti -HPV 11, anti -HPV 16 and anti -HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG LIA, respectively. In the se studies, individuals who were seronegative for anti -HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti -HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 in the cLIA were still protected against clinical disease after a follow -up of 14 years f or 16-23 year- old women, 10 years f or 24-45 year- old women, and 10 years for 16 -26 year-old men . Evidence of Anamnestic (Immune Memory) Response Evidence of an anamnestic response was seen in vaccinated women who were seropositive to relevant HPV type(s) prior to vaccination. In addition, a subset of vaccinated women who received a challenge dose of Gardasil 5 years after the onset of vaccination, exhibited a rapid and strong anamnestic response that exceeded the anti - HPV GMTs observed 1 month Postdose 3. HIV inf ected subjects An academic study documenting safe t y and immunogenicity of Gardasil has been perf ormed in 126 HIV i nf ected subjects aged f rom 7 -12 years (of which 96 received Gardasil). Seroconversion to all four antigens occurred in more than ninety - six percent of the subjects. The GMTs were somewhat lower than reported in non - HIV inf ected subjects of the same age in other studies. The cli nical relevance of the lower response is unknown. The safety profile was similar to non - HIV infected subjects in other studies. The CD4 % or plasma HIV RNA was not aff ected by vaccination. Immune Responses to Gardasil using a 2 - dose schedule in individua ls 9-13 years of age A clinical trial showed that among girls who re ceived 2 doses of HPV vaccine 6 months apart, antibody responses to the 4 HPV types, one month after the last dose were non - inf erior to those among young women who received 3 doses of the vaccine within 6 months. At Month 7, in the Per Protocol population, the imm une response in girls aged 9 -13 years ( n = 241) who receiv ed 2 doses of Gardasil (at 0, 6 months) was no n-inf erior and numerically higher to the immune response in women aged 16 -26 years ( n = 246 ) who received 3 doses of Gardasil (at 0, 2, 6 months). At 36 month follow - up, the GMT in girls (2 doses, n = 86) remained non - inferior to t he GMT in women (3 doses, n = 86) f or all 4 HPV types. In the same study, in girls aged 9 -13 years, the immune response af ter a 2 - dose schedule was numerically lower than after a 3 - dose schedule (n = 248 at Month 7; n = 82 at Month 36). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Post hoc analyses we re conducted at 120 - month follow -up in girls (2 doses, n = 35; 3 doses, n = 38) and women (3 doses, n = 30). T he GMT ratios (girls who received 2 doses / women who received 3 doses) ranged from 0.99 to 2.02 for all 4 HPV types . T he GMT ratios (girls who received 2 doses / girls who received 3 doses) ranged f rom 0.72 to 1.21 f or all 4 HPV types . The lower bound of the1895 % CI of all the GMT ratios remained > 0.5 through month 120 (except for HPV 18 in girls who received 2 doses / g irls who received 3 doses). S eropositivity rates in girls and women were > 95 % f or HPV 6, 11, and 16, and seropositivity rates f or HPV 18 were > 80 % in girls who received.2 doses, > 90 % in girls who received 3 doses, and > 60 % in women who received 3 doses , in the cLIA. Prevention of juvenile - onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP) by vaccination of girls and women of childbearing potential JoRRP is caused by upper airway infection primarily with HPV types 6 and 11, acquired vertically (mother -to- child) during childbirth. Observational studies in the US and Australia have shown that the introduction of Gardasil since 2006 has led to declines in the incidence of JoRRP at population level . 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Single - dose and repeated - dose toxicity and local tolerance studies revealed no special hazards to humans. Gardasil induced specif ic antibody responses against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in pregnant rats, following one or multiple intramuscular injections. Antibodies against all f our HPV types were transferred to the offspring during gestation and possibly during lactation. There we re no treatment - related ef fects on developmental signs, behaviour, reproductive performance, or fertility of the of f spring. Gardasil administered to male rats at the f ull human dose (120 mcg total protein) had no ef f ects on reproductive performance includ ing fertility, sperm count, and sperm motility, and there were no vaccine - related gross or histomorphologic changes on the testes and no eff ects on testes weights. 6.
