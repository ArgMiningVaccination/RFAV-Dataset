Methods: 462 adult participants were included in the study. A sociodemographic data form including questions on information about COVID-19 was filled by the participants. In addition, the participants were evaluated with the anxiety, obsessive-compulsive(OCD) and hostility subscale of the Symptom Check List - Revised 90 (SCL-90 R) scale and the Adults Attachment Style Scale (AASS). Results: In logistic regression analysis, it was shown that concern about COVID-19 vaccines safety was effective on intention to be vaccinated (x2=228.667; N= 462; df=1; p<0.01). The relationship between believing COVID-19 vaccines safety and intention to get vaccinated is moderated by anxious/ambivalence attachment style, anxiety level, hostility and number of children. Conclusion: In conclusion, anxious-avoidant attachment, anxiety level, hostility and number of children had moderate effect on the relationship between the safety concerns of vaccines and the intention to be vaccinated. Vaccine persuasion studies should focus on individual studies after public information. None NONE Ama\u00e7: Bu \u00e7almann \u00c7nar Tanrverdi, E. (2022).
