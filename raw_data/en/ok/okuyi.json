I am Thai and I have one children. Although I was born and lived in Thai whole of my life but I NEVER put any interest in the MEDITATION because I think that it is the old path for the old generation.

But the things always happened to increase more and more stress in my mind. One day, I sat on my favorite chair, starting to think about my routine work and what I was going to do next. Suddenly, my mind was empty and blocked. I did not know who I am and the reason why I had to sit here. What was the purpose for my life? Am I mad? And then my brain was full of the previous memory like a movie starting since I was born until present. It was very terrible to get that feeling. I was in depressing for full 3 days, always thinking everything that I faced in the past. In the fourth day, I asked myself, \"What is happiness?\", \"How can I live with all feeling that I got experience?\" These questions occurred in my mind and I got many conflict with myself to get the answer.
