It does not have FDA approval specific to mpox, but the CDC holds a non-research expanded access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) protocol that allows for use of TPOXX for treatment of mpox in adults and children of all ages. Those that have intact immune systems just need supportive care and pain control rather than antivirals. This should be enough to help control pain while mpox symptoms heal. TPOXX may be considered in some cases based on multiple factors (i.e., initial health status, concurrent illnesses, previous vaccination history, other medical conditions).Treatment of Monkeypox (mpox): TPOXX & Supportive Care Considerations for Treatment Pain management strategies should be tailored to the needs of each patient: How can I get TPOXX? Speak with your health care provider, or contact the mpox Hotline: 1-800-889-3931Over-the-counter medications (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) are recommended for general pain control for patients with mpox. Topical steroids and anesthetics such as lidocaine can be considered for local pain relief. Topical lidocaine or other topical anesthetics should be used with caution on broken skin or open or draining wounds. Use disposable gloves when applying topical medications to lesions, then dispose of the gloves and practice hand hygiene. Prescription pain medications (i.e., gabapentin, opioids*) have been used for short-term management of severe pain not controlled with other treatments listed above. *Opioids may increase risk for side effects such as constipation, or long-term consequences use such as opioid use disorder or overdose. TPOXX Administration MUST be taken concurrently with a full, fatty meal.Oral Capsule TPOXX is administered through one of two methods: Intravenous (IV)Should NOT be used if patient has severe kidney problems, or with pediatric patients <2 years of age.
