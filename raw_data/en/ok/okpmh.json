But bathing wasn't always a thing. Nor was it always done in private. In fact, up until the mid 19th century, most bathing was public, reserved for religious leaders, political leaders, or the very rich. Eventually bathing evolved into a private, personal ritual that can have a wide variety of psychological and physical benefits. Here's how you can make the most of your bath ritual. A Brief History of Bathing The [ oldest known bath](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20121129-the-origins-of-bathhouse-culture-around-the-world) was discovered in the early 1900s in the Indus Valley in Pakistan and dates back to 2500 B.C. According to [ National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/archaeology/mohenjo-daro/), it sat on a great mound and was a sacred site and the closest thing that Mohenjo Daro had to a temple. The Great Bath, as it is known, occupied the highest mound in the 250-acre city. Archeologists believe that bathing and cleanliness was associated with godliness in the ancient civilization. At the same time, bathing and cleansing was a religious ritual in [ Asia and India, where the tradition was tied to the healing waters of rivers.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/595074?seq=1) Though bathing was a tradition in Asia and the Middle East, the Greeks and Romans were really the key drivers behind the popularity of bathing as recreation. Baths became an experience that was open to all. Rich and poor alike would pour into the great Roman baths to cleanse, relax, and wheel and deal. Greek soldiers would take steam baths to ease aching muscles after battle. Bathing in 300 B.C. was as much a way to socialize as it was to rinse off the week's work, and women and men bathed together. Roman baths had a reception room, which led to three different bath rooms that had waters that were hot, warm, and cold. Bathers would move from one to the next, and in some rooms, they were encouraged to exercise. Thanks to the Crusades, the popularity of bathing spread all over the ancient world. As the Roman Empire declined and public bathing went out of vogue in the West, the Byzantine empire picked up the tradition and modified the experience. Baths became more private and elaborate with intricate mosaics on the walls, often showing nude women bathing. Turkish baths removed the cold water room and only had warm and hot bathing rooms. Many baths sprouted up around thermal hot springs that bubbled up from the earth. The famed Hungarian baths began this way and continue to be a public bathing venue today. Word of the healing aspects of bathing (as well as the prevention of disease and illness) spread slowly, and bathing became a worldwide phenomenon. Bath culture was a source of cleanliness, disease prevention (at least until syphilis became a problem in the Renaissance period), social connection, and rejuvenation. It wasn't until the 15th century that women and men were separated in public baths. Only the very [ wealthy elite had private bathing facilities](https://www.ajaonline.org/article/3817) in their homes or palaces. Bathing fell out of fashion in European countries as a result of the spread of diseases, and by the time the first European settlers arrived on the shores of the Americas, they believed that merely changing their undergarments on a regular basis was sufficient. There's evidence that [ the Native American people attempted to convince the settlers](https://www.history.com/news/american-colonists-pilgrims-puritans-bathing) otherwise, but they did not listen. At the time, the colonists believed submerging one's body in water weakened the immune system. Sentiment around bathing began to change in the [ mid-19th century both in Europe and in the Americas](https://daily.jstor.org/when-americans-started-bathing/) as concerns about cholera became a threat, and better water treatment, sewage management, and indoor plumbing became more common. As technology improved, bathing became more popular, and according to a [ research paper published in 1986](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3787982?mag=when-americans-started-bathing&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), the first private bathtub was installed in a private home around 1842 in the U.S. Fast forward to the more modern era and the \"self-care\" boom, and bathing has taken on new levels of significance in our private lives. Bathing has been proven to ease stress, help tired muscles recover, and even [ reduce the chance of heart disease](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/health/tub-bathing-heart-disease-risk-wellness/index.html). The Physical and Psychological Effects of Baths If you've plunged yourself into any body of water, you likely know the effects it has on your body and brain, but science has shown that there can be significant benefits, both physical and psychological, to regularly submerging yourself in warm water. A [ 2018 study out of Japan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29977318) reported that regular submersion in 100-degree Fahrenheit (40-degree Celsius) water had significant benefits for reducing stress, fatigue, and pain, as well as improved skin condition and reported feelings of health. The researchers compared two groups, one who showered regularly and one who bathed regularly, over a period of two weeks. They then swapped the groups so that the showerers became bathers and vice versa. The bathers had better outcomes than those who showered. The researchers postulate that the general improvement in mental and physical states in the bathers was a result of improved blood flow, thanks to the warm water, which helps increase metabolic waste elimination. The study concluded that bathing for just 10 minutes per day in warm water can improve symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, depression, and a general sense of well-being. The increased blood flow resulting from baths has also been shown to lower blood pressure, as well. Another recent [ study from 2020](https://heart.bmj.com/content/106/10/732) that also came out of Japan showed that regular baths are associated with a lower incidence of heart disease and stroke. The researches attribute this to the hemodynamic effect of baths \u2014 or the efficiency with which blood is pumped through the body. Aside from the physical benefits of relaxing in a bath, there are a number of well-documented psychological effects. First bathing offers the opportunity for some down, quiet, alone time. Since you probably shouldn't be using your electronic devices (no phones in the bath!) it can offer the opportunity to unplug and disconnect. Baths have also been proven to help battle depression, as a 2018 [ study out of the University of Freiburg](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/09/12/409276.full.pdf) in Germany showed. Researchers followed 45 people struggling with depression as they began a bathing routine over a period of eight weeks. At the end of the eight-week study, those who spent up to 30 minutes per day soaking in 104-degree water showed an improvement in their depression symptoms (measured on a commonly-used depression scale) compared to those who were told to do aerobic exercise for 45-minutes twice a week. How To Get the Restorative Effects of A Bath At Home Not all of us have the luxury of having a giant bathtub in our homes to luxuriate in. In fact, most Americans have opted to remove bathtubs from their homes in favor of larger shower spaces, according to a [ story from 2018 in Realtor Magazine](https://magazine.realtor/home-and-design/feature/article/2018/02/just-how-important-is-a-bathtub-for-resale), and in urban areas like New York City, the move to [ oversized showers started in 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/realestate/replacing-tub-with-shower.html). If you do have a bathtub, the best way to enhance the good vibes and benefits of a bath are pretty straight forward. First, scrub the tub. Gross bathtubs aren't inviting, so do your best to get the tub as clean as possible. There are some great non-toxic grout cleaners and tub cleaners on the market that can get your tub pretty spotless before you go lounging in it. Make sure that the area around your tub is sealed well so that water doesn't slide down and get underneath it. Repairing any open space between the tub and wall or floor with the right kind of caulk and use a cleanser like [CLR](https://clrbrands.com/Products/CLR-Household/CLR-Calcium-Lime-Rust-Remover) on your faucet and showerhead can also help get your tub and shower clean before you go lounging in it naked. If you can, put away visual clutter in your bathroom. Visual clutter can increase stress, so to enhance the relaxation vibe in your space, it helps to get it out of your line of sight. Even if you don't have the space to put stuff away, you can always pull the shower curtain and give a bit of privacy and enhance the environment of your space. Most experts also recommend setting yourself up for relaxation by limiting your electronic device usage, too. If you want to watch a show while you soak, set your device up well away from the tub. A friendly reminder: Electricity and water do not mix. If you want a distraction while you bathe, choose a book or grab a Bluetooth speaker or a set of wireless headphones that will stay in your ears and put on a relaxing playlist. Candles and scented essential oils like lavender or chamomile can add to the relaxation (and are good for your skin), too. If you're a fan of bath bombs or additives in your tub, feel free to add them to the warm water while filling the bath. If you're looking for a restorative bath that can help ease sore muscles after a workout, try Epsom salts, which you can find in a grocery store or drug store. You can also use oatmeal (yes, the stuff you eat for breakfast) as a skin softening and soothing additive. The main trick with baths is to ensure that the water is not too hot. If you have a thermometer, try to aim for water that's around 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celcius) and stay in the bath at least 10 minutes since that's how long it takes for your body to get the feel-good benefits. If you don't have a bathtub in your home or apartment, never fear. The good news is that showers can be just as relaxing as baths. Add some of your favorite essential oils to the floor of your shower (be sure to step in gingerly into the shower when doing so you don't slip, or, better yet, use a non-slip shower mat), turn the shower on warm so that steam starts to accumulate. Once things get a bit steamy, turn the shower down to that magic 104-degree temperature and hop in. A word of warning, some essential oils can be irritating to your lungs when they get aerosolized in the steam, so be careful about what you choose to use. You can also create your own skin-softening scrub using oatmeal or salt, sugar, and honey in the shower. While it's more difficult to watch a show or listen to music while you shower, you can find waterproof Bluetooth shower speakers that can enhance your experience, too. Again, aim for at least 10 minutes of shower time to get the maximum benefit. If you want to get out of your home once things open up again after COVID-19 subsides, there are also plenty of natural hot springs all over the country, as well as spas and fancy hotels you could visit to get the benefit of baths, as well. Of course, in the current environment, it makes sense to double-check with any place you plan to visit to ensure that they are following proper health protocols and social distancing to keep patrons safe. No matter how you plan to get your bath on, soaking in warm water for even 10 minutes a day can be an incredibly beneficial experience both physically and mentally. Taking time out of your day to practice a little self-care can be incredibly good for you. Bonus points for getting naked, too.
