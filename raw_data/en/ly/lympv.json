It's the time of year when leaves transform into vibrant hues, sweaters come out of storage, and the air becomes refreshingly crisp. Unfortunately, it's also a time of increased cold and flu symptoms, dry and painful skin conditions, and altered moods due to shorter days and a lack of sun. Go into this season prepared with a cupboard stocked with healing remedies for common ailments. Here are some beneficial and easy herbs to support your mind and body through the fall and winter months. 1. Fight Fatigue with Eleuthero Also known as Siberian ginseng, eleuthero has been used for centuries in Russia and China due to its ability to improve cognition, enhance energy, and support stress. Eleuthero is part of a unique group of plants called adaptogens that have been proven to augment resistance to stress both physically and mentally-in other words, they help you \"adapt more easily.\" In the fall and winter months, our energy levels can wane as the days grow shorter, but this plant might be just what's needed to remain alert until bedtime. One study published in the International Journal of Phytotherapy and Phytopharmacology found that a group of females taking a standardized extract exhibited improved attention and accuracy during stressful cognitive tasks. Eleuthero is most often taken in capsule or solid extract form. 2. Keep Your Skin Radiant with Sea Buckthorn The biting winter air can strip your skin of much-needed moisture, causing a dull, dry appearance and sensitive, chapped areas. Sea buckthorn, a plant that grows across the mountainous regions of Asia and Europe, can efficiently counteract these symptoms. The medicinal properties are found in the seed and fruit oil, which contain a unique profile of fatty acids including 3, 6, 7, and 9, and are loaded with vitamins, antioxidants, and flavonoids. Treasured for being the richest plant-based source of omega-7 palmitoleic acid available, sea buckthorn has been studied more than 200 times and is commonly used in modern cosmetics and skin products. Apply it topically or add to a smoothie for a radiant glow during the winter months. 3. Feel Better Faster with Elderberry Scared that you might catch that bug going around? Elderberry acts as a triple threat against those untimely colds, providing antiviral and antibacterial qualities while also bolstering the immune system. This flowering shrub is abundant in the United States and Canada, and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to treat colds. A promising preliminary study published in the Journal of Internal Medical Research revealed that patients with influenza-like symptoms who were given elderberry syrup showed symptom relief four days earlier than those who received a placebo. Unlike many cold and flu treatments, elderberry syrup has a sweet flavor that can be taken alone or added to various drinks and recipes. 4. Unwind With Lemon Balm With the holidays fast approaching, you may feel more stress and anxiety as added obligations and errands begin to pile up. Lemon balm is a plant that has been documented all the way back to the Middle Ages as a treatment for restlessness and insomnia. An interesting study reported in The Journal of Biobehavioral Medicine observed that subjects exposed to a stressor and also given a 600 mg dose of lemon balm rated their calmness significantly higher than those in a placebo group. Another study from England's Northumbria University revealed that a 1,600 mg dose of encapsulated dried leaf lemon balm resulted in reports of improved mood, memory, and serenity. As a member of the mint family, this herb makes a flavorful tea or can be taken in capsule form. 5. Halt Winter Aches & Pains with Turmeric Many people complain of increased joint pain and soreness during the colder months (although there's little scientific explanation for this). Curcumin is an orange-hued compound found in the spice turmeric, one that is commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine for its powerful anti-inflammatory actions. A recent study in the Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine found that a daily dose of 2 grams of curcumin in people suffering from osteoarthritis resulted in reports of reduced pain and increased mobility. In addition to soothing sore joints, curcumin is a potent antioxidant, brain health supporter, and strengthener of the vascular system by improving the lining of the blood vessels. A member of the ginger family, turmeric tastes great and can be infused in tea, added to a recipe, or taken in capsule form. 6. Banish the Blues with Rhodiola Also called \"Arctic root\" because of the way it thrives in the cold, mountainous regions of Northern Europe, rhodiola shows promise as a mood-supporting agent. The Greek physician Dioscorides documented rhodiola's effectiveness back in AD 77 as an aid for fatigue and anxiety. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a common occurrence in the Northern Hemisphere during the fall and winter months, but preliminary research in animal trials has demonstrated that rhodiola increases the \"feel good\" neurotransmitter serotonin, banishing those blues as it promotes the transport of important building blocks such as 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Rhodiola is also part of that exclusive group of herbs known as adaptogens. It can be taken as a capsule, tincture, or tea. 7. Rejuvenate with Astragalus This herb is well known in Chinese medicine for its ability to prevent colds and improve energy, but The Journal of Immunology revealed that it might also be an effective antiaging tool. Two constituents of astragalus-called cycloastragenol and astragaloside-may play a role in extending the lifespan of our DNA. How does astragalus do it? A DNA molecule called a \"telomere\" protects the chromosome material from breaking down-but as we age, our telomeres can shorten. There are associations between shortened telomeres and many age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, dementia, and arthritis. Astragalus shows promise as an effective antiaging tool that can preserve the length of telomeres and perhaps decrease the risk of age-related diseases. The root has a mild yet sweet flavor, and can be infused into a tea, added to a soup, or taken in capsule or tincture form. 8. Detox with Dandelion Want to get back on track after overindulging? Dandelion is often considered a weed, but this herb has been documented as far back as the second century AD as a powerful cleansing agent. Dandelion is regarded as a liver and kidney tonic in traditional medicine, and has often been used to improve digestion. Encouraging preliminary studies suggest that dandelion root could even have liver-protective properties. Add the leaves to your salad, or brew the root and leaves into a tea. 9. Calm Your Stomach With Fennel Seeds 'Tis the season for holiday parties fueled by alcohol and decadent foods-both major causes for an upset stomach later in the evening. Fennel seeds are classified as a carminative herb, which can prevent unwanted gas and bloating. The Journal of Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine revealed in a recent study that fennel seed oil significantly decreases gas and bloating compared to a placebo. These tasty seeds are also a great source of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants such as quercetin and kaempferol. As a bonus, they also act as a breath freshener. Add 1 tsp. of fennel seeds to a cup of hot water and let brew for five minutes, or try them raw if you're on the go. 10. Warm up with Ginger Feel like hibernating all winter long? Sometimes the best medicine is simply a warm fire with a great cup of ginger tea. Ginger has been a popular remedy since ancient times for a diverse range of ailments including motion sickness, nausea, migraines, indigestion, sore throats, and even arthritis. Ginger is a great winter herb for its ability to promote circulation within the body, which can create a warming sensation. It is thought that an active compound in ginger called gingerol is responsible for that \"cozy\" feeling by stimulating blood flow and relaxing blood vessels. To get \"toasty\" fast, boil three cups of water, add several slices of fresh ginger (around three ounces), and a hint of honey. Steep for five minutes and enjoy this spicy tea on a chilly day. Colds & Flu Rx Make your own cold-and-flu kit to knock out symptoms at the first sign of illness, or to ward off viruses completely by bolstering your immune defenses throughout the year. Here are five of our favorite immune health supplements, a mix of potent proprietary ingredients, herbal mainstays, and one unique beauty-boosting blend that doubles as an immune aid. 1. Wellmune WGP. According to recent research, the proprietary ingredient Wellmune WGP (beta-glucan from baker's yeast) has been shown in a double-blind study to prevent colds and flu. Subjects were treated with either 500 mg of Wellmune WGP or a placebo for 90 days. Wellmune WGP is designed to be taken daily and has been shown to start working in one to two days. Take 250-500 mg daily. Editors' Product Pick:Immune Health Basics Wellmune WGP 2. EpiCor. A proprietary ingredient found in different products, EpiCor is derived from nutrient-rich baker's yeast prepared using a patented fermentation process. EpiCor works by supporting the immune system and enabling it to work more efficiently. In one 12-week study published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, EpiCor was given to 116 people who hadn't received any flu vaccination. Those taking EpiCor had fewer episodes of colds and flu-like symptoms compared to the placebo group. Editors' Product Pick:Doctor's Best EpiCor 3. Echinacea. This herb helps prevent and reduce symptoms of the common cold. In an analysis of 14 studies, researchers concluded that the herb reduced the odds of catching a common cold by 58 percent. Among people who did catch a cold, echinacea shortened its duration. Editors' Product Pick:Diamond Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC), a hybrid of several mushrooms, is the top-selling immune-enhancing supplement in Japan. As we age, our immune system weakens. This leaves the older members of our population at increased risk for autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancer. Strengthening the immune system is of particular importance as we age. AHCC is one of the most reliable and well-researched immune-supportive products available. Over 100 human clinical trials, animal, and in-vitro studies on AHCC have been conducted throughout the world. Editors' Product Pick:Quality of Life AHCC 5. Vitamin C. With dozens of published studies, the evidence suggests that vitamin C might help prevent colds in children and stressed adults. It has been shown to reduce both symptoms and the length of infection, especially among people exposed to bad weather. Infections deplete the body's vitamin C levels, so continue taking your supplements for a couple of weeks to avoid a rebound deficiency after fighting a cold or flu. Use 1-6 grams in divided doses daily, less for children. Take the higher dosage if you have a cold or the flu. Editors' Product Pick:American Health Ester-C with Citrus Bioflavonoids try it!
