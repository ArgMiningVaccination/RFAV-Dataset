Not all services available at all locations Metamorphosis History Historic Introduction to our Spas Spa Metamorphosis is an affiliation of Dr. Correa International Touristic Medical Service CXA founded in 1997. We have grown to become of the most import chains of Spas in the Dominican Republic. The concept of Metamorphosis, The Spa came from the necessity of resort hotels to offer something more than just sun and beach and a simple body massage. Our spas have converted into a place where you can encounter true relaxation with a variety of therapies. Since we started as medical doctors we realized the necessity of preventative medicine in this day and age of high stress due to our fast paced lives. Many disease processes are brought on by modern day living and the stress it causes. The attention given to a client no only works on their physical being but also the emotional level. A body in constant motion or stress demands a day of pampering, healing touch, and a mental escape. The concept of Metamorphosis, The Spa is revolutionary. We have started the evolution from traditional beach massage centers to create a true International Spa experience. Our staff is trained by International registered therapists. We are constantly training staff and management to meet the high expectations of international guests of Spa destinations. Remember to call Pedero- and tell him Jeff "}
