EFSAs scientific opinions on meat inspection of 27 swine and poultry have already been published1, and those on meat inspection of 28 ruminants, farmed game animals and solipeds are under development . 29 30 The UK Food Standards Agency is currently funding research to build the evidence 31 base for the modernisation of PM MI, which includes an assessment of the risks and 32 benefits of visual -only PM MI, where mandatory palpation and incision procedures are 33 omitted . A recent risk and be nefit assessment of visual -only PMMI for pigs (Hill, 34 Donaldson et al. 2012 ) concluded that the risk to consumers of pig meat /products 35 would be negligible moving from the current to visual -only inspection of all UK pigs, 36 including those that are not eligible for visual -only PMMI according to current EC 37 Regulation criteria2. In this report we present the results of a similar risk and benef it 38 assessment for a change from current to visual -only PMMI for cattle, sheep/go ats and 39 farmed/wild deer. 40 41 The hazard/species pairings considered are listed in Appendix I; the hazard/species 42 pairing s that were shortlisted as vulnerable to a change in risk were Mycobacterium 43 avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) (all species), M. species), 44 hepatica (all species), Erysipelothrix deer), goats), Jaagsiekte ( Ovine Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma - OPA) (sheep, goats) 47 and Dictyocaulus filaria (sheep, goats). The results of the public health risk 48 assessment indicated that a ll hazard/species pairings were Negligible with the 49 exception of Cysti cercus bovis in cat tle, which was judged to be of Low -Medium 50 increased risk for non -conforming systems compared to systems that conform to 51 1 Poultry opinion can be found here: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/p ub/2741.htm ; swine opinion can be found at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2351.htm . 2 EC Regulation 854/2004 (OJ L 139, 30.4.2004). 3 Regulations3 for visual -only PMMI. However, th e absolute risk was judged to be 52 Very Low - Low for all conforming and non -conforming systems under visual -only 53 PMMI. 54 55 Most hazard/species pairings were concluded to pose a potential increased risk to 56 animal health/welfare, including bovine TB (Very Low - Low increase in risk , but 57 with considerable uncertainty), Fasciola hepatica (Negligible - Very Low) and C. 58 bovis (Very Low - Low). Only for bovine TB is feedback to farmers relatively 59 assured (because this is the only disease considered that requires mand atory follow -up 60 by AHVLA) . Hence as a result of low feedback rates , the feedback to farmers for F. 61 hepatica and C. bovis is low enough that the real risk to animal health/welfare for 62 these two diseases of including non -conforming systems under visual -only PMMI is 63 probably negligible. That then leaves bovine TB as the only confirmed non -negligible 64 animal health and welfare risk. H owever the judgement of Low is very uncertain, as 65 it is unclear to what extent PMMI prevent s the potential transmission of TB to other 66 cattle , by removing cattle from infected herds earlier than the next planned tuberculin 67 test. Further research is required in this area. 68 69 The benefit assessment identified the need for more research to quantify the exact 70 extent to which the omissio n of certain palpation and incision procedures would 71 reduce contamination of the edible carcase , and subsequently whether this would have 72 any corresponding reduction in public health risk. An indirect benefit was identified 73 in using the time saved from omitting mandatory palpations/ incisions to record 74 conditions found more accurately and in a way that is more amenable to further 75 epidemiological analysis. 76 77 Further research is probably required before any policy decision can be made, but 78 there is certainly a convincing reason to conduct this research, as there are avenues of 79 enquiry, such as better data recording, which may make visual -only PMMI a 80 compelling option. This should be balanced against the need to support the TB 81 control programme. 82 83 84 3 EC regulation 1244/2007 (OJ L 281, p . 12 of 25.10.2007) . 4 1 Introductio n 85 Official meat inspection is important for assuring the safety of meat and is also 86 required to ensure access to international trade. Therefore, the aims of the current 87 system of official meat inspection are to: 1) protect public health by ensuring that 88 meat is safe to eat, 2) protect animal health and welfare, 3) maintain consumer 89 confidence, and 4) facilitate national and international trade (Alban, Steenberg et al. 90 2011 ). However, the current post-mortem meat inspection (PMMI) that employs 91 typical macroscopic inspection techniques, namely visual examination, palpation and 92 incision, cannot detect the foodborne hazards that are of importance today , e.g. 93 Salmonella , Campylobacter and E. coli O157 (EFSA 2009 ). 94 95 The European Commission (EC) has recognised a need to develop a more effective , 96 risk-based approach to meat inspection (EC 2000 ). This would improve efficiency in 97 controlling the most important public health hazards associated with meat at abattoirs 98 whilst maintaining surveillance of animal health /welfare issues. The subsequent Food 99 Hygiene Regulati ons (Regulations (EC) 852 /2004, 853/2004 and 854/2004) enabled 100 implement ation of different approache s to PMMI for pigs, calves and lambs , provided 101 certain criteria were met and that it was based on a sound risk assessment. These 102 regulations included the r equirements to supply Food Chain Information (FCI) 103 (epidemiological data, heard health data, production data) , from farmers to the 104 slaughterhouse operator and Official Veterinarian (OV) at the slaughterhouse for 105 animals before arrival at the slaughterhouse . EC Regulation 854/2004 allowed 106 Offical Auxillaries (colloquially known as meat inspectors in the UK) to conduct 107 visual -only post-mortem inspection (i.e. without mandatory use of incision and/or 108 palpation techniques in routine slaughter) of fattening pigs reared indoors from 109 controlled housing conditions and integrated production systems . EC regulation 110 1244/2007 extended the principle of visual -only PMMI to cattle and sheep/goats, 111 provided certain age and manag ement conditions are met (including all-in-all-out 112 production and cattle/sheep being less than 8/12 months old respectively ). 113 114 A previous risk assessment (Hill, Donaldson et al. 2012 ), addressing the risk arising 115 from moving to visual -only PMMI of all pigs in the UK , concluded that the risk in 116 5 relation to all public health hazards detectable by current PMMI (including 117 Myco bacterium bovis) would be negligible . It was also concluded that there would be 118 a very low increased risk to animal health /welfare due to Tuberculosis ( TB) lesions 119 being missed by meat inspectors if they omitted incis ion of the head lymph nodes , 120 because c urrent PMMI is the only surveillance mechanism for identifying the 121 presence of TB associated changes in pigs. As part of the UK Food Standards 122 Agencys (FSAs) continuing process to modernise meat inspection a similar risk and 123 benefit assessment has been conducted for other livestock species where visual -only 124 meat inspection has been allowed by current legislation , specifically cattle, 125 sheep/goats and , in addition, farmed/wild deer. 126 127 The specific risk question asked by the FSA was: 128 129 \"What is the change in risk for i) public health and ii) animal health/welfare if the 130 derogation for visual only post-mortem meat inspection, established in EC Regulation 131 1244/2007 for cattle and sheep/goats under certain age and management criteria, are 132 extended to all animals of these species and farmed/wild deer in the UK?\" 133 134 In addition the FSA requested an assessment of the benefits of visual -only PMMI of 135 cattle, sheep/goats and farmed/wild deer . We do not consider the aspects of meat 136 inspection not related to public or anima l health /welfare i.e. consumer confidence and 137 facilitating international trade, as they were determined to lie outwith the scope of the 138 FSAs research requirements. 139 140 2 Materials and methods 141 142 2.1 Definitions 143 144 For clarity, we first define relevant terminology, concordant with the relevant EU 145 legislation and risk analysis frameworks. To undergo visual -only PMMI there are 146 several requirements as specified in Annex I I of Regulation (EC) 1244/2007, 147 including that animals are raised under \"controlled and integrated production 148 6 systems\". An integrated system is defined as a herd that has detailed information 149 available for all the animals from birth to slaughter and their management conditions. 150 There are also several other criteria relating to all-in-all-out systems , feed and 151 bedding that make up the definition for a \"controlled\" system. 152 153 Expert opinion from the \"English Beef and L amb Executive \" (EBLEX) suggests that 154 all quality -assured farms in England and Wales , regardless of production type, would 155 currently meet the criteria for a fully integrated system . This is due to meeting feed 156 and management requirements, the traceability between farm and abattoir provided by 157 FCI, and the various animal movement licence systems for cattle and sheep. 158 159 We define all product ion systems that meet the criteria as laid down by EC Regulation 160 1244/2 007 as \"conforming\" systems and those that do not as \"non -conforming\" 161 systems. For example, only those cattle slaughtered at an age of less than 8 months 162 and produced in an integrated and controlled production system will be classed as 163 \"conforming\". 164 165 Another important clarification is that while a system may be conforming, not all 166 batches/animals are able to be visually -inspected. Only non -suspect animals would be 167 eligible for routine /normal slaughter and visual -only PMMI . These animals are: a) 168 NOT considered as posing higher risk according to FCI , b) NOT showing relevant 169 abnormalities at ante-mortem inspection and c) NOT showing relevant abnormalities 170 at visual PMMI. Hence, if visual -only PMMI was implemented for all red meat 171 animals slaughtered in the UK, then some animals will still be diverted to a category 172 where carcases /organs would be palpated/incised in addition to visual -only PMMI. 173 174 Sensitivity of detection of infection is def ined as the ability of PMMI to detect an 175 infected animal, rather than the sensitivity of detecting visible lesions (in the context 176 of TB, for example). That is, the sole concern is the ability to detect true infection of 177 an animal. 178 179 Finally, for pars imony, all further references to animal health are taken to include both 180 health and welfare issues. 181 182 7 2.2 Risk -benefit framework 183 184 The risk -benefit framework used in this assessment is identical to that carried out for 185 the assessment of risk and benefit of the change from current to visual -only PMMI for 186 pigs (Hill, Donaldson et al. 2012 ). Briefly, there are two main criteria that determine 187 whether the risk will change: i) i s the sensitivity of detecting a hazard affected as a 188 consequence of switching from current to visual -only PMMI ? And ii) is the hazard of 189 concern more prevalent in no n-conforming systems than conforming systems? If the 190 answer to one or both of these questions is no , then non -conforming animals/systems 191 pose no greater risk than conforming animals/systems. Where the relative risk is non - 192 negligible, we also comment on the absolute risk to public/animal health. The relative 193 risk can be defined as increased if the risk posed by visual -only PMMI of non - 194 conforming systems is greater than the risk posed by conforming systems (conforming 195 systems are assumed to be at an \"accep table\" level of risk). The absolute risk to 196 public health is determined by the relationship between the burden of undetected 197 contaminated meat entering the food chain and the rates of human illness attributable 198 to that contaminated meat. The absolute ris k of a hazard will vary according to the 199 prevalence of the disease it causes in the animal species , and, what proportion of those 200 affected animals can be detected by the meat inspector through observation of related 201 signs/lesions at PMMI. However, the sens itivity of detection of a given disease at 202 PMMI varies with different stages of disease . Many diseases can go undetected at 203 PMMI simply due to their low occurrence . Hence, while a specific risk may be 204 judged to be increased under visual -only PMMI as compa red to traditional PMMI , 205 this increase in risk may not have significant effect on the total burden of disease in 206 human and/or animal population s. This is especially true if the absolute risk for 207 traditional PMMI is already very low -negligible and/or where alternative methods for 208 the disease control are possible . The significance of any visual PMMI versus 209 traditional PMMI increase in risk must be considered in context of the above 210 mentioned aspects by the risk manager before taking appropriate action. 211 212 Disease within a herd or flock can be monitored and managed, if identified correctly 213 and timely. The contribution of PMMI, being a part of the risk management activities 214 of the national Competent Authority, to the control of animal health /welfare hazards 215 8 relies on the PMMI -derived information being fed back to the farmer. Hence, t he 216 absolute risk to animal health/welfare is assessed according to whether a potential 217 decrease occurs in the feedback of meat inspection findings of relevant hazards to 218 farmers of c onforming and non -conforming systems. However, it is not clear how 219 much information is being provided back to farmers on issues identified in the 220 slaughterhouse , or if the farmer is actually interested in the feedback and/or willing to 221 address the issues raised . This presumably depends on : the economics of the farm 222 (such as the impact on productivity) ; legislation requirements followed up by relevant 223 authorities (for example , the identification of TB-positive cattle) ; and the 224 understanding and perception of Collection and Communication of Inspection Results 225 (CCIR), which forms an important aspect of FCI4. However, in this assessment we 226 assume 100% compliance with legislation and a 100% reaction from farmers in order 227 to address animal health and/or welfare issues. This is the only realistic way to make 228 direct comparisons on the impact of the change from current to visual -only PMMI on 229 animal health and welfare . The relevance and impact of this assumption is debated in 230 the discussion. 231 232 The risk assessment framework , shown in Figure 1, largely follows the OIE 233 guidelines for microbiological risk assessment (OIE 2004 ), with an additional Hazard 234 Identification stage. 235 236 4 See Manual for Official Controls: Food Chain Information (FCI) and Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR) , available at: http://www. food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/mocmanualch2part1rev49.pdf . 9 237 238 Figure 1 : Risk and benefit assessment framework. At each stage specific decision 239 criteria are used to assess the absolute/relative risk/benefit from the list of hazards 240 specified in the ap pendix. 241 242 It is not feasible or necessary to assess the risk of all known hazards to public or 243 animal health and welfare that may be found on cattle/sheep/goat/deer carcases and 244 identified during meat inspection. During the Hazard Identification and Relea se 245 Assessment stages of the framework a number of decision criteria are used to identify 246 hazards where there may be a significant change in public /animal health risk between 247 current and visual -only PMMI . Only those hazards which pose a potential risk are 248 taken forward for a full risk assessment. More detail is given below. 249 250 Hazard Identification: Assessment of all relevant hazards under two criteria: i) is the 251 hazard detectable only by palpation and/or incision? ii) does the hazard present a 252 10 significant public or animal health /welfare risk if not spotted at PMMI ? Only those 253 hazards meet ing these two criteria are taken forward to Release Assessment. 254 255 Release Assessment: A ssessment of whether non -conforming animals of each species 256 considered would \"release\" relatively more of the hazard into the food chain than 257 conforming animals. A measurable decision criterion was defined as: is the 258 prevalence of the hazard higher in non -conforming animals than conforming animals? 259 Only those hazards where the prevalence i s higher in non -conforming systems (or in 260 the absence of relevant data unknown to be lower) are taken forward to the next stage. 261 262 Exposure and Consequence Assessment: All hazards remaining are assessed for i) the 263 likelihood of human exposure, and the likel y consequences of exposure , and ii) the 264 likelihood of reduction in feedback from the Food Business operator ( FBO ) to the 265 producer and the likely consequence of this reduction on animal health . The absolute 266 risk to public /animal health from production of all species is assessed, to set in context 267 the relative difference in risk between conforming and non -conforming systems . 268 269 Benefit Assessment: The possible benefits of removing palpation and incision from 270 meat inspection procedures are discussed. 271 272 In this r isk assessment, we define the following categories of risk, as modified from 273 previous definitions (EFSA 2006 ). 274 275 Negligible - Risk or frequency/consequence is so low as to not merit consideration. 276 Very Low - Risk or frequency/c onsequence is almost negligible, but due to 277 uncertainty or other extenuating circumstances cannot be excluded from 278 consideration. 279 Low - Risk or frequency/consequence is small/infrequent, but still worth considering 280 intervention/mitigation. 281 Medium - Occurs frequently, or event associated with a modest consequence. 282 High - Event occurs often, and/or is associated with a significant consequence. 283 Very High - Event occurs almost certainly, and/or is associated with a serious 284 consequence. 285 286 11 Quantitative data in the published literature on benefits of visual -only PMMI are very 287 limited , but it is widely considered that they relate primarily to i) a presumed 288 reduction in microbiological cross -contamination of the carcase , and ii) a potential 289 saving in time and resour ces (which could be channelled into other activities with 290 human and/or animal health benefits) . Both benefit s were assessed, but due to large 291 uncertainties we have not categorised the benefit by as many qualitative outcomes as 292 for risks. Instead, we make only two distinctions - a \"negligible benefit\" (no 293 detectable or perceived public/animal health benefit) and a \"likely benefit\" (evidence 294 for improvement in public/animal health). 295 296 2.3 Hazard identification and release assessment 297 298 A comprehensive list of dis tinct infectious agents and post -mortem conditions was 299 taken from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agencys (AHVLAs) 300 own protocol for post -mortem inspection of submitted cattle (78 hazards), shee p/goat 301 (71) and deer (54) carca ses. Using a co mbination of literature review and the 302 expertise within the project team , hazards were shortlisted by considering those where 303 there would be a decrease in sensitivity if visual -only inspection methods were 304 employed , and in addition pose a potential threat to human and/or animal health . A 305 summary of all hazards considered and identified is given in Appendix I. The hazards 306 that were shortlisted as vulnerable to a change in risk were Mycobacterium avium 307 subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) (all species), M. species), Fasciola 308 hepatica (all species), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (cattle, sheep, deer), Dictyocaulus 309 Cysticercus bovis (cattle, Caseous 310 (CLA) (sheep, goats), Jaagsiekte (Ovine Pulmonary ocarcinoma - OPA) (sheep, 311 goats) , Dicrocoelium dendriticum (liver fluke) (sheep) and Dictyocaulus filaria 312 (sheep, goats). After further investigation, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in 313 sheep/g oats, dendriticum (sheep) were not pursued 315 further , due to sufficient ability to detect these hazards visually at PMMI, and/or due 316 to a current negligible incidence of detection at PMMI. 317 318 12 Due to a lack of relevant dat a to confidently categorise available datasets by whether 319 the animals were from conforming or non-conforming systems, all hazards identified 320 above were progressed to the exposure and consequence assessment stage. 321 322 2.4 Exposure and consequence assessments 323 324 2.4.1 Asse ssment by decision criteria 325 326 The exposure and consequence assessments have been carried out for each of the 327 hazard/species pairings identified in the previous section . The assessments follow the 328 framework laid out in Figure 1, and are based on the decisi on criteria described 329 within. Each assessment follows the same structure: a b rief overview of the disease; a 330 brief assessment of the difference in disease prevalence between conforming and non - 331 conforming animals (where possible); an assessment of the diff erence in the 332 sensitivity of current and visual -only PMMI of detect ing disease associated 333 abnormalit ies (where possible); and finally an assessment of the impact on public 334 and/or animal health /welfare (i.e. the consequence assessment). Each section is 335 concluded with a risk estimatio n stage, where the relative and absolute risk posed to 336 public and/or animal health is given as appropriate. 337 338 The assessments of each hazard/disease pairing is summarised in Table 1. The final 339 two columns give the overall relati ve risk estimate i.e. what is the risk posed by non - 340 conforming systems relative to the risk posed by conforming systems? We make the 341 a priori assumption that the risk from conforming systems is \"acceptable\", hence by 342 definition the risk posed by non -confo rming systems can only be \"unacceptable\" if 343 the relative risk is greater for non -conforming systems than conforming systems. 344 345 Only one non -negligible increase in relative public health risk could be identified by 346 including both conforming and non -conform ing systems in visual -only PMMI , which 347 was Cysticercus bovis in cattle (low increase in risk). There were three increases in 348 animal health and welfare risk identified: C. bovis in cattle, Fasciola hepatica in 349 cattle/deer and M. bovis in cattle. For the s ake of parsimony the exposure and 350 13 consequence assessments for the hazard/species pairing that were assigned a 351 negligible increased risk for public and animal health are given in Appendix II. 352 353 14 Table 1: Summary of risk assessment for each hazard/species pairing identified for further assessment. 354 Each column represents one of the decis ion criteria in Table 1 . The final two columns give the overall 355 relative risk estimate: that is, what is the risk posed by non -conforming systems relative to the risk 356 posed by conforming systems? 357 358 Key: P - prevalence; NC - C Conforming system; VO - Visual -only; T - 359 Traditional ; N - Negligible; VL - Very Low; L - Low; M . 360 *: +/ - indicates increase/dec rease in prevalence in non -conforming systems compared to conforming 361 systems.

Therefore, we have 376 not replicated the authoritative reviews/risk assessments of human and animal TB 377 epidemiology and surveillance, but simply refer to these assessments in our own brief 378 summary (de la Rua -Domenech 2006 ; ACMSF 2010 ; ACMSF 2011 ). 379 380 TB in cattle was one of the most important zoonotic diseases during the first half of 381 the last century until controls (e.g. milk pasteurisation, slaughter of infected cattle) 382 brought the lev els of infection in British cattle down from at least 40 -50% of animals 383 (Waddington 2004 ) to around 1 -2% today Zoonotic transmission of 384 M. bovis , which was primarily through raw milk consumption, is now considered 385 extremely rare (de la Rua -Domenech 2006 ; HPA 2010 ). However, since the late 386 1990s there has been a marked increase in incidence of bovine TB in the southwest of 387 England and Wales (subsequently spreading into the Midlands and Northern 388 England), as r ecorded by the ongoing surveillance and control program mes in place 389 across the UK (de la Rua -Domenech 2006 ; AHVLA 2011 ). There is still much debate 390 over the relative contribution of the role of wildlife, especially badgers in the UK, as 391 reservoirs of the disease and the related spill -over risk to bovines . 392 393 Surveillance for bovine TB is the most comprehen sive among all animal disease s in 394 the UK, and remains a high priority for the Department for Environment, Food and 395 Rural Affairs ( Defra ) and Agricultural Departments in other countries within the UK , 396 as part of an EU -approved and co -financed bTB eradicatio n plan . It includes 397 mandatory testing of herds using the tuberculin skin test every one or four years , 398 depending on previous history of the herd and geographical location , supplemented 399 with pre -movement skin testing, ad hoc testing and additional gamma in terferon blood 400 testing of some infected herds, depending on the location and epidemiological 401 16 situation of the breakdown . The testing regime is complemented by post-mortem 402 meat inspection (with back -tracing and tuberculin skin testing of affected herds) , 403 where several mandatory procedures (e.g. the incision of certain lymph nodes) are 404 aimed at detecting localised TB associated lesions . A detailed flow diagram of the 405 process of tuberculin testing of cattle in Great Britain (GB) is given in de la Rua - 406 Domenec h (2006). 407 408 TB in cattle is typically characterised by small caseous nodules, primarily in the 409 mediastinal, r etropharyngeal, tracheobron chial and mesenteric lymph nodes, which 410 are typically found by palpation and incision of the aforementioned organs at PMM I 411 (Liebana, Johnson et al. 2008 ). 412 413 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 414 415 FSA meat inspection data categorise cattle into calves (< 8 months) and adults (> 8 416 months), hence we are able to broadly differentiate between the relative prevalence of 417 TB in non-conforming and conforming systems since calves slaughtered at <8 months 418 are usually reared indoors (Mary Vickers, EBLEX, personal communication). The 419 PMMI detection rate of Mycobacterium spp. in the UK during the period 2008 -2011 420 was 0.27% in adult cattle (22,514 suspect lesions/8,484,371 cattle slaughtered) and 421 0.04% a statis tically significant difference (p<0.05). 422 Considering the epidemiology of TB infection in cattle, this difference between age 423 groups is not unexpected, given that older cattle grazed outside will be far more likely 424 to be exposed to M. bovis , especially in high risk areas. Furthermore, it is known that 425 the sensitivity of detection at PMMI increases with age, as infected cattle have more 426 time to develop visible lesions, and so the data is likely to be confounded to some 427 degree. 428 429 Sensitivity of detection 430 431 The definition of the sensitivity of detection is the absolute (\"true\") sensitivity of 432 PMMI to detect infection of an animal, i.e. the number of animals detected by routine 433 PMMI divided by the number of animals truly infected, rather than the number of 434 animal s with detectable lesions at routine PMMI divided by number of animals that 435 17 would test positive by a tuberculin test . While the former is pract ically very difficult 436 to define this is the most appropriate definition of sensitivity of detection in the 437 conte xt of assessing public and animal health risk. 438 439 In a recent systematic review of the sensitivity of different tests for TB it was 440 estimated that the sensitivity of PMMI (worldwide) was between 30 -50% (Downs in 441 prep. ), although the sensitivity estimate is based on a comparison against a gold 442 standard of culture , and so is not a n estimate of the \"true\" sensitivity of detection , and 443 will likely be biased upwards because of it . In a recent study of TB pathology in UK 444 cattle the authors found that 55.5% (111/200) of skin -test positive animals (reactors) 445 and 14% (28/200) of in -contact (skin -test negative) animals had macroscopically 446 detectable lesions at post-mortem examination (Liebana, Johnson et al. 2008 ). The 447 majority of these lesions were found within the ly mph nodes. These examinations 448 were carried out at several AHVLA laboratories, where a much more thorough 449 examination than could be expected at PM MI took place. Hence we can conclude that 450 even in the best case scenario (as skin -test positive animals and t heir contacts will be 451 subject to a more thorough PMMI) at least around 1 in 2 TB-positive cattle are not 452 spotted during routine PMMI inspection . These PMMI -undetected, false negative 453 animals may not have any macroscopic lesions , or may have small, localise d lesions 454 that are undetectable by routine PMMI . The true sensitivity of traditional meat 455 inspection for detection of TB-associated lesions is thought by some experts in the 456 project team to be much lower than the 30% quoted by Downs et al. . Omitting 457 incision of the lymph nodes and palpation will reduce the sensitivity of meat 458 inspection, given that most animals are identified through lesions in the lymph nodes . 459 For cattle with PMMI -detectable lesions, omitting incision could result in a large 460 (almost 100 %) reduction in sensitivity, whilst for all PMMI -examined cattle the actual 461 reduction would be more likely to be between 5 -30%. 462 463 We can therefore argue that PMMI is a very insensitive TB-detection test for the 464 purposes of food safety . If we assess that th e animal -level sensitivity of PMMI is 465 around 20% (lower than that indicated in the quoted systematic review, but higher 466 than the view of some of the project team experts of around 5% ), four out of every 467 five TB-infected cattle pass through PMMI undetected. Therefore, of the 1,038 468 positive M. bovis samples taken at the abattoir in 2010 (AHVLA 2011 ), we can 469 18 estimate that somewhere between 1,000 (if sensitivity is 50%) and 20,000 (5% 470 sensitivity) infected cattle went undetected into the food chain in 2010. 471 472 Of interest is the difference in the tissue type where TB lesions were found in 473 slaughterhouse versus positive tuberculin reactors, whic h was analysed in an 474 unpublished study by AHVLA (Richard Clifton -Hadley, AHVLA, personal 475 communication). TB-associated lesions were significantly more likely to be found in 476 the lungs, pleura, liver, and \"other\" organs (including kidney/spleen) in 477 slaughte rhouse cases compared to reactors, and significantly less likely to be 478 identified in the trachea -bronch ial and mediastinal lymph nodes of slaughterhouse 479 cases. This unpublished study indicates that there are differences in carcase pathology 480 of slaughterho use TB cases, which may or may not modify the sensitivity of current 481 and/or visual -only PMMI. Further research would seem to be warranted. 482 483 The sensitivity of PMMI -detection of TB-associated lesions for younge r animals is 484 presumed to be much lower than for adult cattle . Animals that have just been exposed 485 to TB will probably have a lower chance of developing PMMI -detectable lesions , 486 because of a short time period to slaughter . However, no direct evidence to support 487 this assumption was found in the lite rature . 488 489 Impact on public health 490 491 Human infection with M. bovis is clinically indistinguishable from M. tuberculosis , 492 and hence only culture of the organism confirm s M. bovis infection. People may be 493 exposed to M. bovis via occupational exposure on the farm or in the abattoir, or 494 through foodborne exposure . 495 496 Meat -borne transmission of M. bovis is theoretically possible, but it has not be en 497 documented in the UK or EU to date. In any case, in accordance with the legislation, 498 beef carcases from cattle with localised TB infection are passed fit for human 499 consumption after the relevant TB-affected material has been condemned (i.e. 500 removed from the meat chain (Grange a nd Yates 1994 ; Ashford, Whitney et al. 2001 ; 501 de la Rua -Domenech 2006 )). The authors of a quantitative risk assessment for human 502 M. bovis infection via meat consumption in the UK estimated that a maximum of 24 503 19 new cases per year could be attributed to beef consumption (ACMSF 2010 ; ACMSF 504 2010 ; ACMSF 2011 ). This estimate of 24 cases is likely to be a large over -estimate, 505 because it was assumed that all cases in under -35 year olds can be attributed to meat 506 consumption. Given that most cases of M. bovis are far more likely to be attributed to 507 raw milk consumption (the sale of raw milk is still legal in England and Wales), then 508 this figure is likely to be much lower in reality. Hence, even a potential rate of 20,000 509 undetected carcases entering the food chain results in what is highly likely to be a 510 negligible meat -borne risk. 511 512 The omission of the incision of lymph nodes from meat inspection procedures is 513 assumed to reduce the likelihood of occupational exp osure, hence occupational 514 exposure in the abattoir is considered no further in this risk assessment. Occupational 515 exposure of farmers, vets, abattoir workers etc... has been recorded as causing bovine 516 TB infection, but it is very rarely seen in the UK (de la Rua -Domenech 2006 ). 517 518 Impact on animal health /welfare 519 520 In 201 0, 22.2% of all new confirmed (OTF status withdrawn) herd breakdowns5 were 521 identified during PM MI (AHVLA 2011 ). Where TB is identified by meat inspection 522 in a previously Officially -Tuberculosis Free (OTF) herd, typically a sole animal is 523 identified (Olea -Popelka, Costello et al. 200 8). Therefore, omitting incision of lymph 524 nodes and palpation is likely to reduce sensitivity of detection of TB-associated 525 lesions at PMMI to near zero. Consequently we can expect a reduction in the number 526 of herds identified as TB-positive through PM MI if non -conforming systems are 527 included in visual -only PMMI (although it is unknown how many positive herds 528 remain unidentified through current PMMI). 529 530 While a significant percentage of breakdown herds are identified during PMMI in the 531 UK, it can be pres umed that most of these herds would eventually be detected by the 532 mandatory tuberculin test programme. The importance of PMMI as an indicator of 533 TB infection is higher in four -yearly testing areas ( such as Scotland and the far North 534 5 A herd breakdown is defined as a herd that has had one or more suspect TB reactors identified at either tuberculin test or meat inspection. If TB is confirmed, then the herd is classified as a co nfirmed herd breakdown. 20 and East of England) than for yearly -testing areas - 45.4% and 21.3% of Officially 535 Tuberculosis Free Withdrawn ( OTF -W) herds are identified through PMMI , 536 respectively. The additional contribution of PMMI to TB-detectio n on top of the 537 tuberculin test programme depends on the r ate of spread of TB in the affected herd , 538 the frequency of testing, the type and size of the herd and other factors (Broughan et 539 al. 2011) . If lymph node incision was omitted from PMMI there may be a delay in 540 detecting new breakdown herds resulting in add itional animals /herds becoming 541 infecte d. 542 543 The OTF status of cattle herds with suspect cases of TB detected by PMMI is initially 544 suspended by AHVLA, pending laboratory culture results. Once a submission from 545 PMMI has been confirmed by culture of M. bovis at AHVLA (approximately 75% of 546 all submissions) , a herd is assigned OTF -W status . The probability of confirmation of 547 a breakdown /OTF -W status increases with the time since the last routine herd test. 548 Around 30 -50% of herds re-tested within a year of rout ine testing are confirmed , 549 peaking at 66% for herds tested 3 -4 years previously (AHVLA 2011 ). In 2010, 382 550 herds (41.6% of all OTF -W new incidents identified within the abattoir) had skin -test 551 positive reactors, comprising a total of 2,694 cattle ( an average of 7.8 reactors per 552 reactor -positive herd ). Hence we can reasonably assume that around 3,000 reactors 553 are removed each year due to PMMI: this will not impact on public health where the 554 risk is already negligible, but could be important in reducing the numbers of days -at- 555 risk in which TB-infected cattle remain able to pose a transmission risk to other cattle 556 or wildlife . 557 558 The implic ations of the proposed changes in PMMI for TB control programmes in the 559 UK ar e hard to ascertain. In high -risk areas, cattle herds will be tested on farm every 560 year anyway, and so the impact of the removal of PMMI as an effective animal health 561 surveillanc e tool in preventing the transmission of infection within -herd and/or 562 between herds is probably limited. While within -herd (cattle -to-cattle) transmission 563 rates are hard to determine, modelling and observational data suggest that spread of 564 infection betwe en cattle on the same herd would be in the region of single figures over 565 the course of 1 -4 years (Barlow, Kean et al. 1997 ; Phillips, Foster et al. 2003 ; Fischer, 566 van Roermund et al. 2005 ; Conlan, McKinley et al. 2012 ). We assume any infected 567 herds in these areas would be detected relatively quickly through mandatory 568 21 tuberculin skin testing, relative to the rate of TB spread through the herd. However, 569 Officially -Tuberculosis Free (OTF) herds in low -risk areas will only be tested once 570 every four years, wit h the implication that infection could become relatively 571 widespread in that timeframe, and potentially pose a risk to other herds if animals are 572 moved. While the proportion changes yearly, around 40 -50% of herds currently fall 573 within the yearly -interval testing parish; roughly the same percentage falls within the 574 four-yearly interval testing parish. 575 576 Risk estimation 577 578 Of the estimated 100 or so new confirmed human cases of M. bovis per year in the 579 UK, there is no substantial evidence that any could be at tributed to meat consumption. 580 It is possible that meat from infected cattle is contaminated with M. bovis . In one 581 study 5% of reactors or dangerous contacts with N o Visible Lesion s (NVLs) yielded 582 viable M. bovis from edible carcase tissue or offal (ACMSF 2003 ). Nevertheless , 583 human meat -borne infection is extremely unlikely given the level of c ontamination is 584 probably very low due to the typical localised type of infection found in most UK 585 cattle (Liebana, Johnson et al. 2008 ). Cooking and drying are also effective in 586 reducing the amount of M. bovis in muscle tissue (Merkal and Whipple 1980 ; van der 587 Merwe, Bekker et al. 2009 ); in addition, the dose required for human infection via the 588 gastrointestinal route is likely to be several orders of magnitude higher than that for 589 aerosol transfer (ACMSF 2011 ). As stated previously, meat f rom undetected infected 590 cattle (and from detected cattle with affected areas being removed) has been entering 591 the food chain for decades with no evidence of meat -borne transmission. Hence, 592 while it is possible that there w ould be an increase in the proportion of TB-infected 593 cattle remaining undetected during PMMI if visual -only inspection was extended to 594 non-conforming systems, the relative increase in risk to public health from M. bovis is 595 negligible , as is the overall ris k to public health from consumption of beef. 596 597 Despite an increase in bovine TB incidence in cattle and increases in the UK 598 population over the last two decades, the number of M. bovis cases reported annually 599 has decreased, or at the very least remained c onstant, over the same time period (HPA 600 2010 ). The ra te of occupational exposure is clearly linked to the number of infected 601 cattle in the UK, but there has been little evidence for a corresponding increase in the 602 22 number of M. bovis infections in humans due to contact with TB-infected cattle. 603 Bovine TB infection via occupational exposure remains very rare. It is estimated 604 above that around 3,000 reactors are removed each year due to PMMI; hence if these 605 are not removed there is, at most, 3,000 extra cattle for humans to be exposed to via 606 occupational activi ties. It is extremely unlikely this number of infected cattle would 607 result in measurably more occupational exposure cases. The overall increased risk to 608 public health would be negligible . 609 610 Given that the within -herd spread of TB is probably slow and results in sporadic cases 611 only, the rationale for maintaining incision of the lymph nodes is more compelling for 612 low-risk herds/areas than it is for high -risk herds/areas. Given the current importance 613 of PMMI in detecting a significant proportion of breakd own herds, it is impossible to 614 assess the relative increase in risk to animal health as negligible. However, given the 615 epidemiology of TB in cattle, then the relative increase in risk to animal health is 616 probably very low - low, although this cannot be st ated with great confidence as there 617 are significant uncertaint ies present in this assessment . Further research is required to 618 make a more certain assessment and rule out a higher relative risk. 619 620 2.4.3 Fasciola hepatica in all species 621 622 Overview 623 624 F. hepatica, commonly known as liver fluke, is a common trematode parasite of 625 ruminants which has a major impact on livestock in te rms of morbidity and mortality 626 (Salimi -Bejestani, McGarry et al. 2005 ). Eggs fr adult worm inhabiting the 627 hosts bile duct enter the duodenum with the bile and leave the host via the faeces. 628 The snail Lymnaea truncatula forms the intermediate host ingesting the eggs and 629 subsequently depositing cercariae on blades of grass where they can remain viable for 630 1 year. Sheep are more susceptible to infestation than cattle, goats and deer as they 631 graze the grass more closely and the majority of the cercariae encyst low down 632 (especially on marshy land ). When the grass is eaten by grazi ng animals the cysts 633 dissolve in the small intestines ; the embryos then pass to the liver and develop into 634 adult flukes where they can live for up to 10 years. Heavily infested hosts may die 635 23 and those with lighter infestations may suffer inhibited growth and reduced 636 production efficiency (Fox, White et al. 2011 ). 637 638 The di sease is usually diagnosed in the live animal either on the basis of microscopic 639 observation of eggs in faeces (Boray 1985 ), serological tests for parasitic antigens or 640 specific antibodies in serum. Few of these tests have been validated for large -scale 641 diagnostic purposes. Over the past 40 years fascioliasis in cattle ha s increased in 642 significance with the number of cases being diagnosed increasing and the infestation 643 being detected in areas where it was previously considered unlikely. Fascioliasis is 644 treated and controlled through the strategic use of flukicidal drugs. Control is aided 645 by preventing cattle grazing snail -infested habitats and by the use of molluscicides to 646 reduce snail numbers. 647 648 Fascioliasis in ruminants can occur as either acute or chronic forms. Chronic 649 fascioliasis is the most common clinical syndro me associated with liver fluke 650 infection in sheep and cattle. It occurs when the parasites reach the hepatic bile ducts 651 causing bile duct obstruction, tissue, hepatic fibrosis (scarring) and 652 anaemia. Cattle typically present with ns of weight loss, anaemia and chronic 653 diarrhoea. Acute fascioliasis results from swelling and congestion of the liver due to 654 invasion by large numbers of young flukes. In deer , infection is most common in roe 655 deer in which it may be fatal . Other deer species have more resistance (Parr and Gray 656 2000 ). 657 658 Enhanced surveillance for human fascioliasis was carried out after a reported increase 659 in livestock Fasciola cases in the UK. For the year 2008 -2009, 11 human cases were 660 confirmed by reference laboratories in England and Wales. Clinical features of both 661 acute and chronic infection in man include fever, upper abdominal pain, malaise, 662 eosinophilia, and impa ired liver function. All cases were either in people who had 663 recently travel led to fascioliasis -endemic areas of the globe or had consumed Fasciola 664 infested veg etation from abroad (Chand, Herman et al. 2009 ). Fascioliasis is 665 sometimes included in zoonotic diseases in the literature since the infestation occurs 666 both in animals and humans, but in this case there was no evidence of direct zoonotic 667 (animal -to-human) transmission of Fasciola cases in the UK . 668 669 24 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 670 671 FSA PMMI data shows a marked increase in prevalence of detected fascioli asis in 672 older cattle wit h an annual average of 20,838 case s per 100,000 cattle over the past 4 673 years compared to 142 cases per 100,000 calves. Animals with access to pasture 674 would be more at ris k of encountering cercariae than calves kept indoors. Although 675 data suggest that the risk from ovine fluke infection is increasing in the UK as a result 676 of changing climatic conditions (Fox, White et al. 2011 ), there have been no 677 nationwide surveys to estimate the prevalence of F. hepatica in sheep. In a New 678 Zealand study (Charleston, Kissling e t al. 1990 ) the national prevalence of Fasciola 679 infestation in lambs was 0.05% compared with 4.41% for older sheep. However, no 680 information was given for age of sheep at slaughter or husbandry type. FSA meat 681 inspection data suggest an average prevalence of 6746/100,000 cases of Fasciola in 682 sheep and 2019/100,000 in goats for GB. Commercial dairy goats sent to slaughter are 683 not likely to be affected by fascioliasis because they are housed indoors (Nick 684 Clayton , British Goat Society - personal communicatio n). Veterinary i nvestigation 685 surveillance data collected by AHVLA (from the VIDA - Veterinary Investigation 686 Diagnosis Analysis - database ) show s a majority of VIDA submissions for goats 687 diagnosed with acute/chronic fascioliosis from older goats . The rate of submission for 688 sheep older than 12 months is twice as high as for sheep less than 12 months of age . 689 690 From FSA meat inspection records, the rate of detection of Fasciola in deer was 30 691 per 100,000 wild deer and 6 ,233 recordings per 100,000 farmed deer. The prevalence 692 of Fasciola detection at PM MI for wild deer is probably greatly under -estimated due 693 to the practice of presenting the carcase only (i.e. minus pluck -heart, liver and lungs ) 694 for inspection at the slaughterhouse unless the hunter suspects any abnormality . 695 696 Sensitivity of detection 697 698 Current mandatory meat inspection procedures for liver in bovines are as follows . 699 Bovines under 6 weeks of age require visual inspection of the liver and the hepat ic 700 and pancreatic lymph nodes, p alpation and, if necessar y, incision of the liver and it s 701 lymph nodes . Bovines over 6 weeks of age require visual inspection and palpation of 702 25 the liver, hepatic and pancreatic lymph nodes , and the incision of the gastric surface 703 of the liver (and at the base of the caudat e lobe for bovines) to examine the bile ducts. 704 For sheep and goats the mandatory meat inspection requirements are visual inspection 705 and palpation of the liver and hepatic and pancreatic lymph nodes and incision of the 706 gastric surface of the liver to exam ine the bile ducts. The EFSA opinion on meat 707 inspection procedures for lambs and goats (EFSA 2004 ) defines Fasciola as being 708 detectable by observation or incision at slaughter. The more serious cases of 709 fascioliasis may be accompanied by cholangitis which is detectable by visual 710 inspection . In other cases incision of bile ducts is necessary for detection. For deer 711 mandatory meat inspection requires visual inspectio n only with incision where 712 deemed necessary if abnormalities are detected . This procedure would not change 713 under visual -only meat inspection so the sensitivity of detection of Fasciola for deer 714 would remain the same. 715 716 Raps ch et al. (2006) estimated the tr ue prevalence of clinical and sub -clinical Fasciola 717 hepatica in slaughtered Swiss cattle, and determined that the sensitivity of meat 718 inspection ( visual liver inspection only) was around 55-70%. 719 720 In New Zealand routine liver inspection procedure of shee p at slaughter involves 721 visual inspection and palpation only. In a New Zealand study (Kissling 1989 ) 722 researchers compare d Fasciola detection between visual/palpation and gastric liver 723 surface incision method at slaughter. They calculated that of all liver fluke affected 724 lamb livers 6.65% would be missed by palpation but detected by single gastric 725 incision whilst for sheep livers the figure would be 4.94%. 726 727 Assuming that the sensitivities of meat inspection proc edures in cattle and sheep/goats 728 are roughly similar then we can conclude that some livers contaminated with fluke do 729 pass through current meat inspection, and that more would remain undetected if 730 regular incision of the liver was omitted from older cattl e and sheep/goats. However, 731 from current meat inspection data, herd -level sensitivity for cattle would probably 732 remain broadly constant (as within -herd prevalence is relatively high) , but would 733 potentially drop slightly for older sheep /goats (less so for lambs) as within -herd 734 detection prevalence is already relatively low . 735 736 26 Impact on public h ealth 737 738 Incisions of the liver are aimed specifically at the detection of liver fluke. As human 739 liver fluke infections do not occur from ingestion of infested bovine /ovine liver there 740 is no increase d public health risk from omission of these incisions. Despite the 741 described parallel rise in human and veterinary fascioliasis, there is no evidence that 742 recent human cases resulted from zoonotic transmission within the UK (Chand, 743 Herman et al. 2009 ). 744 745 Although the association of fascioliasis with other microbial infections has been 746 documented these have only been demonstrated either experimentally or fortuitously 747 (Ogunrinade and Adegoke 1982 ). It is therefore not possible to categorise the risk to 748 public health of secondary bacterial infection. 749 750 751 Impact on animal h ealth 752 753 Although clinical signs in the animal at farm level allow the farme r to instigate a fluke 754 management programme , many cases of F. hepatica are subclinical and are only 755 detected by the presence of lesions during PMMI . Approximately 20% of 756 slaughterhouse throughput of cattle over the age of 8 months is found to have 757 Fasciola infested livers. Using coproscopy as the gold standard, liver inspection was 758 estimated to have an average sensitivity of 63.2% (55.6 -70.6%; 95% credible interval) 759 (Rapsch, Schweizer et al. 2006 ). We can therefore make a broad statement that up to 760 30-40% of liver fluke would be missed under visual -only PMMI (although of course 761 some of this 30 -40% would be missed under other combinations of 762 visual/palp ation/incision procedures) . This under -detection could be detrimental to 763 animal health and welfare if the lack of feedback to the farmer prevents instigation of 764 a fluke management programme. However, given the current prevalence of Fasciola 765 in cattle, it is unlikely that the drop in animal -level sensitivity would significantly 766 impact herd -level sensitivity (as it is unlikely that all infected cattle within a herd 767 would be missed). 768 769 27 In a comparison of New Zealand and European community ovine liver inspect ion 770 procedures (Kissling 1989 ) incision at PMMI detected an additional three Fasciola - 771 affected livers per 10,000 lambs (in addition to 45 that would be detected by 772 visual/palpation only) and 22 livers/10,000 adu lt sheep. Although this was compared 773 to a visual and palpation PMMI technique it is still considered that a visual only 774 procedure should be sufficient to detect enough liver fluke to identify most if not all 775 affected herds . 776 777 Of concern are recent findings that c attle infected with F. hepatica can have altered 778 responsiveness (delayed type hypersensitivity reaction and cytokine response) to M. 779 bovis BCG infection with reduced interferon - gamma responsiveness in co -infected 780 animals (Flynn, Mulcahy et al. 2009 ). A significant negative association between 781 exposure to F. hepatica and diagnosis of M. bovis using the single intradermal 782 comparative cervical tuberculin test ha s also been established (Claridge, Diggle et al. 783 2012 ). Such interactions could have implications for M. bovis disease diagnosis and 784 progression. 785 786 Similarly d amaged l iver tissue resulting from fluke infestation can become infected 787 with clostridium bacteri a in particular C. novyi which causes \"Black disease \", an 788 acute and fatal disease in both sheep and cattle . However, this condition can be 789 detected visually so the det ection rate between traditional and visual only PMMI will 790 remain the same with no consequential impact on animal health. 791 792 Risk estimation 793 794 F. hepatica is not a meatborne hazard, and hence the risk to public health is negligible 795 in both current and visual -only PMMI of both conforming and non -conforming 796 systems. 797 798 Despite detection of clinical signs at the farm level the frequency of detection of F. 799 hepatica at PM MI is still high for cattle over 8 months of age (~20%) , sheep (7%) and 800 farmed deer (6.5%) many cases are subclinical. Visual -only PMMI would 801 likely reduce sensitivity of detection in all species, but probably not enough to 802 significantly reduce herd-level sensitivity. The increased risk to animal health 803 28 through omission of liver incisions and palpation would probably be negligible for all 804 species , but given the lack of information regarding the reduction of sensitivity for 805 cattle and farmed deer the increased risk might be very low rather than negligible . It 806 is not possible to judge how a very low decrease in the rate of PMMI detection of F. 807 hepatica positive herds would impact on surveillance for bovine TB, but again any 808 impact is likely to be small given that herd -level sensitivity would probably be 809 maintained given a change to visual -only PMMI. 810 811 812 2.4.4 Cysticercus bovis in cattle 814 Overview 815 816 Bovine cysticercosis is a zoonotic disease for which cattle are the intermediate hosts 817 of the human tapeworm Taenia saginata . Humans acquire infection by ingesting raw 818 or undercooked infected beef and the cycle is completed by the ingestion by cattle of 819 faecally disseminated eggs in the environment. Taen iasis in people causes abdominal 820 discomfort, mild diarrh oea, weight loss and emotional distress . It is easily treated by 821 the use of antihelmintics. 822 823 Viable cysticerci in muscles can be easily missed at PMMI since the translucent cysts 824 blend with the surrounding host tissue. Only upon death and degeneration of the 825 parasite is there a sufficient host inflammatory response to create a more detectable 826 lesion. Cysticercosis infections can consist of both v iable and degenerate cysticerci so 827 the detection of only degenerate cysts does not imply the absence of infective cysts 828 elsewhere in the carcase . T. saginata is less of a public health concern than T. solium 829 (the helminth cycling between humans and pigs ) but has proved more difficult to 830 eradicate due to : a greater difficulty in detecting an imals that are lightly infected; and 831 a global propensity to consume raw or semi -cooked beef (Pawlowski and Murrel 832 2001 ). In spite of its low sensitivity, regulated PMMI of cattle at slaughter for 833 cysticercosis helps to reduce transmission of these parasites. 834 835 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 836 29 837 C. bovis still persists in Europe today with prevalen ce of bovine cysticercosis varying 838 between 0.007% and 6.8% based on meat inspection report ing (Dorny, Vall\u00e9e et al. 839 2000 ). The rates of detection from UK meat inspection data from 2008 -2011 are 840 0.008% (15/190,493) and 0.03 2 (2674/8,484,371) for slaughtered calves and adult 841 cattle respectively. 842 843 The sensitivity of meat inspection of carcases with light infestations (1 -10 cy sts) of C. 844 bovis is believed to be low (27%), rising to 43% for animals with 11 -20 cysts and 845 78% when 20 or more cysts are present (EFSA 2005 ). The available research thus 846 suggests that the prevalence of bovine cysticercosis in the EU as determined through 847 meat inspection is greatly underestimated (Dorny and Praet 2 007); the actual 848 prevalence could be 3 - 10 times higher. Heavy infestations in cattle are uncommon , 849 with light infections being most common as a result of accidental ingestion of eggs 850 that have been disseminated in the environment. Hence, if similar s ensitivities are 851 applied to current UK meat inspection procedures, then the prevalence of C. bovis 852 infection could be anywhere between 24 and 80 per 100,000 calves slaughtered 853 (0.00 8%*3*100,000 - 0.008%*10*100,000) , and 100 - 300 per 100,000 adult cattle 854 slaughtered. 855 856 While detection of cysts is more difficult in calves than in adult cattle , the 857 seroprevalence of bovine cysticercosis does appear to be positively correlated with 858 increasing age (Dorny, Vercammen et al. 2000 ). This is explained by the fact that 859 infection is accidental and that the risk of historical exposure increases with the age of 860 the animal. Hence, we can reasonably ascertain that the difference in incidence rates 861 between calves and adult cattle is real (although maybe not as great as indicated by 862 meat inspection data) . 863 864 Sensitivity of detection 865 866 Mandatory meat inspection includes incisions into the internal (pterygoideus) and 867 external (masseter) mastication muscles (not applicable to animals under six weeks of 868 age), a lengthwise incision of the heart in cattle of all ag es and visual examination of 869 the cut surfaces . However, only a proportion of the cysts are located in these so - 870 30 called predilection sites, i.e. the heart (15.7%) and masseter muscles (6.5%) (Dorny 871 and Praet 2007 ). In addition , the success of the method is highly dependent on the 872 skills of the meat inspector and stage of degeneration of the cysticerci. If an animal 873 has generalised infection the carcase and offal are declared unfit for human 874 consumption. If the infect ion is localis ed, detected cysts are removed and the carcase 875 has to be stored at a temperature not exceeding -10 C for > 14 days or -7oC for > 3 876 weeks before release for human consumption. This cold treatment kills any viable 877 cysticerci. 878 879 Since the early 1990s EU regulated modifications were introduced in meat inspection 880 methods in order to reduce costs and time of veterinary control (EFSA 2000) . These 881 included a reduction in the number of incisions of the organs, including the heart, at 882 PMMI. There is s ome evidence that the reduction in the number of cuts in the heart 883 has led to a reduction in sensitivity of meat inspection for cysticercus detection 884 (Dorny, Vall\u00e9e et al. 2000 ). Decreased cases reported in an industrial abattoir in 885 Northern Italy in 1992 -1993 were attributed not to a real decrease in cysticercosis but 886 to a reduction in the number of cuts in some organs accord ing to the new EU 887 regulations and hence to a reduction in sensitivity of inspection (EFSA 2000) . An 888 abattoir trial aiming to increase the detection level of C. bovis at meat inspection 889 performed several additional heart incisions in a total of 1,088 slaugh tered cattle in 890 Switzerland. With the EU -approved routine meat inspection, bovine cysticercosis was 891 diagnosed in 1.8% (20/1088) of the slaughtered animals. Additional incisions into the 892 heart muscle revealed a further 29 cases, indicating that the prevale nce was at least 893 4.5% (Eichenberger, Stephan et al. 2011 ). Another study in Canada found similar 894 results : after experimental infection of calves with C. bovis , a more thorough 895 examination of the heart during the inspection procedure was the most practic al 896 method for optimis ing the PM MI detection of infected animals. The results of this 897 study have been incorporated into the Canadian Food Inspection Agencys ( CFIA ) 898 procedures for the PMMI of veal calves for cysticercosis. 899 900 The heart is widely regarded to be a predilection site fo r cysticerci. C ysts in ca rdiac 901 muscle degenerate earlier; the r esulting lesions persist longer than in skeletal muscle 902 so are more likely to be detected at PMMI at an earlier stage of infection. In 2004 903 31 EFSA was asked to assess the risks of a simplified meat inspection of the presence of 904 Cysticercus cysts in calves kept under specific management conditions (EFSA 2005 ). 905 Their review identified poor sensitivity, especially for lightly infected animals. Their 906 opinion suggested that in the region of 40% of cysts would be identified through the 907 surface area of heart exposed by the current mandated incision s. They recommended 908 a semi -quantitative risk profiling of veal calf herds based on the system used to 909 produce the animals and history/epidemiology of infection on the farm. Low -risk 910 herds may be inspected without the need to incise the heart or other org ans. They 911 cited as support for this recommendation various published findings , where current 912 meat inspection procedures have a negligible impact on reducing the level of public 913 health risk in a country where C. bovis infection of cattle is low. 914 915 Impact o n public health 916 917 In a risk assessment model for human infection with T. saginata in New Zealand 918 under current PMMI conditions the mean number of human infections per year as a 919 result of consumption of C. bovis infected beef in the export and domestic marke t was 920 estimated at 0.5 and 1.1 respectively (vanderLogt, Hathaway et al. 1997 ). Using a 921 1997 population estimate for New Zealand of 3,781,270 individuals (using NZ 922 government we btool - http://www.stats.govt.nz/tools_and_services/tools/interactive - 923 pop-pyramid.aspx ), then this translates to an infection rate of roughly 18.9 and 41.6 924 per 1 00,000 population for export and domestic markets respectively. If PM MI 925 procedures were not carried out for the detection of C. bovis the mean numbers of 926 human infections was estimated to increase to 0.61 and 1.3 respectively, roughly a 927 20% increase. 928 929 Ninety-eight human cases of T. saginata were reported in the UK in 2011. During the 930 same year, 975 cases of bovine c ysticercus were recorded at PM MI but a possible 931 2,925 - 9,750 cases were undetected (assuming an under detection rate of 3 to 10 - 932 fold). Assum ing the 98 cases arose as a consequence of these undetected cases this 933 equates to 1 case of human infection from every 30 - 100 undetected cases , which is a 934 relatively high rate of infection . Over the last 12 years 1,207 Taenia cases were 935 recorded by the H PA ( unpublished data, HPA) , of which roughly 98% were T. 936 32 saginata . However, n o other information on these cases as regards source of infect ion 937 was available as the se data are not routinely collected at the HPA. 938 939 Impact on animal health /welfare 940 941 Naturally occurring C. bovis infections in cattle are unlikely to produce any clinical 942 signs. Heavy infestations will occasionally show muscle stiffness and fever though 943 such infestations are rare in GB . The main reasons for the persistence of T. saginata 944 in Europ e include the low sensitivity of current meat inspection protocols and cattle 945 husbandry systems which allow grazing on pastures and drinking from water streams 946 (assuming water streams and surface water are contaminated with T. saginata eggs) 947 (Dorny and Praet 2007 ). Most types of sewage treatment plant cannot eliminate T. 948 saginata eggs from purified water (Rickard, Arundel et al. 1981 ). Two of the biggest 949 risk factors for cattle infection are application of slurry from sewage plants on 950 pastures and Taenia eggs in effluent from sewage treatment plants. Bovine 951 cysticercosis is not transmitted di rectly from cattle -to-cattle. The Canadian Food 952 Inspection Authority ( CFIA ) has a National Cysticercosis Programme aimed at 953 detecting and eradicating infected cattle. All abattoirs must report suspicion of C. 954 bovis to the CFIA which then places infected farms of origin under government 955 control and carries out eradication of infection where the source is known . The CFIA 956 retains control of the premises until there is slaughter evidence that the herd is C. 957 bovis free. Cattle from infected farms are moved u nder licence to slaughter. If C. 958 bovis is detected at PMMI in GB t he feedback from the meat inspectors to producers 959 is via a rejected meat receipt or via email if the producer is set up on the FSAs IT 960 system . This information is considered by the FSA to be for the producer to act upon. 961 The FSA does not check or follow up if any action was taken by the producer 962 (Howard Betts FSA -personal communication). 963 964 It is unsure how effective feedback, concerning C. bovis detection, from the FBO to 965 the farmer is. As the biggest risk factors for cattle infection are slurry and leakages 966 from sewage plants , the dissemination of T. saginata eggs in the environment can 967 make it difficult to ascertain the source of infection if cattle are diagnosed with C. 968 bovis . This alo ng with the lack of any regulated treatment for the disease in the live 969 animal makes it difficult for the farmer to compile an eradication programme . 970 33 However, as Cysticercosis is usually subclinical and current PMMI remains the only 971 form of general surveil lance for C. bovis any reduction in detection by employing a 972 visual -only PMMI could be considered a potential risk . 973 974 975 Risk Estimation 976 977 Bovine cysticercosis is of great public health interest, as shown by the number of 978 EFSA opinions concerning cysticercus over the past 12 years (Dorny, Vall\u00e9e et al. 979 2000 ; EFSA 2004 ; EFSA 2005 ; EFSA 2010 ). However, t he severity of human T. 980 saginata infestation is usually low because symptoms are , in most cases, mild and 981 infection is easily treated. In terms of the number of cases, i f the New Zealand risk 982 assessment is broadly applicable to the UK situation, we can expect an increase in the 983 number of huma n cases per year of around 20% ( from approximately 100 cases per 984 year to around 120 ) if a move from traditional to visual -only meat inspection is 985 allowed for all cattle . Therefore , the increase in risk from allowing non -conforming 986 systems to undergo visual -only PMMI is considered low-medium , but the overall 987 absolute risk to public health is very low - low, because of the small number of extra 988 cases involved. 989 990 The risk to animal health /welfare incurred by changing to a visual -only PM MI 991 method for calves under the age of 8 months is very low determined by the low 992 prevalence of the disease and the difficulty in visualis ing cysts in this a nimal group at 993 PMMI (meaning the relative change in sensitivity will be minimal) . The increased 994 risk to animal health /welfare incurred by changing to a visual -only PM MI method for 995 animals over the age of 8 months is considered to be very low -low. Although the 996 frequency of detection at PM MI is low , removing the heart incisions is likely to 997 reduce sensitivity of meat inspection even further . 998 999 2.4.5 Brief discussion of negligible risk hazard/species pairings 1000 1001 An important reason for the assessment of many of the ot her hazard/species pairings 1002 as negligible is that visual -only PMMI would not see a large change in procedures 1003 34 from current PMMI. For example, the incision of lymph nodes is not required in 1004 sheep or goats, and hence the primary method for identifying M. bovis is already non- 1005 mandatory for these species. It is therefore unsurprising that M. bovis in sheep/goats 1006 and deer is rarely detected at the slaughterhouse; there were no positive submissions 1007 from sheep/goats and 14/15 positive submissions from farmed a nd wild deer over a 1008 four year period (2008 -2011) respectively. A drop in the rate of detection due to 1009 visual -only PMMI of deer would be a negligible risk to public or animal 1010 health /welfare . 1011 1012 PMMI detection of Johnes disease in GB has very little impact o n either public or 1013 animal health, due to its low diagnostic sensitivity. Meat inspection currently detects 1014 very low numbers of suspect Johnes disease cases in cattle (around 100 per year) and 1015 wild deer (0.5 per year) and has not identified a single case in sheep, goats, or farmed 1016 deer between 2008 and 2011. The proposed change in meat inspection procedures to 1017 a visual -only technique could only affect detection of Johnes disease in cattle as th is 1018 is the only animal group currently subject to mandatory pa lpation of the mesenteric 1019 lymph nodes. The others already undergo visual -only appraisal of the relevant 1020 tissues. The links between Mycobacterium Avium Paratuberculosis (MAP ) and 1021 public health are still debatable (see Appendix II ), but it would appear that the meat - 1022 borne risk is negligible. With regard to animal health, even in a worst -case scenario, 1023 where all the recently identified cases would be missed by the change in inspection 1024 procedure, the numbers remai n very low. Thus, a change to visual -only meat 1025 inspection is very likely to be of negligible risk to animal health. As PMMI is the 1026 only detection method for MAP, it may be necessary to conduct other surveillance 1027 activities if visual -only PMMI was introdu ced, or at least retain traditional PMMI 1028 procedures in areas of high MAP risk. spp . and rhusiopathiae and CLA are 1031 considered to be occupational human hazards; the omission of incisions and palpation 1032 of lymph nodes/organs presumably only lower the already extremely small risk to 1033 meat inspectors. 1034 1035 Diagnosis of CLA is most likely in the live animal at the farm, and so there is a limit ed value 1037 35 of feedback to farmers. Only CLA is explicitly recorded as a condition at meat 1038 inspection, the others would be recorded as more general conditions (joint ill, lung 1039 lesions) . Hence there is a further limit to the usefulness of any feedback to the farmer. 1040 It was assessed that the sensitivity of visual -only PMMI for each of these four animal 1041 diseases would be slightly less than for traditional PMMI, but that these drops in 1042 sensitivity should not significantly affect herd-level sensitivity, as these diseases are 1043 quite common within an infected herd/flock (it is herd -level sensitivity which is 1044 important for feedback to farmers). 1045 1046 36 Benefit assessment 1047 1048 2.4.6 Overview 1049 1050 The aim of PMMI is to protect public health ( meat safety , occupational health ); 1051 animal hea lth (notifiable (exotic) disease , endemic (production) diseases ); and animal 1052 welfare . In addition, it contributes to food quality . There is potential to achieve 1053 benefits from a move from current, traditional PMMI procedures to a visual -only 1054 system in all these distinct areas. The potential for ben efits was recognised in the EU 1055 revision of meat inspection for beef paper (EFSA 2004 ). The main public health 1056 benefits arising from omitting or reducing manual ( palpation and/or incision ) PMMI 1057 techniques include likely reduction s in cross -contamination of meat with pathogenic 1058 microorg anisms. This could be either between different sites of the same carcase 1059 and/or between different carcases and/or between organs and carcases (depending on 1060 the number of inspectors involved and the distribution of tasks between them ). Visual 1061 only inspect ion would also reduce the exposure of inspectors to occupational hazards, 1062 as well as exposure of the meat to microbial hazards originating from the inspectors. 1063 1064 In addition, omitting or reduc ing manual examinations would enable more rational 1065 and effectiv e direction of some of the resources (both manpower and financial ) 1066 towards other public health -relevant activities - particularly better exploitation of the 1067 food chain information and a greater focus on abattoir process hygiene controls 1068 (EFSA 2004 ). Furthermore, moving from laborious and monotonous manual tasks 1069 (related to a sin gle animal that is most often abnormalit y-free) towards a wider range 1070 of more intellectual ly stimulating tasks (related to varied animal populations and FCI) 1071 might be expected to increase both the motivation and the satisfaction of inspectors. 1072 1073 Benefits ma y arise either as a direct consequence of the changes examined in the 1074 context of this research , or indirectly. 1075 1076 37 1077 2.4.7 Direct benefits of revised inspection protocol 1078 1079 Public health - food safety 1080 It has been postulated that omitting palpation and incision procedu res at PMMI will 1081 result in reduced microbiological contamination of carcases and offal. Incision of 1082 lymph nodes may transfer organisms to the surface of meat and offals. Incis ing 1083 muscles (masseters) increases the surface area for contamination (deep musc le tissues 1084 are generally regarded as sterile). Palpati ng carcases and offals may distribut e any 1085 organisms present more widely on the surface of individual carcases /offals, and 1086 transmit organisms between carcases /offals. 1087 1088 Assuming that the hands of inspect ors and their knives are microbiologically clean 1089 at the start of a period of inspection, palpation and incision should not add to the 1090 overall burden of microbiological contamination of carcases /offals . The impact of the 1091 inspection activities , however, will be the redistribution of organisms present on 1092 carcases /offals on and between individual carcases /offals when they arrive at the 1093 inspection station . In the case of inspectors being undetected symptomless 1094 carriers/shedders of pathogens (e.g. Salmonella ), their handling of meat can mediate 1095 additional contamination. 1096 1097 The most relevant -producing E. coli . 1099 These organisms do not cause any lesions that are detectable under current PMMI 1100 procedures. Possible contamination of carcases can occur at many points in the 1101 slaughtering process from the initial slaughter through to PMMI and on to trimming 1102 and boning. Legislation requir es abattoir operators to minimis e contamination 1103 through implement ing HACCP -based procedures . PMMI is a standardised and 1104 regulated procedure for all abattoirs , carried out by official inspectors, and outside the 1105 operators HACCP -based system . 1106 1107 Contamination of carcas es with faeces and subsequent cross contamination of further 1108 carcases can occur at any point in the slaughter process . Between -abattoir differences 1109 38 in process hygiene performance can result in differen ces in the hygienic status of the 1110 final carcases prese nted for PMMI. However, PMMI involving routine handling is 1111 another stage where additional bacterial cross contamination can occur , including with 1112 enteric pathogens . The surface of the carcase can be contaminated by palpation and 1113 with bacteria residing in the lymph nodes and/or organs via incision . 1114 1115 Benefit assessment related to microbial status of the final carcases 1116 1117 The majority of discussions on the benefits of reducing cross contamination as a result 1118 of omitting incision/palpation from PMMI have centr ed on the pig industry. In a 1119 recent scientific opinion on meat inspection of pigs (EFSA 20 11) it is stated that the 1120 food safety risks of Salmonella and Yersinia enterocolitica cross -contamination of 1121 pig carcases exceeds the risks posed by hazards associated with conditions targeted by 1122 palpation/incision. For example, it was considered that i ncising lymph nodes to detect 1123 tuberculosis -like lesions can have a detrimental effect on the overall microbial safety 1124 of meat, which may exceed the public health benefits of detecting abscesses caused by 1125 Mycobacterium . Studies on the release, and subseque nt cross -contamination, of 1126 enteric pathogens from lymph nodes as a result of PMMI incision concluded that 1127 mandatory incision repres ents a cross -contamination risk et al. 1128 2000 ), Nesbakken 2003 ). The contents of the intestines also represent contamination 1129 risks for Y. enterocolitica if the slaughterhouse personnel accidentally cut into the 1130 viscera. Other mandatory procedures, for example, incision of the heart, were shown 1131 to cause cross -contamination, as did the examination of other body sites after 1132 inspection of the head by the same inspector (P. Willeberg, personal communication 1133 quoted in Pointon, 2000). Similarly, the presence of Salmonella spp. in cattle livers 1134 has been shown to rise from 32% at evisceration to 82% after PMMI (Samuel, 1135 O'Boyle et al. 1980 ) demonstrating a rise in cross contamination as a result of 1136 mandatory inspection procedures. However, a study of pigs in Australia found a 2.5- 1137 fold reduction in combined Salmonella and Y. enterocolitica contamination 1138 prevalence on 800 visually -only inspected finished carcases (0.250%) compared with 1139 800 traditionally inspected carcases (0.625%), but the difference was not statistically 1140 significant (Hamilton, Gallas et al . 2002 ). However, it is unknown whether the 2.5 - 1141 fold reduction found in that particular low pathogen -occurrence situation would have 1142 been more significant in a higher pathogen -occurrence situation, as the occurrence of 1143 39 these pathogens on pig carcases can be as high as > 40% for Y. enterocolitica (Van 1144 Damme, Habib et al. 2010 ) or Salmon ella spp. (Small, James et al. 2006 ; Blagojevic, 1145 Antic et al. 2011 ). Further evidence (for pigs) will be generated in a current FSA trial 1146 of visual -only versus current PMMI, where contamination level of carcases will be 1147 compared under the two systems. Initial results from this study indicate that there was 1148 no difference found in the isolation of Yersinia spp. or Salmonella spp., total aerobic 1149 plate count or the presence/absence of Enterobacteriaceae from traditional and visual - 1150 only PMMI inspected carcasses. However, when present the Enterobacteriaceae 1151 count was lower on carcases that had been visually inspe cted than traditionally 1152 inspected, implying less contamination. Nevertheless, it should be noted that PMMI 1153 procedures differ between animal species in terms of both the total amount of manual 1154 handling and the carcase sites/organs handled. Consequently, e xpected PMMI - 1155 mediated cross contamination can differ between animal species in both the 1156 contamination location/distribution and its levels. Therefore, the PMMI -mediated 1157 cross -contamination effects determined in one species (e.g. pigs) cannot be directly 1158 extrapolated to another (e.g. cattle). 1159 1160 In summary, while data is sparse, manual meat handling used in PMMI procedures 1161 (incision into potentially contaminated lymph nodes, palpation) probably increases the 1162 likelihood of cross -contamination (numbers and/or p revalence of pathogens) of the 1163 final carcase and organs, and a number of EFSA opinions have come to the same 1164 conclusion (EFSA 2004 ; EFSA 2011 ). Therefore, we may conclude that eliminating 1165 incisions into , and reducing palpation of, organs and lymph nodes will reduce the total 1166 number of pathogenic organisms on an individual carcase and/or the total number of 1167 carcases contaminated. 1168 1169 The current EFSA opinions on meat inspection have used final carcase contamination 1170 levels (numbers a nd/or prevalence of pathogens) as the endpoint by which to judge 1171 potential benefits to omitting mandatory palpation/ incision procedures. On balance, 1172 based on prevailing information and views in published literature, we would assess 1173 that there are reductio ns in the microbiological contamination of the final carcase by 1174 using visual -only PMMI, but with a high level of uncertainty as this conclusion is 1175 based more on expert opinion than data. It is not known how significant this 1176 40 reduction in microbiological co ntamination would be in terms of protecting public 1177 health. 1178 1179 Benefit assessment related to public health risk at the time of food consumption 1180 1181 The risk that PMMI -mediated cross -contamination poses to public health at the time 1182 of food consumption is unkn own. We do not know h ow many human infections (of 1183 several relevant hazards ), acquired via consumption of each of several meat species 1184 and of each of a large number of other foods possibly cross -contaminated from 1185 meat/meats along the food chain, would be incision/pa lpation 1186 of lymph nodes/organs. 1187 1188 In the only study we could find that has attempted to indicate the food safety impact 1189 of visual -only PMMI, Hamilton et al. (2002) concluded that levels of protection for 1190 food safety were the s ame for traditional a nd visual -only PMMI of pigs. This was on 1191 the basis that there was no significant difference in the Salmonella and Y. 1192 enterocolitica contamination prevalence of 150 retail samples of pork that had been 1193 produced from carcases of visual -only PMMI pigs and 150 retails samples of pork 1194 from carcases of traditional PMMI pigs. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the total 1195 number of tested retail samples was small considering the situation of a low 1196 pathogens prevalence (0.250 -0.625%) on carcases in the study. How relevant the 1197 study by Hamilton et al. (2002) is to the red meat industry overall and to industries for 1198 each animal species within it, or to meat inspection in general and to inspection of 1199 each animal species within it, is unknown. 1200 1201 There are many complicated routes involving the eventual transfer of foodborne 1202 hazards from the carcase of a recently slaughtered animal to humans , via meat 1203 consumption and/or via consumption of other foods possibly cross -contaminated from 1204 meat along th e food chain. Hence, any contamination of the edible carcase that 1205 occurs because of PMMI -mediated contamination is just one element of the eventual 1206 number of organisms a person will consume in an exposure event. Any 1207 contamination caused by PMMI (i.e. red istribution of organisms from lymph nodes 1208 and/or organs to edible parts of the carcase ) must be considered in this light. 1209 1210 41 However, what we are not able to conclude, because the required studies have yet to 1211 be done, is whether this reduction in organisms i s a significant benefit to public 1212 health. That is, is there a measurable reduction in the number of Salmonella , E. coli 1213 O157:H7 etc... infections due to beef, lamb and venison consumption (and/or 1214 consumption of other foods possibly cross -contaminated from m eats) ? 1215 1216 Much more research is required to establish with any confidence what the quantifiable 1217 benefits to public health might be from a move to visual -only PMMI. There are no 1218 studies quantitatively comparing foodborne hazards such as Salmonella spp. on 1219 carcases that have undergone traditional or visual -only PMMI for red meat species . 1220 These studies would be required before further assessment of public health benefits 1221 can be made. The results for contamination levels of carcases from both systems 1222 could, for example, be used in quantitative risk assessment models in order to assess 1223 the relative burden of disease from carcases inspected in either way. 1224 1225 The extent of any microbiological benefits from omitting palpation and incisions will 1226 be dependent on whet her, and to what extent , handling of carcasses is required to 1227 position the carcass to enable its proper visual inspection . This can be affected by the 1228 design of the slaughterline , and how much carcase handling is involved in visual 1229 inspec tion (which can v ary between abattoirs) . Some changes to the physical layout 1230 of inspection stations, carcase dressing procedures, and the way in which carcases and 1231 offals are presented for inspection may be required (depending on the species) so to 1232 avoid carcass handling before its visual inspection . 1233 1234 1235 Public health - occupational hazards 1236 1237 The use of sharp knives to make incisions in organs by official inspectors , working in 1238 the hazardous conditions of slaughterhouses carries clear risks of injury. Repetitive 1239 strain inju ry is a potential hazard for official inspectors carrying out identical incisions 1240 on organs at high line speeds. Less incision and handling of carcases and organs will 1241 reduce exposure of inspectors to certain zoonotic hazards such as Erysipelothrix. 1242 1243 42 Anim al health and welfare 1244 1245 No direct benefits to animal health or welfare. 1246 1247 2.4.8 Indirect benefits of changed inspection protocol 1248 1249 In order to establish any relevant indirect benefits through the saving of official 1250 inspectors time, one of the projects experts vis ited several cattle and sheep 1251 slaughterhouses to observe current PMMI practices and assess deployment of 1252 resources. Each procedure that would be omitted by visual -only PMMI is listed for 1253 cattle and sheep/goats, along with a n estimation of i) the amount of handling that 1254 would be omitted and ii) the time saved in the overall meat inspection process of each 1255 carcase (see Tables 2a and 2b). 1256 1257 Table 2a: Estimated c hange in handling and time saved for mandatory procedures for 1258 visual -only PMMI of c attle. 1259 Procedure Calves < 6w Cattle > 6w Change in handling if omitted Time Palpate Incise Palpate Incise Retropharyngeal LNs -b + +c Tongue Masseters - - + + + Lungs () () - - - Bronchial/mediastinal LNs - + + Trachea/ bronchi () () Heart - - + + Liver - + + Hepatic/pancreatic LNs + Gastric/mesenteric LNs - - - + + + Umbilical region - - + Joints - - + () Incision if lungs intended for human consumption 1260 43 b: Minus sign indicates if there is a reduction in the amount of handling of the carcase required.

This is the 1274 ratio between those animals and \"non -suspect\" animals requiring visual -only 1275 PMMI, within the population presented for slaughter. Namely, visual -only 1276 PMMI is meant to be applied in a routine/n ormal slaughter situation only 1277 (presumably, a large majority of animals), and in any other situation visual 1278 examination would be followed by palpation/incision too. Only non -suspect 1279 animals would be eligible for routine/normal slaughter and visual -only PM MI, 1280 and those animals are: a) NOT considered as posing higher risk according to 1281 FCI, b) NOT showing relevant abnormalities at ante -mortem inspection and c) 1282 NOT showing relevant abnormalities at visual PMMI. However, any relevant 1283 issues noticed in respect to a) and/or b) and/or c) would result in re - 1284 44 categoris ation of those animals into \"suspect\" category with use of 1285 palpation/incision in addition to visual examination. 1286 Slaughter line speed 1287 Abattoir layout and equipment 1288 o all cattle offals presented to the official inspector at one inspection 1289 point c.f. inspector down time through constant movement between 1290 inspection points; 1291 o rise and fall platform to inspect entire cattle carcases c.f. fixed sh eep carcases to inspectors; 1295 o capacity and operation of rectification rails and detained rooms. 1296 Class of animals 1297 o Young, prime c.f. adult, cull 1298 o More pathology in older animals 1299 1300 Cattle 1301 1302 For most cattle (except calves < 6 weeks ) the benefits of visual inspectio n apply only 1303 to offals and heads since no palpation or incision of the carcase is currently required. 1304 There will be time savings from visual -only inspection , but these will be dependent on 1305 the size/throughput of the abattoir and the ratio of suspect/non -suspect animals . 1306 1307 It was noted that compliance with the requirements for inspection of the green offal 1308 may have been influenced by a combination of (1) the location of green offal 1309 inspection points (usually on the opposite side of the line to all other ins pection 1310 activities) and (2) the general belief of inspection staff , supported by the outcome of 1311 other FSA research, that green offal inspection adds very little to the detection of 1312 pathology (Alonso, Dadios et al. 2011 ). 1313 1314 Sheep /goats 1315 1316 45 Visual only inspection has potential resource benefits for both carcase and offal 1317 inspection. 1318 Inspection of lamb carcases requires palpa tion of the umbilical region and joints. 1319 There is an opportunity to save some official inspector resource by moving to visual 1320 inspection at carcase inspection, but it is beyond the scope of this work to quantify it. 1321 Total resource saving at each abattoi r will be a multifactorial function including 1322 aspects such as the speed of the line , throughput and the proportion of suspect cases 1323 requiring more detailed examination . 1324 1325 In most abattoirs, official inspectors must lift sheep carcases to carry out visual 1326 inspection of the neck and forequarters, which are sites where contamination may be 1327 commonly found. To obtain real benefits, from efficiency and contamination aspects, 1328 physical modifications at the inspection point would be required to enable inspection 1329 to be done without manipulation of carcases . Changes in carcase dressing and 1330 presentation, as have been implemented in Australia and New Zealand (Jackman and 1331 Hathaway 2006 ), would be necessary to permit fully hands off inspection. 1332 1333 A further option is one introduced in New Zealand (Jackman and Hathaway 2006 ), 1334 where the slaughterhouse operator is required to identify, detect and remove any 1335 contamination at the point on the line where the forequarters are still on the spreaders 1336 and can be easily inspected . This may require a change of policy by FSA about the 1337 division of responsibility for inspection and audit between food business operators 1338 and the competent authority. 1339 1340 Options for re -directed resources 1341 recording of PMMI findings 1343 1344 PMMI findings are a valuable source of information for: livestock producers and their 1345 veterinarians (to provide feedback about animal health status and the effectiveness of 1346 on-farm control measures); national animal disease surveillance (for the detection of 1347 exotic disease s, monitoring of endemic diseases and identification of emerging 1348 46 diseases ); and animal welfare monitoring (pathological findings may be indicators of 1349 welfare issues on farm , during transport , at the abattoir lairage or during stunning ). 1350 1351 A reliable and p ractical system for the capture and recording of PMMI findings - 1352 both pathology and contamination incidents - and the correlation of pathology with 1353 individual animals or batches of animals was observed in only one of the four 1354 abattoirs visited . Capture of PMMI findings generally relied on mechanical counters 1355 or inspector memory, with no correlation of inspection findings with individual 1356 animals or batches of animals. The one exception was an abattoir where a terminal of 1357 the operators plant computer syste m had been installed adjacent to the head and offal 1358 inspection point to capture accurate information for individual cattle. 1359 1360 The current method in use for cattle and sheep records PMMI findings under 1361 pathology category headings as number of occurrences for each category per day for 1362 the abattoir. At present there is no formalised system for routinely recording findings 1363 against animals/batches of animals and their producers. We understand that FSA is in 1364 the process of implementing an IT system6 to enable in spection results to be recorded 1365 in a more accurate and useful form and to be correlated with the animals concerned. 1366 This will be essential for the implementation of a risk -based inspection system. 1367 1368 Routine capture of data by official inspectors about cont amination findings was not 1369 carried out at some of the abattoirs visited , particularly for sheep where high line 1370 speeds and lack of practical recording systems were considered to afford limited time 1371 for data recording by inspectors . The detection and accura te recording of 1372 contamination incidents is an important component of PMMI to enable FSA to 1373 monitor operators compliance with their HACCP -based food safety plans . 1374 1375 Accurate and reliable data capture at the inspection point requires time. Better 1376 capture a nd recording of PMMI for cattle and sheep would be a significant and 1377 practical use of MHI resources saved by a move to visual inspection. 1378 1379 1380 6 at the time of publication of the report, t he IT system mentioned was up and running for poultry and pigs, and in the process of roll out for cattle . 47 Food chain information 1381 1382 All Official Veterinarians (OVs) at the abattoirs visited reported deficiencies in the 1383 FCI s ystem. It was stated that it is very rare for FCI to record any deviations from 1384 perfect health - even when abnormities in animals submitted to the abattoir are clearly 1385 present. 1386 1387 Visual -only inspection may be applied on the basis of an analysis of the risk s 1388 presented by animals submitted for slaughter. Risk assessment relies on a functional 1389 system of FCI, part of which is the receipt by producers of information about 1390 previously slaughtered animals from the same source . 1391 1392 Although the FCI framework is in pl ace, it is apparent that FCI does not currently 1393 fulfil its intended purpose - to inform risk -based decisions by the OV and abattoir 1394 operator. Resources saved by visual -only PMMI may afford an opportunity for FSA 1395 staff to take steps to secure compliance wi th FCI requirements and ensure that FCI 1396 delivers its desired aims at the production/slaughter interface of the food chain. . In 1397 addition, the savings may enable applying an improved and expanded FCI system, 1398 that would include consideration of a range of additional on -farm and at -abattoir 1399 generated information leading to risk categorisation of farms, risk categorisation of 1400 abattoirs, etc... 1401 1402 2.4.9 Observations out of the scope of the project 1403 1404 The scope of this project is PMMI and does not include operator activit ies. However, 1405 it is important to acknowledge that PMMI is only one factor that affects the 1406 microbiological quality of meat and offals leaving the slaughterhall. At some 1407 abattoirs visited for the project it was observed that there was a considerable amoun t 1408 of handling of carcases by plant staff around the carcase inspection point, particularly 1409 by operatives placed immediately before the inspection point to remove surface 1410 contamination. The benefits of visual -only PMMI on the microbiological quality of 1411 carcases and offal may be relatively insignificant if dressing is not performed to high 1412 standard and carcase handling by plant staff is not kept to a minimum. 1413 48 1414 Visual inspection may have negative practical impact on official inspector 1415 performance. The actio n of making the current mandatory incisions concentrates the 1416 inspectors attention on the organ and demonstrates that each carcase/offals has/have 1417 been inspected. Official inspectors expressed the view that visual -only PMMI may 1418 reduce their concentration and could result in visible lesions not being detected. 1419 1420 1421 3 Discussion 1422 1423 The modernisation of meat inspection in Europe is continuing with several EFSA 1424 Scientific Opinions either underway (red meat species) or published (swine, poultry) 1425 to propose changes t o PMMI (EFSA 2011 ; EFSA 2012 ). This risk assessment fits 1426 into the context of this modernisation by focusing on the asp ect of visual -only PMMI . 1427 While visual -only PMMI is already allowed under certain conditions for pigs and red 1428 meat species, it has not been implemented in the UK . 1429 1430 The results of this risk assessment for cattle, sheep/goats and wild/farmed deer 1431 suggest tha t the only increased risk for public health through meat is from C. bovis in 1432 cattle . The increase in meat -borne risk of C. bovis if all cattle were allowed to 1433 undergo visual -only PMMI was considered to be low -medium , up from a very low 1434 human burden under the current rules of traditional PMMI (100 cases per year, but 1435 most of these are likely to be caused by consuming beef abroad). 1436 1437 The most recent EF SA report on cysticercus (EFSA 2010 ) concluded that monitoring 1438 should continue to be based on traditional meat inspection according to current 1439 European legislation, because more sensitive methods are not yet commercially 1440 available or fully validated for a routine diagnosis. Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 1441 currently allows the use of serological tests on cattle, and it was recommended within 1442 the EFSA opinion that such tests be further developed for use as a routine surveillance 1443 tool as soon as possible. In preliminary studies , the Ag -ELISA method only 0.26% positives were detected 1445 49 by conventional meat inspection (Dorny, Vall\u00e9e et al. 2000 ). However, this was 12 1446 years ago and as yet there is still no validated test for the detection of C. bovis suitable 1447 as a replacement for meat inspection. 1448 1449 Another EFSA opinion also expressed concern over TB in cattle should visual -only 1450 meat inspection be allowed for all cattle (EFSA 2004 ). However , the results of a 1451 recent UK risk assessment suggest that TB cannot be classed as anything but a 1452 negligible meat -borne risk (ACMSF 2010 ). Meat inspection may indirectly contribute 1453 to protecting consumers from TB if they drink raw milk by identifying positive -yet- 1454 OTF herds supplying raw milk in between tuberculin tests , but the likelihood of such 1455 an occurrence is small given the small number of raw milk suppliers currently trading . 1456 1457 With regards to animal health/welfare, we concluded that there would be an increase 1458 in risk for TB in cattle ( very low - low increase, but with wide uncertainty ), F. 1459 hepatica in cattle and deer and C. bovis in cattle ( both very low - low increase ). 1460 These conclusions were made as the removal of the relevant mandatory incisions 1461 would mean th at the relative sensitivity of detection of these hazards would be 1462 reduced, potentially sufficiently so to reduce herd -level sensitivity. Herd -level 1463 sensitivity is an important aspect of meat inspection, as the real value of meat 1464 inspection for animal hea lth (surveillance ) is feedback to farmers. 1465 1466 In order to conduct the risk assessment we assumed that there would be 100% 1467 feedback of conditions to farmers, and 100% positive action from farmers given 1468 feedback on any of these conditions. The judgements ma de about the increases in 1469 relative risk to animal health are borderline with the assumptions of 100% feedback 1470 and compliance, but probably verge on negligible given realistic assumptions about 1471 the level of feedback to farmers that currently occurs for F. hepatica and C. bovis . In 1472 addition, s urveillance of C. bovis and F. hepatica is preferred by serology at the herd 1473 level . Only for TB in cattle, where there is a control programme in force, and it is 1474 known that 10-20% of breakdown herds within the UK are i dentified during meat 1475 inspection, does removing the mandatory incisions of the head and neck lymph nodes 1476 pose a realistic threat to animal health /welfare because of the detriment to the overall 1477 sensitivity of animal surveillance. 1478 1479 50 A review of bovine TB incidents detected in the slaughterhouse was undertaken by 1480 the AHVLA in 2010 (AHVLA 2010 ). As expected, submissions of suspect TB 1481 lesions were higher in abattoirs located in high-risk areas (South -west England and 1482 Wales), but significantly lower in 4 yearly testing parishes. The confirmation rate of 1483 M. bovis by culture/histology was also higher in high -risk areas. However, there was 1484 a marked increase in the percentage of br eakdown herds identified by PMMI within 4 1485 yearly testing parishes - 45% - versus 16 -21% in yearly tested parishes. These results 1486 confirm the assumption that slaughterhouse PMMI is more valuable for low -risk areas 1487 where herds are routine ly tested at less r egular intervals , although there may well be a 1488 decreased sensitivity and specificity of slaughterhouse detection in these areas. 1489 1490 The main result for PMMI animal health surveillance of TB in cattle is that around 1491 3,000 reactor cattle are slaughtered per ye ar as a result of OTF -status being withdrawn 1492 through TB detection at the abattoir , which will have some value in preventing the 1493 transmission of disease. However, while on average more reactors are detected the 1494 longer the time since the last routine herd t est, the majority of new OFT -W incidents 1495 identified in the slaughterhouse come from herds (593/654 - 90.6%) 1496 (AHVLA 2011 ). Given the relatively slow spread of TB it could be argued that 1497 yearly -tested herds are tested regularly enough to minimise any potential risk of TB 1498 spread through non -detection of slaughterhouse cases given visual -only PMMI ; pre - 1499 movement testing would re duce this risk still further . That would then leave in the 1500 region of 60 -70 herds (at current rates of infection) that would not be identified under 1501 visual -only PMMI in higher test interval parishes. It is not possible to confirm 1502 without further research whether the removal of up to 700 reactors per year in these 1503 low-risk areas (70 herds * 10, a worst -case estimate of the average number of reactors 1504 per herd ), and subsequent movement restrictions on the affected herds , is crucial in 1505 preventing the further s pread of TB into low -risk areas. 1506 1507 While outside the scope of this qualitative assessment, further quantitative analysis of 1508 new OTF -W incidents detected at the slaughterhouse could more accurately describe 1509 the increase in the number of days -at-risk as a res ult of visual -only PMMI (i.e. the 1510 total time in which cattle remain undetected in their herds before the next tuberculin 1511 test), which could give an indication of how important surveillance of cattle at 1512 slaughter is to the efforts in controlling/preventing the spread of TB in cattle. 1513 51 1514 There are many factors that need to be considered when developing any bovine TB 1515 policy, including the economics of the farm and the political considerations involved. 1516 No factors apart from public health and animal health/wel fare are considered in this 1517 assessment, and explicitly so. As with current parish testing intervals, a reasonable 1518 approach to visual -only PMMI may be to consider the risk on a regional rather than 1519 national basis , and/or on the basis of certain conforming and non -conforming systems. 1520 1521 In summary, i f clear benefits to public health and/or animal health /welfare can be 1522 achieved by moving to a visual -only PM MI inspection method for all systems of 1523 production (or at least relaxing the definition of a conformi ng system, for example by 1524 allowing outside production) then there may well be a strong case for a change to the 1525 current EC regulation. The only potentially compelling reason is to maintain the 1526 maximum possible sensitivity of bovine TB surveillance in orde r to achieve 1527 eradication of the disease (where of course doing anything to reduce the status quo 1528 could be argued as potentially dangerous, especially in light of the increased incidence 1529 in cattle TB over the previous decade) . It is outside the scope of th is project to 1530 determine the cost -benefit of such a policy. 1531 1532 With regards to the benefit assessment, it is not possible to state the relative benefit to 1533 public health due to the reduction in cross -contamination that may occur during 1534 visual -only PM MI compar ed to traditional PMMI . For this, f urther research would be 1535 required . An indirect benefit to public and/or animal health /welfare may be the 1536 diversion of the official inspectors time away from mandatory incisions to potentially 1537 more productive matters, su ch as ensuring accurate reproduction of condition 1538 statistics. Such accuracy is required in order to ensure the value of Food Chain 1539 Information, and to maximise the potential to analyse meat inspection data in an 1540 epidemiologically rigorous wa y. A distinct improvement has been made to data 1541 collection by the rolling out of electronic databases for meat inspection of cattle and 1542 sheep/goats, which should include production system information. However, even 1543 these data are suspect if meat inspectors are too bus y performing their mandatory 1544 tasks to make accurate recordings. 1545 1546 52 The results of the risk and benefit assessment s are intended to provide further 1547 evidence for the on -going discussions at EU level over the modernisation of meat 1548 inspection. In summary, the re appears to be a genuine rationale for considering 1549 visual -only PMMI of all cattle, sheep/goats and farmed/wild deer , which should be 1550 discussed further by risk managers and policy makers at both a UK and EU level . 1551 1552 4 Acknowledgements 1553 1554 The authors would lik e to thank the following persons for their assistance in obtaining 1555 data and providing expert opinion for the risk and benefit assessments: from AHVLA 1556 Jenifer Broughan, Elizabeth Ely , Jon Weston, Helen Gartner and Adam Brouwer; and 1557 from the UK FSA, Javier D Carles Orri (the project Betts, 1558 Andrew Bullock and Andrea Cranfield .

These 1954 animal populations are regarded as being spil lover hosts for M. bovis infection 1955 where infection occurs only as long as there is input from an external source. Sheep 1956 should be considered as dead end hosts in that they play no significant role in the 1957 onward transmission of M. bovis , whilst goats ca n be amplifier hosts which appear 1958 capable of transmitting M. bovis to other species (AHVLA website). There are no 1959 mandatory TB testing requirements for non -bovine species so disease surveillance 1960 mostly relies on post mortem detection at either PMMI or by private veterinarians. 1961 Evidence of TB infection for both sheep and goats is notifiable. 1962 1963 Currently, TB testing for sheep and goats is only carried out when TB is suspected in 1964 the herd or flock following post-mortem examination or when flocks/herds are li nked 1965 epidemiologically to a breakdown in cattle. Movement restrictions are also imposed 1966 to contain any further disease spread. These restrictions last until the herd or flock 1967 tests negative using the tuberculin skin test (following the voluntary slaughter of any 1968 test positive animals) or until the cohort of exposed and potentially infected animals 1969 has been removed. 1970 1971 Spoligotyping and variable number tandem repeat typing of isolates of M. bovis from 1972 sheep and goats can be carried out to assist in determinin g the source of TB 1973 breakdowns retrospectively . Possible sources for M. bovis infection of sheep and 1974 goats include: environmental contamination of animal housing, co -grazing with 1975 infected cattle or grazing of infected pasture, infection by a common wildlife source 1976 (Houlihan 2008) 1977 70 1978 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 1979 1980 EC regulation 1244/2007 defines sheep and goats suitable for visual only meat 1981 inspection as being less than 12 months old and 6 months old respectively. Accord ing 1982 to the AHVLA TB culture database there have been no M. bovis positive submissions 1983 from sheep < 12 months of age over the last 6 years and positive submissions from 1984 goats < 6 months of age could be linked to a single outbreak of M. bovis on one 1985 holding in 2008. For sheep > 12 months of age, prevalence is low (24 positive 1986 submissions in 2011) but has been increasing over the last 2 years possibly as a 1987 consequence of increased awareness of the infection in sheep. Since the reported 1988 outbreak of M. bovis in Golden Guernsey goats in 2008, submissions for culture have 1989 been declining for goats with only one submission (cultured negative) in 2011. 1990 1991 Sensitivity of detection 1992 1993 TB is not a specifically recorded condition on FSA P MMI forms for sheep and goats 1994 despit e meat inspection being the only form of surveillance for this condition. 1995 Suspect TB associated lesions detected at PM MI are submitted to AHVLA for culture 1996 but are not noted on the PMMI form. The FSA throughput numbers at slaughter in 1997 2011 were 11 million and 12,500 animals for sheep and goats respectively, . 1998 Corresponding numbers of TB culture positive cases were 30 (0.00027%) and 6 1999 (0.048%)( TBTB . EC regulations state that no incision of lymph nodes or lungs is 2000 required at PMMI of sheep and goats. The AH VLA T B database indicates that most 2001 positive submissions from sheep are associated with lesions in the bronchial and 2002 mediastinal lymph nodes, so most T B lesions are not detected under current 2003 traditional PMMI regulations nor would be by visual -only PMMI. 2004 2005 Impact on public health 2006 2007 The potential public health impact via consumption of lamb, mutton and goat meat 2008 can be assumed to be less than that from beef (See bovine M. bovis section for 2009 discussion above). Unpasteurised milk or dairy products made with unpa steurised 2010 milk from M. bovis infected sheep and goats can constitute a risk to consumers. In 2011 71 England and Wales there are no restrictions on sales of unpasteurised sheep or goats 2012 milk although only 27 producers are registered with AHVLA to sell raw goats m ilk 2013 and 3 to sell raw sheeps milk. Sales of raw drinking milk and cream from any species 2014 are banned in Scotland. The ACMSF concluded that the risk to human health from M. 2015 bovis in unpasteurised sheep and goat milk and milk products is likely to be very lo w 2016 but with uncertainties due to lack of data. 2017 2018 Furthermore, as lungs and associated lymph nodes are not incised at current PMMI a 2019 change to visual -only examination would not have a significant public health impact 2020 compared with the present situation. 2021 2022 Impa ct on animal health 2023 2024 M. bovis in non -bovine farmed animals is rare and this population of livestock is not 2025 considered to represent a significant reservoir of disease for other animals or be of any 2026 significance in the persistence of TB in cattle (DEFRA 2011 ). However, it is still 2027 possible that severely infected sheep and goats could act as vectors of infection for 2028 other animals. 2029 2030 Risk estimation 2031 2032 The incidence of M. bovis in sheep and goats in GB is considered to be rare. 2033 Mandatory incision of lymph nodes o r lungs for the detection of TB associated lesions 2034 is not carried out at PMMI for these animals. 2035 TB Very few TB culture positive cases in sheep and goats were detected by PMMI for 2036 the period 2008 -2011 inclusive and T B is not a specifically recorded condit ion as 2037 documented by the FSA. It is therefore considered that the relative (and absolute) risk 2038 to public and animal health is negligible if a visual only PMMI procedure was 2039 employed for sheep and goats. 2046 M. bovis was first recorded in UK farmed deer in 1985 in red deer that had been 2047 imported from Hungary (Bode 1995) but might have been present in wild deer 2048 populations prior to this. Deer may be infected with both bovine and avian TB via 2049 both the respiratory and alimentary r outes. In an infected population many animals 2050 only show signs of subtly swollen lymph nodes and many are asymptomatic carriers. 2051 Hotspot areas, where significant levels of TB are found in wild deer, are usually 2052 associated with high TB infection rates in cat tle and with high deer densities. In the 2053 UK, herds of wild red, fallow and sika deer are frequently closely associated with 2054 farmed livestock, grazing the same pasture and consuming the same crop fodders. 2055 Most reports of M. bovis infection have occurred in these species. Deer -to-deer 2056 transmission occurs by both respiratory and alimentary routes via faecal 2057 contamination of pasture and sharing of feedstuffs (B\u00f6hm 2007). 2058 2059 Farmed deer are subject to the same considerations as regards TB as mentioned above 2060 for sh eep and goats. Government tuberculosis deer orders provide for control of TB 2061 in farmed deer herds only, not in wild populations. At present it is mandatory for 2062 suspected TB in any deer to be reported to Defra but the powers of control (movement 2063 restrictio n orders) apply only to deer from enclosed premises. Detection of M. bovis in 2064 a wild deer population can only be recorded as an incident with no follow up 2065 regulatory controls and would, therefore, have little consequence on the subsequent 2066 disease status of the group. 2067 2068 M. bovis infection in deer is usually subclinical whilst in advanced disease, 2069 emaciation is the most typical sign. Detection of TB in non -bovine species occurs 2070 either in abattoirs, as part of routine meat inspection or during post mortem 2071 exam inations carried out by private veterinarians , or at gralloching for deer by the 2072 stalkers . For farmed deer PMMI -based surveillance is the primary detection method 2073 of M. bovis and is largely concentrated in a small number of specialist abattoirs - 2074 there is no surveillance skin testing . Detection of M. bovis in wild deer relies upon the 2075 experience of the hunter in the field and his knowledge of tuberculosis -associated 2076 abnormalities in the viscera. A trained hunter (with knowledge of requirements of 2077 Regulation 853/2004) must attach a numbered declaration stating that the animal was 2078 found to be free of any abnormal characteristics. If the carcase is accompanied by a 2079 73 declaration the head and viscera do not need to be taken along with the body to the 2080 game handling establishment. If, however, a trained person is not present the head, 2081 heart, lungs and liver must be delivered with the deer carcase . The lymph nodes of the 2082 head region are the most common sites of lesions caused by M. bovis in farmed and 2083 wild deer (de Li sle 2001). 2084 2085 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 2086 2087 EC regulation 1244/2007 does not define any specifications for deer populations 2088 suitable for visual -only PMMI, although two distinct production systems exist. Wild 2089 deer pro duction is generally unregulated with no FCI or prior knowledge of animal 2090 history. Farmed deer, on the other hand, are more likely to be part of an integrated 2091 production system. FSA meat inspection data records Mycobacterium spp. occurring 2092 on average in 4 0/100,000 farmed deer and 3/100,000 wild deer over the past 4 years. 2093 It should be acknowledged, however, that TB suspect submissions to the AHVLA TB 2094 database confirmed as M. avium are far more prevalent than M. bovis so it can be 2095 assumed that a high percen tage of PMMI spp 2096 M. avium. This is confounded by the fact that gross lesions caused by 2097 paratuberculosis and M. avium in deer are indistinguishable from lesions caused by 2098 M. bovis. PMMI data could also be subject to bias as the viscera of wild deer, where 2099 TB-associated abnormalities could reside, are often left in the field and so are not 2100 subject to full meat inspection. The British Deer Society states that in some localised 2101 areas of Exmoor the levels of TB infection in wild deer may be as high as 50% but 2102 with no active surveillance of M. bovis in either farmed or wild deer it is impossible to 2103 determine a definitive prevalence of the disease in either of these populations. 2104 Outbreaks of TB infection are often seen in de er younger than 2 years whilst older 2105 carrier animals may have few or no obvious lesions. The total number of deer 2106 submissions to the AHVLA TB database is low (average of 55 annually over the past 2107 6 years) with the incidence of M. bovis averaging 23 annual confirmed submissions in 2108 wild deer and ~ 2 confirmed cases in farmed deer. We would expect higher numbers 2109 of wild deer submissions given that wild deer samples include survey samples from 2110 known high -risk areas. 2111 2112 Sensitivity of detection 2113 74 2114 EC regulations c overing meat inspection at PMMI of farmed game are vague stating 2115 that the inspection is to include palpation and, where judged necessary, incision of 2116 those parts of the animal which have undergone any change or are suspect for any 2117 other reason. For inspe ction of wild game the official veterinarian is instructed to 2118 carry out a visual examination of the carcase and cavities and to observe/palpate the 2119 organs, where appropriate, to examine for characteristics indicating that the meat 2120 presents a health risk. D ata on the specificity and sensitivity of PMMI in deer is 2121 scarce. Based on experience of TB in cattle, sensitivity is estimated to be between 10 - 2122 87% whilst expert opinion on specificity varies from 15 -98% (EFSA 2008 ). The wide 2123 range in estimates may be due to differences in stage of infection and in the inspection 2124 routine. If PMMI is to be effective inspectors must be well trained, examine the 2125 correct tissues and increase submissions of identified suspect lesions for la boratory 2126 examination (EFSA 2008 ). There is a high proportion of TB in fected deer with no 2127 visible lesions with PMMI reportedly identifying TB associated lesions in less than 2128 50% of culture positive deer (Whiting et al., 1994). Furthermore, the number of TB 2129 cases in farmed and wild deer detected at PMMI by observation, palpat ion or incision 2130 is unknown. Abattoir meat inspection remains the only form of surveillance for M. 2131 bovis in both farmed and wild deer. However, as there is no mandatory incision at 2132 current PMMI of deer there would not be a significant reduction of TB detect ed cases 2133 with a move to a visual -only PMMI. 2134 2135 Impact on public health 2136 2137 There is no peer -reviewed literature showing conclusive evidence of meat -borne M. 2138 bovis infection in humans from consuming venison. Although PMMI is the only form 2139 of surveillance for M. bovis in deer the impact on public health from moving to a 2140 visual only PMMI is considered negligible given the very rare incidence of M. bovis 2141 in both farmed and wild deer, and considering that incision at current PMMI is not 2142 mandatory. 2143 2144 Impact on animal health 2145 2146 75 Deer are not currently considered significant in the epidemiology of TB in cattle or 2147 badgers in England (Delahay, Smith et al. 2007 ). It is not known whether infection 2148 can persist in wild deer in the absence of any other source of infect ion. The same 2149 range and geographic distribution of DNA isolates from M. bovis from cattle, deer and 2150 badger have been found indicating transmission between these hosts, but not s howing 2151 the direction of spread of infection (Duarte, Domingos et al. 2008 ). In GB w ild deer 2152 have increased in density and expanded their geographical range over recent years. 2153 Further increases in deer abundance may exacerbate the potential for disease 2154 persistence and spread in livestock -deer communities (Bohm, Hutchings et al. 2009 ). 2155 A quantitative r isk model looking at the M. bovis exposure risk posed to cattle by wild 2156 deer relative to badgers in England and Wales (Ward, Smith et al. 2009 ) concluded 2157 that there would be localised areas where the relative risks posed by deer may be 2158 considerable. In addition, where there are infected wild deer populations the risks to 2159 cattle may be additive to those posed by badgers. 2160 2161 Risk estimation 2162 2163 The incidence of M. bovis in farmed and wild deer in the UK is considered to be very 2164 low. Mandatory incision of lymph nodes or lungs for the detection of TB associated 2165 lesions is not carried out currently at PMMI for these anim als, and so detection rates 2166 are correspondingly low. It is therefore considered that the risk to public and animal 2167 health would be negligible if a visual -only meat inspection procedure was employed. 2168 2169 2173 E. rhusiopathiae is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium found as a pathogen in a 2174 wide variety of animals. Infection can occur via the mucous membranes, abrasions or 2175 skin lesions (Smith 1998). Although domestic pigs are believed to be the major 2176 reservoir (Reboli 1989) E. rhusiopathiae can cause joint and navel infections in cattle 2177 and sheep. I nfection is characterised by non -suppurative polyarthritis and laminitis; 2178 systemic infection is rare (Cross 1977). 2179 76 2180 E. rhusiopathiae infection commonly occurs via t he umbilical cord wound, abrasions 2181 caused by docking and castration or small skin abrasions from the dipping vat. 2182 Infection may cause a local reaction at the point of entry (navel ill) or pass in the 2183 bloodstream around the body localizing in the joints, le ading to joint ill. On -farm 2184 diagnosis in the live animal is common as E. rhusiopathiae infection very often has a 2185 constant incubation period allowing diagnosis to be made from procedural history and 2186 clinical signs. 2187 2188 E. rhusiopathiae is a zoonotic agent tr ansmitted to people via occupational exposure. 2189 The majority of animal to human transmissions cause localised skin infections known 2190 as Erysipeloid, an occupational hazard mostly affecting individuals working with raw 2191 meat and fish including abattoir workers , fishermen and butchers (Conklin and Steele 2192 1979 ). 2193 2194 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 2195 2196 There has been an annual average of 328 recordings of jo int/navel ill per 100,000 2197 calves over the past four years (FSA meat inspection data). Joint/navel ill is not 2198 recorded for adult cattle. However, if the recording categories of joint/navel ill and 2199 joint lesions are combined for calves, then there is certain ly a higher detection rate for 2200 calves versus adult cattle joint lesions (389.5 per 100,000 calves versus 226.1 per 2201 100,000 adult cattle). There are no figures, however, indicating what proportion of 2202 diagnoses is made from observation, palpation or incisio n at PMMI, or what 2203 bacterium was the causative agent in the condition/s. Because navel infections in 2204 calves usually arise as a result of infection with E. coli or Arcanobacter pyogenes , and 2205 E. rhusiopathiae occurs rarely in calves (EFSA 2003), we assume th at the majority of 2206 joint ill cases recorded by meat inspectors are not caused by E. rhusiopathiae . 2207 2208 Submissions to the AHVLA Veterinary Investigation Diagnostic Analysis (VIDA) 2209 database diagnosed as joint ill were all from animals less than 3 months of a ge 2210 (unpublished data, AHVLA VIDA). Conversely, E. rhusiopathiae is rarely associated 2211 77 with disease, such as bacterial endocarditis, in adult cattle (Edwards, Schock et al. 2212 2009 ). 2213 2214 Joint ill is relatively rare in g oats compared with sheep. The relative resistance of 2215 goats to the bacterial infection was demonstrated by challenging with 2216 disproportionately large number of Erysipelothrix organisms without the animals 2217 succumbing to disease (Yeh, Chen et al. 1990 ). Post mortem detection of joint ill is 2218 not a recorded condition in sheep or goats but VIDA recordings of the pathogen are 2219 categorised as navel E. rhusiopathiae' . 2220 Submissions diagnosed as joint ill were all from animals less than 3 months of age 2221 whereas erysipelas and arthritis due to E. rhusiopathiae' submissions were 2222 diagnosed in occasional submissions from adult animals indicating that disease is 2223 infrequently pr esent in the older animal (unpublished data, AHVLA VIDA). 2224 2225 Post mortem detection of joint ill is not a recorded condition in deer. There have been 2226 no reports of E. rhusiopathiae in deer in Britain (Dr. John Fletcher, Veterinary Deer 2227 Society, personal commu nication) and the incidence in the rest of the world is rare 2228 (Bohm, Bollwahn et al. 1980 ). In summary, E. rhusiopathiae appears to be more 2229 common in younger bovine/ovines, and rare in deer. 2230 2231 Sensitivity of detection 2232 2233 Currently mandatory meat inspection procedures in bovines less than 6 weeks of age, 2234 sheep and goats include visual inspection and palpation of the umbilical region and 2235 joints. Incision can be undertaken if deemed necessary. EFSA considers arthritis and 2236 joint ill in sheep and goats to be detectable by observation and palpation (EFSA 2237 2004 ). 2238 2239 There is no mandatory inspection of joints in bovines over 6 weeks of age. Howev er, 2240 EFSA (2004) states that pathology of the joints are relatively frequent in cattle and 2241 require a routine visual inspection followed by incision, if necessary, to ascertain 2242 possible septic conditions leading to involvement of the carcase as a whole. The 2243 exclusion of such animals from normal slaughter based upon careful ante -mortem 2244 78 examination is preferable. Arthritic carcases are partially or totally condemned at the 2245 abattoir depending on whether infection is localised or systemic. 2246 2247 There is no directly c omparable data to assess the change in sensitivity of detection of 2248 E. rhusiopathiae by British meat inspectors if they switched to visual only 2249 examination. Affected live animals will usually be lame and have swollen joints but a 2250 better view of the damage t o the joints will be gained after the carcase has been 2251 skinned. There is no published information indicating the percentage of joint lesions 2252 are caused by E. rhusiopathiae or the percentage of joint lesions identified by 2253 observation, palpation or incision at post mortem. Detection can vary according to 2254 hind joint lesions or fore joint lesions. In relation to hind joint lesions (even if there is 2255 no apparent swelling) visual inspection of the iliac lymph nodes usually provides an 2256 indication of abnormalities present, and therefore incision of the joint may be required 2257 as a further investigative measure if no apparent pathology is present. Due to the 2258 presentation of the carcase , joint lesions in the fore quarter are picked up by visual 2259 inspection. An incision i s often required to ascertain whether the swelling is just a 2260 buildup of fluid or another pathology (Andrea Cranfield, Senior meat inspector - 2261 personal communication). 2262 2263 It is unlikely that there would be a significant decrease in detection of E. 2264 rhusiopathi ae if a visual only PMMI technique were to be adopted in either 2265 conforming or non -conforming animals, as visual inspection (followed by limited 2266 palpation in suspect cases) would be likely to identify most cases of joint ill. 2267 2268 Impact on public health 2269 2270 Meat -borne transmission : 2271 2272 There are no reports of E. rhusiopathiae entering the food chain and affecting public 2273 health via consumption of beef/lamb/goat/venison meat. Man is infected through 2274 wounds and skin abrasions, but is very resistant to other entry route s (PAHO 2001 ). 2275 More than forty years ago, two cases of bacteremia (one with endocarditis) reportedly 2276 79 occurred after ingestion of undercooked pork (Grieco and Sheldon 1970 ) but the exact 2277 scenario/point of the pathogens entry is poorly documented. 2278 2279 Occupational transmission : 2280 Reliable figures on Erysipeloid in humans are difficult to find. Systemic infection in 2281 humans is uncommon but has b een found to cause endocarditis in rare cases (less than 2282 1% of infections), usually after occupational exposure to animals, most commonly 2283 domestic swine (Gorby and Peacock 1988 ). Anim al to human transmission is 2284 typically by direct cutaneous contact and so reducing the amount of contact with E. 2285 rhusiopathiae during visual -only meat inspection probably decreases slightly the risk 2286 to public (occupational) health. 2287 2288 Impact on animal health 2289 Joint ill is a major welfare problem in lambs and is most often caused by poor 2290 hygienic practices. However, most sheep farmers follow a flock health plan drawn up 2291 in association with their vet so may have a suitable disease treatment plan for their 2292 flock . 2293 2294 Risk Estimation 2295 2296 E. rhusiopathiae is a zoonotic organism, but affects people rarely and mainly via 2297 occupational exposure. Hence, the risk of animal -to-human transmission would 2298 probably be reduced if palpation/incision were omitted in PMMI as there would be 2299 reduced exposure between the infected animal and operator. It is also unlikely that 2300 any decrease in detection would lead to an increase of infection in the live animals on 2301 the farm, as most farmers would probably be aware of the infection due to lame 2302 animals on the farm before meat inspectors identified the condition. Reports of E. 2303 rhusiopathiae in deer and goats are rare. The overall risk to public health, as well as 2304 to animal health, from changing from current to a visual -only PMMI procedure for 2305 animals from conforming and non -conforming systems is therefore considered 2306 negligible for all species. 2307 80 2308 Caseous lymphadenitis Overview 2311 2312 Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) by the bacterium 2313 Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis . It is a chronic, often subclinical, disease 2314 characterised by abscess formation in the lymph nodes and viscera, particularly in the 2315 lungs (Dorella, Fachin et al. 2006 ). In the UK, the most common sites of abscesses are 2316 the superficial lymph nodes of the head and neck. The lymph nodes of the limbs and 2317 torso are affected less commonly. These lesions are generally detectable as firm, 2318 discrete swellings beneath the skin. The visceral form of th e disease is also commonly 2319 found in the UK. 2320 2321 C. pseudotuberculosis can survive for up to 5 months in soil and is also viable in 2322 faeces and faecally -contaminated sheep dips. Transmission occurs when superficial 2323 wounds are contaminated with material from ex ternal abscesses, e.g. at shearing, 2324 tagging, castration and by aerosol transmission from lung forms of CLA. Infected 2325 animals can also shed the organism in faeces and milk. Housing, close confinement 2326 for prolonged periods in a contaminated environment and t rough feeding are likely to 2327 be important risk factors (Baird and Malone 2010 ). 2328 2329 CLA has been in the UK for approximately 20 years at relatively low levels but a 2330 recent geographical spread in incidental reporting suggest s that CLA is an emerging 2331 and a potentially important problem in British sheep flocks. Antibiotic treatment is 2332 fairly ineffective against CLA and no vaccine is currently licensed for use in the UK. 2333 Controlling the disease can be successful via identificati on and removal of infected 2334 carrier sheep using serological tests to detect antibodies to Phospholipase D (PLD). 2335 The PLD ELISA has been used in an established disease eradication and control 2336 scheme in the Dutch dairy goat industry (Baird and Malone 2010 ). 2337 CLA occasionally causes infection after occupational exposure, leading to potentially 2338 serious swelling of the axillary lymph nodes in man. However, the disease risk is low 2339 81 when sensible hygienic precautions are taken by farmers and vets when dealing with 2340 infected animals. 2341 2342 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 2343 2344 2345 Prevalence of detection at abattoirs in the UK is relatively low with an average of 6.08 2346 recordings per 100,000 animals for shee p over the past 4 years and 9.32 recordings for 2347 goats. Evidence suggests that the relative prevalence of CLA is higher in adult sheep 2348 than in lambs. VIDA submissions positively confirmed as CLA also suggest a 2349 distinction between age groups for sheep over 12 months of age versus animals less 2350 than 12 months of age (unpublished data, AHVLA VIDA). 2351 2352 Sensitivity of detection 2353 2354 In a survey of Australian feral goats head, body and visceral lesions were present in 2355 49.3%, 46.7% and 12.3% of affected goats respectiv ely. Lung lesions were relatively 2356 uncommon (Batey, Speed et al. 1986 ). Clinical presentation in goats is commonly on 2357 the superfi cial lymph nodes mainly on the head and neck whilst visceral lesions are 2358 more common in sheep (Malone, Fee et al. 2006 ). It has been estimated that in the 2359 UK between 25% and 50% of animals with CLA have only internal lesions (Malone, 2360 Fee et al. 2006 ), Baird et al 2010). 2361 2362 Impact on public health 2363 2364 Although very rare, human occupational infections with the sheep/goat strain have 2365 been recorded amongst farm and abattoir wo rkers. In people, infections are associated 2366 with flu -like symptoms, fluctuating fever and chronic lymph gland enlargement . 2367 2368 Impact on animal health 2369 2370 Clinical inspection of sheep detects many cases of CLA. However, some visceral 2371 lesions in the lung parench yma would remain undetected at meat inspection if the 2372 lungs were not incised. A s part of the sheep and goat health scheme the Scottish 2373 Agricultural College (SAC) promoted a CLA monitoring scheme using a serological 2374 82 test. However, uptake was poor with less than 10 flocks tested under the scheme 2375 (Brian Hosie, SAC, personal communication). 2376 2377 In summary, it is likely that whilst most infected goats would be detected ante - 2378 mortem, there may be a number of infected sheep that are only identified at PMMI. 2379 Some of these sheep may have lesions that are only detectable by palpation/incision, 2380 hence the sensitivity of meat inspection may decrease by a small margin for CLA. 2381 However, CLA is a common infection, infecting between 16% and 36% of a herd in 2382 one study (Malone, Fee et al. 2006 ), so it is very unlikely that a herd would remain 2383 completely undet ected during visual -only PMMI. Therefore the value of PMMI as an 2384 animal surveillance tool for CLA infection would be likely to remain even if 2385 incision/palpation is omitted. 2386 2387 2388 Risk estimation 2389 2390 Zoonotic transmission occupational, so moving to visua l-only PMMI of 2391 small ruminants would reduce the public health risk. Zoonotic transmission is rare so 2392 that the risk to public health given either current or visual -only PMMI of conforming 2393 or non -conforming sheep populations can be classed as negligible . 2394 2395 A potential risk to small ruminant health exists because of the role PMMI may play in 2396 surveillance for the disease. However this risk is likely to be negligible given that 2397 while individual animal sensitivity may decrease, herd -level sensitivity of meat 2398 inspection would probably remain unaffected. Regular use of an ELISA to test and 2399 remove positive sheep, in association with clinical inspections and changes in farm 2400 management, can greatly reduce the incidence of CLA in affected flocks (Malone, Fee 2401 et al. 2006 ; Baird and Malone 2010 ). 2402 2403 Dictyocaulus 2407 83 Different species of the Dictyocau lus lungworms are found in cattle and deer (D. 2408 viviparus ), and sheep and goats (D. filaria ). Adult worms in the lung produce eggs 2409 that hatch almost immediately. The larvae from these eggs migrate up the trachea of 2410 the host where they are swallowed and consequently p assed out in faeces 2411 contaminating pasture. The cycle is completed by subsequent animals ingesting the 2412 larvae which migrate to the lungs until they reach the airways where they mature into 2413 adults. The passage of larvae through the lungs and the presence of adults in the 2414 airway causes the clinical signs of lungworm -associated respiratory disease. 2415 2416 The clinical s igns of lungworm infestation range from moderate coughing, with 2417 slightly increased respiratory rates, to severe persistent coughing and respiratory 2418 distress. Reduced milk yields and weight loss accompany many infections in cattle, 2419 sheep, and goats. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, epidemiology and presence of 2420 larvae in faeces, as subclinical infections can occur in all species. ELISA tests are 2421 available in some laboratories, but because the antigens used are derived from adult 2422 worms, the test is not suitable for detecting all stages of infection. 2423 2424 There is an effective vaccine against lungworm currently given to susceptible stock 2425 prior to turnout . However, this practice relies on the animals subsequently being 2426 exposed to natural lungworm infection to allow them to develop full immunity. 2427 Failure to expose animals in this way will result in a risk of lungworm in subsequent 2428 years. Lungworm has been t raditionally managed by both vaccination and the use of 2429 anthelmintics. A reduction in use of the vaccine in recent years and an increasing 2430 reliance on the use of anthelmintics has resulted in a steep rise in the number of 2431 lungworm cases in older cattle (van Dijk 2004 ). 2432 2433 Severe clinical signs and lesions are only seen with he avy lungworm infestation. 2434 Clinical disease has an incubation period of around three weeks from ingestion and 2435 can, therefore, occur a few days before larvae appear in the faeces. By the time 2436 clinical disease is present, the health of the cow or calf is alre ady severely 2437 compromised by the extensive damage that can be caused by worms in the lung 2438 tissues. 2439 2440 84 The role of deer in the transmission of lungworm is not yet totally clear. Infective D. 2441 viviparus larvae isolated from Roe deer can produce infections in ca ttle. There are, 2442 however, indications that these isolates are less pathogenic for cattle and that no 2443 outbreaks of lungworm disease result from infections (Jorgensen and Vigh -Larsen 2444 1986 ). There is also mo lecular evidence that the Dictyocaulus species found in wild 2445 cervids are different from those isolated from et al. commonest in larger bronchioles. Dictyocaulus spp. 2448 were present in 15% of both wild red and sika deer. The level of infection was higher 2449 in males than females. Infection with Dictyocaulus spp. showed no significant 2450 differences in relation to age or region. 2451 2452 Dictyocaulus spp. are not zoonotic. 2453 2454 between conforming and non -conforming animals 2455 2456 Estimating the prevalence of lungworm disease in any species based on current 2457 available data is difficult as little high quality surveillance is being carried out. I n 2458 cattle i t was traditionally known as a disease of calves but since 1 993 it has also been 2459 recognized as a disease of adult cattle. From 1993 -2003 76% of the total cases of 2460 lungworm in cattle involved cattle older than one year. VIDA data from the last 9 2461 years show a similar trend with rates of lungworm detection in cattle o lder than 8 2462 months just higher than that from calves (unpublished data, AHVLA VIDA). It is still 2463 one of the most commonly diagnosed respiratory diseases in cattle. 2464 2465 In a review on the control of pneumonia in housed calves (Shoo, Wiseman et al. 2466 1990 ), D. vivaparus is described as being a likely pathogen only in adult cows 2467 (classed as over 1 year of age) and dairy calves housed after a season at grass. 2468 2469 Prevalence of lungworm in sheep relative to age is not clear -cut. The overall trend 2470 since 2003 appears to be for more confirmed cases in sheep < 12 months although this 2471 situation has been revered in some years (unpublished data AHVLA VIDA). 2472 Submissions are low for both age sets of animals, an annual average of 0.1 2473 submissions per 100, 000 animals for all a ges. 2474 85 2475 Sensitivity of detection 2476 2477 Despite lungworm being a n increasingly diagnosed respiratory disease Dictyocaulus 2478 viviparus in cattle and deer, and Dictyocaulus filaria in sheep and goats, are not 2479 recorded conditions at PMMI. Lung conditions detected post-mortem are categorised 2480 as either lung lesions or pneumonia/pleurisy. Post mortem requirements for cattle are 2481 observation, palpation and incision of lungs in the posterior third, perpendicular to 2482 their main axes. Mandatory PMMI requirements for deer are o bservation only whilst 2483 observation and palpation is required for sheep and goats. The trachea and main 2484 branches of the bronchi are incised lengthways and bronchial and medistinal lymph 2485 nodes are incised. Expert opinion is that lungworm would be detectabl e by palpation 2486 of the lungs at PM in cattle, sheep/goats and deer (Andrea Cranfie ld, Senior Meat 2487 Inspector, FSA). If palpation of lungs were to be removed from PMMI there may be a 2488 reduction in sensitivity of detection of low level lungworm infections. 2489 2490 Impact on animal health 2491 Surveillance for lungworm appears to focus on the live animal. There is no specific 2492 recording of lungworm as the causative agent for lung lesions or pleurisy/pneumonia, 2493 at PMMI so it is difficult for the FBO to provide accurate feedba ck to the farmer . 2494 Detection of lungworm in the live animal allows the farmer to implement a 2495 vaccination/anthelmintics programme. The lack of feedback from the FBO to the 2496 farmer due to the absence of lungworm recording at PMMI will mean that there is no 2497 impact on animal health if a visual -only PMMI is employed. 2498 2499 Risk estimation 2500 2501 Lungworm is not a recorded condition for rejection at PM though expert opinion 2502 states that lung lesions detected are primarily due to pneumonia or lungworm. In the 2503 literature it is s tated that the incidence of lungworm is similar in both calves under 8 2504 months of age and older cattle. Surveillance of lungworm is largely based on clinical 2505 investigations rather than post mortem findings (van Dijk 2004 ). Although expert 2506 86 opinion states that lungworm in cattle, sheep/goats and deer requires palpation for 2507 detection, the risk to animal health incurred by changing to a visual only PM method 2508 is considered to be negligible . This is due to the lack of recording of the condition at 2509 PM and the extensive surveillance in the live animal. 2510 2511 or Jaagsiekte) is a chronic pulmonary 2516 disease of small ruminants, caused by Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus (JSRV). 2517 Horizontal transmission occurs between adults and young animals, and lambs have 2518 been shown to be infe cted perinatally (Salvatori, de las Heras et al. 2004 ; Caporale, 2519 Centorame et al. 2005 ). There is some e vidence that infection at a young age results in 2520 an increased severity of clinical signs and macroscopic lesions (Salvatori, de las Heras 2521 et al. 2004 ). Close contact with infected animals is the major risk factor for 2522 transmission of JSR V (Griffiths, Martineau et al. 2010 ), and only a proportion of 2523 infected animals go on to develop OPA pathol ogy or clinical signs (Sharp and 2524 DeMartini 2003 ; Caporale, Centorame et al. 2005 ). The disease has a long incubation period (Caporale, Centorame et al. 2005 ) and 2527 usually presents in older animals as non -specific clinical signs such as loss of 2528 condition, followed by the d evelopment of respiratory difficulty, particularly when 2529 herded (Stevenson, Finley et al. 1982 ; Hunter and M unro 1983 ). Terminal cases are 2530 identified by respiratory distress and the production of pulmonary fluid, which is 2531 visualised by elevating the hind legs of the animal (\"wheelbarrow test\") (Voigt, 2532 Kraemer et al. 2007 ; Cousens, Graham et al. 2008 ). 2533 2534 Post mortem evidence includes enlarged lungs with lesions present in both lungs and 2535 the appearance of firm tumour s of varying size often separated from the adjacent 2536 normal lung tissue. Pleurisy may be evident over the surface of the tumour and 2537 abscesses are often present in the adenomatous tissue (OIE 2008 ). Pathological 2538 findings can be complicated by secondary bacterial infection (Stevenson, Finley et al. 2539 1982 ), and histopathology is required for a definitive diagnosis. 2540 87 2541 2542 Difference in prevalence between conformin g and non -conforming animals 2543 2544 Relative prevalence of OPA in the UK is higher in adult sheep than in lambs, 2545 according to AHVLA VIDA submission data (AHVLA VIDA, unpublished data). 2546 Animals kept indoors are at greater risk of JSRV infection (Griffiths, Martineau et al. Sensitivity detection 2550 2551 Meat inspection data from 2008 -2011 show that approximately 5% of all animals 2552 have lung lesions. However, this is non -specific for OPA, as it includes multiple 2553 pathologies and aetiologies. Expert opinion suggests that the majority of lung lesions 2554 are either due to lungworm or pneumonia (Andrea Cranfield, FSA Oper ations Group, 2555 personal communication). Tumours are detected in approximately 2 animals per 2556 100,000 slaughtered, which could reflect OPA in the majority of cases (Salvatori, de 2557 las Heras et al. 2004 ). 2558 2559 Expert opinion indicates that a visual -only inspection of the lungs is likely to miss 2560 more cases of OPA than traditional inspection (Chris Cousens pers. Comm.) . 2561 Necropsy data show gross post mortem inspection of clinically healthy ewes from 2562 known OPA -positive herds has a sensitivity of d etection ranging between 0 and 75% 2563 (Voigt, Kraemer et al. 2007 ; Cousens, Graham et al. 2008 ). Sensitivity of detection of 2564 OPA by gross pathology in adult animals with mild or suspicious (but not severe) 2565 clinical signs (i.e. those that might not be detected at ante mortem inspection) was 2566 71% in one study (Voigt, Kraemer et al. 2007 ). It is important to note that these data 2567 refer to necropsy procedures, which are more thorough than meat inspection, and thus 2568 75% sensitivity could be considered the best -case scenario for the latter. By contrast, 2569 in a large -scale New Zealand study, visual meat inspection of lamb lungs was shown 2570 to have a sensitivity of detection of pneumonic lesions (a classification that includes 2571 OPA) of only 17% (Goodwin -Ray, Stevenson et al. 2008 ). 2572 blic adenocarcinoma animal health 2578 2579 JSRV spreads horizontally within a herd and has been shown to infect lambs from a 2580 young age. Within -herd prevalence in infected flocks can be high (Garcia -Goti, 2581 Gonzalez et al. 2000 ; Cousens, Graham et al. 2008 ) the incubation period is usually 2582 long (months -years); and in fection is often clinically and/or macroscopically silent 2583 within the individual. Meat inspection (either traditional or visual -only) is therefore 2584 unlikely to be an effective tool for diagnosis of OPA in a herd. However, visual -only 2585 PMMI will be likely to reduce the sensitivity of detection of PM meat inspection, 2586 although it should be noted that OPA is not currently recorded at meat inspection as a 2587 condition in its own right. 2588 2589 Risk estimation 2590 2591 While non -conforming, adult animals are at greater risk of OP A and the sensitivity of 2592 detection of visual -only meat inspection would be less than for traditional meat 2593 inspection, OPA is not currently recorded at meat inspection. Therefore, accurate 2594 information is unable to be passed back to the farmer. In the abse nce of meaningful 2595 feedback, visual -only PMMI is unlikely to result in any change in risk to animal 2596 health, i.e. the consequences of change are negligible . 2597 2598 Mycobacterium avium Overview 2601 2602 Johnes disease is caused with Mycobacterium avium subspecies 2603 paratuberculosis (MAP) , usually at a young age. In cattle, sheep and goats Johnes 2604 disease presents as a clinical syndrome of weight loss and/or diarrhoea several months 2605 or years later (Davis and Madsen -Bouterse 2012 ). Johnes disease in deer can present 2606 similarly, or as an acute or subacute debilitation and collapse in young animals. 2607 2608 89 Various studies have shown that susceptibility to Johnes disease, either in terms of 2609 infection, or extent of clinical progression and/or faecal shedding of MAP, decreases 2610 with age (Dore, Pare et al. 2010 ; Mackintosh, Clark et al. 2010 ). In cattle, limiting 2611 exposure of calves to adult faeces is t he most important element of Johnes disease 2612 control (Dore, Pare et al. 2010 ; Marce, Ezanno et al. 2011 ). 2613 2614 The m ain pathological findings in cattle, sheep and goats are thickening of the distal 2615 small intestine, distension of the draining lymphatics, and enlargement of the 2616 associated lymph nodes (Buergelt, Hall et al. 1978 ; Corpa, Garrido et al. 2000 ; Greig 2617 2000 ). In deer, thickening of the small intestinal wall is less f requent, and enlargement 2618 and oedema of the mesenteric and ileocaecal lymph nodes is commonly seen (Marco, 2619 Ruiz et al. 2002 ; de Lisle, Yates et al. 2003 ). 2620 2621 There has long been conjecture regarding the link between Johnes disease and 2622 Crohns disease in man (Uzoigwe, Khaitsa et al. 2007 ). MAP has been isolated from 2623 patients with Crohns disease, but also from patients with other diseases, and healthy 2624 people (Davis and Madsen -Bouterse 2012 ). Studies of high -risk groups that have 2625 been exposed to clinical Jo hnes in animals have failed to show an association 2626 between the two diseases (SCAHW 2000 ). 2627 2628 Difference in prevalence between conforming and non -conforming animals 2629 2630 Meat inspection recorded a prevalence rate of 4.7 cases per 100,000 adu lt cattle 2631 slaughtered in the period 2008 -2011. No calves were identified with the condition. 2632 Herd prevalence of bovine Johnes disease in Great Britain has previously been 2633 shown to be between 3.5% and 4.9% (Cetinkaya, Egan et al. 1996 ), although a much 2634 higher regional prevalence (75 -78% of dairy herds, and 44 -46% beef suckler herds) 2635 has recently been estimated in South -West En gland (Woodbine, Schukken et al. 2636 2009 ). Herd -level prevalence is thought to be over 50% in several European countries 2637 (Nielsen and Toft 2009 ). A mean of 3,381 cases per year has been diagnosed by 2638 AHVLA laboratories o ver the period 2008 -2011 (AHVLA, 2012). 2639 2640 An increased prevalence in older cattle has been shown (Gasteiner, Awad -Masalmeh 2641 et al. 2000 ), and in the UK, Johnes disease has not been detected at slaughter in 2642 90 calves younger than 8 months (FSA, 2012). Animals reared in contact with adult 2643 faeces (e.g. those with access to pasture, or contact with their dam) are also at higher 2644 risk (Dore, Pare et al. 2010 ). Thus, adult cattle, and those reared in extensive systems, 2645 are at higher risk of developing Johnes disease than animals from conforming 2646 systems. 2647 2648 Johnes is not a recorde d condition at meat inspection for sheep or goats. The 2649 prevalence of Johnes disease in British sheep is thought to be between 1% and 5% of 2650 individual animals (Greig 2000 ; Scott 2012 ). Flock -level prevalence in Europe is 2651 considered to be above 20% (Nielsen and Toft 2009 ). Like Johnes disease in cattle, 2652 the disease occurs in older animals that have usually been infected with MAP at a 2653 young age. 2654 2655 Two wild deer were recorded with Johnes Disease during meat inspection over the 2656 period 2008 -2011, giving a prevalence rate of 0.47/100,000 wild deer shot and 2657 inspected. No farmed deer were recorded with the disease. The presence of f armed 2658 deer has been associated with an increased risk of bovine Johnes disease in England 2659 (Cetinkaya, Erdogan et al. 1997 ). 2660 2661 Sensitivity detection 2662 2663 Two studies on Johnes disease -affected cattle herds show that between 24% and 53% 2664 of MAP -positive cattle did not have visually -identifiable lesions on post mortem 2665 (Buergelt, Hall et al. 1978 ; Brady, O'Grady et al. 2008 ). Meat inspection procedures 2666 for adult cattle currently include palpation and, where cons idered necessary, incision 2667 of the gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes (EC 854/2004). Omitting palpation of the 2668 lymph nodes during meat inspection is likely to result in some, but not all, of these 2669 cases being missed (Dominguez, Watson, personal communicati on, FSA). Due to the 2670 low numbers of presumptive Johnes cases detected by the existing method, the 2671 absolute difference in the sensitivity of detection between traditional and visual -only 2672 meat inspection is likely to be very low. 2673 2674 Pathological changes in MA P-positive sheep/goats, particularly goats, are not always 2675 evident grossly (Corpa, Garrido et al. 2000 0; Tafti and Rashidi 2000 ). 2676 91 studies show between 36% and 67% of MAP -positive animals from clinically 2677 affected flocks have either no gross lesions, or very mild ones that are easily missed at 2678 necro psy which is a more thorough, and therefore sensitive, examination than meat 2679 inspection (Carrigan and Seaman 1990 ; Perez, Marin et al. 1996 ). Studies from 2680 Australia show that flock -level sensitivity of detecting ovine Johnes disease by 2681 manual and visual meat inspection is between 30 -36% in low -prevalence areas 2682 (Sergeant 2003 ), although this is likely to be an over -estimate . 2683 2684 Palpation and incision of the gastrointestinal tract, mesentery and associated lymph 2685 nodes of sheep and goats are not curren tly performed at PMMI. There is therefore no 2686 change in sensitivity of detecting this disease in small ruminants. No cases of Johnes 2687 in either sheep or goats have been detected in the abattoir by this visual appraisal 2688 between 2008 -2011. 2689 2690 The prominent pat hological change in Johnes -affected deer is enlarged or abnormal 2691 mesenteric lymph nodes. Abattoir detection of this pathology by visual inspection has 2692 been shown to be highly specific (at least 94.6%) for MAP -positivity but sensitivity is 2693 low (12-13.3%) (Hunnam 2011 ). There is some evidence to suggest that this method 2694 is more reliable in young animals (Stringer, Wilson et al. 2011 ). Similarly to sheep 2695 and goats palpation and incision of the gastrointestinal tract, mesentery and associated 2696 lymph nodes of farmed deer are not currently performed at PMMI. There is therefore 2697 no change in sensitivity of detecting this disease in these animals. 2698 2699 In GB, only two suspect cases of Johnes disease (in wild deer) have been detected at 2700 meat inspection in the last four years (FSA, 2012). The pluck of wild deer is usually 2701 left in the fiel d unless abnormalities are detected visually by the hunter. This practice 2702 is already a visual -only inspection so there will be no change in sensitivity of 2703 detection of Johnes disease in wild deer. 2704 2705 Impact on public health 2706 2707 Meat from clinical and subclini cally affected cattle can contain disseminated MAP 2708 (Alonso -Hearn, Molina et al. 2009 ; Eltholth, Marsh et al. 2009 ) and go on to enter the 2709 food chain. However, very little data exist on the persistence of MAP in processed or 2710 92 cooked meat. The sole study investigating the presence of MAP in retail beef found 2711 no evidence of the bacteria in 200 samples of groun d beef (Jaravata, Smith et al. 2712 2007). Heating of MAP -contaminated lymph node/meat composites, where the 2713 bacteria were present in greater amounts than in muscle alone, showed that cooking to 2714 medium rare \"greatly reduced\" the amount of viable MAP present, and cooking to 2715 well-done elimina ted viable MAP (Mutharia, Klassen et al. 2010 ). 2716 2717 A New Zealand study has shown that MAP was isolated from skeletal muscle or 2718 blood in 71% and 62%, respectively, of sheep with confirmed clinical Johnes 2719 disease; it was a lso detected in 13% and 3% of muscle or blood from sheep with no 2720 gross or histopathological evidence of Johnes disease (Smith, West et al. 2011 ). 2721 2722 Zoonotic transmission potential of MAP is still debate d. Presently, there is no 2723 evidence of meat -borne transmission of MAP to humans, but there is a view from the 2724 National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF) that 2725 the possibility should be further investigated (NACMCF 2010 ). 2726 2727 Impact on animal health 2728 2729 Johnes disease may not present with clinical signs for several months or even years 2730 after infection. Despite serological tests indicating a high herd prevalence of infection 2731 for cat tle with approximately 7% cattle testing positive PMMI data for detection of 2732 Johnes disease are considerably less indicating a low sensitivity of detection for 2733 traditional PMMI techniques (Woodbine 2009). As the difference in the sensitivity of 2734 detection between current and visual -only meat inspection is likely to be very low and 2735 current detection rates are already very low there is likely to be negligible impact on 2736 animal health for cattle. 2737 2738 There would be no impact on animal health for sheep, goats and d eer as palpation and 2739 incision of the gastrointestinal tract, mesentery and associated lymph nodes is not 2740 currently performed so a visual only PMMI is already in place for these species. 2741 2742 Risk estimation 2743 2744 93 PMMI detection of Johnes disease in GB has very lit tle impact on either public or 2745 animal health, due to its low diagnostic sensitivity. Meat inspection currently detects 2746 very low numbers of suspect Johnes disease cases in cattle and wild deer and has not 2747 identified a single case in sheep, goats, or farmed deer between 2008 and 2011. The 2748 proposed change in meat inspection procedures to a visual -only technique could only 2749 affect detection of Johnes disease in cattle or farmed deer, as these are the animal 2750 groups currently subject to mandatory palpation of t he mesenteric lymph nodes. The 2751 others already undergo visual -only appraisal of the relevant tissues. Wild deer form a 2752 unique population in that PMMI is currently the only point of surveillance for MAP 2753 detection . However, as stated above the current visual -only PMMI will not be 2754 changed under the new proposals. 2755 2756 The links between MAP and public health are still debatable, but it would appear that 2757 the meat -borne risk is negligible so the impact of a change to visual -only PMMI 2758 would also be negligible . 2759 2760 With regard to animal health, even in a worst -case scenario, where all the recently 2761 identified cases would be missed by the change in inspection procedure, the numbers 2762 remain very low. Thus, a change to visual -only meat inspection is very likely to be of 2763 negligible risk to animal health. 2764 2765 2766 Appendix III Flow diagram of TB testing in GB - taken from de 2767 la "}
