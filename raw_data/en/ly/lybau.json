Are you tired of suffering? Are you ready to begin living once again? If so, it is time to look at how homeopathy can help you. Our integrative health specialist and homeopathic doctor has more than 30 years of experience helping sufferers just like you recover from illnesses and chronic health issues. Homeopathy focuses on healing your body rather than just treating your symptoms. Homeopathic doctors understand that all systems in the body are interrelated and work together to promote health. When the body has the nutrients it needs, it can heal itself. Homeopathic medicine has three defining principles. Law of Similars - substances that produce the same symptoms in a healthy person can help heal a sick person. For example, when you chop onions, your eyes typically water and your nose runs. With the law of similars, a remedy for a runny nose would be a homeopathic remedy that acts as a decongestant, much like an onion. In this instance, [Allium Cepa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/allium-cepa) may be recommended. Law of the Minimal Doses - homeopathic medicines are believed to be more effective when they are diluted and shaken vigorously. The advantage of minimal doses is the reduction of unwanted side effects while still providing the body with the medicine it needs to heal itself. Law of Individualized Medications and Single Remedies - single remedies are chosen to help heal the patient from the inside out. The whole of a person, including their temperament, emotional health, personality and physical responses are considered when determining the proper ingredients to use in the prescribed remedy. At Rose Wellness, we take your health seriously. During your first appointment, our homeopathic doctor will discuss your lifestyle choices, stress in your life, family history, medical concerns and past illnesses. He will use this information to develop customized homeopathic treatment plan for you. He may suggest nutritional and lifestyle changes that will help heal your body, spirit and mind. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to ensure you are on the road to recovery and wellness.
