{"title": "The 10 Very Best Rice Cookers", "author": "Emma Wartzman", "url": "https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-rice-cookers.html", "hostname": "nymag.com", "description": "Whether you want a cheap and simple model or a technologically savvy machine with lots of settings.", "sitename": "The Strategist", "date": "2018-06-19", "cleaned_text": "In this article I eat rice multiple days a week \u2014 and used to exclusively make it in a [pot](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-saucepans.html) on the stove. It's a deceptively easy task: Measure, rinse, add water, simmer, steam, and less than a half an hour later, you're done. And yet often \u2014 no matter if you're an amateur in the kitchen or consider yourself pretty accomplished \u2014 the final result is a letdown. Even though I put myself in the latter category, sometimes my grains turn to mush, sometimes they're hard in the middle, and all too often, they're stuck to the bottom of the pot (in my house, the ultimate \"let it [soak overnight](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/how-to-hand-wash-dishes.html)\" culprit \u2014 never a fun thing to wake up to). For many, rice cookers save the day. They are basically a targeted type of electric cooker, similar to a [pressure cooker](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-pressure-cookers.html) or [slow cooker](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-slow-cookers.html), only they excel at making plump, perfectly cooked rice. They can either be incredibly simple, with just two settings to \"cook\" and \"keep warm,\" or they can be quite advanced, with presets for all different types of rice (brown, long grain, sushi, and more), as well as preparations like congee, porridge, and even pressure-cooking (which is, yes, one way in which all those electric cooking tools can overlap). I spoke with 17 experts about their own favorite models, which ranged from cheap and straightforward contraptions to more high-tech machines, and then tested some out myself. The bottom line is clear: If you eat rice even a couple of times a week, a rice cooker may be well worth a spot on your countertop. What we're looking for Capacity Many of the rice cookers below come in multiple sizes. I've listed all of them so you can easily see what your options are. Of course, how big of a capacity you go for will depend on how much rice you consume per meal, as well as if you want to have leftovers. But in general, a three-cup rice cooker is good for one or two people, a five- or six-cup rice cooker is good for about four people, and anything bigger is best if you eat a lot of rice or [host people](https://nymag.com/strategist/tags/steal-my-party/) frequently for dinner. Also important to remember: The bigger the capacity, the more space the cooker will take up. Settings As I mentioned before, some rice cookers come with just a couple of settings, and others come with many. Here, I've listed each of the specific functions the given rice cooker can perform. The one exception is the last on this list, which is a manual donabe rice cooker. Best overall rice cooker Capacity: 5.5 or 10 cups | Settings: White/sushi, mixed, porridge, sweet, brown, cake, steam, and quick cooking For my whole adult life, I've cooked rice in a pot on the stove. There's something satisfying about honing that skill, but, even with age and wisdom, the grains don't turn out right every time. A few months ago, however, I got my hands on this Zojirushi to test, and since then, my rice has been evenly tender and fluffy every time. My biggest disclaimer: This appliance is big. But if you have the space, it really does live up to the hype. The settings are displayed on a small screen at the front, and if you're unsure about your water to rice ratio, the brand has [this helpful guide](https://www.zojirushi.com/grains/nszcc18.html) (the first time I cooked Basmati in it, I did a quick check to make sure I was filling it with the proper amount of liquid). I've also used the included basket to steam greens and, [as Carla Lalli Music taught me](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/ylyl-steamer-basket.html), perfect potatoes. When all is said and done, both the steamer and the inside bowl are a breeze to clean. You pluck them out and any residue rinses right off. But don't just take it from me. In my reporting, Zojirushi came up more than any other brand. They have a fancier model with even more settings that multiple experts mentioned (you can read about that one further down on the list), but this one \u2014 especially given that it's less than half the price of the other \u2014 makes for an all-around great buy. Food writer and recipe developer [Kiera Wright-Ruiz](https://www.instagram.com/kierawrr/?hl=en) had to leave hers behind when she recently moved out of the country, and told me it's the thing she misses the most. \"I'm sure people have said this before, but it really is the Lamborghini of rice cookers,\" she says. The standout reason is what Zojirushi calls \"Fuzzy technology,\" or a built-in microcomputer that can sense how your rice is cooking and adjust the time and temperature to get a perfect result if need be. \"There's just no way to mess up rice in it,\" Wright-Ruiz explains. \"Even if you add too little or too much water, it will self-correct. You get a consistent texture with a margin of error.\" Another particularly appealing feature is the ability to preset when you want your rice to cook. \"You can sync it to be done at the same time as other foods,\" says Wright-Ruiz. \"Like if you're braising something that takes three hours, you can time it so that the rice is done right when your braise is done. Or if you want rice in the morning, you can set it before you go to sleep and it will automatically start so you have rice ready to go when you wake up.\" Finally, though perhaps not the most imperative to the rice itself, Zojirushi's machines play music when you start them (an adaptation of \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\") and when they're [done cooking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMN0jAENzIg) \u2014 and it's clearly delightful enough that everyone who recommended the brand (again, more on the rest of those folks below) made mention of the jingles. Best less expensive rice cooker Capacity: 5 or 10 cups | Settings: Quick cook/steam, white rice, brown rice, porridge/soup, keep warm The Panasonic is another simple model, the one that food photographer [Neal Santos](https://www.instagram.com/nealsantos/?hl=en) has also used for a decade \u2014 both personally and at his Philly-based Filipino pop-up, [Lalo](https://www.instagram.com/lalophilly/?hl=en) (which unfortunately closed due to the pandemic). \"I'm not a high-tech kind of person, and this only has a few settings. That's what I grew up with in a Filipino household,\" he says. \"It can be on all the time and stay warm. It has a little basket that can steam veggies over the rice. Sometimes I'll use it for other dishes as well. The Philippines has a lot of rice desserts \u2014 like suman, which is sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf. I put the suman in there and let it stay warm. That's how we used it at the restaurant. We were in a food hall, so everything was small, and this was an efficient way to do things.\" Reviewers of the Panasonic agree. \"The 'keep warm' function is so convenient,\" writes one, \"and I never end up with burnt rice that's impossible to clean off the pot. In fact, I usually only have to give the pot a quick rinse when I'm done and it's good to go.\" Another says it's even better than the Zojirushi when it comes to that particular setting. \"It keeps white or brown rice warm and ready to eat for 24 hours, without the rice drying out and becoming too hard and brittle,\" they write. \"The 10-cup Zojirushi we have will dry out the rice overnight.\" Best even less expensive rice cooker Capacity: 4 cups | Settings: White rice, brown rice, keep warm, steam, delay timer, flash rice For a particularly low-key model that gets the job done, chef [Justin Lee](https://www.instagram.com/fatchoyboy/?hl=en) turns to his Aroma Digital Rice Cooker. \"For home use, I think a cheap and simple one is really all you need,\" he says. \"Overall, it's just easier than using a pot \u2014 or at least you don't have to watch it as much. It gets the job done totally fine. And sure, there's something about the way the Zojirushi is constructed that makes it superior. But at the end of the day, we're not making sushi rice. This is just us cooking rice at home so we can feed ourselves and our family.\" For that, he maintains, it's perfect. In my own testing, I found the simplicity of the machine wasn't only good enough, but a plus. While I do appreciate the more targeted settings of the Zojirushi, this one was more intuitive to use initially with only a few very clear settings. Each time, it has yielded fluffy, perfectly cooked grains, no matter if I'm making long-grain white, short-grain white, or brown rice. The keep-warm setting works well, too. Once, I let a batch sit for a full hour before I ate, and it was still moist but not overcooked. Recipe developer and [cookbook author](https://www.amazon.com/Mayumu-Filipino-American-Desserts-Remixed/dp/0063244063?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0829aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov________________) [Abi Balingit](https://www.instagram.com/theduskykitchen/?hl=en) expresses a to use,\" she says, \"basically dummy-proof.\" The cost was also part of the initial appeal, Balingit says, but she's been using hers for five years with \"consistent results every time.\" She also appreciates the compact size that fits in the small space above her kitchen cabinets. Still, I'll note, it fits plenty; I made rice in it for a dinner party of five people and had [leftovers](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-food-storage-containers.html). If you're interested in an even [simpler version](https://www.amazon.com/Aroma-Housewares-UNCOOKED-Digital-ARC-914D/dp/B007WQ9YNE/?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0829aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov________________) of Lee's Aroma, Strategist senior editor Chelsea Peng (who grew up with Zojirushis), endorses such a model. She uses hers to make brown rice (and during tomato season, this [extremely dated but delicious hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_9QImcJmSg)). \"The 12-minute final countdown is a handy feature, because it tells me when to squeeze in a Shona Vertue video or to start cooking the other components of my meal,\" she says. \"And it's very sturdy \u2014 I've bashed it around and picked it up by the top handle when it's open (don't ask me why) with no detrimental effect.\" Best electric steamer rice cooker [Tatung Rice Cooker](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1552619&url=https%3A%2F%2Fyunhai.shop%2Fcollections%2Ftatung-electric-rice-cooker-and-steamer&xcust=__st0908aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov__191801______________) Capacity: 6 cups | Settings: Steam, keep warm Food writer [Cathy Erway](https://www.cathyerway.com/) explains that her rice cooker, ubiquitous in Taiwan, works like an electric steamer: Instead of mixing rice and water directly together, the Tatung heats water in a larger compartment around the bowl that holds the rice. This generates steam and helps the individual grains cook super-evenly. But it also means that \"you can steam other foods, like eggs or broccoli, without boiling them,\" Erway says, whether that's on a tray set on top of the rice or without any rice at all. She also appreciates the simple functionality. \"I don't need a ton of buttons to do this thing or that thing,\" she says. \"After the first time or two making rice, you know exactly how long it takes.\" Best simple rice cooker Capacity: 6 cups | Settings: Cook, keep warm Recipe developer and writer [Justine Doiron](https://justinesnacks.com/) loves her rice cooker because of its simplicity and reliability. She first bought it about eight years ago at Target because it was the cheapest one she could find. Despite the notably low price, the machine has proven to be incredibly durable and has \"never done me wrong,\" she says. The Imusa comes with a measuring cup and instructions on how much water to add, depending on what variety of rice you're making. Other than that, it operates with a single cook button and a setting to keep food warm if you want. \"When a cooking appliance is only meant for one use, you don't need the fanciest model,\" Doiron says. Best Persian-rice cooker Capacity: 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 or 15 cups | Settings: Customizable timer, keep warm The Pars Persian-rice cooker is built to do something different from all the others on this list: make [tahdig](https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/09/cooking-perfect-persian-food-while-quarantined.html), the ubiquitous, crispy layer of rice at the bottom (and top, when you turn it over) of many preparations of Persian rice dishes. \"I'm an avid home cook, but rice was always tough for me, and that's part of why for a while I avoided cooking a lot of Persian food,\" says writer [Arya Roshanian](https://www.aryaroshanian.com/), who [chronicled his foray](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22301088/nowruz-persian-new-year-pars-rice-cooker) into using the Pars for Vox last year. Funny enough, his mom and grandmother both used one, and it was during the pandemic that he finally decided it was time to get one himself. In fact, he has two now \u2014 the smaller four-cup he started out with and a larger seven-cup he uses to make tahdig for a crowd. \"It's user-friendly,\" he says, \"something that my 85-year-old grandma who only speaks Farsi and isn't that good at technology can figure out. The first time I used it, I was thinking I would need to try a few times in order to get it right, but it came out pretty perfectly \u2014 and then each subsequent time too.\" Roshanian also likes that the insert is lightweight and \"nonstick so it's super-easy to flip out and clean.\" Best rice cooker with pressure cooking Capacity: 10 cups | Settings: White rice, glutinous turbo, mixed rice, brown rice, high heat, GABA rice (germinated brown rice), porridge, nu rung ji (scorched rice), multi-cook, auto-clean, pressure cook, reheat, keep warm, preset timer \"I bought a Cuckoo because that's what my mom and aunts use,\" says Joanne Lee Molinaro, better known as the [Korean Vegan](https://www.instagram.com/thekoreanvegan/?hl=en). \"When you go to a Korean grocery store, you see a bunch of Cuckoos all over the place.\" Molinaro uses hers \u2014 [a slightly older but similar model](https://www.cuckoomallusa.com/products/crp-g1015f) to the one listed \u2014 primarily for brown rice as well as mixed rice, the setting for which she uses every time she adds soybeans, farro, pearled barley, and even chestnuts and sweet potatoes. For food writer [Justine Lee](https://www.justineslee.com/), who has the more recent model, \"the multi-cook setting is where it stuns.\" Multi-cook essentially turns the appliance into a [pressure cooker](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-pressure-cookers.html) and allows you to adjust the time and heat level. \"Both are as easy as dialing the knob to set,\" says Lee. \"It's how I steam a bunch of Korean sweet potatoes right before road trips and quell my bean hankerings come summertime. I've even followed recipes fitted for a traditional Instant Pot such as cinnamon buns and [yakbap](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.instagram.com_p_CaAavJKFNwP_&d=DwMFaQ&c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&r=LNmPfaUp8qvDiDEkSL2R26ZXB3Ez4m-XCDbPEbkdd1o&m=8ChCJpLnmf6Ig4QTQ2AGhP1PyUmSezaglb0-WVkwlocuqvpTjBQyfVpBPRTkOSRo&s=N6Mn5Ppy4FS8uJwjWyz7ORQvi1s_4FWjxljjpsQWTfQ&e=), which can get sticky. But cleanup with this rice cooker is a breeze across the board.\" If you're interested in the brand but don't care so much about the multi-cook feature, Strategist editor Maxine Builder has an even older version of [this under-$100 Cuckoo](https://www.amazon.com/Cuckoo-CR-0655F-Cooker-Liters-Quarts/dp/B01MQWFGKG?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0829aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov________________) that still works perfectly after she's used it for the past several years. (Her exact model is older still than the one linked and not available online anymore.) Best less expensive rice cooker with pressure cooking Capacity: 3 quart, 6 quart, or 8 quart | Settings: Rice, soup/broth, meat/stew, bean/chili, poultry, multigrain, porridge, steam, saute, yogurt, slow cook, pressure cook, keep warm It's no secret that the Instant Pot can do a lot \u2014 but Strategist senior editor Jen Trolio primarily uses hers for rice, making it for her family of four at least once a week. She takes a stainless-steel mixing bowl, fills it with equal parts water and rice, and sets it inside the Instant Pot on top of the wire rack the unit comes with. Then she puts a half-inch or so of water at the bottom of the larger container (not covering the top of the rack). She cooks on high pressure for four minutes, then does the slow release for about ten minutes (with a manual release if there's any pressure remaining at the end). With a little fluff, it's ready to go. \"It's nice to have the (nearly) set-it-and-forget-it convenience of a 'rice cooker' that is also multipurpose for [pressure cooking](https://nymag.com/strategist/2016/11/the-best-pressure-cooker-is-the-fagor.html), slow cooking, and so on,\" Trulio says. \"Obviously we could still do rice on the stove, but on top of the convenience, the Instant Pot can be shoved to the edge of the counter and not take up a burner.\" Best high-end rice cooker [Zojirushi NP-NWC10XB Rice Cooker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FZXZHY?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0908aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov__182896______________) Capacity: 5.5 or 10 cups | Settings: White (regular, softer, or harder), umami, mixed, sushi/sweet, Jasmine, porridge, congee, brown, GABA brown (germinated brown rice), steel cut oatmeal, quick cooking, automatic keep warm, extended keep warm, reheat This is the previously mentioned higher-end Zojirushi model that so many experts enthusiastically recommended. It is, notably, the most expensive on the list, but it's also clearly a favorite, a worth-it investment if you eat enough rice. Of course, it has that same standout technology as the more affordable model. The main difference is the myriad of settings \u2014 and in particular, one that everyone whom I talked to honed in on. \"This model I bought specifically because it has a congee mode,\" says food writer and editor [Alyse Whitney](https://www.instagram.com/alysewhitney/?hl=en). \"The one I had previously for many years only had Japanese porridge, which is thinner. So, yes, I bought this for a button, but it literally makes perfect congee.\" Recipe developer and [cookbook author](https://www.amazon.com/My-Shanghai-Recipes-Stories-Water/dp/0062854720?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0829aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov________________) [Betty Liu](https://www.instagram.com/bliu07/?hl=en) also makes a lot of congee in hers, calling it \"convenient, fast, and incredibly reliable.\" And finally, TikTok recipe creator [Vivian Aronson](https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingbomb?lang=en) uses that feature too, particularly for breakfast. \"I can set it at night and have congee ready in the morning,\" she says. Best donabe Capacity: 1, 3, 4, or 5 cups | Settings: None Jing Gao, the founder of [Strategist](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/gifts-under-50-from-asian-owned-brands.html)- [favorite](https://nymag.com/strategist/2022/01/things-thatll-sell-out-parachute-peanuts.html) [brand](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-edible-food-gifts.html) [Fly by Jing](https://flybyjing.com/), has multiple donabes from the Los Angeles-based shop Toiro in her kitchen, including this one specifically for cooking rice. While she also owns a Zojirushi, she swears this manual method makes the rice taste better. While Gao's vessel is similar to a traditional donabe you would use for soup or stew, in that it's made from porous clay, there are a few key differences that allow the grains to cook especially evenly. First, as Toiro owner and [donabe expert](https://www.amazon.com/Donabe-Classic-Modern-Japanese-Cooking/dp/1607746999?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0829aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov________________) [Naoko Takei](https://www.instagram.com/mrsdonabe/?hl=en) says, it's about one-and-a-half times thicker than the other models she sells, meaning it takes longer to build heat. Second, there's an inner lid underneath the top lid, which adds pressure. And finally, it has a rounded shape, creating \"the most ideal circulation of water and moisture and steam during cooking,\" she says. To use this donabe, you simply set your flame to medium high, let it go for about 15 minutes, turn it off, then let it sit for another 20 to further steam. It was designed to be just as convenient and simple to use as electric versions (with traditionally shaped donabes and standard stainless-steel [saucepans](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-saucepans.html?), you have to change heat levels and keep an eye on things). Gao also points out that, beyond providing superior taste and texture, the donabe looks beautiful. \"Being able to display it out in the open is really nice,\" she says. \"It inspires you to cook with it.\" Some more rice cookers we've written about Our experts [Vivian Aronson](https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingbomb?lang=en), TikTok [Abi Balingit](https://www.instagram.com/theduskykitchen/?hl=en), Maxine Builder, [Justine Doiron](https://justinesnacks.com/), recipe developer and writer [Cathy Erway](https://www.cathyerway.com/), food writer Jing Gao, founder of [Fly By Jing](https://flybyjing.com/) Justin Lee, chef [Joanne Lee Molinaro](https://www.instagram.com/thekoreanvegan/?hl=en), writer, recipe developer, [cookbook author](https://www.amazon.com/Korean-Vegan-Cookbook-Reflections-Recipes/dp/0593084276?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0829aam__cjim1c6nh001a4by6otei4uov________________) [Betty Liu](https://www.instagram.com/bliu07/?hl=en), recipe developer and [cookbook [Arya Roshanian](https://www.aryaroshanian.com/), food photographer [Naoko Jen Trolio, Strategist senior editor [Alyse Whitney](https://www.instagram.com/alysewhitney/?hl=en), food writer and editor [Kiera Wright-Ruiz](https://www.instagram.com/kierawrr/?hl=en), food writer and recipe developer [The Strategist](http://nymag.com/strategist/2016/10/introducing-the-strategist.html) is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
