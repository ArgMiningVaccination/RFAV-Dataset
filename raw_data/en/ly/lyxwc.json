In particular, women's health felt to Crystal like it was missing major pieces, and so she created in herself what she hopes all healthcare providers will someday aim to be- educated in both holistic and allopathic practices, focused on preventative and non-invasive medicine, and interested in guiding patients to the tools needed to empower them. In other words, Crystal listens to her patients and helps them figure out the path to healing that works for THEM. For over 17 years, Crystal has been providing women with a place where she could lead them to healing, whether trying to conceive, pregnant or experiencing hormonal imbalances. She approaches medicine with natural therapies that initiate balance and long-term health. She is tech savvy, has a memory that is nearly photographic and has an in-depth knowledge of Reproductive Medicine. She loves drawing, journaling, music, birth, sea turtles and the lost art of personal communication. Crystal's Credentials: Licensed Acupuncture Physician Board Certified in Oriental Medicine through NCCAOM Fellow of the American Board of Oriental Reproductive Medicine Master of Science in Oriental Medicine Bachelor of Science in Professional Health Studies Associate of Science in Graphic Design Certified HypnoBirthing\u00ae Instructor (Former) Certified Hypnotherapist Certified Birth Doula (CBI) | "}
