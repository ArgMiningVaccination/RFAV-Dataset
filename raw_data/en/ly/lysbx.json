Minimum: 3 mL whole blood from light green top tube or TWO Microtainer\u00ae devices for pediatric patients Testing Schedule: 24 hrs/day, 7 days a week, including holidays. Turn Around Time: 1 hour (upon receipt in laboratory) Reference Range: Non-reactive; positive with vaccine administration. Non-reactive samples have anti-HBs level less than 8.5 mIU/mL. Reactive samples have anti-HBs level greater than or equal to 11.5 mIU/mL. The result is indeterminate if the sample tests twice with anti-HBs results greater than or equal to 8.5 mIU/mL but less than 11.5 mIU/mL. Comments: This assay may be significantly impacted by high-dose biotin (>5 mg dose) taken within previous 12 hours. High concentrations of biotin may lead to falsely decreased results. These concentrations may be found in patients taking over-the-counter supplements with biotin content much higher than nutritional requirements for biotin. Specimens should not be collected until at least 12 hours after the last dose. Part of initial diagnostic hepatitis profile or to verify immunity status in patients who have received the hepatitis B vaccine. Results include reactivity (REACTIVE or NON-REAC), immune status (IMMUNE or NON IMM OR INDETERM) and quantitative concentration. Anti-HBs can be formed following a hepatitis B infection or after hepatitis B vaccination.

Results include reactivity (REACTIVE or NON-REAC), immune status (IMMUNE or NON IMM OR INDETERM) and quantitative concentration. Anti-HBs can be formed following a hepatitis B infection or after hepatitis B vaccination. Test Limitations: Assay is unaffected by mg/dL), and lipemia (triglycerides < 1500 mg/dL). No false negative findings due to the high-dose hook effect are observed up to an anti-HBs concentration of 115,000 mIU/mL. In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to analyte- specific antibodies, streptavidin, or ruthenium can occur. For diagnostic purposes, the results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical examination, and other findings. The assay is not intended for use in screening blood bank donors. A nonreactive test result does not exclude the possibility of exposure to or infection with hepatitis B. Individuals who have received blood component therapy, e.g., whole blood, plasma, immune globulin administration, during the previous 3 to 6 months may have a false reactive anti-HBs due to passive transfer of anti-HBs. Results from immunosuppressed individuals should be interpreted with caution.

Methodology: Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) Sample Processing: Centrifuge at a speed and time necessary to get barrier separation of plasma/serum and cells within 1 hour of collection. Send specimen in original tube. Do Not transfer to another tube. Each sample must be labeled with at least TWO full patient identifiers (First/Last Name & DOB are sufficient for non-UIHC affiliated clients) to avoid sample rejection/delays.

Sample Storage: Refrigerate. All sample storage requirements are intended for delivery to UIHC within 24 hours of collection for testing. If samples won't arrive in this time period, please call the UIHC Core Lab for alternative storage/shipping instructions (319-356-3527).
