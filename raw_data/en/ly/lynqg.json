They also rely on herbal remedies and choose the natural approach to health care over vaccinations, as do a number of other parents whose children attend the Engels' day-care center. But after Sonoma County's largest whooping cough outbreak in a decade hit the center-and after a measles epidemic last year struck a nearby private school where parents also reject vaccination-local public health officials say they no longer can live and let live. \"They're a fringe that won't go away. It's like a flat-Earth society,\" said Dr. George Flores, county public health officer. \"They don't consider the effect of their child on the rest of society.\" Vaccinations have become the subject of increasingly emotional debate nationwide at a time when the Clinton administration is promoting childhood immunization as a top national health priority. Some parents insist health care should be a private choice. They look on childhood illness as a normal part of human development, and they prefer their children gain full immunity from a bout of measles or mumps rather than from a vaccination, which can wear off in adulthood and isn't always effective. \"The decision I made wasn't just arbitrary,\" says Wendy Engel, 36, whose 5-year-old daughter was the first of seven children to get sick who were connected with the 30-child day-care program the couple runs from its spacious home and sprawling backyard. \"There needs to be a place for everyone to choose the lifestyle that works for them.\" But their lifestyle became a hazard to others, according to health officials. Nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the incidence of whooping cough has been on the rise, reaching a 25-year high last year with 6,132 cases and eight deaths. Before the whooping cough vaccination was introduced in the late 1940s, the highly infectious respiratory disease caused thousands of deaths every year, mostly among babies. Still, the CDC reports that fewer than 50 percent of preschoolers nationally are vaccinated for any disease. Cost and lack of access to health care are the reasons most often cited. But an informal national movement that has raised questions about the safety and efficacy of vaccinations is adding to the numbers. In California, resistance to vaccinations is focused in northern rural areas of the state. Sonoma County reports 1.7 percent of parents request vaccination waivers for their children entering kindergarten; in Sierra County, the percentage is 3.5. Statewide, the percentage is 0.5. \"They're not a large number, but they often occur in pockets if there's a religious or New Age group,\" said Loring Dales, chief of the California Health Department's immunization branch. For most Americans, the scourge of whooping cough may be lost to memory, but not for Peggy Morris, whose 3- and 7-year-old children caught it at the Engels' Starchild Waldorf day-care center even though they had been immunized. \"You're up all night. You get no sleep. They cough until they throw up. I could see how an infant would die from this, but my kids were strong enough,\" said Morris, who runs a wholesale nursery business with her husband. The county public health officer ordered all children at the center, including those not sick, to take antibiotics, which can prevent further spread of the airborne disease but does not cure it. Many parents chose to keep their children home rather than give them drugs they felt were unnecessary. The Engel family and several others at the day-care center turn for medical advice to Dr. Bob Dudney, who believes in anthroposophy. The movement, based on the unity of mind, body and spirit, was developed by the early 20th Century German philosopher Rudolf Steiner. Working from a makeshift storefront office, the pony-tailed doctor prescribes specially prepared herbs and solutions made from insects. His waiting room is in the adjacent Womankind shop, which sells environmentally friendly feminine hygiene products. Most parents interviewed at the Starchild center said they gave their children no vaccinations. But all over the country, some parents who do immunize their children spurn the whooping cough, or pertussis, part of the DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) shots given in infancy and childhood. These parents say they fear reports of adverse reactions from the pertussis vaccine. The National Vaccine Information Center in Vienna, Va., begun in 1982 by a woman whose son suffered an adverse vaccine reaction, has persuaded the medical establishment to inform parents that in rare cases the shots can cause high fevers, seizures and temporary comas. Whether such reactions cause permanent damage is the subject of continuing scientific and political debate. In the mid-1980s, after parents across the country had filed $3.1 billion in lawsuits claiming their children suffered permanent injuries or death from a variety of vaccinations, Congress set up the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to prevent drug companies from leaving the market or further raising prices because of increasing liability. The no-fault program has paid out $435 million in awards to 1,230 claimants since 1988. But only in March did a study by the Institute of Medicine, a part of the National Academy of Sciences, confirm the possibility of a causal relationship between severe reactions within seven days of a DPT shot and brain damage or death. Under the worst circumstances, the study said, such extreme side effects might occur in 10 out of every 1 million children vaccinated. Such a small risk, health officials say, is far outweighed by the thousands of lives saved by minimizing preventable diseases. \"The question is very large for some of these parents. Some of them are honestly trying to do what's best for their children,\" said Kathleen Stratton, study director at the Institute of Medicine. \"The flip side, of course, is that the pertussis disease is awful "}
