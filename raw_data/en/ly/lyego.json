This can be true for those who are not available to meet at group class times, need an introduction to yoga, would like to tailor make a personal practice, need accountability to incorporate yoga into their regular self-care habits, or would like to learn more about yoga at their own pace. Are you interested in channeling your passion and skill into helping someone feel better during a difficult time? We offer several training opportunities to teach yoga to cancer patients, survivors and/or caregivers. Acupuncture is being used in the care of cancer patients to help alleviate pain, fatigue, hot flashes and dry mouth after radiation as well as post-operative chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. The UNC Mindfulness-based Program for Stress and Pain Management offers training in meditation and mind-body awareness that will teach you how to slow down, set priorities and stay calm, focused and relaxed in the midst of a busy life. These practices will enhance your body's natural adaptive healing ability and will cultivate the mind's clarity and insight.
