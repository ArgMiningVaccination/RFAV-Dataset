Our primary goal is to help our patients thrive throughout treatment and beyond by providing attentive and compassionate care and offering access to the most advanced available therapeutics. Precise Diagnostics and Individualized Treatment The accuracy of a diagnosis can be a critical indicator of a patient's treatment experience and outcomes. As part of our mission to deliver the best possible individualized care to our patients, our world-class hematopathologists provide collective assessment of all individual cases, working to secure an accurate diagnosis before determining the appropriate therapy. We then work together with patients and their families to determine the optimal regimen for each individual's unique needs and lifestyle. World-Class Medical Care Comprehensive treatment of lymphoma can require the input of other medial sub-specialties, such as cardiology, pulmonary medicine, dermatology and more. Individuals treated within the AYA Lymphoma Program have access to the world-class supplementary care available throughout Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Clinical and Translational Research Our robust clinical trial portfolio grants our patients access to novel, practice-changing therapies often not available elsewhere and can help uncover innovative ways to manage and/or prevent potential long-term complications of treatment. Our research focus on age-specific issues like fertility and post-treatment survivorship helps us to improve the understanding and care of lymphoma and make a positive impact on the lives of AYA patients at our institution and beyond. Transplantation Bone marrow and stem cell transplantation can be a life-saving option for people with blood cancers such as lymphoma. The variety of procedures available within our internationally recognized transplant program - including haplo-cord transplantation and CAR T-cell therapy - allows us to serve a diverse group of patients inclusive of those unable to secure an adequate donor. Fertility Preservation Some cancer treatments can impact future fertility. Our team collaborates closely with experts at Weill Cornell Medicine's world-renowned Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine, who are leading the field in fertility preservation for people with cancer and can facilitate a range of reproductive medicine options available to both male and female patients. Additionally, our expertise in high-risk obstetrics enables us to provide the best possible care to young women who are diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy. Insurance and Financial Services Most of our physicians accept major forms of medical insurance. Once one of our physicians outlines a treatment plan, our account administrators can help with any insurance and financial issues, such as verifying insurance coverage, obtaining authorizations, planning for out-of-pocket expenses and setting up a payment plan, if needed. We also provide financial guidance for this age range that tends to be under- or uninsured after transitioning from parental coverage. Social Work Our dedicated AYA social worker is available to help patients address the unique social and emotional needs that can accompany being diagnosed with cancer at a young age, such as navigating friendships and romantic relationships during and after treatment. Art Therapy Our trained art therapist works with our AYA patients during and after treatment to provide a unique outlet for creativity and emotional support. Integrative Medicine We offer complementary integrative therapies to help patients mange the symptoms of cancer and its treatment, including guided imagery, therapeutic touch, progressive relaxation, aromatherapy, acupuncture, massage, meditation and yoga. Consultations with a registered dietitian are available for guidance regarding nutritional issues during treatment and beyond. Survivorship Program At completion of treatment, patients are transitioned to our survivorship program, which provides management of potential late side effects and focuses on moving forward with optimal quality of life beyond treatment. Hospital Guest Facility [The Guest Facility at the Helmsley Medical Tower](http://www.nypguestfacility.com/) is located next-door to Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. This location makes the Guest Facility at the Helmsley Medical Tower ideal accommodations for patients and their families scheduled for early-morning medical tests or hospital visits, or those in need of follow-up attention. The facility is also an answer for people who live out of town and require extended care, or those who want around-the-clock proximity to a hospitalized loved one. Second Opinions Patients outside of the Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital AYA Lymphoma Program are welcome to visit us for a second opinion on diagnosis and treatment. For patients unable to stay in New York City throughout treatment, we can provide detailed consultation and collaborative care in partnership with a patient's primary oncologist close to home. "}
