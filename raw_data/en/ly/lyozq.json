[Manage stress](/health/stress/manage-stress/) A sprain is an injury to the ligaments keeping a joint together A sprain occurs when one or more ligaments in a joint are injured. This damage takes the form of over-stretching or, if more severe, tearing of small fibres in the ligament. In severe injuries, ligaments can be completely ruptured - in which case, it is no longer described as mundanely as a sprain! Sprains can occur in any joint in the body but the most common joint affected is the ankle, followed by sprains to the wrist. Injury to joints can also damage surrounding muscles (known as a [muscle strain](/health/muscles-joints/muscle-strain/)) and it is for this reason that the terms sprains and strains are sometimes used together. A sprain occurs when a joint bends more than it is designed to do as a result of excessive force. This extra movement stretches the ligaments to their limit, causing damage by either over-stretching or tearing the internal structure of the ligaments Some people are more prone to developing injuries to their joints for a variety of reasons - all of which give rise to a weak joint: Typical symptoms of sprains in any part of the body are: Severe swelling, or abnormal movement of the joint together with deformity of the injured area may indicate that the injury is severe, and not merely a sprain. If you notice these symptoms or if you have severe uncontrolled pain, seek medical help immediately. Sprains are best treated as soon as possible after the injury. Immediate action can reduce pain and other symptoms as well as help recovery. A packet of frozen peas can be used as a cold compress if nothing else is available. Continuing this treatment for 48 hours after injury can help recovery. Pain-killers (either taken by mouth or in the form of creams or gels) can be used to control pain and inflammation. Some herbal remedies can provide pain relief following joint sprains - both in the acute and recovery phases. It can also help resolve [bruising](/health/muscles-joints/bruising/) which is common with such injuries. Stress impacts your concentration, your sleep, immune system and digestion.
