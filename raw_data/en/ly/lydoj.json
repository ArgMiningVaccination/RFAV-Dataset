This is not that far away. Probably fewer than 30 genes in/out, maybe fewer than 20 Also, there are efforts to modify pigs to be models of human pathogen response And it turns out that pigs are surprisingly good lab animals especially compared to chimps, keep them fed and scratch behind the ears every so often and they seem happy. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31074044/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31074044/) Background: Differences in quality and strength of immune responses between individuals are mainly due to polymorphisms in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Focusing on MHC class-II, we asked whether the intensity of human anti-pig T-cell responses is influenced by genetic variability in the human HLA-DRB1 and/or the porcine SLA-DRB1 locus....... Results: Concerning the MHC class-II configuration of cells, we found a significant overrepresentation of HLA-DRB1*01 alleles in the medium/strong responder group as compared to individuals showing weak responses to stimulation with L23 cells. Evaluation of the role of MHC class-II variability in porcine stimulators revealed that cells expressing SLA-DRB1*06 alleles triggered strong proliferation in approximately 70% of humans. Comparison of amino acid sequences indicated that strong human anti-pig reactivity may be associated with a high rate of similarity between human and pig HLA/SLA-DRB1 alleles. Conclusion: Variability in human and porcine MHC intensity of individual human anti-pig T-cell responses. MHC typing and cross-matching of prospective recipients of xenografts and donor pigs could be relevant to select for donor-recipient combinations with minimal anti-porcine immunity. there is a lot going on in this area, some of it not getting published until patented Importance of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (Swine Leukocyte Antigen) in Swine Health and Biomedical Research [https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/1 ... 518-115014](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-animal-020518-115014) In pigs, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), or swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) complex, maps to Sus scrofa chromosome 7. It consists of three regions, the class I and class III regions mapping to 7p1.1 and the class II region mapping to 7q1.1. The swine MHC is divided by the centromere, which is unique among mammals studied to date. The SLA complexspans between 2.4 and 2.7 Mb, depending on haplotype, and encodes approximately 150 loci, with at least 120 genes predicted to be functional. Here we update the whole SLA complex based on the Sscrofa11.1 build and annotate the organization for all recognized SLA genes and their allelic sequences. We present SLA nomenclature and typing methods and discuss the expression of SLA proteins, as well as their role in antigen presentation and immune, disease, and vaccine responses. Finally, we explore the role of SLA genes in transplantation and xenotransplantation and their importance in swine biomedical models. "}
