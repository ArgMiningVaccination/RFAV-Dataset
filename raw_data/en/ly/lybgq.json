Growth & development, healing & immune system response, heart health, emotions, behaviors, & MORE, are all dependent upon clear nervous system communication to EVERY body cell. Whether or not you're currently struggling with a health challenge, Chiropractic care helps your brain & body communicate clearly so you & your family can heal, function, & grow at your best! Chiropractic is the art, science & philosophy of detecting and correcting vertebral subluxation, allowing the nervous system to function optimally for physical, emotional & spiritual healing, regulation & growth of the body. A subluxation is a spinal misalignment causing interference in essential nervous system communication between your brain & body. Subluxations are created by everyday chemical, physical & emotional stresses that are not only present now, but may have happened in the past, like old injuries, emotional upset, even childbirth! Chiropractors adjust subluxations to improve nervous system function & health potential in people of all ages. Chiropractic care is a natural health discipline that focuses on the care of your spine and nervous system to improve your overall function, growth and healing. Chiropractic care doesn't \"cure\" anything - not even back or neck pain - but when your nervous system and spine function better, without imbalance and stress, your body naturally feels better. Feeling better is just one small benefit of regular adjustments. Yes, many people have recovered from illnesses, injuries, and even pain under chiropractic care, but regular chiropractic care as part of a healthy lifestyle allows your body to adapt better to the everyday stresses put upon it, before a crisis of illness or injury interferes with your quality of life. \"Being healthy\" is very different from \"just not being sick\", and health has a LOT more to do with how your body functions, than how your body feels. For example, many devastating disease processes can go on for years without a single symptom (i.e. heart disease, cancer) and yet a person seems \"healthy\" because they \"feel good\". Conversely, symptoms such as fever or vomiting, certainly don't \"feel good\", but are a part of your \"healthy\" body's natural defenses to fight infection or eliminate a toxin. Adapting to stresses (chemical, physical and emotional) before they become crises is the true realization of health and wellness. Regular chiropractic care helps your body better adapt to stress by balancing the spine and nervous system for improved function, growth and healing, regardless of your age, or current health situation.
