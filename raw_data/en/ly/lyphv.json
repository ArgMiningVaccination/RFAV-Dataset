Byrne to discuss some of the challenges the department would be facing in the coming years. Mr .

CONVENED: Chairman V anOrden called the meeting of the Senate Health and W elfare Committee (Committee) to order at 3:06 p.m. RS 30001 Relating to Health. Senator Bjerke presented RS 30001 to the Committee, stating in his research, Idaho Code Chapter 98, T itle 39, outlines in particular situations, an essential caregiver should be someone who could visit an individual in the hospital, as someone designated to assist you in your health care. He noted this legislation seeks to amend Idaho Code T itle 39, by adding a new chapter that provides for a patient's right to visitation giving Idaho families the fundamental right to visit their loved ones receiving care in a health care facility . He further stated the was no provision that spelled out this type of visitation. Senator Bjerke continued, in amending Idaho Code, T itle 39, would add a new Chapter 8 to define terms that: provide legislative intent to establish provisions regarding visitation policies and procedures at certain facilities provide a right to visitation for patients and residents and for facilities provide certain requirements in visitation policies and procedures to establish provisions regarding suspension of visitation provide for the submission of visitation policies and procedures to the Department of Health and W elfare provide for publication of visitation policies and procedures on certain websites provide for submission of certain complaints provide for a certain hot line provide authority to the Department of Health and W elfare in declaring and emergency , and provide an ef fective date. Senator Bjerke relayed it would expand visitation to assist the health care agent or one who had a durable power of attorney for health care decisions. An individual's vaccination or immunization status would not be taken into account to prevent disparate treatment, and allow four people at any one time for the visitation. It would also include provisions for the health care facility to suspend the rights to visitation if people don't follow the policy if needed. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send RS 30001 to print. V ice Chair Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion passed by voice vote . RS 29935 Relating to an Institutional Controls Program for the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex Superfund Facility . Jess Byrne, Director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), relayed that RS 29935 proposes a new statute to codify the existing institutional control program for the Bunker Hill Superfund Site contained in Idaho Code Chapter 68, T itle 39. The Bunker Hill Superfund Site (Site) has high concentrations of metal, mainly lead, arsenic, and cadmium as a result of historic mining activities conducted in the Silver V alley . The clean up actions over the last several decades at the Site were only a partial removal of contaminated soil. The top 12 inches of contaminated soil was removed and replaced with clean fill as a barrier over that underlying contamination. The Institutional Control Program (ICP) was established to ensure proper management of those clean barriers, and required to prevent recontamination. The ICP regulates certain activities and provides services at no cost to the public. The DEQ would delegate implementation of the ICP to the Panhandle Health District, who would continue to operate through a formal agreement, the costs right now were covered through a cooperative agreement with EP A and State dedicated funding. He further relayed this proposed legislation would move authority from the Panhandle Health District Rules into Idaho Statute, thereby resolving that uncertainty , and moving the Rule into Statute would remove outdated, duplicative and unnecessary language, combine some tax, and add definitions into the Statute for clarity . MOTION: Senator W introw moved to send RS 29935 to print. Senator Lee seconded the motion. Motion carried by voice vote . RS 29917C2 Relating to Environmental Quality . Jess Byrne , Director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), presented RS 29917C2 to the Committee. He stated this legislation would modify Idaho Code \u00a7 39-105, adding new subsection that allows DEQ to enter into voluntary funding agreements with public agencies, municipal corporations and private parties. The current language in Idaho Code \u00a7 39-105 allows the DEQ to enter into voluntary funding agreements, only in very specific instances with the involvement of a federal agency . This legislation would broaden authority to allow DEQ to accept funding on behalf of the State and enter into voluntary funding agreements without that federal nexus. When relating to participation in the initial or environmental planning process, federal agencies and mining companies want State participation in that process, and DEQ wanted to participate in that process. He further stated that if the federal government does not enter into a cost recovery agreement with the project proponent that included the State, the ability to participate is limited. Currently , the only options are to absorb the additional work where possible, or to request additional General Funds. The DEQ would add a third, voluntary option considered on a case by case basis, estimated at approximately $180,000 per year worth of work. Mr . Byrne continued, adding these voluntary agreements would still be subject to all of the normal appropriation requirements and processes.

Ms. Charron replied she would follow up with that information. Representative Mitchell asked about the time line of federal funds that came into the State to help of fset costs. Ms. Charron replied at this time, the ninety percent federal match would continue. Representative Redman inquired about of those currently under covered under Expansion would be determined by April 1st. Ms. Charron replied they would not know until they started the redetermination work. Representative Redman asked how many of that percentage would be determined ineligible and would it be about six months before those individuals were actually unenrolled. Ms. Charron replied at this time, they do not have a projection. Representative Redman asked if the unenrollment would be retroactive, or if it would be ef fective on the date found ineligible. Ms. Charron replied it would be from the date the individual was found ineligible going forward. Senator W introw inquired about decreasing the amount of general funds that are put toward the program Ms. Charron replied there was a decrease in the amount of State General Funds needed. Representative Blanksma asked about ef forts the Department was making to recover funds of individuals rolling of f. Ms. Charron replied due to the continuous enrollment provision of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, those funds cannot be clawed back. Representative Blanksma asked if ef fort would be made to recover of those costs. Ms. Charron replied those funds cannot be recovered, as continuous enrollment was mandated through the Public Health Emergency . Representative Blanksma requested an update on the waivers included in the 2022 Legislation. Ms. Charron explained the 1 1 15 waiver was approved and implemented, and there would be no action taken on the remaining waivers. Representative Healey inquired about any dif ficulty getting Medicaid patients access to preventive care. Ms. Charron replied she believed there was a statute that required Medicaid participants be connected with a primary care provider upon enrollment. Representative Healey inquired about gap analysis when individuals went to the ER, and if they were of fered preventative care appointments with their primary care providers. Ms. Charron replied she does not have an analysis available. Representative Rubel asked about impact analysis on the stability of rural hospitals if the Medicaid Expansion were to terminate. Ms. Charron replied they had not completed that analysis. Representative Gallagher inquired how much of the $527 million was spent on the Medicaid Expansion population in the 2022 fiscal year . Ms. Charron stated she would get an exact breakdown. Representative Gallagher asked what steps are in the prevention of diabetes care. Ms. Charron replied they want an individual to have a physician to connect with for those preventative screenings to get them on any necessary medications for diabetes or make lifestyle changes to avoid them needing medication in the future. Senator Bjerke asked about optional programs under Medicaid Expansion that could be removed to control costs, and what those thresholds were for getting on the exchanges versus Medicaid or the Expanded Medicaid. Ms. Charron replied the cost containment review from the Division of Financial Management (DFM) had a number of recommendations. Senator Bjerke asked what determined who would be on the exchanges versus Medicaid, and what was the benefit of those two options. Ms. Charron replied a tax credit was given to reduce the cost of purchasing a plan through the state based marketplace. Representative Wheeler asked what percentage of primary care providers are medical professionals. Ms. Charron replied she would follow up with a breakdown of provider types. Representative Wheeler asked what the biggest challenge was in connecting patients to primary care providers, and if telehealth played a role. Ms. Charron replied that Medicaid of fered non-emergency medical transportation to get to a provider visit, and telehealth does support access to services and has been a great commodity to used in more rural areas. Representative Erikson asked about the correlation between us and other states on the number of people that are disabled and enrolled in Medicaid versus the non-disabled. Ms. Charron stated in comparison to Utah's Medicaid population, she believed they have around 130,000 expansion participants and their budget was just over a billion. Senator Zuiderveld inquired about the amount of money recovered by Medicaid through home liens, and if transition hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgeries were available under the Medicaid program.

Ms. Charron replied DFM would like to give a presentation to both committees within the next two weeks. Representative Redman asked how Idaho Medicaid benefits work in comparison to other states. Ms. Charron replied every state is a bit dif ferent in terms of what they provide. One expanded benefit Idaho had was adult dental, one of the recommendations in the DFM cost containment report. Representative Healey inquired about access to dental care, and where the cost breakdown would be included in primary care. Ms. Charron stated she would get back to him on the exact spent on dental, as it was outside of primary care. Representative Mitchell asked what was projected for this program and how much that has changed comparatively on a year to year basis. Ms. Charron stated she would follow up with those exact numbers. Senator Bjerke asked if trips to the ER had been lessened in a positive way , and was that ef fect detrimental with doctors in deciding to keep individuals who left their traditional insurance and are now under Expanded. Ms. Charron replied she does not have information before the Medicaid Expansion to distinguish what was seen over time. Representative Gallagher asked what Medicare dollars were used for advertising of Medicaid Programs. Ms. Charron replied no, other than general information on the Department's website. Representative Gallagher asked if there were preventative measures for overall health on the website. Ms. Charron replied that information was of fered for participants or potential participants on their website about prevention and healthy lifestyle. Representative Erickson asked if the $10 million dif ference in cost savings included bad debts, Indigent Care Service and others that were taken away as a result. Ms. Charron stated it did not include the exact impacts to hospitals, but did include funds if we were to re-establish the Catastrophic Fund and the Indigent Fund. Chairman V ander W oude asked when redetermining individuals for Medicaid Expanded coverage, and the individual does not respond, how long before they were removed from Medicaid Expansion, and if they do not respond at all, what is that time frame for removal, and are there federal regulations on that. Mr . Shane Leach, Department of health and W elfare, stated beginning February 1, 2022, notices were sent out. Individuals had 60 days to respond. If no response, it will close on the ef fective date after 60 days. Chairman V ander W oude asked for clarification, if that individual would be removed on April 1, 2022 if they did not respond. Mr . Leach replied that was correct. Chairman V ander W oude asked if a certain percentage of notices were sent in the beginning of February . Mr . Leach explained notices were divided up over six dif ferent groups, based on staf f capacity , as the first group would be about 30,000 individuals who were sent notices. Chairman V ander W oude asked why the dollar amount was still over one billion dollars in the SFY 24 request if 60,000 individuals were to become unenrolled from the Medicaid Expansion Program. (see attachment 1). Ms. Charron explained in the SFY 24 request, there was a reduction in the General Fund, but an increase in the federal and dedicated fund. The federal and dedicated fund are supporting the upper payment limit to hospitals. The supplemental payment to hospitals was the dif ference between what Medicaid paid and what Medicare would have paid.

CONVENED: Chairman V anOrden called the meeting of the Senate Health and W elfare Committee (Committee) to order at 3:00 p.m. DISCUSSION: Continuation of Medicaid Expansion. Chairman V anOrden explained today's discussion was from the Medicaid Expansion presentation held on January 23, 2023, before both the Senate and House Health and W elfare Committees. She directed the Committee, pursuant House and Joint Rule 20 (G)(H), there would be no public testimony during the meeting. She further stated any questions the Committee had must be directed only to the Director of Health and W elfare, his staf f, or another Committee member . Chairman V anOrden directed the Committee's attention to a print out inside their folders. She referred them to Idaho Code \u00a7 56-267(7), that established Medicaid Expansion (Expansion). She further stated she would consult with Chairman V ander W oude from the House of Representatives to decide how they would proceed in notifying the House and the Senate of their recommendations on this matter . (see Attachment 1) Dave Jeppesen , Director , Department of Health and W elfare (Department), informed the Committee that he and his staf f were there to answer questions the Committee had regarding Medicaid Expansion. Senator W introw called on Ross Edmunds, Administrator for the Division of Behavioral Health, for clarification about the serious impacts of mental and behavioral health in Idaho. She asked about the impact of mental and behavioral health services for the 20 percent that did not have an earned income, unlike the other 80 percent. Mr . Edmunds replied under Expansion, individuals could be of fered medication and case management in crisis issues. Individuals with serious mental illness and addiction could get full access to benefits. Senator Lee asked about the enrollment redetermination process looked like for the Expansion, and what kind of assistance was needed to expedite that process. Shane Leach , Medicaid Eligibility Division, stated there were currently 150,000 individuals the Department had not heard from during the Public Health Emergency . These individuals would be found ineligible on April 1, 2023, if they did not respond to complete the renewal process. He continued, stating the Department would send out 30,000 notices per month to these individuals over the next 6 months, beginning February 1, 2023. Senator Bjerke asked out of the 150,000 individuals, how many were part of the Expansion. Mr . Leach replied approximately 67,000. Senator Harris asked about the approved waivers the Department had received from Medicaid. Ms. Charron, Division of Medicaid, replied only the 1 1 15 waiver was granted. Senator Bjerke inquired if the Expansion program was viable moving forward, and if it was the best thing for Idaho and Idaho citizens. Director Jeppesen replied the Department's role as an agency was to present facts, information, the perspective of how programs run, and to carry out the direction that the policy makers set out. He further stated it was the Department's job to make sure that Expansion was sustainable and financially viable as possible. Chairman V anOrden asked what would the impacts be if Expansion were not in place. Director Jeppesen replied a number of things were paid for out of the State General Fund for services provided to Idaho citizens. With the Expansion, there were reductions in agency budgets, as those expenses were on the sheets. (see Attachment 2). He further stated if Expansion were not in place, the assumption was the State would go back to paying for those services. The Catastrophic Fund and the Indigent Funds had both been closed, as they were covered under the Expansion.

He stated the dif ferences between the Health District Rule and the Statute was through consolidation activities that removed duplicative, outdated or unnecessary language.

DOCKET NO. 16-0414-2201 Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) (ZBR Chapter Rewrite) - Proposed Rule. Lisa Johnson, introduced herself to the Committee. She stated the revision of the proposed chapter do not change eligibility requirements for families. She explained the revisions made the rolling language clearer , remove regulatory burden, and have provided the Department the opportunity to ensure the language was in line with program requirements. DOCKET NO. 16-0612-2201 Idaho Child Care Program (ICCP) - Proposed Rule. Aubrie Hunt, Child Care Program Manager , Department of Health and W elfare, stated the pending changes to this Chapter focus on two categories; eligibility for families and requirements for child care providers as the income for eligible families would raise to 175 percent of the federal poverty limit for program participants. DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked about child care standards. Ms. Hunt replied that Federal requirements mandated Idaho had a policy in place to prevent child abuse and maltreatment in care. Senator Bjerke asked where the funding source for the child care program came from. Ms. Hunt replied the child care subsidy program in Idaho was exclusively funded through the federal Child Care and Development BLOCK grant and some State matched dollars. 16-0504-2101 Domestic V iolence Counsel Grants (ZBR Chapter Rewrite) - Proposed Rule. Heather Cunningham, Domestic V iolence Council Director , explained the current rules were outdated and don't account for the need and demand for victim services. The pending rule changes allow the council to distribute the funds where needed. She further stated they had simplified and streamlined the rules, reduced restrictive words by 80 percent and reduced the word count by 37 percent. They also received 1 1 letters of support which highlighted the need for the changes. (see Attachment 1). Chairman V anOrden asked what the changes to the rule were. Ms. Cunningham stated instead of taking population and square miles into account to distribute the funds, 5 percent of the award would go to each of the seven public health district regions, 5 percent would go to statewide programs, and the remaining 60 percent would be distributed at the discretion of the Council. She further stated the largest federal funding stream was from the V ictims of Crime Act (VOCA), and the State Domestic V iolence Fund, a dedicated fund that came from the Marriage and Divorce Licenses Act. Other substantive changes made would allow for electronic publication of the grant opportunities, including a required rubric for scoring the application when publishing the grant opportunity . Chairman V anOrden asked if there would be a statute change to deal with the connection to marriage licenses in the county , and what the process was currently . Ms. Cunningham stated there was an agency bill with Representative Erickson in the House. Senator W introw asked if the letters of support would be provided, and if the council itself was making the rubric decisions. Ms. Cunningham replied the process is set forth in our rules that two council members score each application. They cannot score their own region and two staf f members score; the grant manager and one other person, either herself or the grant supervisor . Ms. Cunningham of fered to distribute the letters of support. P ASSED THE GA VEL: V ice Chairman Zuiderveld passed the gavel to Chairman V anOrden.

CONVENED: Chairman V anOrden called the meeting of the Senate Health and W elfare Committee (Committee) meeting to order at 3:03 p.m. INTRODUCTION: Chariman V anOrden called Liz W oodruf f, Executive Director , Idaho Academy of Family Physicians to introduce the visiting physicians to the Committee. Ms. W oodruff called attention to the physicians in the audience who had completed medical school and were in their second year of training at Full Circle Health in Boise. S 1005 IMMUNIZA TIONS - Amends existing law to require that daycare facilities provide citation to the immunization exemption law in communications with parents. Senator Herndon explained this bill seeks to amend Idaho Code \u00a739-1 1 18, which would require city and county licensing for child care facilities to meet the same requirements as the State. He stated S 1005 copies the language from H 298 (2021), which requires full disclosure to parents regarding vaccine exemption in schools. Senator Herndon stated he would like the same requirements in child care facilities regarding that disclosure. DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked about the dif ference between private companies and public schools and compliance with those dif ferences. Senator Herndon responded that Health and W elfare regularly communicated with the child care facilities, as they were the ones who issued rules to those facilities. Senator Lee asked if the form that was currently used in schools was suf ficient notification. Senator Herndon agreed it was. Senator T aylor asked if Health and W elfare would be responsible for dispersing the vaccine exemption information to the child care facilities. Senator Herdon replied the child care facility would be responsible for the dispersion. TESTIMONY : The following registered to testify in support of S 1005. Sarah Clendenon and Carol Andrews. Ms. Clendenon provided information with Health Freedom Idaho to support the bill, as their intent was to educate, not penalize the facilities. Ms. Andrews was not present. MOTION: Senator Bjerke moved to send S 1005 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. V ice Chairman Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . DOCKET NO. 16-0506-2201 Relating to criminal history and background checks. Fernando Castro, Criminal History Unit, Division of Management Services, Department of Health and W elfare (Department) explained the pending rule provided clarity about the Department background check processes to agencies and employers for relocating all compliance expectation items to a centralized location within the rule. He stated portions of the rule were removed, updated references to statutory requirement, and reduced applicant and provider costs by removing the notary requirement. Also, enabled the use of certain Idaho records for background checks if obtained in the previous six months, and updated the list of disqualifying crimes. T wo virtual negotiated rule making meetings were held in April 2022, 67 participants gave their feedback. They received even more feedback in writing after the meetings were held. DISCUSSION: Senator T aylor asked why the Department was retaining records for six years now instead of five. Mr . Castro replied a six year retention period was more adequate to get accurate records for applicants and providers. Senator Bjerke asked if the result of the negotiated rule making process was positive or negative. Mr . Castro replied it was positive. Senator Lee asked if the changes were in response to any suggestion from the FBI. Mr . Castro replied there was a request from the FBI to have a more specific list of individuals that need a background check. MOTION: Chairman V anOrden moved to approve Docket 16-0506-2201 . It was seconded by Senator Lee . The motion passed by voice vote . DOCKET NO. 16-0733-2201 Relating to adult mental health services; T rina Clark, Division of Behavioral Health, highlighted the proposed changes in the Docket. Ms. Clark stated this rule review was timely and coincided with the Health and W elfare ef forts to integrate Medicaid funded services into one behavioral health system of care for Idahoans. The proposed changes would significantly decrease the regulatory burden for providers. DISCUSSION: Senator Bjerke asked how they would decrease the regulatory burden regarding providers. Ms. Clark replied with the rule change, those regulations would not apply to the community providers. Senator Lee asked how the notice of appeal has changed. Ms. Clark replied we have clarified that for the administrating contractor . MOTION: Senator T aylor moved to approve Docket No. 16-0733-2201. Senator Lee seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote .

Senator Grow explained the Legislation would allow Idaho Optometrists the ability to safely use three in-of fice therapeutic laser procedures to treat Idahoans. MOTION: V ice-chairman Zuiderveld moved to send RS 30208 to print. Senator Bjerke seconded the motion. The motion was carried by voice vote . PRESENT A TION: Relating to the Medicaid Cost Containment Interim Report. Michael Heifetz, Director , Sellers Dorsey explained they responded to a Request for Report (RFP) from the State to conduct a review of the Idaho Medicaid Program. The first report was a short term review for cost savings and/or revenue maximization strategies for the Medicaid program. The second report would be about potential changes and strategies in the medicaid program, and is due in April 2023. The presentation graphs outline Medicaid spending by categories and funding sources (see Attachment 1). DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked how the information was obtained on what was unique to Idaho. Director Heifetz replied Idaho's geography makes it dif ferent from most states due to it's many rural areas. The size of the Medicaid program does matter in any state, as it is part of the dynamics that go along with budgeting Medicaid issues. Senator Lee asked why the report did not look at pharmacy spending. Director Heifetz replied there were no recommendations at this time, as this was a larger issue that was not contained in the short term report. Senator Bjerke asked if the 65.7 million dollars in savings shown in the chart recommendations was the same amount presently spent out of the General Fund, and what were some of the pros and cons between managed care and fee for service for someone who does this type of consulting work. Director Heifetz replied the 65.7 million dollars was a General Fund reduction. In relation to managed care and advantages, It's not just a perspective of the firm necessarily , as managed care largely of f-loads the budget risk. A managed care entity still must be paid. Senator Bjerke asked if statistically , across the nation, if more states lead in managed care or fee for service. Director Heifetz replied many states have managed care, and each state varies, as managed care still must be overseen. Senator W introw inquired if Director Heifetz reviewed the Of fice Performance Evaluation (OPE) report, and if it helped him form the presentation. Director Heifetz replied it did, yet this report was only a 90 day look at the Medicaid Program. Chairman V anOrden asked what Idaho's assessment tax was at this time. Director Heifetz replied his understanding was that Idaho did not have such an assessment. Senator Lee asked Juliet Charron, Medicaid Administrator , what could be done to ensure the fidelity of the Medicaid Program. Ms. Charron replied the administrative component to running the program was lean, as they were looking forward to the final Sellers Dorsey report in April to give them a road map of cost containment in the long term, and look at staf fing going forward with that model. Senator Lee inquired if there was information to show when Idaho removed the adult dental program, and what those additional costs were when it was removed. Ms. Charron replied she would follow up with that information, as she believed the adult dental benefit was removed from the Program, then reinstated. Senator W introw asked if there was an estimate on what the savings would be after the eligibility removal process. Ms. Charron replied they have done their best to predict what the following year would look like, however they would not know at this point. Senator W introw asked how many were in Medicaid Expansion population, and if there were recommendations regarding home and community based services. Ms. Charron replied the Expansion populations was not as large when compared to the tradition Medicaid population, and there was more review to be done around the home and community based services recommendations. ADJOURNED: There being no further business at that time, Chairman V anOrden adjourned the meeting at 4:06 p.m. ___________________________ ___________________________ Senator V anOrden Michelle T ierney Chair Secretary SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , February 06, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 State of Idaho, Division of Purchasing Medicaid Cost Containment INTERIM REPORT CONTACT: Michael Heifetz Director 1635 Market Street Suite 301 Email: MHeifetz@sellersdorsey.com DECEMBER 2022 December 2022 Contents sellersdorsey.com Page | 3 Executive Summary Sellers Dorsey, in collaboration with the State of Idaho's Executive Office of the Governor's Division of Financial Management (DFM) and Department of Health and Welfare's (IDHW) Division of Medicaid, is undertaking an in- depth review of the State's Medica id program. This comprehensive project is specifically designed to address concerns regarding substantial increases in General Fund spending necessary to maintain the Medicaid program by providing recommendations for cost containment, revenue maximization , cost avoidance, and key investments. This interim report contains items that can be implemented in the short term, meaning within one -year or less, in relation to some of the Medicaid -specific programmatic areas agreed upon by DFM, IDHW and Sellers Do rsey listed in the table below, and which broadly align with the State of Idaho budget documents. In some programmatic areas, the Discovery Sessions identified potential longer -term recommendations. These will be included in the April 2023 Final Report, a nd such areas are not included in this Interim Report. Notably, further transitions from fee -for-service (FFS) to managed care fall in this longer -term category. Therefore, no assumptions are made or included regarding additional resources and programm atic changes necessary for such transitions. The target amount of savings and/or revenue maximization for this project equals five percent of the General Fund expenditures, per the Request for Proposals (RFP). This corresponds to $41.5 million of General Fund expenditures. The FMAP percentage for the purpose of calculating the State share of expenditures and General Fund savings is 24.5139%. This was provided by IDHW staff and represents the State share inclusive of the extra 6.2% in federal share per the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act signed into law in March 2020. Below is a brief Summary Table of Recommendations and Annual Savings, assuming effective dates of 7/01/23, the start of the new State Fiscal Year (SFY): December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 4 Summary Table of Recommendations and Savings: Recommendation Annual Savings Value -Based Care - PCCM Reform (6.7m) Hospital - Inpatient Rates (6.0m) Hospital - Outpatient Rates (8.7m) Hospital - SCAs Reform (2.1m) NEMT - PMPM Reductions (1.2m) Transportation - Rate Reform (0.5m) School Based Services - Federal Withhold (3.1m) DD/IDD - \"Pass -through\" payments (0.05m) DD/IDD Review (7.2m) LTSS - Provider Assessment (2.4m) Dental - Eliminate Adult Benefit (5.8m) Program Integrity - External Recovery Audit Contractor (0.2m) Program Integrity - Enhanced Program Integrity (0.6m) Professional Services - 7.5% Rate Reduction (21m) Total Savings: (65.7m) Process The Sellers Dorsey Project Team began the project with a comprehensive environmental scan of the Idaho Medicaid program. As part of the environmental scan, the team reviewed publicly available state budget documents, reports, and Waivers. An initial list of additional data requests was developed and discussed at the initial kick -off meeting on September 19, 2022, and further refined after that discussion and shared with IDHW. Upon completion of the kick -off, the Sellers Dorsey project team collaborated w ith identified Idaho Medicaid Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to conduct a series of Discovery Sessions. Topic specific questions were developed by each Sellers Dorsey SME and shared with the identified IDHW SME prior to each discovery session Each session was scheduled for sixty minutes and covered a wide range of topics and issues specific to each topic area. Additional data needs were identified during these calls and IDHW worked with the Sellers Dorsey project team to ensure follow -up materials were share d. The Sellers Dorsey Project Team then used the information gleaned during the discovery sessions, requested data, and follow -up questions to identify potential recommendations, with an initial focus on short -term items. December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 5 \"SMART\" Rubric The full budget scorecard (found in Appendix A) contains various elements for consideration and is structured to prioritize the individual recommendations by \"difficulty of implementation\" (\"least difficult\" are listed first, followed by \"medium\"). However, the scorecar d could be reconfigured to illustrate different rubrics. The recommendations in this Interim Report each meet the five criteria below: Specific - Each item is a distinct action related to a single programmatic area. This means each recommendation can b e selected in isolation, independent of other initiatives (no \"waterfall\"). Measurable - Each item has a specific dollar amount. Certain initiatives that did not meet this standard have been excluded, although they may be included in the final April 20 23 report. Achievable - Each item can be achieved while recognizing key factors, such as: difficulty of implementation, speed to dollars, implementation action requirements, and stakeholder engagement Relevant - Each item is related to one of the core a reas for evaluation as agreed upon between Sellers Dorsey and the State. Time -Bound - Each item must have a realistic 12 -month timeframe. Items that fall outside of that timeframe may be included in the final report. Limitations The information and recommendations included in this interim report are based on information and data from the State of Idaho, both publicly available resources and more customized information and data derived from the State's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), and other State of Idaho and publicly available resources. Therefore, the ana lyses and recommendations may be impacted by any limitations, gaps, or errors in such information. The recommendations and initiatives suggested in this interim report may be implemented at the discretion of the State of Idaho pursuant to executive branch authority, legislative requirements, statutory authority, and federal laws, regulations, and guidelines. The success and timing of operational components are subject to any limitations within the Idaho Medicaid program, including contractual processes, procurement processes, vendor engagement, and/or external resources necessary for implementation. Estimates of potential savings and revenue maximization included in this interim report are based on data available during the period beginning with the kick off meeting. While there has been consistent follow -up and dialogue with staff, some elements may not have been included due to the brief timeline of this interim report. Factors to Consider Administrative Capacity Although Medicaid administration st aff are dedicated and performing at high levels, an overarching theme across each discovery session was limited administrative capacity. The teams in the DFW and the Division of Medicaid are lean, which presents mult iple risks such as staff burnout and tu rnover, overdependence on individual team members (limited backup capabilities when such staff is away from the office or changes jobs), and limited management and oversight of contracted vendors in various functio ns. Examples of such concerns include non emergency medical transportation (NEMT), pharmacy benefit management, and program integrity. Some of the recommendations modify current practices, adjust certain programs, and/or require greater oversight be performed by the staff to achieve savings, gene rate revenue, and ensure accountability of providers, vendors, December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 6 and other Medicaid stakeholders. As these recommendations are considered, operational and administrative capacity may need to be addressed. Additional detailed recommendations will be incl uded in the April 2023 long term recommendations report. Such recommendations are anticipated to include broader structural changes to the Medicaid program and may require additional resources and different capabilities than the current program. Public H ealth Emergency The public health emergency (PHE) was issued by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS) on January 31, 2020. States were required to keep beneficiaries enrolled for the duration of the PHE as a condition to receive an in creased Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) of 6.2 percentage points .1 As a condition of receiving the enhanced FMAP, all states have paused redeterminations during the PHE. Similarly, states have been planning for the end of the PHE and the redetermination process. Nationally, between 5.3 million to 14.2 million enrollees could lose coverage as a result of the redetermination proces s.2 In Idaho, this could translate to 80,000 enrollees. Pursuant to the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, the enhanced FMAP will be \"phased down\" on a quarterly basis over the course of calendar 2023. In addition, states may initiate redeterminations beginning on April 1, 2023. This legislation contains other provisions, and further guidance from DHHS is expected in the coming weeks. Pursuant to DFM direction and project scope, this report does not eva luate any potential changes in enrollment, utilization, expenditures, or policy considerations associated with the eventual formal end of the PHE , or the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 . Interim Recommendations The recommendations in this inte rim report are organized by Medicaid programmatic areas in the following format: Brief description of the programmatic area Recommendations for cost savings/revenue maximization Assumptions utilized to determine financial impact Benefits of each recom mendation Challenges of each recommendation Stakeholder Impact Each section of the report contains a table indicating the financial impact of each recommendation. As noted, the minimum amount of savings and/or new revenue generated by the recommendation s must total $41.5 million. The recommendations presented in this interim report total approximately $ 65 million. Value -Based Purchasing Initiatives Description: The Idaho Medicaid program has a long history of integrating value -based care, beginning in 1993 with the Primary Care Case Management Program (PCCM). The PCCM program was intended to reduce emergency department utilization, reduce duplication of services, and improve primary care access. The program has 1 Fiscal and Enrollment Implications of Medicaid Continuous Coverage Requirement During and After the PHE Ends | KFF 2 10 Things to Know About the Unwinding of the Medicaid Continuous Enrollment Requirement | KFF December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 7 undergone multiple structural changes and expansions, from the transition to the Patient Centered Medical Home (\"Idaho Medical Home Collaborative\"), to \"Value Care Organizations\" (VCO) Key Elements: While some data indicate reduced costs through these VBP initiatives, other data d oes not indicate broad success. Multiple iterations, sometimes because of legislation, suggest value -based care programs are being utilized as an alternative to standard rate increases for providers. There is a lack of comprehensive third -party evaluatio ns of the program providing a clear picture of successes and opportunities to improve these efforts. Idaho staff indicated that such programs are administratively challenging to oversee, including management of underperforming providers. The current PCC M program has considerable overlap and duplication of efforts with the newly created VCO program. Recommendations: Recommendation #1: Eliminate or suspend the PCCM program (25% state share) Assumptions: The savings were derived from reported SFY2022 prog ram expenditures. The multiple iterations of this program, relative lack of regular reporting and analytics, and new federal emphasis on quality and at -risk VBP suggest the program be revisited prior to continued investment. Benefits of Recommendation: The programs are challenging to administer and there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate the level of improvement. Eliminating the PCCM program allows a reset to improve upon past challenges and create a sustainable, long -term vision in collaboration with providers, members, and the Medicaid administration. Challenges of Recommendation: There has already been significant investment in this program by the State and providers. Stakeholder Impact: There is a potential for the provider community to consider this a reimbursement cut, and some may have made investments to achieve various goals of these programs. Summary Table of Value -Based Purchasing Recommendations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Administrative SFY 2024 SFY 20 25 PCCM Elimination 7/1/2023 Administrative Page | 8 Hospital Reimbursement Description: Inpatient hospital payments are mostly made through DRG. Until recently, Idaho used interim payments with settlement done in a future fiscal year. Starting in SFY2022, Idaho implemented a DRG rate -setting process with the first update and initial modeling in the second quarter of that year (10/1/22). State -owned hospitals, including five institut ions for Mental Disease (IMDs), critical access hospitals, and most out -of-state hospitals are excluded from the DRG payment system. Key Elements: Cost data from 2019 was used for the hospitals in the model as the budget target. In-state hospital payments were set at 100% of hospital costs. Out-of-state hospitals were set at 87% (per state statutes). For outpatient services, Idaho is moving to th e Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) prospective payment system. Medicaid payments to Idaho hospitals also includes payment for Graduate Medical Education (GME). Recommendations: Recommendation #1: Inpatient - Reduce in -state pay -to-cost ratio to 90% (or 95% for a reduced financial impact) Assumptions: The savings were derived from reported SFY2022 program expenditures. The estimate is based upon the newly implemented APR DRG reimbursement methodology and only reflects providers paid under the new approach. Further, the proposed reductions are for instate providers only as out of state providers already reflected a markedly lower pay -to-cost ratio (which aligns with other state Medicaid agency practices). Further, only claims and costs included in modeling were considered (i.e. claims excluded by the rate setting vendor were also excluded for cost containment estimation purposes). Benefits of Recommendation: Aligns cost coverage percentage more closely with other Medicaid programs and resets the ba se at a more sustainable level. However, the funding \"reduction\" should be restored through the hospital assessment methodology articulated in Regular Session 2022 Senate Bill 1350. Challenges of Recommendation: Because ra tes were frozen at 2019 levels ( even at 100% of cost), inflationary pressures have reduced the overall cost coverage over time. This has the potential to exacerbate that dynamic. Stakeholder Impact: Providers a re likely to interpret this as a significant reimbursement reduction and t he State reversing an assumed commitment to maintain 100% cost coverage. Recommendation #2: Outpatient - Reduce expenses by 10% (or 5% for reduced financial impact) Assumption: The savings were derived from reported SFY2022 program expenditures and includes both in and out of state providers. December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 9 Benefits of Recommendation: Aligns outpatient reimbursement more closely with other Medicaid programs and resets the base at a more susta inable level. Challenges of Recommendation: The state has embarked on a multi -year effort to transition to APCs. Any changes to existing payments or policies could be viewed as a disruption to the roadmap. Stakeholder Impact: Providers are likely to in terpret this as a significant reimbursement reduction. Recommendation #3: Reduce Single Case Agreement (SCA) Expenditures to 2019 (pre -pandemic) levels Assumptions: SCAs are tracked and administered outside of the MMIS system through relatively informal means. Available data indicates year -over -growth in SCA expenditures of approximately $2.1 million since 2017, an atypical trend. To fully understand this dynamic, a very thorough financial and clinical review of the individual cases would be required, s imilar to that which a managed care organization would undertake to manage such complex and costly services. Benefits of Recommendation: Address the increasing trend, and cost, of reliance on SCAs from out-of-state providers for various services. In addi tion, while some SCAs may be necessary in a given year, improved oversight of the process (and providers) likely reduces costs. 2019 is used as the benchmark to remove potential pandemic -related irregularities. Challenges of Recommendation: Staff indicat e there is very limited capacity to apply clinical and financial oversight of the SCAs. Therefore, instituting such processes may require additional resources (state staff and/or vendors). In addition, although a return to 2019 levels is reasonable, ther e is a degree of unpredictability in the need for rare clinical services. Stakeholder Impact: Members with very specialized clinical needs may face additional steps before being sent out -of-state for care. Out -of-state providers may resist clinical revie w and more aggressive financial negotiations. Summary Table of Hospital Reimbursement Recommendations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Administrative SFY 2024 SFY 2025 Inpatient Rates sellersdorsey.com Page | 10 Transportation Description: Idaho pays for and manages the Medicaid transportation benefit in two ways . Ambulance Services providers are paid on a fee -for-service basis. Non -Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) services are contracted with a brokerage vendor. Ambulance services are managed primarily by one DHW staff person. Approximately 80% of amb ulance providers are public/municipal and the other 20% are private. Senate Bill 1283, enacted earlier this year, authorizes a Certified Public Expenditure program for ground emergency medical transportation (GEMT) providers. This program will enhance the federal component of reimbursement for public ambulance service providers. As of the date of this report, this program has not yet been implemented. Key Elements: For FY22, total payments for ambulance services providers were approximately $9 million. For FY22, the total payments made to the NEMT vendor were just over $47 million. Ground ambulances provided nearly 22,000 transports in the last fiscal year at a cost of $7.8 million. There were 239 air ambulance transports at a total cost of about $1 million. Compared to other states, Idaho Medicaid pays relatively high rates for ambulance services. For FY22 total payments from DHW to MTM were $47.1 million. Total claims incurred were $25.9 million. This leads to an MLR of about 55%. Recommendatio ns: Recommendation #1: Reduce PMPM rates paid to vendor (to cover claims, admin, and 80% MLR) Assumption: The state should work with its actuaries to develop an actuarily sound, but lower, PMPM rate. Benefits of Recommendation: The State would save nearly $5 million total if it had been implemented in SFY2022. Challenges of Recommendation: These rate changes may cause a reduction in access to services . While a GEMT has been authorized by SB 1283 that would provide relief to public providers, a similar program for private providers has not been authorized. However, a similar mechanism could be created for private providers. Stakeholder Impact: NEMT vendors will likely oppose the rate changes . Recommendation #2: Reduce ambulance services rates to national average Assumption: While rates paid for ambulance services (basic life support, advanced life support, ground and air) are below Medicare, they are at the higher end of what state Medicaid ag encies pay for these services. Benefits of Recommendation: Reducing rates by 20% (to roughly the national Medicaid average , according to data provided by the American Ambulance Association ) would save approximately $2 million in total dollars and $500,000 in state funds. December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 11 Challenges of Recommendation: These rate changes may cause a reduction in access to services . While a GEMT has been authorized by SB 1283 that would provide relief to public providers, a similar program for private providers has not been authorized . However, a similar mechanism could be created for private providers . Stakeholder Impact: Providers will likely oppose the rate changes. Summary Table of Transportation Recommendations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Administrative SFY 2024 SFY 2025 PMPM Reductions Description: Idaho's School Based Services (SBS) program is a traditional FFS model where local education agencies (LEAs), or school districts, enroll as Medicaid providers and bill the State for services per the State's fee schedule. School -based practitioners submit claims under their LEAs' organizational national provider identifier (NPI) and are not required to enroll as Medicaid providers. The State do es not participate in the Medicaid Administrative Claiming program. The program has an MOU with the Idaho Department of Education that provides all SBS program training and facilitates the Medicaid enrollment process for schools. Key Elements: As of 2020, there were 220 total LEAs in Idaho and 126 participating in the SBS program. Idaho's SBS program is financed via intergovernmental transfer (IGT). LEAs provide the entire non -federal share claims, transferring roughly 30% of t heir anticipated SBS expenditures to the state which holds funds in account until claims are processed. Idaho does not participate in the federal Medicaid Administrative Claiming (MAC) program, which provides federal match to LEAs for administrative acti vities performed in service of the Medicaid program. A recent survey of LEAs by IDHW showed low levels of interest in implementing a MAC program. Recommendations: Recommendation #1: Implement an SBS claims withhold to cover state operating costs and/or program improvement expenses . Methodology: Assume 10% skim estimate from federal match excluding COVID dollars (10% of total federal match including COVID dollars for SBS for FY21 per the CMS -64 would be $3.1M). Benefits of Recommendation: This is a common mechanism through which State operating costs for SBS are covered with federal funds. There will likely be additional revenue beyond operating costs that could be used to assist the State and/or local school districts to maximize SBS through impro ved claims processes and other mechanisms. December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 12 Challenges of Recommendation: There may be accounting and administrative efforts required, in addition to current responsibilities. Stakeholder Impact: School districts are likely to oppose this reduction in funding for SBS , which may reduce access to services. This dynamic would differ by district, as the use of th ese funds varies . Summary Table of School Based Services Recommendations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Admi nistrative SFY 2024 SFY 2025 Federal Services Subtotal (3.1m) (3.1m) Developmental Disabilities Services Description: Idaho Medicaid provides intervention services through its State Plan, including Katie Beckett services for children. Supportive services, including respite, are offered under a 1915(i) waiver, and supportive employment services are offered under a 1915(c) waiver. One -half of the children receiving such services are under the state's Katie Beckett program, with the other half receiving intervention services under its State Plan. As is the case across the country, one of the prevailing structural/policy cha llenges is the tightening labor market for the direct care workers on whom the state's programs depend on adequately meeting each individual member's and families' needs. To help address these challenges the state has authorized funding aimed specifically at those workers employed by home and community -based services (HCBS) providers . These funds are expected to be \"passed through\" to the agencies employing the workers in the form of higher wages. Key Elements: 282 provider types are delivering all Med icaid services across programs. These providers fall within both Managed Care and FFS environments. In SFY17, the average weekly members served was 6,774, compared to 6,762 in SFY22. However, the expenditures for this relatively stable population increa sed by more than 50%, from $266M in SFY17 to $408M in SFY22. Intermediate Care Facilities are the only provider type serving members with intellectual and developmental disabilities that must submit updated annual cost reports that are also then audited b y Myers & Stauffer. A new priority in the cost reports audits is for Myers & Stauffer to ensure the annual $2 Million direct are worker pay rate enhancement \"passed through\" to the workforce as intended. Recommendations: Recommendation #1: Ensure the In termediate Care Facilities are complying with pass -through requirements intended to increase wages for direct care workers and recoup these dollars from noncompliant providers. In addition, consider excluding those who fail audit requirements from particip ating in future pass -through payment enhancement pools. December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 13 Assumptions: The current pool totals $2M, and this recommendation assumes 10% of total pool dollars would not be \"passed through\" to direct care workers. This may be a conservative estimate, as more aggressive compliance activities could be implemented. Benefits of Recommendation: Inappropriate payments should be curbed and addressed quickly and efficiently. Providers will see an increase in auditing and oversight from the federal level in the coming years. As the State enhances efforts to hold providers accountable, compliance is expected to increase accordingly. Ultimately, this will benefit the members being served and the State. Challenges of Recommendation: Additional resources are needed for support, either through a vendor or state staff. Additionally, exclu ding non -compliant providers may reduce provider capacity. Stakeholder Impact: There is a potential for stakeholders to resist recoupment of any reimbursement. Recommendation # 2: Standardize the rate review/rate setting process for all HCBS providers (not limited to the Intermediate Care Facilities) who are not required to have an audited cost report. Assumptions: Adding more rigor around the rate setting process for providers currently excluded from such measures is anticip ated to illustrate that rates in recent years grew at a rate that outpaced costs (and necessary overhead and margin) for these providers. The table below assumes a 7.5% reduction in costs as rates are \"rightsized\". Higher or lower estimates could alternat ively be applied, with the dollars adjusted accordingly. Finally, such efforts typically achieve greater savings in the first year. The table below shows reduced savings in the second year, as stakeholders adjust to new policies and procedures. Benef its of Recommendation: Annual submissions of such information for a formal cost -to-rate reconciliation will help ensure rates are not growing faster than provider costs and provide improved budget predictability. The quality withhold recommendation for pr oviders to submit this information timely and accurately to the state will help ensure both a comprehensive and timely rate review. In addition, this will bring new insight regarding potential modifications to the benefit structure while managing costs. Challenges of Recommendation: Additional resources are needed to operationally build and support this functionality, either through a vendor or state staff. Any potential rate reductions could cause reductions in access to certain services. Stakeholder Impact: Stakeholders will likely seek input into any modification to the rate setting process. Additionally, providers may interpret this recommendation as a mechanism to reduce reimbursement. Summary Table of Developmental Disabilities Services Recomme ndations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Administrative SFY 14 Standardize Rate Administrative (7.2m) (4.8m) Developmental Disabilities Services Subtotal (7.2m) (4.8m) Long Term Care/Nursing Facilities Description: Idaho Medicaid reimburses nursing facilities claims on a fee -for-service basis, using a per diem rate at the lower of the Medicaid allowed amount. For dual eligible individuals receiving services through Idaho's Medicaid Plus (IMPlus) or Idaho's Medicare -Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP) nursing facility services are provided through managed care. State law authorizes the Department to levy a nursing faciality assessment, not to exceed the maximum percentage per federal law. Nursing facilities were subjecte d to an assessment in 2020 and 2021. Key Elements: Idaho operates sixty -seven nursing facilities and contracts with facilities in Utah for specialized care and rural access. State and county owned, and operated facilities are exempt from this assess ment. Myers & Stauffer is currently researching potential changes to the SNF tax program, and this work may impact the savings associated with the recommendation noted below. This analysis may also clarify any statutory or administrative code changes necessary to implement this recommendation. Recommendations: Recommendation #1 : Increase Provider Assessment for Skilled Nursing Facilities to six percent. Assumptions: Increase the assessment to 6% tax on total revenue of nursing facilities only. The points below may b e impacted by the Meyers & Stauffer analysis referenced above . In addition, no assumption is made regarding utilizing an increased assessment to leverage federal resources towards a provider reimbursement in crease . Benefits of Recommendation: This is a standard mechanism used widely in Medicaid programs that quickly generates additional federal revenue to offset state general fund expenditures : 44 states have implemented such an assessment, at varying degrees up to the federal maximum of six percent. Six states are currently at the six percent ceiling: AR, CA, MI, NJ , NM, OK1. Challenges of Recommendation: This provider group no longer receives automatic reimbursement increases , as of July 1st, 2021 ; levying such an assessment may exacerbate access issues for certain services , depending on federal revenue ramifications . Stakeholder Impact: There is likely to be significant pushback from interested stakeholders. 1Kaiser Family Foundation Survey of Medicaid O fficials in 50 states and DC conducted by Health Management Associates, October 2017 December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 15 Summary Table of Long -Term Care Reco mmendations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Administrative SFY 2024 SFY 2025 Provider Assessment 7/1/2023 Legislative Care Subtotal (2.4m) (2.4m) Dental Description: Idaho Medicaid generally provides broad benefits for both children (covered under Medicaid or CHIP) and adult populations, although there is no minimum requirement for adult dental services under Medicaid. As in many states, Medicaid dental access is a co nsistent challenge. Key Elements: In FY20 there were $57 million (all funds) in dental expenditures. The adult dental benefit is technically discretionary spending. Program integrity efforts within the dental spend are limited. Recommendations: Recommendation #1 : Eliminate the adult dental benefit Assumptions: Calculation based on state -provided summary report by aide category and procedure code ranges for SFY2021. State specified aide codes are used to identify adult and expansion populations. Recommendations utilize either all adult -related aide codes or the adult expansion population subset Benefits of Recommendation: Cost reduction. This benefit is not require d. Challenges of Recommendation: Eliminating the adult dental benefit could lead to more utilization and expenses due to dental problems becoming more severe and requiring emergency department treatment or other provider services. Stakeholder Impact: Members and advocates will likely oppose this recommendation, due to the existing dental access challenge in some areas, and the potential clinical impacts noted above. Summary Table of Dental Recommendations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Administrative SFY 2024 SFY 2025 Eliminate Adult Benefit Page | 16 Program Integrity Description: The Idaho Medicaid Program Integrity team focuses primarily on fee -for-service claims from providers. The source of this information is typically drawn from the claims system. The Program Integrity team also contracts with IBM to assist in targeting Key Elements: Idaho staff have identified deficiencies in the claims payment system that inhibit greater effectiveness within the program integrity functions, such as providers being able to adjust the volume of services that are originally filed in their claims. Program Integrity efforts are hampered by a lack of inclusion of managed care data. However, this may be at least partially alleviated by inclusion of managed care/MMCP data in the Medicaid data warehouse early in 2023. The utilization of IBM Watson is c onstructive and there may be opportunities to further utilize this tool. While TPL performs reasonably well, it is not fully integrated with Gainwell functionality. Recommendations: Recommendation #1 : Solicit external recovery audit contractor Assum ptions: Comparable states recovered between $700k and $500K after 10% fee amount listed is State share only. A formal procurement process may be required, with a sole source contract being a faster option, if permitted by State procurement laws and regulat ions. Benefits of Recommendation: Reduces the risk of duplicate billing across programs and unintentional waste (or intentional fraud ) by providers serving clients in both managed care and fee -for-service environments. The data warehouse referenced abov e may also be constructive in this regard. Challenges of Recommendation: There is a degree of uncertainty that the Recovery Audit Contractor market will respond to an RFP or other procurement mechanism. Stakeholder Impact: Recovery Audit Contractors routi nely meet significant stakeholder resistance. Recommendation #2: Increase utilization of external data contractor for fraud detection Assumptions: With an aggregate return of $3.36 for every $1 spent on FWA activities, Studies2 the expected return for a well -functioning program would be approximately $4.9 million for the $1.5 million expended in Idaho. The State of Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Program Integrity Unit SFY 2022 Closed Cases report used a State ma tch rate of approximately 25% , producing an additional $ 653,500 annuall y. Projected savings are based on FY2022 reported activity of approximately $2.2 million. The three -year average activity is higher at approximately $2.9 million per year. Benefits o f Recommendation: Enhanced FWA activities have been shown nationwide to reliably improve compliance and generate savings, in the ratio referenced above. Such enhanced efforts ensure greater program accountability without impacting members. December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 17 Challenges of Re commendation: Additional state resources will likely be required for a relatively modest return in relation to aggregate Medicaid General Fund expenditures. Stakeholder Impact: Providers and other stakeholders will likely resist additional program integri ty initiatives . Summary Table of Program Integrity Recommendations: Recommendation Implementation Date Legislative / Administrative SFY 2024 SFY 2025 External Recovery Audit Contractor 7/1/2023 Administrative Enhanced Subtotal (0.8m) (0.8m) Professional Services Description: Idaho Medicaid professional services are primarily traditional fee -for-service (FFS). Professional services include a wide array of services including those performed by a practitioner, physician administered drugs, and durable medical equipment. Ambulat ory Surgical Centers (ASC) are also considered professional services and include all professional codes for billing as traditional FFS in an outpatient setting. Idaho Medicaid bases reimbursement for professional services on Medicare fee schedules. Key E lements: For SFY22, Idaho reimbursed approximately $1.23 billion for non -ASC professional services and $11.1 million for ASC professional services. Non -ASC professional medical services are meant to reflect 90% of Medicaid Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). Analyses are performed annually to maintain alignment with a prescribed % of MPFS, although there is not an automatic process for rate updates. Physician Administered Drugs (PAD) are reimbursed at the Medicare Average Sale Price (ASP) plus 6%. ASCs are reimburse d at 90% of the Medicare fee schedule upon a code becoming covered. Recommendations: Recommendation #1: Implement across the board (ATB) rate decrease of 7.5%. Assumptions: CPT codes that do not have an Idaho rate are not included in this reduction. Benefits of Recommendation: Cost reduction. Challenges of Recommendation: The magnitude of the reduction could exacerbate member access challenges for certain services. December 2022 sellersdorsey.com Page | 18 Stakeholder Impact: Providers can be expected to oppose this reduction, although opposition may vary based on Medicaid volume.

CONVENED: Chairman V anOrden called the meeting of the Senate Health and W elfare Committee (Committee) to order at 3:02 p.m. PRESENT A TION: Relating to Medicaid Budget Information. Jill Randolph, Principal Analyst, Division of Budget and Policy Analysis (Division) stated the budget review was done at the request of the Department of Health and W elfare (Agency), and the Governor's recommendation. This presentation provided a look back at what the Agency had done, a look into the current fiscal year , what the Agency was doing, and what the Agency had requested for fiscal year 2024. At the top of the page there were tabs that take you from either the agency description or the deep information that was presented to the Finance Committee (JF AC). The Fiscal Source Book contains sources and the use funds for this Division (see Attachment 1). DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked if the Department used a per week, per member , per month analysis as contracting with brokers and managed care moved forward. Ms. Randolph replied yes, it was a more accurate way of looking at the data. Senator Lee asked if setting up a fund would have to be made into policy . Ms. Randolph replied the creation of the fund itself was a departure from what they would normally do, instead of providing a direct appropriation each year from the General Fund. T o set aside funds, the accessible funds would be a decision of the policy , and that transfer itself would happen through JF AC. Chairman V anOrden informed the Committee that Director Jeppesen from the Department of Health and W elfare would be at tomorrow's meeting to answer any questions, and the Legislative Services Of fice (LSO) website had put together a dashboard with charts, graphs and explanations. Senator W introw asked what the $48,000 withhold on the Medicaid T racking Report slide meant. Ms. Randolph stated it was a forecast document to see how the forecast was hitting the actual expenditures, and what the Legislature could expect moving forward. Senator T aylor asked if Legislation made EMS an essential service, would it ef fect the EMS involved. Ms. Randolph replied there was a line item request in the budget for $350,000 to develop a study to provide a direction to the legislature and to stakeholders on what statewide funding for EMS would be. ADJOURNED: There being no further business at this time, Chairman V anOrden adjourned the meeting at 3:54 p.m. ___________________________ ___________________________ Senator V anOrden Michelle T ierney Chair Secretary SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , February 07, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 IDAHO LEGISLATIVE SERVICES OFFICE Division of Budget & Policy AnalysisCreated by: Agency: Date:Jill Randolph, Budget & Policy Analyst Department of Health and WelfareFebruary 7, 2023 https://legislature. idaho.gov/lso/bpa/ BudgetInformation/Redesigned Legislative Budget Information WebsiteIDAHO LEGISLATIVE SERVICES OFFICE Division of Budget & Policy Analysis AGENCY OVERVIEWCreated by: Agency: Date:Jill Randolph, Budget & Policy Analyst Department of Health and WelfareFebruary 7, 2023 Redesigned Legislative Budget Information Website IDAHO LEGISLATIVE SERVICES OFFICE Division of Budget & Policy Analysis AGENCY OVERVIEWCreated by: Agency: Date:Jill Randolph, Budget & Policy Analyst Department of Health and WelfareFebruary 7, 2023 Agency Summary & Statutory Authority The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare provides services and regulatory programs in partnership with taxpayers, consumers , and providers to promote economic well - being, support vulnerable children and adults, enhance public health, and encourage self -sufficiency.

There was also some technology , motor pool, security , and transportation for children in that figure.

Director Jeppesen replied the receipt authority allowed the State to take in money back for what has been already been paid for , such as drug rebates and third party medical payments.

Senator Bjerke asked how EMS could be managed to where there was a central agency that kept operating procedures the same. Director Jeppesen stated that was a complex issue. There was a recommendation to pull together a workgroup of stakeholders, who were meeting now to fund the contractor that would support them.

Cameron Gilliland , Department of Health and W elfare, replied that waivers would come to him as the administrator . Occasionally relatives would want to foster children that may be in a situation that did not pose danger to the child, but may violate those rules, such as family living in a motor home.

V ice Chairman Zuiderveld thanked Ms. Mann for all her hard work, and asked about her future plans. Ms. Mann stated she had a wonderful time while serving at the Senate and gained much experience. She planned to attend college for a Certified Public Accounting (CP A), as they of fered a 5 year program so she could graduate with her masters degree. Senator Lee stated she was very proud of Brooklyn, as she was from her district, and felt she represented the best and the brightest. The Committee enjoyed their time with her , and all wished her the best. SCR 101 Health - States findings of the Legislature and request that the Department of Health and W elfare develop draft legislation, establishing a statewide planning, coordination, and funding system for emergency medical services (EMS). Senator Harris explained the Of fice of Performance Evaluation (OPE) completed a study of EMS in Idaho, and found the EMS across the state were severely understaf fed and underfunded ( https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/OPE/Reports/r1004.pdf ). DISCUSSION: Senator Bjerke asked if creating the essential service element was the beginning of moving toward a connection between those who wanted independence and those who felt there should be greater control from a larger entity . Senator Harris replied it was part of the challenge, as the Bureau of EMS set the licensing guidelines, however their authority was limited. TESTIMONY : Fred Birnbaum , Idaho Freedom Foundation testified in opposition of SCR 101 . He explained the opposition was not to the bill itself, but that it would be placed within the Department of Health and W elfare. He stated it was a 5 billion dollar agency that should not be asked to execute further agencies. DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked if he had a suggestion of an agency that would be a better fit for execution. Mr . Birnbaum replied he would be willing to do some research and get back with her . TESTIMONY : Mark Babson testified in support of SCR 101 . Shawn Rayne , Chief of Ada County Paramedics, testified in support of SCR 101 . He stated had been involved with the work of the task force since it started last summer . The issues EMS was facing are at their worst, as they cannot get any applicants to support the population growth. W esley Anderson , Acute Rescue and T ransport, testified in support of SCR 101. He stated the lack of volunteers was an issue not only seen in Idaho, but across the nation. V olunteers were no longer sustainable, and over 70 percent of Idaho was volunteer . DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked what barriers the Committee should be aware of as they moved forward. Mr . Anderson replied the 2010 OPE report almost mirrored the 2022 report, in that the issues identified 12 years ago are the exact same issues seen today . He further stated that private EMS were not supported by the General Fund, as the only was to collect on services rendered was to bill the insurance companies, which was only a 45 percent collection rate. TESTIMONY : Sasha O'Connell , Bureau of Of fice of Performance Evaluations (Bureau), was in support of SCR 101 . She explained that there was a lack of data at the local level about staf fing needs. The Bureau aimed to work with the task force when hiring consultants to figure out what the need was at each agency level. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to sent SCR 101 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator T aylor seconded the motion. The motion passed with a voice vote . DOCKET NO. 16-0319-2201 Certified Family Homes (ZBR Chapter Rewrite, Fee Rules) - Proposed Rule. Steve Millward , Division of Licensing and Certification (Division), explained a certified family home consisted of an adult care provider certified by the Division, to serve up to four vulnerable adults living in the provider's personal primary residence and integrated into the provider's household. Nearly 74 percent of Idaho residents received services in certified family homes were related to their care provider and likely spent their lives in that home prior to certification. Idaho was one of the few states in the country to of fer such a program. TESTIMONY : Francoise Cleveland , AARP Idaho, registered in support of Docket No. 16-0319-2201 . DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked if there was due process for the Division to require a background check at any time. Mr . Millward explained there were times when the Division learned of possible legal issues that occurred with the care provider before the required five year check. In those instances, the care provider needed to go renew their clearance before that five year benchmark. Senator Lee asked what the estimate was for the additional costs to the certified family homes in new inspection requirements to plumbing and heating every 12 months. Mr . Millward explained there was no requirement for inspection on a yearly basis. It only regarded the initial certification. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to accept Docket No. 16-0319-2201 . Senator Harris seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . DOCKET NO. 16-0208-2201 V ital Statistics Rules - T emporary and Proposed Rule. James A ydelotte , Bureau Chief, Division of Public Health, explained the proposed changes to the rules brought them into alignment with legislation that was passed during the 2022 session. S 1268 established a no fee identification card would be issued by the Idaho Department of T ransportation for individuals who experienced homelessness, as this was a barrier to both job and housing attainment. Under that bill, the Bureau of V ital Records and Health Statistics would issue a birth certificate at no charge to those individuals, and S 1320 allowed an adult adoptee open access to their birth records. TESTIMONY : Francoise Cleveland , AARP Idaho, registered in support of Docket No. 16-0208-2201 . MOTION: Senator W introw moved to approve Docket No. 16-0208-2201 .

Jarryd Samples , Food Program Manager , Division of Public Health stated deviations were made from the FDA Food Code that were specific to Idaho. The term 'non-critical item' was changed to a 'core item'. The term 'potentially critical item' was changed to a 'priority foundation item', and the term 'critical item' had changed to a 'priority item'. These terms denote the severity of the violation. W ording was changed from requiring the regulatory authority to inspect the food establishment from once every year to once every 12 months. MOTION: Senator T aylor moved to approve Docket No. 16-0219-2201 . Senator Lee seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote .

Senator W introw informed their Committee this bill created pathways for individuals who had been licensed physicians in their country outside the United States, and were forcibly displaced due to war , political asylum, or other issues. Dr . Scott Smith introduced himself as a retired residency director and leadership for internal medicine residency at the V eterans Administration (V A). He informed the committee that 97 percent of Idaho's geography was now federally designated as underserved by physicians. Dr . Scott stated he was at a State Department Relocation Center , which had many refugees, asylees and humanitarian parolees in that area, which brought a great need for culturally appropriate health care.

Amador answered there was one in 2023, as there had not been substantial increase since 2013. Senator W introw asked if a budget request was made to the Governor's Of fice. Mr . Amador stated yes, he had spoke with that of fice often. Chairman V anOrden asked what blended rate was on the chart. Mr . Amador replied as a home care agency , all the rates and the costs for care were added together for budgetary purposes, based of f of the Medicaid reimbursement rate. ADJOURNED: There being no further business at this time, Chairman V anOrden adjourned the meeting at 3:57 p.m. ___________________________ ___________________________ Senator V anOrden Michelle T ierney Chair Secretary SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , February 20, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Idaho Association of Home Care Agencies What we do... 1.Provide support to families and individuals allowing someone to age in place. 2.Provide a transition between someone being able to live alone and moving to a care facility. 3.Our services include all the services found in an Assisted Living Facility, just provided in the comfort of your own home. Assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADL's) for the elderly and disabled which include dressing, bathing, toileting/changing attends, transfers, G -tube feedings, mobility, and other essential functions. Homemaker services including meal preparation, laundry, and housekeeping. Housekeeping is utilized after the caregiver has completed meal preparation, cleaning up after a bath, and other housekeeping tasks that the participant is unable to complete independently. This allows the participant the ability to remain at home in a clean and safe environment. Respite -our caregivers allow family members to obtain outside employment knowing that their loved ones will be cared for while they are gone. Who we serve Our association represents agencies throughout the state of Idaho. Our members provide services in all regions. Services are either paid for privately, through the VA, or through Idaho Medicaid. This includes the enhanced benefits that are managed by Blue Cross or Molina Health Care. 70% -80% of agencies clientele consists of Medicaid participants and it continues to climb. This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY -NC-NDOur challenge....Current Administrative burden per hour continues to increase. This increase in administrative burden is caused by; Increased training requirements RN oversight requirements Documentation requirements FLSA -Overtime changes Health insurance costs Recent electronic visit verification (EVV) mandate. What are we doing to save money? As agencies we do our best to reduce costs where we can. We do this by; Keeping administrative staff to a minimum. Overlapping job requirements; for example, salaried office staff are being used to work as caregivers in the field. Limiting caregiver hours to reduce health insurance expense but this limits the hours a caregiver can work attributing to more of the caregiver shortage. Shifted hiring costs to be paid by the applicant and not the agency but again this reduces our ability to hire as the applicant must produce $100 dollars to start working. Stretch out time in -between clients to reduce travel pay requirements. Some agencies are denying high skilled or Medicaid clients onto their service. This reduces the amount of training and administrative wages. How the state can save money... Keep participants in their home and out of long -term facility placement. Reduce emergency room visits by utilizing Personal Care agencies Stabilize the risking risk population by utilizing Personal Care agencies. These agencies can help participants remain stable in their condition, working towards their goals to reduce further chronic care needs.What has brought us here today... There is a caregiver shortage throughout Idaho and agencies have been unable to hire enough (or any) providers to care for the vulnerable members of our population. This shortage is caused by several factors: Aging population Increase in residents which include those Desire for individuals to remain in their own home instead of moving to a care facility. Lack of individuals looking for work as a caregiver. This is mostly due to low wages caused by Medicaid's reimbursement. Personal caregivers make on average of $10 -12 per hour Increased competition in the market to pay high wages. Amazon is paying $15 per hour McDonalds is paying $15 per hour Target is paying $16 per hour for night staffWhere we are... Past and present reimbursement rates In 11 years, Personal Care agencies have received an increase of $1.54 to put towards caregiver wagesWhere we are continued...The association has worked closely with the department of Health and Welfare on these challenges for the past couple of years. Earlier this year the association engaged in discussions with the Idaho Health and Welfare Department for an increase of approximately $9 million in Medicaid reimbursement rates to assist. Unfortunately, with the advent of COVID -19, the Department was instructed to reduce 4% of their budget and the increase was placed on hold.Why we need an increase... State requirements continue to increase and are imposed upon the agencies increasing our administrative burden while reimbursement remains low. We need additional funds in order to pay our caregivers more competitive wages. We can serve our vulnerable population and help them avoid more expensive levels of care including emergency room visits and long -term care placement when not appropriate. Our request of you...Reimbursement rate increase effective July 1st, 2021. Annual review of reimbursement rates. This will help agencies and the state avoid these caregiver shortage emergencies.

Shane Leach , Administrator , Division of Health and W elfare (Division), provided information regarding the process, as the unwinding period would begin April 1, 2023, now that the Public Health Emergency was no longer in ef fect (see Attachment 1). DISCUSSION: Senator Lee inquired as to what group would have priority in the unwinding process. Mr . Leach explained they prioritized individuals likely to be over income and no longer eligible. Senator Lee asked if it would be easier to prioritize the individuals they had not heard from in 2 years. Mr . Leach replied the Centers for Medicaid Services (CMS) were aware of those individuals, however they were still required to give each individual the opportunity to renew their eligibility . Senator T aylor asked Mr . Leach out of the 150,000 individuals, if there was an estimate as to how many would be found ineligible. Mr . Leach replied they had no estimate. Senator W introw asked how the Division's self- reliant staf f would interface with developmentally disabled individuals when they applied for benefit renewal. T onya Standerfer , Reevaluation Deputy Administrator , Division of Health and W elfare, stated there were 2 options. A person could call in to access their account, or go through idalink.idaho.gov , the Division's website, to complete their renewal. Senator W introw asked when forms were needed from the recipient to prove their income, how a developmentally disabled applicant would achieve submitting those forms. Ms. Standerfer replied the self-reliant staf f could verify their information through their interfaces, and would make a phone call to verify other information when necessary . Senator W introw inquired how long the reevaluation process took. Ms. Standerfer stated the average renewal took around 45 minutes. Senator W introw asked how often individuals respond negatively to their loss of eligibility . Ms. Standerfer replied there were times when a person would become upset. Sometimes it was due to additional steps that were needed to complete their renewal or were referred out to other resources. Senator Lee asked if there was a way the Department could move the eligibility determination process along faster . Mr . Leach replied they had conversations with another firm to help see what they could provide for potential supporting staf f for the unwinding, however there were limitations on how much they could work because they were a contractor , not a state employee. The contractor rate of pay was higher than what the customer service representatives employed by the Department were paid. Senator Lee asked if the Division had calculated the cost to the State when continuing to pay benefits for individuals who were no longer eligible. Ms. Standerfer replied there would still be reimbursements coming into the State through the ongoing eligibility determination Process. V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked what the transition from Medicaid to the state based marketplace looked like for those ineligible for Medicaid, and what that cost was. Mr . Leach replied when an individual no longer qualified for Medicaid, they were over the income limit, which was 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The individuals information was automatically transferred from the Division's system to the state based marketplace. The state based marketplace then reached out to that individual or family to inform them that they may qualify for what's called an advanced premium tax credit (APTC) that of fset the cost of the insurance premium. V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked if that information could be found on the Division's website. Mr . Leach recommended the yourhealthidaho.org website for state based marketplace information. Chairman V anOrden asked if there was a process for a fair hearing to go into ef fect. Mr . Leach replied the Division had a Fair Hearing Unit. Chairman V anOrden asked when an individual was found ineligible, was their Medicaid coverage continued when a fair hearing was requested. Ms. Standerfer replied the individual's case would be closed at the time found ineligible, and remain closed until a decision was made by the fair hearing staf f.

DISCUSSION: Senator Lee stated she was concerned about the Board of Nursing deleting requirements for continuing education. Nicki Chopski, Bureau Chief of Health Professions, Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses explained in their prospective analysis, they found other states did not require continuing education (CE) for a registered nurse (RN) or a licensed practical nurse (LPN), as the requirements for certification were higher than what the rules required. Nurses who returned from a time out of practice were required to complete a refresher program. Senator Lee asked if there were other professional medical licenses that did not require CE. Ms. Chopski replied she did not have that information. Senator Lee asked how they knew if a self-employed nurse kept up with changes in the field and other requirements for safe nursing practices. Ms. Chopski stated they had not seen any nurses who weren't willing to maintain or keep up on their education. Senator Lee asked if the removal was because of an audit that discovered the Board of Nursing had not kept track of the CE numbers. Ms. Chopski explained that audits were not done across the nation during COVID-19, which was when that audit was completed. Senator T aylor asked how it would af fect a nurse's ability to maintain an A-Class advanced cardiac or pediatric life support certification, and if it was separate from an annual or two year recertification. Ms. Chopski stated those were separate certification required by the employer . TESTIMONY : Randall Hudspeth , Executive Director , Idaho Center for Nursing, testified in support of Docket 24-0000-2201F . He stated a large number of nurse practitioners in Idaho were licensed before certification was a possibility and before there was a national requirement to maintain certification. Many of those rules were put in place when national standards did not exist, and the national certification requirements now exceeded what the State required. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to approve Docket No. 24-0000-2201F . Senator T aylor seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . DOCKET NO. 24-0501-2200F Rules of the Board of Drinking W ater and W astewater Professionals - Notice of Omnibus Rulemaking (Fee Rule) - Proposed Rule. T im Frost, Deputy Administrator , Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses explained this omnibus rule chapter was reauthorized and did not have any changes, as it was previously reviewed and approved by the Committee. MOTION: Senator T aylor moved to approve Docket No. 24-0501-2200F . Senator Lee seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . PRESENT A TION: Suicide Prevention in Idaho . Mike Sandvig, National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Lee Flinn, Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline 988, Stuart Wilder , Idaho Suicide Prevention Action Collective (ISP AC), came before the Committee to present information in honor of Suicide Prevention Advocacy Day (see Attachment 1). PRESENT A TION: Extended Employment Services. Miren Unsworth, Deputy Director , Department of Health and W elfare gave an overview of the transition of the Extended Employment Services Program (EES) from the Division of V ocational Rehabilitation (Division) to the Department of Health and W elfare (Department). In the 2022 Legislative session, S 1399 moved the administration of the EES from the Division to the Department. EES were services that assisted individuals with developmental disabilities in maintaining employment or gaining employment skills. This prepared them for community employment within an industry , business setting or community rehabilitation program. The EES provider agreement was modified slightly during the transition with an understanding that the agreement would need major revisions in the future. The department was working in collaboration with providers to revise the agreement and evaluate rule promulgation (see Attachment 2). DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked how much that budget was. Ms. Unsworth replied it was just over $3.5 million, with about 217 individuals in work services and community supported employment.

Ms. Unsworth stated they could not leverage that system because the service they supplied was not a Medicaid Service.

This annual report provides an overview of SPP's activities and progress toward reducing suicide in Idaho during SFY22. In CY2021, theIdaho suicide rate impro ved to 20.4 suicides per 100,000 population , representing a reduction of over 14% since the 2018 baseline. Although Idaho still ranks among the top 10 states for suicide, the rate decline is a hopeful sign that the overarching goal of reducing suicide by 2 0% by 2025 is possible through continued public -private collaboration and investment across the state. In the past year, SPP continued to support Idaho Suicide Prevention Action Collective (ISPAC) , a public/private, multidisciplinary stakeholder group comp rised of individuals who shaped the Idaho Suicide Prevention Plan 2018 -2023 . SPP served as the facilitator, provided technical assistance, and supported implementation activities of ISPAC and the stakeholder teams that manage and implement the plan. In ac cordance with the Legislature's annual budget appropriations, SPP updated agreements with State Department of Education to deliver youth suicide prevention programming statewide. During the 2021 -22 academic year, regional coordinators directly engaged with 176 Idaho elementary and secondary public schools, delivering support resources and prevention trainings. In SFY22, SPP supported the launch of 988 \u2014the new universal phone number for the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. This support was possible d ue to additional state and federal funding. These added funds were subgranted to the Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline to support capacity needs related to the transition to 988 in July 2022. The first week following the 988 saw a 36% increase in crisis line contacts in Idaho, consistent with projected higher demand for services. Following staffing, training, and technology upgrades, the Idaho crisis line achieved National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administratio n performance standards, including a 90% in -state response rate for calls originating in Idaho. Call volume from Idaho is expected to further increase in coming years due to population growth and widespread promotion of the 988 line. SPP awarded subgrants to all seven Idaho Public Health Districts to establish local suicide prevention collectives in SFY22. Each district is responsible for building local capacity to develop and implement suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention activities. Local plans are aligned with the Idaho Suicide Preve ntion Plan and its goal of reducing suicide throughout Idaho . Coordinators in each Public Health District provided local outreach events and educational resources promoting suicide awareness and prevention. 2018 2019 2020 2021 Number of Idaho Resident Suicide Deaths 418 365 421 387 Annual Suicide Rate 23.8 20.4 22.9 20.4 Source: Bureau of Vital Statistics, Division of Public Health, September 2022Page |3 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) ANNUAL REPORT This annual report provides an over view of SPP's activities and progress toward reducing suicide in Idaho during SFY22. During the 2022 Legislative Session, the Joint Finance and Appropriation Committee appropriated $1,783,800 to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (DHW), Division o f Public Health's Suicide Prevention Program (SPP). Bureau of Equity and Strategic Partnerships In May 2022, DHW established the Bureau of Equity and Strategic Partnerships (BESP) which combines the work of Get Healthy Idaho to advance Idaho's health imp rovement plan, priorities of the CDC COVID -19 Health Disparities Grant, and three programs: Drug Overdose Prevention Program, Refugee Health Screening Program, and SPP. BESP collaborates across the department with other state and local government agencies , community partners, and organizations across industry sectors to ensure a multi -pronged cohesive statewide strategy is developed to identify and address the social determinants of health, which are the root causes of inequities in health outcomes. Idaho Suicide Prevention Action Collective (ISPAC) Since 2018, SPP has participated in and provided administrative support to the Idaho Suicide Prevention Action Collective (ISPAC), a public/private, multidisciplinary stakeholder group comprised of many of thos e individuals who participated in the strategic planning process in 2018. SPP collaborated with ISPAC to determine the scope of work to be conducted with the funds appropriated to SPP for SFY22, including setting priorities for the program and determining budget amounts to be spent within each priority area. SPP serves as the facilitator for ISPAC, provides leadership and guidance to ISPAC, and supports coordination andimplementation activities of ISPAC and the stakeholder teams that manage and implement the six Key Performance Areas (KPA) of the suicide prevention plan. SPP staff serve as facilitators and support staff for each of the six KPA teams. While the relationship continues to evolve, SPP and ISPAC operate with a coordinated and common vision. In May 2022, SPP facilitated an annual meeting with ISPAC to evaluate progress on thestatewide Suicide Prevention Plan and discuss annual work plan priorities. Along with reviewing impact andannual progress, the collective group identified the following priority areas for the next fiscal year: Create, coordinate, and monitor prevention, intervention, and postvention activities in each local health district. Improve state, tribal, and local capac ity to use data to identify and address equity and risk disparities in higher suicide risk population segments. SPP data analysis identified the following high -risk segments in Idaho: military service members and veterans, rural residents, tribal community members, LGBTQ community members, those affected by disability and/or chronic illness, and youth/adolescents. Priority areas for the annual workplan are closely aligned with DHW Strategic Plan Goal 3 -Help Idahoans become as healthy andself-sufficient as possible -and its objective to reduce Idaho's suicide rate by 20% by 2025.Page |4 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) Following input from ISPAC to align activities with the state plan priorities for SFY23, the SPP budget was allocated as follows: Staff Salaries $318,700 General Operating Expenses $30,000 Youth Education and Prevention$423,000 Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline$448,000 Training and Technical Assistance$20,000 Suicide care model/Zero Suicide$54,000 Local Collectives, Public Health Districts (7)$315,000 Idaho Suicide Prevention Action Collective (ISPAC)$70,000 Communications and Outreach$105,100 Total State General Funds Budgeted$1,783,800 KPA tasks are outlined within the suicide prevention action plan. KPA t eams are as follows: Capacity Building and Infrastructure Suicide Care and Zero Suicide Communication and Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Data and Evaluation Advocacy a nd Policy With support from SPP, each of the six KPA teams is responsible for directing activities that help accomplish the state plan goal of reducing the Idaho suicide rate by 20% by 2025 compared to the baseline statewide suicide rate in 2018. A 20% reduction in the baseline 2018 Idaho suicide rate of 23.8 per100,000 residents equates to a rate of 19.0 or lower as the goal for 2025. In 2021, the Idaho suicide rate improved to 20.4, representing a reduction of over 14% since the 2018 baseline. Although Idaho s till ranks among the top 10 states for suicide rates , the rate decline in both 2019 and 2021 is hopeful sign that the plan 'soverarching goal is possible through continued aligned efforts and investments from all stakeholders. The following is a summary of SPP's scope of work and notable accomplishments in support of the Idaho State Suicide Prevention Plan in SFY22, as well as ongoing efforts during SFY23. Capacity Building and Infrastructure Developed a suicide -prevention training packet for degree -seekin gstudents in behavioral health disciplines at Idaho colleges and universities SPP and stakeholders continue dto explore options for funding and maintaining a statewide online repository or website to simplify access to suicide prevention, intervention, an d postvention resources offered through ISPAC partners and local collectives Suicide Care Models and Zero Suicide Selected the Zero Suicide model to equip health care systems with the tools and mechanisms needed for suicide safe care.

Year one (SFY22) efforts focused on recruiting a cohort of providers in a range ofhealthcare settings: primary care centers, behavioral health clinics, and/or hospital departments and health care systems In partnership with American Foundation for Suicide Prevention ,the Zero Suicide KPA team selected three Idaho healthcare organization s (Shoshone Medical Center in Kellogg, Snake River Community Clinic in Lewiston, and Caribou Medical Center in Soda Springs) to receive SafeSide\u00aePrevention training scholarships. SafeSide\u00aeprovides training for health and community organizations that aspi re to Zero Suicide implementation SPP contracted with Education Development Center's Zero Suicide Institute to lead a workshop covering the core components of the Zero Suicide Framework. The contract scope of work also covers one year of project consulting and support for healthcare organizations piloting the Zero Suicide model In May 2022, staff representing Caribou Medical Center, Owyhee Community Health (Shoshone -Paiute tribe), Panhandle Health District, Kootenai Health, St. Luke's Health System, Marimn Health (Coeur d'Alene tribe), Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, and Saint Alphonsus attended the Zero Suicide Workshop to learn tenets of creating a leadership -driven, safety -oriented culture committed to reducing suicide among people under care Ongoi ng objectives (SFY23 -24) are focused on supporting healthcareproviders with Zero Suicide Institute programming. The goal is to establish four (4) Zero -Suicide pilot sites in Idaho, and to work with community health partners in implementation and support SPP has allocated $54,000 in SFY23 for Zero Suicide model recruiting, training, and professional facilitation Communications and Outreach Engaged Department of Health & Welfare's marketing agency, RIESTER Mountain , to produce four (4) new \"Rock Your Role\" radio spots in English and Spanish. Suicide awareness messages are tailored for Idaho's high priority population segments including those living in rural communities, first responders, middle -aged males, and youth RIESTER created new outdoor advertising and updated existing \"Rock Your Role\" campaign materials. Along with suicide prevention messaging, the campaign was updated to promote the newly rebranded Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline and the national 988 crisis line SPP subscribed to Idaho State Broadcasters Association for reduced - cost media placement services through the Non -Commercial Supporting Announcements (NCSA) program. Local broadcast affiliates in all regions of Idaho aired \"Rock Your Role\" television and radio spots 15 ,872 times between January -June 2022 To reach a broad audience with suicide prevention messages, SPP sponsored \"Rock Your Role\" social media and outdoor advertising campaigns between August -October 2022. Paid social media posts were placed on Facebook and Instagram. Non -skippable video spots ran on YouTube. Campaign billboards promoting suicide prevention awareness and the 988 crisis line were installed on major traffic roadways, including ruralPage |6 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) stretches in Idaho's northern, central, and eastern regions Media reporting guidelines endorsed b y the American Association of Suicidology, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were reviewed and approved. The guidelines were disseminated to SPP media partners through DHW's Office of Communications Suicide Health Tools education and crisis support publications were updated with the new crisis line number (988) and reviewed to ensure accuracy and currency of information. Materials are routinely distributed by SPP to various partners and individuals a round the state, at no charge to them SPP has allocated $105 ,100 to support messaging campaigns as well as for publication production and distribution in SFY23 Training and Technical Assistance Maintained and updated a list of trainers and training session s across the state, which is accessible to the public on the SPP website SPP staff collaborated with Micron's Global Health & Wellbeing and Women's Leadership employee networks to host a mental health resource fair. 47 Micron employees completed on -site Q uestion, Persuade, Refer (QPR) gatekeeper training in 2022. With support from SPP, Micron plans to offer thistraining at all employee campuses in North America SPP will continue to provide funding and staff support to expand local access of evidence -base d trainings such as postvention training created by the Dougy Center, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training\u00ae, and Crisis Intervention Team training SPP has allocated $20,000 for investments in evidence -based trainingcurriculum and conference sponso rships in SFY23 Data and Evaluation Shared Idaho's Violent Death Reporting System data dashboard (www.gethealthy.dhw.idaho.gov/idaho - vdrs) at monthly stakeholder meetings, trainings, via newsletters and information briefings. The dashboard allows public access to official Idaho Vital Statistics suicide mortality data. Demographic detail is provided along with monthly updates on suicide counts in Idaho. These data summaries are instrumental in monitoring frequency of suicide, identifying priority population segments and measuring progress toward state plan goals SPP funded data collection and analysis from Idaho Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to monitor the prevalence of suicide attempts and sources of follow -up care. Data analysis identified Idaho adults at higher risk of suicide attempts as well as factors contributing to suicide attempts For SFY23, SPP is piloting a suicide attempt and ideation alert process using emergency department data available through the ESSENCE system. On ce finalized, the data alerts will be used to develop communication protocol with partners statewide and support local response efforts Advocacy and Policy Drafted Governor's Proclamation for Suicide Prevention and Recovery month to promote National Suici de Prevention Month by conveying the message \"Connecting Help, Finding Hope, Building Recovery.\" Organized a Proclamation signing event with Governor Brad Little in Coeur D'Alene on September 10, 2022 Supported KPA team in defining advocacy and policy obj ectives toPage |7 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) implement the strategic initiatives outlined in the state plan Assisted with legislation proposed during the 2021 and 2022 sessions to provide support for transition to a national mental health crisis support hotline (988) Youth Suicide Prevention SPP and State Department of Education updated their annual service agreement to deliver youth suicide prevention programming statewide. HB 634 requires the state board of education to: 1) adopt rules supporting suicide awareness and prevention training each year for public school personnel; 2) develop a list of approved training materials to fulfill the requirements of HB 634; 3) requires each public school district to adopt a policy on student suicide prevention, and 4) requires the state depa rtment of education to develop and maintain a model policy to serve as a guide for schools SPP and S tate Board of Education worked collaboratively to research and identifyprograms for suicide prevention training in schools to share as approved training materials to fulfill the requirements of HB 634. This list of approved programs was finalized with representation from State Board of Education , SPP, and other ISPAC stakehol ders with interest in youth suicide prevention. State Board of Education routinely engages third -party evaluators to ensure that school suicide prevention programming is evidence - based and that it effectively achieves performance objectives. Evaluation t eams from Boise State University and University of Rochester are currently studying the impact of SDE's youth programs offered during the 2022 -23 academic year. State Board of Education is currently developing \"Suicide Safer Idaho: A One -Stop Guide for Sch ools\" to help school districts consolidate information and easily access support materials. In SFY22, S tate Board of Education partnered with Idaho Lives Project to implement youth suicide prevention programming and postvention services in public schools throughout Idaho. Idaho Live Project's mission is to foster connectedness and resilience throughout Idaho school communities to prevent youth suicide. This partnership prioritizes opportunities to help districts and schools actualize their suicide safer prevention, intervention, and postvention efforts. Using funding support from SPP and two federal grants, services are provided to youth and adults at no cost to them. During the 2021 -22 academic year, Idaho Lives Project regional coordinators directly engage d with 126 Idaho secondary schools and 50 elementary schools (for a total of 176 schools), delivering support resources and prevention trainings. In partnership with the Division of Behavioral Health's regional clinicians, coordinators facilitated a compre hensive School Postvention Crisis Team training for school s within CentralNumber of Idaho schools that participated in suicide prevention trainings Number of Idaho students who participated inschool suicide prevention trainings Number of Idaho adults who participated in school suicide prevention trainings176 2,131 2,840Key FiguresPage |8 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) District Health and Southwest District Health in February 2022. State Department of Education and partners created a statewide suicide -safer model policy that has been adopted by 23 public school districts. Evidence -based protocols which support the model policy were recently updated and are now available to all Idaho school districts. Sources of Strength training is offered at schools each year through scholarship awar ds. Sources of Strength is an evidence -based youth suicide prevention and wellness program. In SFY22, a total of 2 ,131 Idaho students in grades 3 through 12 participated in these trainings. Further, 19 new secondary schools delivered the training during the most recent academic year. Additionally, 2,840 adults were trained in evidence -based suicide prevention programs including Sources of Strength and professional gatekeeper training workshops such as Suicide Prevention Fundamentals Instruction and Ques tion, Persuade, Refer (QPR) training. Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline Support SPP has provided financial support to the Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline since the program's inception. In SFY22, the availability of federal grants resulted in a substantial increase in subgrant funding to support staffing and training requirements related to the national crisis line transition to 988. Federal funding source s managed by partners in the Division of Behavioral Health combined with the SPP state general fund allocation ($448,000) allowed SPP to provide a total of $1,310,000 in funding to the hotline in SFY22. 988 Transition The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 designated 988 as \"the universal telephone number for reaching a nationa l suicide prevention and mental health crisishotline system operating through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\" and intended to be the mental health equivalent of the 911 emergency line. In preparation for the transition to 988 and to broaden the reach of their services, the hotline rebranded as Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline in Spring 2022. The hotline is a member of the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and their network of over 200 crisis call centers. Callers with an Idaho area code who dial 988 or (800) 271 - 8255 are routed to the Idaho hotline . Help seekers may also reach thehotline by texting 988 or (208) 398 -4357 and through internet chat. The essential promise of 988 was defined by stakeholders as \"someone to call, someone to respond, and a place to go.\" Fulfilling that promise requires ongoing collaboration and support from national and state agencies including Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health & Welfare's Division of Behavioral Healt h, Division of Public Health, and Division of Medicaid, as well as our Idaho Legislature . The new three -digit number went live on July 16, 2022 as the universal phone number for the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The number was widely promoted throug h marketing campaigns and in media coverage during the summer months which resulted in a significant increase in hotline call volume. The first week following the 988 launch saw a 36% increase in hotline contacts, consistent with projected higher demand for services. Following staffing, training, and technology upgrades, thehotline achieved the National Lifeline and Substance Abuse and Mental Page |9 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) Health Services Administration performance standards with a 9 0% response rate for calls originating in Idaho. Calls that are not answered by an Idaho hotline operator are routed to the National Lifeline call center network. In April 2022, SPP was awarded a federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Se rvices Administration (SAMH SA) appropriated through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in the amount of $642,000 over a two -year project period. If spending approval is granted by theIdaho Legislature , these funds will be directed to hotline operations t o help further build capacity to meet record high demand for crisis support services following the launch of 988. Sustained funding is essential to allow ever - growing numbers of Idahoans to receive the lifesaving support they seek. Highlights from the Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline 2nd Quarter Report (April -June 2022) Total number of contacts: 6,416 (5,784 calls and 632 texts/chats). This represents an increase of over 36% since the same time period in 2021. Thehotline continues to experience increasing call volume, reaching historic allyhigh levels. During the second quarter of CY2022 (which pre -dates the 988 launch), the hotline responded to more calls and texts than any previous quarter in operating history In follow -up inquiries, 94% of help - seekers reported that they appreciated thehotline 's service After support from thehotline , 81% of help-seekers de -escalated or had reduced distress In compliance with National Suicide Prevention Lifeline protocols, crisis responders are required to ask every caller about suicide. In the second quarter, there were 4,711 contacts inwhich suicidology was assessed and addressed with the caller. Funding for Local Suicide Prevention Collectives SPP awarded subgrants to all seven (7) local public health districts in SFY22 to establish and support local suicide prevention collectives. The subgrants allow each district to build local capacity to develop and implement suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention activities. The funds support a part -time coordinator in each district who is responsible for organizing and coordinating a collective of individuals, businesses, community members and survivors to develop a local plan that is aligned with the Idaho Suicide Prevention Plan and the goal of reducing deaths by suicide. Local coordinators attend monthly Learning and Action Network meetings led by SPP staff to1%1%2%2%38%40%16% Criminal justice system concernsCrime *Suicide includes callers who mentioned current ideation (47%), a current suicide plan (15%), concerns for a third -party (17%), attempt or loss survivor (18%), and past ideation (3%)Page |10 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) share best practices, solve problems, an d connect resources. The subgrant scope of work requires each local collective to conduct a local analysis to assist the district and local counties to identify gaps in their resources, policies, training, and services related to prevention, intervention, and postvention which will be used to inform and guide suicide prevention efforts; work with local school districts, S tate Department of Education , and contractors to ensure suicide prevention plans are in place and active; develop a data col lection plan to ensure timely local suicide data; and support and evaluate local suicide prevention outreach events. Local collectives promoted Suicide Prevention and Awareness Month in September 2022 through social media and Public Health District websit es. Many hosted local events such as survivor walks and dinners to build community and spark important conversations. As part of their local suicide prevention plans, each collective distributed loss survivor support packets, promoted lethal means safety ( by disseminating prescription lockboxes, drug deactivating pouches, and gun trigger locks), facilitated support groups, and participated in outreach events to provide suicide prevention education and share resources. Highlights of recent accomplishments: Panhandle Health District purchased viewing rights to My Ascension, an acclaimed documentary about youth suicide. The district presented screenings for multiple audiences live and online. The Panhandle District is also an active partner in Zero Suicide im plementation and plans to hire a local project manager to oversee pilots in all five of their county clinics North Central Health District forged new relationships with the Willow Center, Rural Crisis Center Network, University ofIdaho, Lewis -Clark State College, Walla Walla Community College, YWCA, and others local organizations to facilitate access to mental health resources and collaborate on trainings and educational events Southwest District Health hosted a \"Mental Health Symposium\" in spring 2022 wit h sessions on postvention, trauma -informed response, plus a 2 -day Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST)\u00ae. The local coordinator also teamed with Idaho Lives Project on a suicide prevention mural project in the Notus School District Central District Health organized a suicide awareness challenge at Tamarack Resort. Staff were trained in the Community Resiliency Model which seeks to expand trauma response capacity in local communities South Central District Health hosted a speaker event in Twi n Falls featuring Kevin Hines, a nationally known suicide prevention advocate who survived a suicide attempt from the Golden Gate Bridge. As part of local 9/11 memorial events , this district promot ed topics related to suicide prevention and mental health support for first responders and veterans .A large flag was displayed from Perrine Bridge to promote \"Bands on the Bridge\" and survivors tied \"bands of hope\" ribbons to Southern Idaho's most visible bridge Southeastern Idaho Public Health hosted \"Stories of Hope Across the Lifespan\" which featured presentations from survivors, a screening of the suicide prevention documentary My Ascension, and a safety planning discussion led by local suicide prevention experts. Eastern Idaho Public Health implemente d grief and loss support groups in rural areas. Their approach helped promote awareness of online resources (includingPage |11 Idaho Suicide Prevention Program |Annual Report to the Legislature (SFY2022) support groups specifically for those experiencing suicide loss) to those in remote communities with limited access to services Question , Persuade, and Refer Training SPP contracted with Whistle Communications to provide Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) gatekeeper training workshops via DHW Learning Hub employee training portal. Trainings are offered virtually to all DHW employees (full ti me, part time, and temporary). The ongoing effort strives to train at least 1,000 employees to recognize signs of suicide risk and learn how to intervene and refer individuals for care. As of June 2022, 83% of this training goal was reached and is project ed to be exceeded by the end of the calendar year. The training is continuously promoted through DHW internal communications channels including DHW Connection employee newsletter, banner ads on Inside DHW (the Department's intranet portal) and periodic up dates from the Director and Human Resources staff. Pre-training surveys found that nearly all workshop participants have known someone who was struggling with thoughts of suicide. However, prior to completing the training, fewer than 1 -in-4 knew how to rec ognize signs of suicide risk or how to appropriately respond. Following the training workshop, 9 -in- 10 of those trained reported being aware or extremely aware of recognizing signs. About the same number reported knowing what to say and what to do when so meone shows signs of suicide risk. Dougy Center Loss Survivor Support Group Facilitator Training SPP's funding allocation supported a two -day postvention workshop developed by the Dougy Center in May 2022. Hosted by the Idaho Crisis & Suicide Hotline, the training provided techniques for facilitating loss survivor support groups using theDougy Center's pioneering peer grief support model. A representative from each of the seven PublicHealth Districts participated in the training, expanding access to evidence -based loss survivor support groups in communities throughout the state. Governor's Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans, and their Families SPP staff is supp orting Idaho's participation in the Governor's Challenge, ensuring alignment with Idaho Suicide Prevention Plan goals. Co- ledbyU.S. Department of Veteran s Affairs (VA) andSAMHSA ,and championed by Idaho's veteran and military affiliated organizations, this initiative is focused on strategies for reducing suicide risk among service veterans, service members, and their families over a four-year project period.1 Extended Employment Services Update 2/23/2023 Miren Unsworth Deputy Director2 Senate Bill 1399Background Extended Employment Services Work ServicesCommunity Supported Employment3 EES Transition : May -July 1 4 Ongoing Operations and Next Steps Established provider workgroup Revising provider agreement Evaluating rule promulgation5 Questions Miren Unsworth Miren.Unsworth@dhw.idaho.gov (208) 334 -5506AMENDED AGENDA #1 SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE 3:00 P .M.

COMMITTEE MEMBERS COMMITTEE SECRET AR Y Chairman V anOrden Michelle T ierney V ice Chairman Zuiderveld Sen Wintrow T aylor MINUTES SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE DA TE: Monday , February 27, 2023 TIME: 3:00 P .M. PLACE: Room WW54 MEMBERS PRESENT : Chairman V anOrden, V ice Chairman Zuiderveld, Senators Lee, Harris, EXCUSED: None NOTE: The sign-in sheet, testimonies and other related materials will be retained with the minutes in the committee's of fice until the end of the session and will then be located on file with the minutes in the Legislative Services Library . CONVENED: Chairman V anOrden called the meeting of the Senate Health and W elfare Committee (Committee) to order at 3:16 p.m. S 1072 DISINTERMENT - Amends existing law to revise provisions regarding the disinterment of a body . Senator W inder explained this dealt with family members who wanted to appoint another person to be their designee, and witness the relocation process of a casket. TESTIMONY : Michael Johnson testified in support of S 1072 . He stated he had been in law enforcement and coroner work for 45 years. He shared with the Committee what he experienced during this dif ficult process, as it was something not everyone would want to see. DISCUSSION: V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked how often the process of moving deceased persons happened. Mr . Johnson stated he did not know , as it was a very dif ficult process. Senator W introw inquired if there were other reasons for disinterment that could present any legal issues. Mr . Johnson answered not that he knew of. TESTIMONY : T ony V aldez , Counsel and Executive Secretary , Idaho Funeral Services, testified in opposition of S 1072 . As a licensed mortician, she was required to oversee the disinterment and removal process. She stated that only upon a verified application of the person having the highest authority under the provisions of Idaho Code \u00a7 54-1 142, however that section was not a list of persons who had disposition authority . DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked why it bothered her to allow a family to designate another party to oversee the disinterment. Ms. V aldez responded it would require a funeral director to allow the designee to be present as the funeral director was required to be there. Senator T aylor asked if the funeral director had the authority to decide who could be present. Ms. V aldez answered yes, as the Statute was currently written. Senator Bjerke asked who was allowed to make that decision pursuant Idaho Code \u00a7 54-1 142. Ms. V aldez replied disposition authority was given in the absence of a prearranged funeral plan. Senator W introw asked what the main issue was in what Senator Winder proposed. Ms. V aldez responded one cannot delegate authority the Statute gave to someone else for the disposition of those remains. Senator T aylor asked how often during the funeral planning process was the issue of disinterment considered. Ms. V aldez replied it was not considered often. TESTIMONY : Randy Basterrechea testified in opposition of S 1072 as it mandated a legal next of kin or a representative for a legal next of kin be present at the disinterment. He had personally been involved in many disinterments throughout his career , and there were many uncomfortable variables that could occur for those involved in that process. Senator W introw asked if there was an issue for a designee to attend that process. Mr . Basterrechea replied no, however , under the bill, it would mandate a family member or designee be present. Senator Bjerke declared a 39 H for a possible conflict of interest. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send S 1072 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote. H 70 COUNTY INDIGENT SER VICES AND FINANCES - Amends and repeals existing law to revise provisions affected by the repeal of the County Indigent Program and the Catastrophic Health Care Cost Program (CA T). Representative V ander W oude explained in 2022 the CA T Fund was discontinued. Kelly Brassfield , Idaho Association of Counties, stated this addressed the county jail medical statutes with the repeal of the Indigent Program. With the repeal of that section, there was no longer a reference that allowed claims to be priced at the reduced Medicaid rate. Currently , individuals could of fer a settlement request. The CAP board had the authority to review the case and settle if it's above 75 percent. With the repeal of that section, there was no longer a reference that allowed those claims to be priced at the reduced Medicaid rate. There was no longer a board to make that settlement request approval or to approve the annual report or audit. TESTIMONY : Brian Whitlock , Idaho Hospital Association, testified in support of H 70 . He stated H 316 (2021), eliminated the CA T Plan and the County Indigent Plan. This bill codified what was available before those plans were eliminated. He explained with that loss, any indigent or catastrophic cases left the hospitals to carry that cost burden. Those two programs had an impact in the $20 to $30 million range statewide. MOTION: Senator T aylor moved to send H 70 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Lee seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . S 1091 PUBLIC ASSIST ANCE - Amends existing law to provide a civil penalty for public assistance providers who fail to timely complete required training for staff. Lori Stiles , Manager , Medicaid Program Integrity Unit, Department of Health and W elfare (Department), explained this legislation added additional authority to assess civil monetary penalties for noncompliance of rules and regulations associated with the protection of vulnerable Idahoans through criminal history , background checks and required training for proper Medicaid Participant care. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , February 27, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked if the fines would be issued directly by the Department or if they would be issued by a third party broker or managed care provider . Ms. Stiles stated those penalties were assessed by the Department to the provider who employed those individuals. Senator Lee inquired if the Department communicated with employers when a background check had not been completed. Ms. Stiles explained they worked closely with the Criminal History Unit to ensure penalties were not assessed when the process was slow , as the Department had ability to be flexible in those situations. Senator W introw inquired if that happened often. Ms. Stiles replied if they were not getting the Idaho State Police check or their employee was not linked to that employer , there was no one to reach out to them about those problems. Senator W introw asked if the contract could be terminated for those individuals with persistent neglect of background checks. Ms. Stiles replied the Department believed a monetary penalty was not as harsh of a penalty as terminating a provider from the program. Senator W introw asked how the Department's system helped providers ensure background checks were completed on time, and what the cost was to complete the background check. Fernando Castro , Criminal History Unit Supervisor , Department of Health and W elfare, stated there was an online background check system, and changes were made to the procedure which allowed applicants to work before being cleared because the applicant's fingerprints had been taken, as that clearance could take up to 4 months. The cost of the background check range from $65 dollars per person. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send S 1091 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator T aylor seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . S 1009 HEAL TH - Amends and adds to existing law to clarify the health rights of Idahoans. Senator Foreman explained this legislation created a revised section in Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9004, that established health rights under the law for medical patients, their family members and legal guardians. DISCUSSION: Senator Lee inquired about the inclusion of sexual orientation, in that gender identity in those areas were already codified in federal law . Senator Foreman responded the State of Idaho does not contain the language sexual orientation or gender identity . He did not want individuals turned away for those reasons. Senator Lee asked if it would be more appropriate to state 'no person for no reason at all should ever be turned away .' Senator Foreman answered he felt it was important to add more specificity and refer to federal law . Senator T aylor asked if he knew of a time when a human being in Idaho was refused medical attention based on their sex, age, race, national origin, ethnicity , religion, sexual orientation, gender identity , veteran, military status or any other basis. Senator Foreman replied yes, a family member was denied medical care because she refused the COVID-19 vaccination. Senator W introw inquired if this bill could potentially prohibit hospital employees from wearing masks, as the hospital was a political subdivision. Senator Foreman replied it would depend on the funding of the hospital, how it was structured, organized and financed. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , February 27, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 3 Senator T aylor asked how the language 'where no patient shall be administered any experimental drug' would work with Idaho Code, T itle 39, and the Right to T ry Act. Senator Foreman replied the bill stated 'with informed written consent'. Senator W introw inquired about the language 'visitation by patients, family members or legal guardians, that it shall be allowed unless the patient refuses visitation or visitation was presently denied by the attending physician for medical reasons, in the best interest of the patient', and how that could be handled when patients were all in one facility . Senator Foreman replied it is in the physician's best medical judgment to restrict visitation. TESTIMONY IN F A VOR: The following testified in favor of S 1009 : Dale Ortmann; Amber Drake; Mike Lewis; Kathleen Maria Leibler . TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION: The following testified in opposition to S 1009 : Kelley Packer; Emile Jackson-Edney; Blaine Conzatti; and Alicia Abbott. TESTIMONY : T oni Lawson , Idaho Hospital Association, testified opposition of S 1009 . She informed the Committee the new section of the proposed statute would apply to state and political subdivisions of the state or public health districts, as that would apply to some hospitals but not others. She opined that many parts of the legislation were duplicative to state and federal law , as that agency mandated what hospitals must do in regards to the patients and HIP AA. DISCUSSION Senator Bjerke asked how many of the federal statutes were violated during COVID-19. Ms. Lawson was not sure if there was a specific area that was violated. Senator Bjerke asked how a patient's right to choose their health care provider could af fect private insurance. Ms. Lawson replied she did not know if it would conflict with that insurance carrier . Senator W introw asked what would be the most catastrophic thing that could happen if the bill were to pass. Ms. Lawson opined in her experience, legislation that was duplicative and contained unnecessary language created confusion as one section of code overlapped another . For example, a hospital cannot remove the mask mandate because it was a federal requirement. Nikki Zogg , Director , Southwest District Health, testified in opposition of S 1009 . She stated it would prohibit public health districts from issuing orders to protect the health of the community . She believed it conflicted with existing Idaho Code, T itle 39, Chapters 14 and 15, and the term 'extreme medical emergency' was not well defined. Senator Lee asked if she thought this bill would have prevented her public health district from making any of those recommendations when promoting vitamin D or other therapies. Ms. Zogg stated her concern about the bill language was that it's not specific enough where a provider could recommend or prescribe alternative therapies because they were considered of f label. She understood the way the bill was currently written, it could include things like zinc, vitamin B, and even Hydroxychloroquine, before there was a COVID-19 vaccine available. MOTION: Senator Zuiderveld moved to send S 1009 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Bjerke seconded the motion. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Senator W introw made a substitute motion to send S 1009 to the floor with no recommendation. The motion failed due to no second..

Idaho ranks 50th in the nation for active physicians providing direct patient care per resident and 45th in the nation for active primary care physicians per resident.\u00b9 The physician shortage is projected to worsen in coming years with 30% of Idaho physicians being age 60 or older.\u00b9 Rural communities, which make up 80% of our state, have a higher rate of the aging population suffering from a greater number of chronic conditions requiring more frequent and complex care. Despite this, rural Idaho counties have substantially fewer physicians per resident than urban counties (2.8 vs. 4.6 physicians per 5,000 residents). And 14 Idaho Idaho counties have less than 2 physicians per 5,000 residents.\u00b2 How Physician Visa Waiver Programs Work The Conrad J-1 Visa Waiver and National Interest Waiver programs were established by federal law in 1961 and in Idaho law in 2004 as recruitment options of last resort. These programs allow healthcare facilities designated as a Healthcare Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) to recruit non- U.S. citizen physicians to fill vacancies they have been unable to fill with a U.S. citizen physician. To be eligible, a physician must have successfully completed a residency training program in the U.S. For the J-1, the waiver eliminates the two-year return home requirement in exchange for a three- year service commitment to practice medicine in an underserved area in the U.S. The National Interest Waiver program waives the labor certification requirement for the employer and allows a foreign physician to practice medicine with an underserved population for 3-5 years. Waivers are submitted to the Division of Public Health for review, and final waiver decisions are made by the U.S. Department of State.Physician FTE by County per 5,000 Residents Increasing Use of Physician Visa Waiver Programs Simplified Ratio per 5,000 Residents 0 5Increasing Use of Visa Waivers in Idaho Visa waiver programs have been effective recruiting tools for healthcare facilities across the country, yet they have been historically underutilized in Idaho. Idaho can receive 30 visa waivers per year statewide, but from 2004-2021, Idaho health facilities only requested on average 1 waiver per year. In 2022, Idaho facilities submitted 7 applications. According to feedback from healthcare facilities, the additional elements required by Idaho law are particularly burdensome for lower-resourced facilities such as Rural Health Clinics and Critical Access Hospitals. The following table outlines the proposal that will simplify the application process, while continuing to meet the original intent as a recruitment option of last resort.References \u00b9 State Physician Workforce Data Report (2021), available at aamc.org. \u00b2 Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Report (2022).

Laura Thompson , Bureau Chief of Facility Standards, Division of Licensing and Certification, Department of Health and W elfare (Department), explained the Idaho Health Care Association, which represented all 80 skilled nursing facilities in Idaho, requested the Department consider allowing certified medication assistants to administer medications in facilities. Currently , the licensing rules only allow a registered nurse (RN) to complete that task. MOTION: Senator W introw moved to approve Docket No. 16-0302-2201 . Senator Lee seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . H 83 HEAL TH - Amends existing law to revise eligibility requirements for the Conrad J-1 V isa W aiver Program and the National Interest W aiver Program. Representative Healey stated the current requirements mandated facilities that requested the J-1 or visa waiver physicians must demonstrate they tried for six months to recruit physicians within Idaho or the United States. Due to the shortage of providers in underserved areas, the bill proposed that time be reduced to 3 months. Senator W introw asked what the Idaho Conrad J-1 V isa W aiver Program did. Representative Healey explained it allowed physicians from other countries to come in on a visa waiver to work in Idaho for 3 to 5 years. TESTIMONY : Gina Pannell , Chief, Bureau of Oral Health and Primary Care, Division of Public Health, Department of Health and W elfare testified in favor of H 83 . She stated those that had used this waiver had reported much success when recruiting key , long term providers for vacancies that had been dif ficult to fill. MOTION: Senator Harris moved to send H 83 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator T aylor seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . S 1052 OPT OMETRISTS - Amends existing law to provide for the practice of optometry to include certain therapeutic laser procedures under certain circumstances. Senator Grow explained this would allow only those optometrists who were certified, and received the required education and training to use those three specific laser procedures in their of fices. Lance Giles , lobbyist, informed the Committee the benefits of this bill were safety , increased competition based on free-market principles, and improved access and consumer choice. The following therapeutic laser procedures were limited to 3 in-of fice procedures, performed in an outpatient setting: The Laser Capsulotomy (CAP), which uses the energy of the laser to remove cloudiness that develops on the lens implant after cataract surgery . The Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI), which uses a low-energy laser to prevent blindness should an angle-closure develop. The Laser T rabeculoplasty (L T), which uses short laser pulses to target pigment cells in a network of channels to reduce eye pressure (see Attachment 1). Senator Lee asked what ef forts were made between optometrists and Ophthalmologists to come an agreement since the last time the proposed bill was presented. Mr . Giles stated after the print hearing, he did reach out to the lobbyist for the Idaho Society of Ophthalmologists. He asked him what he thought of the bill and if any compromise was available. They were still opposed to the bill. Senator Bjerke asked if there was an increase in optometrists providers in rural areas in the State. Dr . Reynolds , President, Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners stated they have seen substantial increased access in rural areas, with about 120 optometrists performing those procedures currently . Senator T aylor asked how many of those procedures were based on an emergency situation, or was this a procedure that could wait for appointment. Dr . Reynolds responded the LPI would be considered an emergency treatment. Senator T aylor asked what the wait time was in Idaho was for one of the three non-emergent procedures. Dr . Reynolds responded the wait time in Kentucky was around 2 months. Senator T aylor asked if there was any information on Idaho. Dr . Huber answered they did not have that data, however , it depended on where the patient was located. Senator T aylor asked when an optometrist had a problem if they sought a second opinion before performing a surgery . Dr . Aaron Bronner , Optometrist, Pacific Cataract and Laser Institute, answered their facility was 2 months out for patient evaluations. An optometrist would refer a patient for any number of dif ferent procedures. There was no second clinic visit unless the patient needed to return for a procedure. TESTIMONY : Dr . Aaron Bronner testified in favor of S 1052 . He informed the Committee that optometrists were capable of dealing with complications that may result from those procedures, as those complications were very rare. If there was a complication, it was almost always from increased pressure or inflammation inside the eye. Y AG lasers have been linked to the risk of a significant complication called a retinal detachment. In his career he had seen 5,000 Y AG laser treatments, and never saw a retinal detachment as a result. If a patient were to come in with retinal detachment, an optometrist would manage it the same way an ophthalmologist would. They would not treat the retinal detachment, they would refer the patient to a trained retina specialist. Dr . Kathy Lee , pediatric ophthalmologist, St. Lukes Hospital, testified in opposition of S 1052 . She stated since 1999, she saw 4 retinal detachments. In the last five years, there were 45 attempts to expand the scope of optometrist practice in 20 states, and only 5 accepted that expansion. Recently , there was a decision in South Dakota to reject that expansion. DISCUSSION: Senator Bjerke asked if the motivation to expand was out of the sense of need. Dr . Lee replied she was not sure that expanding scope was going to provide that much greater access to rural communities. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , February 28, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 TESTIMONY : Dr . Rodney White testified in favor of S 1052 . He stated Idaho Code \u00a7 54-1501 defined a particular procedure performed by an optometrist called a 'foreign body removal'. The American Medical Association (AMA) coded that procedure as an in of fice surgical procedure, and the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook lists 16 surgical procedures performed by optometrists. Dr . Brett Betts , President, Society testified in opposition of S 1052 . He opined the bill should not be approved as it was currently written. The wait time for Y AG laser treatments in his of fice was 2 to 4 weeks, and that had not changed in the last 3 years. He reminded the Committee that this bill was rejected 3 years ago by the Legislature. DISCUSSION: Senator T aylor asked how many of those procedures were performed in Idaho each year . Dr . Betts replied he did not know what the total number was, however , in his personal practice, he had completed 350 Y AG laser treatments within last year . Senator Bjerke inquired if there was a future for access in rural settings. Dr . Betts replied those lasers had very expensive service contracts, and a provider would need to do enough procedures in a certain time period to make it economically feasible. TESTIMONY : Dr . T odd Slusser testified in support of S 1052 . He stated the ophthalmologist who authored the Oklahoma study did not look at actual outcomes, but merely tallied the number of sessions billed per patient at a time when an optometrist was conservatively splitting treatments into two sessions with some patients. He stated that was a technique developed by ophthalmologists to reduce inflammation. There were 1 1 ophthalmologists nationwide who averaged more sessions per patient than any other optometrist. The study data showed that if an ophthalmologist does the initial laser procedure, the patient was twice as likely to need incisional glaucoma surgery . A recent report published by Colorado disagreed with V ermont and recommended that optometrists practice to their full level of training, including laser procedures. Dr . Dan Gealy testified in opposition of S 1052 . As a retina specialist, he stated there was one fifth of a millimeter , 200 microns, was the dif ference between a successful laser and permanent damage to the lens or permanent damage to the vitreous in the back of an eye. Laser procedures had known complications such as damage to the lens, bleeding inside of the eye, and retinal detachment no matter how good the surgeon was. He explained the data from Oklahoma and Kentucky was bad, as neither of those states had reporting requirements for optometrists to report complications, nor was there a procedure for them to do so. There was no way to report those requirements, so if there was a medical complication, it did not go to the Board of Medicine. Dr . Cody Jones testified in support of S 1052 . He stated in August of 2020, the Department of V eteran Af fairs (V A) removed restrictive language that denied veterans access to laser eye procedures provided by doctors of V A facilities. In September of 2022, the V A dropped additional language that prevented veterans from access to community care doctors of optometry for invasive eye care procedures. The language previously allowed this care only to be provided by an ophthalmologist. Now it allowed these procedures to be provided by optometrists and ophthalmologist based on that state's licensure requirements. The proposed changes to Idaho Statute would allow Idaho optometrists to render all the services that they were trained and educated to perform. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , February 28, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 3 DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked if federal law had approved to provide those procedures to the V A, and if Idaho was waiting to align with federal law . Dr . Jones answered that 95 percent of V A facilities had an optometrist in the United States, and eye care services were the third most requested service next to mental health and primary care. TESTIMONY : Dr . James Earl testified in opposition of S 1052 . He informed the Committee about surgical decision making, and how that was developed during residency surgical training. He believed there was no substitute for residency surgical training, as there was a big dif ference between learning about a surgical procedures and performing them. Currently , to perform eye surgeries in Idaho, a surgeon must complete surgical residency . Residency came after four years of medical school and an additional year of internship. There were many variances that required precaution, and adjustments that must be made to the technique. He suggested the bill was a shortcut for optometrists that allowed them to perform surgery without completing surgical training. DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked if the list of surgeries performed by optometrists was semantics. Dr . Earl stated he had not seen that list. TESTIMONY : Dr . Lauren Huber testified in support of S 1052 . She stated that therapeutic laser procedures were safe in the hands of optometrists, and had performed those procedures in other states since 1990. This was not new technology to that field. Senator W introw asked for clarification regarding optometrist training and qualification for using laser procedures. Dr . Huber replied there were two optometric schools within the United States where therapeutic laser procedures were performed. Optometric students had ample opportunity to attend rotations from site to site that allowed students to practice those surgical procedures on patients. Dr . Caroline V argason testified in opposition of S 1052 . She explained as a board certified ophthalmologist, 17,000 hours of clinical and surgical training was required to learn those skills, and an additional 8,000 hours of specialized training on tissue around the eyes in ocular facial plastic surgery still must be obtained. This training was highly regulated by a national council, and she believed those standards were set at a national level for patient safety . Dr . Aaron W arner testified in support of S 1052 . He stated the procedures in question were safe, as malpractice insurance rates have not gone up over the years since the introduction of the laser procedures. TESTIMONY : Jason Kreizenbeck , contract lobbyist, testified in opposition of S 1052 . He stated the Idaho Society of Ophthalmology and the Optometric Association were negotiating a piece of legislation. The stopping point was they could not come to an agreement on the level of training, residency programs, and how those practices would be put into ef fect. The version of the bill Mr . Giles had presented to them was not the same bill as the one before the Committee today . DISCUSSION: Senator Bjerke asked if the changes made were impassable to ophthalmologists. Mr . Kreizenbeck replied the bill presented today was a very dif ferent version than the one presented in 2020. The bill still did not fix the core issue the Idaho Society of Ophthalmology had with the bill, as the training was insuf ficient to operate those lasers in a manner that was safe for Idaho patients. TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT : Brian McNeel, Jef fery Collins, Jerald White, Alexandra Ruiz, Jacob W atson, Abby W atson, James Bewley , Lisa White, Doug Adams, and Ana Ferrer also testified in support of S 1052 .

Lisa Anderson , Public Policy Director , Alzheimer's Association of Greater Idaho, explained the bill directs the Department of Health and W elfare (Department), Division of Public Health, and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Program (ADR), to convene every five years to update the ADR's Strategic Plan for Idaho, and report to the Legislature and the Governor on gaps, needs and progress (see Attachment 1). DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked what the dif ference was between presenting updates of the strategic plan every 5 years or could recommendations continue to occur on an ongoing basis to the Department. Ms. Anderson replied they would receive an update on where the plan was in the process every year , as well as what they were looking toward for the next year . Senator W introw asked what time of the year the legislature would receive the annual update. Ms. Anderson replied they had a public policy group as part of that alliance, and as that possible legislation came up, they would contact legislators to see who would be interested in helping. Senator W introw asked how progress had been made in addressing any gaps previously identified as problems. T iffany Rob , Program Manager , Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Program stated they were looking at how they would educate Idahoans about choices they could make now to improve their brain health outcomes as they got older . They were finding ways to support family caregivers, and the involuntary hold issues were an entirely dif ferent segment of the population, as those with neurocognitive disabilities or decline were not considered a mental or behavioral health issue. Senator W introw asked how those gaps in care came to the surface for legislative recommendations and support in budgetary ways. Dave Jeppesen , Director , Department of Health and W elfare, replied the Department would submit that legislative idea, which would turn into a draft legislation, which usually took place over the summer . If that were approved through the governor's of fice process, then the Department would look for a legislative sponsor in the third or fourth quarter . If that was something the Committee prioritized as Department Legislation, then the process would be followed. TESTIMONY : Francoise Cleveland , AARP , testified in support of S 1096 . MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send S 1096 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. It was seconded by Senator T aylor . The motion carried by voice vote . S 1097 MEDICAID - Adds to existing law to establish the Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMI) Dedicated Fund in the state treasury . Senator Cook stated the cost for that entire system was $186 million, and the State of Idaho would pay 10 percent of that. He worked with the project manager Kevin Nelson, and they looked at spreading the system out in pieces over the course of many years. The base module would be first, then followed by pharmaceutical, then the data warehouse. They would not start the next module until after the last one was installed. Senator Bjerke asked if there was an alternative plan. Senator Cook responded there had to be milestones to keep from going overboard. TESTIMONY : Fred Birnbaum , Idaho Freedom Foundation, testified in opposition of S 1097 . He expressed his concerns as the MMI Project was estimated at $138 million in early 2022, then was estimated at $175.9 million later that fall. He stated S 1097 lacked an accountability piece. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send S 1097 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Harris seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote .

Senator Harris seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . PRESENT A TION: Idaho Caregiver Alliance. Dr . Sarah T oevs , Director , Center for the Study of Aging, Boise State University , explained in Idaho, 40 percent of the Medicaid budget went toward caregivers that were not a spouse, as Idaho did not allow a spouse to be a paid caregiver . The Alliance wrote into all three grants the sustainability for the statewide coalition, and that money was used as a one time source to get it established (see Attachment 1). DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked why they were not applying for the grant. Judy T aylor , Director , Idaho Commission on Aging, replied those grants were highly competitive. After those grants were awarded, the assumption was that the State or the community was going to continue to sustain the Alliance. Senator W introw inquired what could be done to keep the Alliance moving forward. Ms. T aylor answered she did not know if there was anyone giving a significant money around that issue. Senator Bjerke asked if there was a projected date where a spouse could be a paid caregiver , and what the strategies were to deal with that population. Ms. T aylor replied there was an application where the State could submit a Medicaid waiver to allow for spousal coverage. The Alliance developed their own certified family home program, which received money from the State. Chairman V anOrden asked if a spouse would qualify as a paid caregiver under Idaho law .

This would appropriate a $25,000 maximum payout over a 5 year period to both new and current registered nurses. Senator Harris asked if there were other nursing educational programs that would make certain applicants ineligible for the rural nursing loan repayment program. Representative Healey answered yes, as the language in the bill would not allow for double dipping. TESTIMONY : Fred Birnbaum , Idaho Freedom Foundation, testified in opposition of H 213 . He stated his concerns about using taxpayer money to pay for that loan. He further stated If that standard applied only to counties that did not independently contain a city , then that would cover three fourths of the counties in Idaho. DISCUSSION: Senator T aylor inquired if there was a suggestion to help fix the shortage of nurses and medical professionals across the State in both rural and urban areas. Mr . Birnbaum replied there was a shortage across the U.S., not just Idaho. TESTIMONY : Michael McGrane , Idaho Nurses Association, registered to testify in support of H 213 . He stated currently there were an estimated 2,000 open positions in the State of Idaho. 1,500 of those positions were covered by traveling nurses, who were under contract at a very high premium price and come from out of state on a temporary basis. There was no commitment to the community , which was not a sustainable solution to the shortage problem. Robert V ande Merwe , Idaho Health Care Association, registered in support of H 213 . He stated the problem was not in attracting nurses, it was more about where they went to work when they graduated, as more urban areas pay more than rural. MOTION: Senator Lee declared a 39H.

H 162 HEAL TH - Amends, repeals, and adds to existing law to revise terminology and other provisions regarding virtual health care. Senator Lee explained this expanded access to virtual technologies while still ensuring patient safety and the Idaho community's standard of care. It updated the Pharmacy Practice Act to allow virtual care technologies to establish a patient provider relationship, and required anyone providing those services to adhere to Idaho's rules, regulations, and laws. TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT : Claudia T ucker , Senior V ice President, Government Af fairs, T eledoc Health testified in support of H 162 , as they were the world's largest telehealth provider . She stated this ensured that an Idaho licensed provider could use their clinical expertise and professional standards to make sure the care they gave to an Idaho resident met the Idaho standard of care. It also aligned with the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSB), an organization that every state medical board belonged to, including Idaho. Francoise Cleveland , AARP Idaho, registered to testify in support of H 162 . She stated older adults and individuals with disabilities would greatly benefit from telehealth services, especially those with physical limitations and within rural communities who experienced additional barriers when they sought in-person care. DISCUSSION: V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked for clarification on what a 'static online questionnaire' was. Senator Lee replied it was a broad questionnaire that collected very basic information, was similar with all patients, and allowed the patient to acquire a prescription for controlled substance medications with ease.

PRESENT A TION: Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities. Christine Pisani , Executive Director , Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities, explained the Council was authorized by federal and state law to monitor service systems and policies, and advocate for improved services that enabled Idahoans with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live meaningful lives in their home communities. The Council contracted with the Criminal Justice Program at Boise State University to complete three separate studies. The findings and recommendations of the first study released last spring, in 2022 were contained in today's presentation. Dr . Layne Gillespie and Dr . Jessica W ells conducted the study focused on stakeholder interviews to understand the current challenges and successes in handling abuse, neglect and exploitation reports from people with disabilities (see Attachment 1). Jennifer Zielinski , Executive Director , Idaho Anti-Human T raf ficking Coalition stated their non-profit organization provided services directly to victims and survivors of human traf ficking throughout the state. The Coalition focused on education, training, awareness, advocacy , and systemic change (see Attachment 2). DISCUSSION: V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked if someone was missing, was it not reported or could they not identify it. Ms. Zielinski replied it was referred to as a push-pull ef fect. There was not any county , judicial or jurisdictional policies that defined a missing person, so the Coalition advocated for evaluating why that child was missing and questioned was somebody pulling that child to them or were they running away from abuse or exploitation within the home. In their advocacy ef forts, any child who goes missing should be declared as missing.

H 63 COUNSELORS AND THERAPISTS - Adds to existing law to provide that no counselor or therapist will be required to counsel or serve a client regarding goals, outcomes, or behaviors that conflict with the sincerely held principles of the counselor or therapist. Representative Julianne Y oung explained the bill provided conscience protections for Idaho counseling professionals, and ensured that counselors could be transparent about their values. The 2014 American Counseling Association (ACA) Code of Ethics contained a significant shift stipulating that counselors refrained from referring prospective and current clients based solely on the counselor's personally held values, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. It required counselors to support client goals that are in direct conflict with the counselor . DISCUSSION: Senator W introw inquired as to how a counselor would know if they were counseling someone whose outcomes or behaviors would be in conflict. Representative Y oung replied there would be some discussion about why they were seeking care, and whether they should move forward. Senator W introw inquired when counseling an individual and something came up, could the counselor ethically terminate that relationship and make a referral to another counselor . Representative Y oung replied it would work the same as the current referral process. Senator T aylor asked if there was a recent change to the profession that justified a right of conscience on behalf of the therapist, as he did not see the verbiage referred to in the ACA Code of Ethics. Representative Y oung answered she did cover that change in her introduction when she referred to the ACA Code of Ethics in 2014. TESTIMONY : Chad Y ates , Idaho Counseling Association, testified in opposition of H 63 . He stated if this bill were passed, he believed it would violate their counseling code of ethics, as they had training to refer clients under necessary conditions, and to work ef fectively with clients who had dif ferent beliefs and value systems. Monique Barber testified in opposition of H 63 . She stated how to balance sincerely held principles with ef fective counseling was taught in accredited graduate programs and were required in ongoing education. She believed it promoted unethical and unprofessional behavior that had the potential to cause harm, promote discrimination, and had a disproportionately negative impact on rural Idahoans where there were fewer mental health practitioners. Peggy McFarland testified in support of H 63 . She explained that therapists who trained Medicaid children were required to assess them birth to age 18 for sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. Parents were not informed that these questions were being asked when a child's self-diagnosis and new gender identity therapists were required to use a critical race theory gender af firming model to help that child transition socially and medically . Parents who disagreed were labeled as oppressive and discriminatory . Lianna Erickson-T rembath testified in opposition of H 63 based on the 2014 ACA Code of Ethics, section 1 1, 'V alues Within T ermination and Referral. Counselors are to refrain from referring prospective and current clients based solely on the counselor's personally held values and attitudes, beliefs and behaviors'. She stated it was her ethical responsibility to work with all clients who requested services just as a doctor or nurse did not have the right to refuse service to patients who verbalize dif ferent beliefs, politics, religion, sexual orientation, or any other personal belief system. Dr . Bethany T ownsend , President, Idaho Association for Counselor Education and Supervision, testified in opposition of H 63 . She stated that not only did this violate the ACA Code of Ethics, it would ef fect the healing of the client if the counselor were to terminate that relationship because of something they didn't agree with. DISCUSSION: Senator Bjerke asked when the ACA code of Ethics was last updated. Dr . T ownsend replied in 2014. TESTIMONY : Amanda Arnold testifies in opposition to H 63 . She stated not only did this legislation pose significant risks to client welfare, but it was also unnecessary . Counselors already had the ability to ethically refer clients to another provider if they did not believe they had the necessary skills or training to work with that particular client. Holly Humphreys testified in support of H 63 . She stated it protected the therapist, the client, the families, evenly and equally , regardless of what they believed. Cameron Baxter testified in support of H 63 . He stated by forcing the counselor to provide services contrary to their core values impeded them from exercising their best judgment and ensuring best practices for protecting the interests and needs of their clients. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Thursday , March 09, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Brian Smith testified in opposition of H 63 . He stated many of those clients were already at a significantly higher risk for self-harm and suicide. The lack of trust in the counseling profession, which would accompany passage of this bill, would only worsen their situation. Joy Huffman testified in support of H 63 . She stated because people seeking treatment deserve a transparent choice in their mental health care. She believed that forcing counselors to treat clients who had goals that conflict with their deeply held beliefs would be a deterrence in drawing counselors into the profession. W e did not need another wave of health professionals who were hampered or driven from the profession because they were being forced to render treatment that went against their sincerely held beliefs during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked if her code of ethics, as a nurse, required her to treat people who had behaviors that she were of fended by or had a deeply held conscience against. Ms. Huffman replied that was dif ferent where counselors actually needed to be able to have goals in mind for their clients that they were treating so they could help them attain those goals to the very best of their ability . TESTIMONY : Heather McPhie testified in support of H 63 . She stated she had deliberately sought counselors and therapists who had sincerely held principles and professionals who were firmly converted to specific principles. Mark Hand testified in support of H 63 . He stated he needed protection from other professionals and systems that were becoming increasingly intolerant to any belief, ideal or conviction that would not align with the cookie cutter approach to practice. DISCUSSION: Senator Bjerke asked what the impending issue was that he was worried about when breaking of f that relationship and referring that claim. Mr . Hand stated he was not necessarily in fear of anything that had to do with his relationship with his client. What this bill enableh him to do was talk to other providers that he worked with and explain why it would benefit the client to refer them to another provider . Senator Bjerke asked if it was about the possibility of not having the personal freedom of speech to express to another provider or a fellow clinician his thoughts on the clinical outcome or potential of that client. Mr . Hand replied yes. His experience at grad school showed it had become intolerant in some of those professions. He would want to speak freely without fear of losing his job or license. Stephanie Alvarez registered in support of H 63 . She found it dif ficult to be forced to operate in certain areas that were outside her scope of expertise, areas that were in contrast to her background and belief system. Dena Garbett testified in support of H 63 . She stated it not only posed a threat for professionals, but more importantly for parents who sought counseling for their children. Parents should have the highest clearance to information about the professionals their children have direct contact with. MOTION: V ice Chairman Zuiderveld motioned to send H 63 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Bjerke seconded the motion. ROLL CALL VOTE: Chairman V anOrden could not discern the voice vote, she called for a roll call vote. Chairman V anOrden , V ice Chairman Zuiderveld , and Senator Bjerke voted aye. Senators Lee , W introw , and T aylor voted Nay . Senator Harris was excused. The motion failed.

Representative V ander W oude explained in processing the bill and talking to the Chairman and the Director of Health and W elfare, this bill needed to be sent to the amending order . It needed to strike out line 12, with eligibility criteria included, so the change had to be in financial eligibility criteria only . MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send H 192 to the 14th order for possible amendments. Senator Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote .

CONVENED: Chairman V anOrden called the meeting of the Health and W elfare Committee (Committee) to order at 2:15 p.m. GUBERNA T ORIAL REAPPOINTMENT : Committee Consideration of the Gubernatorial Reappointment of Mark Bowen to the Board of Environmental Quality . Mr . Bowen stated he had a consulting engineering background. His first appointment to the Board was in 2018, and was seeking reappointment for 2023. DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked what one of the biggest challenges he foresaw was, or if there was something he thought the Committee should know . Mr . Bowen responded that one of the big challenges the State of Idaho faced right now was funding for infrastructure in smaller communities, as those systems had aged dramatically . Senator W introw inquired as to how he plans to balance safety as well as ef ficiency . Mr . Bowen replied one must struggle with competing interests, and believed it was a conversation that needed to be had. The decision makers were the ones who must to make those judgments. Senator T aylor invoked Senate Rule 39 H for a possible conflict of interest. S 1 154 HEAL TH - Amends existing law to clarify requirements for criminal history and background checks for potential temporary caregivers. Senator Lee explained last year , a piece of legislation was passed that allowed family caregivers to temporarily help children who were at risk of entering the foster care system, which required a background check. This bill would allow the Department of Health and W elfare to obtain that check at no cost to the caregiver . MOTION: Senator Harris moved to send S 1 154 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator W introw seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . H 264 GEST A TIONAL AGREEMENTS ACT - Adds to existing law to enact the Gestational Agreements Act. Representative Green stated this bill codified into statute best practices the Idaho surrogacy industry already used. Currently there was no statutory law in Idaho that addressed surrogacy . Representative Healey explained the Gestational Carrier Agreement protected the parents, the gestational carrier , and the baby . Currently , the names of both parents were not on the original birth certificate. Idaho mandated a court process to remove the name of the surrogate from the birth certificate, and add the child's prents to it. The bill would help create a more smooth process after the baby was born for the surrogate, and less of a burden for the child's parents. TESTIMONY : Jacqueline W akefield testified in opposition, stating that contrary to the proposed statute, there was intent to protect the welfare of children born. It fails to protect the unborn children involved in the process, as some of those procedures involved in that technology resulted in embryos frozen, destroyed, or subject to experimentation. She submitted written testimony . DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked if her opposition was to the in vitro fertilization (IVF) or to the enforceable agreements that could protected all parties involved. Ms. W akefield replied it failed to protect the unborn. Senator Lee asked if there was a specific part of the bill identified that was bothersome, or was there something that could be added to the bill to enable her support. Ms. W akefield replied it did not protect unborn children, and asked to submit written testimony for the record. TESTIMONY : Breanna Shrenk testified in support of H 264 . She stated as a surrogate, she had carried for four families. She said the most challenging part was the mandatory court process that she was forced to attend 3 days after she delivered the baby , that terminated her right to the child, when she was aware the child was not hers to begin with. Karen Simkins testified in opposition of H 264 . She stated the bill was representative of a tourism industry in Idaho that was unregulated and needed study from the Committee to consider how it af fected families. Emily Naugle registered in opposition to H 264 . Heather Seychelle testified in support of H 264 . She explained she was disappointed with the mandatory court process that placed their name on their baby's birth certificate, as she was made to inform the judge why they would be good parents. She felt that if she had given birth to the child herself, she would not need to explain to a judge that she would be a good parent. She did not feel this was a fair process. Megan W old , Right to Life Idaho, testified in opposition of H 264 . She urged the Committee to reconsider the bill, as the purpose was to facilitate contracts consistent with Idaho's public policy . Idaho Code prevented a surrogate contract from limiting a surrogate's right to make personal decisions to safeguard her health or the embryo or fetus she carried. She stated that language could allow a surrogate to obtain an abortion if she believed it was in the interest of her mental or emotional health, despite any objection of the intended parents. Melissa Sherman, Selenia Prado, Shannon Rayner , Renee Rippey , Dr . Kevin Maas, Idaho Center for Reproductive Medicine, Y uki Moss, Shaylan Pease, Jennifer Ellsworth, V aughn Ellsworth, and Sarah Edmunds, testified in support of H 264 , as each of them were not able to have children of their own without the assistance of a surrogate. Crystal Kulack testified in support of H 264 . She explained she was a surrogate who assisted the Sherman's to have their own family . She stated the questions asked at the court hearing were redundant and unnecessary , as the contract had already been created by the medical professionals. The terms of that contract were clearly understood by all parties, and was signed and notarized before the embryo was ever placed in her womb. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , March 13, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 DISCUSSION: V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked if this bill stated that life began at the time of conception. Representative Green answered that was not in the scope of what the bill attempted to obtain. V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked how many gestational carriers were egg donors that resided in Idaho. Representative Green replied she did not know what that number was. V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked how much money a carrier received for carrying the child, and if that could be considered human traf ficking. Representative Green stated some were compensated and some were not, as there was no expectation in the contract. They attempted to put provisions in place to ensure protection against the human traf ficking of babies, because they were aware that process was a possibility . V ice Chairman Zuiderveld inquired if the gestational agreement gave the carrier the right to abort the unborn child. Representative Green stated it was to ensure the mother could do what was necessary for her health and the baby . MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send H 264 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator W introw seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vot e. V ice Chairman Zuiderveld requested she be recorded as voting nay .

GUBERNA T ORIAL REAPPOINTMENT VOTE: Senator T aylor moved to send the Gubernatorial Reappointment of Mark Bowen to the floor with the recommendation he be confirmed by the Senate. Senator W introw seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . H 61 TELEHEAL TH ACCESS ACT - Adds to existing law to provide for mental and behavioral health care . Representative Y oung explained it created an interstate compact with mental health providers from other states through a registration process. The word 'credential' was removed and replaced with 'registration'. DISCUSSION: Senator Harris inquired as to why 'registered' replaced 'credential'. Representative Y oung stated the insurance provider used 'credential' in a dif ferent context to avoid confusion. Senator Harris asked why registration was a better term to use, as both words had dif ferent meaning. Representative Y oung believed in terms of the legislation, there were concerns that the term 'credential' would somehow be interpreted as the equivalent of an insurance credential. Senator T aylor asked why an out of state provider would only pay $35 dollar fee per year where a provider in Idaho would pay $125 dollars. Representative Y oung responded the out of state provider would need to pay the licensing fees in their home state. Senator W introw inquired how a provider licensed in another state could practice in Idaho through a computer . Representative Y oung stated that currently , Idaho prohibited telehealth. Senator W introw asked how Idaho could hold a registered, out of state provider accountable, who was not licensed in this State. Representative Y oung stated that provider may not meet Idaho's exact requirements, however those requirements would be similar . V ice Chairman Zuiderveld asked when the provider filled out the registration paperwork, what the dif ference would be between that registration and the credential information that they would need to share. Representative Y oung stated the bill stipulated what information must be included. Senator Bjerke asked in creating this compact with other states, how much it would help address Idaho's behavioral health needs. Representative Y oung replied it could help make providers more accessible. Senator T aylor inquired as to how prescribing medication through telehealth would be addressed, as it does not require an initial in person visit. Representative Y oung stated prescribing would be regulated, as it was for other Idaho providers providing telehealth care. Senator W introw asked how an out of state provider could legally practice telehealth if they moved to Idaho and still held their license in another state. Representative Y oung was not sure how that would work. TESTIMONY : Rod Furniss testified in support of H 061 . As an insurance agent, telehealth had become a popular way to give care, which reduced cost over time. It had become live saving. Senator Harris asked if insurance companies were comfortable covering registered doctors who practiced in Idaho. Mr . Furniss replied he was informed the physician would need to be duly licensed to receive money back or be paid by the insurance company . This included partial 061. Deborah Katz , Executive Director , Idaho Psychological Association, and Dr . James Madara , Idaho Medical Association, submitted written testimony against H 061 . Chad Y ates, Idaho Counseling Association, testified in opposition of H 061 . Mr . Y ates informed the Committee that although the bill prohibits the licensee from practicing in a way that exceeded their training, there was no reliable way to enforce that under the bill. The term 'substantially similar' was inadequate when determining training standards. Compact legislation had been introduced and implemented in over 18 states. The counseling compact created a shared, interstate license and data system that was developed to allow near-instant verification of licensure, status, and disciplinary information, where H 061 did not. Senator W introw asked what the benefit of license and registration was to a compact. Ms. Hatter stated compacts were an interstate licensure data system, developed for patient safety , where the provider license was checked. Senator W introw asked what the accountability piece was and what authority the licensing board had in regards to patient safety . Ms. Hatter answered the licensing board that reviewed provider credentials, and those licensing requirements must be met. Under H 061 , the licensing board could report that bad actor to the licensing state, however , that state was not required to revoke that license, whereas in a compact, their license would be revoked. Senator W introw inquired if the bill was more about access or insurance. Ms. Hatter stated her understanding was that the provider must be licensed in the State of Idaho to receive those benefits. Senator Harris asked if there was an issue with insurance coverage by out-of-state providers. Representative Y oung replied some claims could be partially paid, where others were considered out of network. MOTION: Senator Lee moved to send H 061 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Bjerke seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . Senator T aylor and Senator W introw asked they be recorded as voting nay . PRESENT A TION: Ideal Option. T im Kilgallon explained this was an addition treatment center in Idaho. He wished to inform the Committee about some dramatic changes that were taking place in the drug supply in the streets of and in the back roads of Idaho and in the rest of the country (see Attachment 1). SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , March 14, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Chairman V anOrden asked what the average cost per person for treatment was. Mr . Kilgallon replied $250 per visit was the average. Chairman V anOrden asked if that included prescription medication. Mr . Kilgallon replied no. That cost was $30 per month through the pharmacy . Senator W introw asked how many patients have been treated. Mr . Kilgallon replied just over one thousand.

CONVENED: Chairman V anOrden called the meeting of the Senate Health and W elfare Committee (Committee) to order at 2:12 p.m. H 212 HEAL TH AND SAFETY - Amends safety law to clarify that certain schools and after-school programs do not need a daycare license. Representative Erickson was excused. Kate Haas , Kestrel W est, presented. She explained during the rules process, a section of code was not reflected in the bill that defined child for the purposes of a daycare, as anyone up to age 13, so not to license aftercare programs with school age children. The other piece this bill did was strike out private or religious schools as an exemption. She asked the bill be sent to the amending order . DISCUSSION: Chairman V anOrden asked what it would read with the amendment on the bill. Ms. Haas replied it would read 'the operation of day camps, programs and religious schools for less than 12 weeks during a calendar year or not more often than once a week, and after school programs for children over four years of age or in kindergarten.' MOTION: V ice Chairman Zuiderveld moved to send H 212 to the 14th order for possible amendment. Senator Lee seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . HCR 5 RULE REJECTION - HEAL TH AND WELF ARE - States findings of the Legislature and rejects certain rules of the Department of Health and W elfare relating to residential assisted living facilities. Representative Healey explained there were times when the patient of an assisted living facility may need to move into a skilled nursing facility due to an open pressure wound. There were times when that wound could be treated by a wound care nurse already employed at the assisted living facility . This had created a large burden for the patient and any family they resided with. TESTIMONY : Heidi Brough Nye testified in opposition of HCR 5 . She stated as the owner of an assisted living facility , she did not provide a level of care required in a skilled nursing home did. Level three and level four pressure ulcers were open wounds to the bone, and that type of care was not appropriate for an assisted living environment, as they were not trained to provide that kind of medical care. DISCUSSION: Senator Lee asked if there were other states that she was aware of that had rules regarding these issues. Ms. Brough Nye replied no, level three and four pressure ulcers were not allowed in assisted living facilities, which was mandated by the federal government. That type of care was mandated for a nursing home, as the federal government has put so many constructs in place to guide nursing homes and how they provided care. Senator Lee asked without that rule, would you have the discretion to say we no longer have the capacity to care for the resident, which made it the decision of the assisted living facility rather than the state's regulatory framework. Ms. Brough Nye replied yes, at any point a facility could say that they were not able to provide for the resident's care. Senator Bjerke inquired what was the level of care provided to the residents at an assisted living facility . Ms. Brough Nye replied an assisted living provides for someone's care and comfort. They provided things like assistance with the tasks of daily living; bathing, dressing, medication management, housekeeping, and meals. In their setting, we provided those types of things as someone's health care needs changed. Our contract says that we provided for their care and comfort, and as their needs changed, up until the point that we could no longer do that. Senator Bjerke asked if assisted living facilities of fered dif ferent levels of care. Ms. Brough Nye stated that larger facilities could provide dif ferent levels of care. Senator Bjerke asked if there were some assisted living facilities that would accept a patient to remain in the facility with a stage three or four ulcer that needed treatment. Ms. Brough Nye replied yes, if they partnered with a home health agency . TESTIMONY : Robert V ande Merwe , Executive Director , Idaho Health Care Association, testified in support of HCR 5 . He stated the ombudsman for the elderly told him they like the rule change because it supported the residents right to choose. Those residents were in favor of regulation. Angela Hilleshiem testified in support of HCR 5 . She explained as the nursing shortage became greater , they needed more nurses to collaborate. That process would go for home health and hospice and come into assisted living facilities. The assisted living care staf f attend to the daily cares, so the nurses needed to coordinate and collaborate on this care with one another . Nancy Hollis testified in support of HCR 5 . She stated the rule change would bring back residents. She had a registered nurse and two licensed practical nurses on staf f at her facility , and they made the decision whether or not they could take care of this wound correctly , properly and safely , just as they were trained to do. MOTION: Senator W introw moved to send HCR 5 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Bjerke seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote .

Senator V anOrden announced the remaining Minutes for approval would be taken up at later date. H 193 Health - Amends existing law to clarify provisions regarding essential caregivers and to require health care facilities to establish policies regarding essential caregivers . Representative Y oung invited Senator Bjerke to open the presentation. Senator Bjerke . He stated the inspiration for the bill was based on numerous concerns from constituents over their experiences with hospital visitation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill would modify the existing Essential Caregivers Act passed during the last Legislative Session. Passing this bill would ensure that a patient's rights to visitation were protected and it would prepare the State for any future health crisis. Representative Y oung explained the bill clarified that an essential caregiver had the right to visit a patient in-person. A patient could have more than one essential caregiver and the medical facility could not limit how many essential caregivers a person had, however , a medical facility could limit the amount of essential caregivers a patient could see at one time. DISCUSSION: Senator Harris questioned how those facilities were to train staf f in such a short period of time. Representative Y oung indicated health care facilities already knew what was expected of the process of designating an essential caregiver . Senator Harris asked about the new language and expressed confusion on how it could be considered a new statute. Representative Y oung remarked it was new language but the requirement to allow patients to designate essential caregivers was existing. Senator W introw asked why it was necessary to redefine an essential caregiver rather than creating a bill that protected visitors from being denied. Representative Y oung answered there was not any statute regarding this issue. Senator T aylor voiced his concern over the bill's narrow definition of essential caregiver and asked why it was necessary . Representative Y oung commented the modification of the definition of an essential caregiver was done in a way that better aligned with the intent of the bill. Senator W introw asked for clarification on the restrictions a health care facility could place on essential caregivers. Representative Y oung stated that a health care facility could not limit the number of essential caregivers a patient had, but could restrict how many essential caregivers could see a patient at one time. Senator Bjerke asked if the term \"private action\" replaced more strict statute language as part of a compromise. Representative Y oung did not believe that was the case. TESTIMONY : V ictoria Horn testified in opposition to H 193 . She stated she was concerned with certified family homes being included in the language of the bill and preferred to see it removed. She claimed the addition of certified family homes into the bill placed further restrictions on their policies and procedures. Those facilities were already bound by other regulations regarding patient visitation in Idaho Code. She pointed out certified family homes were fundamentally dif ferent than other health care facilities and did not need to be placed under the same requirements as other facilities. DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked Ms. Horn for confirmation on whether certified family homes and other similar care facilities were included under the requirements of the bill. Ms. Horn confirmed that was the case. Senator Bjerke asked what the scenarios would be if a certified family home denied a patient's visitor . Ms. Horn explained certified family homes were already bound to allow visitation under most circumstances unless they posed a danger to the patient. Senator Bjerke asked if the bill would place more restrictions on certified family homes. Ms. Horn believed that was the case. Chairman V anOrden called T oni Lawson, Idaho Hospital Association (IHA), up to answer any questions the Committee had. Senator Harris asked Ms. Lawson for her opinion on the staf f training requirement and if hospitals could train their staf f in time if the bill became law . Ms. Lawson stated hospitals would be in an immediate violation of compliance if the bill were signed into law the way it was currently written. Senator Harris asked what would happen if a hospital were in violation. Ms. Lawson explained if a hospital were in violation of this provision, the licensure could be impacted. Senator Harris asked how long she thought it would take for hospitals to be in compliance with that kind of requirement. Ms. Lawson stated the IHA would prefer to have this bill set July 1, 2023 as the compliance date to give hospitals time to train staf f. She emphasized to the Committee that hospital procedures could not change instantaneously and hospitals needed more time to ensure they SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Thursday , March 16, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 were going to be in compliance with the law . Senator Bjerke asked how quickly hospitals could comply with the statute when the original Essential Caregivers Act was enacted the prior year . Ms. Lawson was unsure exactly how quickly each hospital came into compliance of that law . Senator W introw asked what the process was for a patient if they thought they were a visitor . Ms. Lawson answered every hospital had a grievance process for complaints if a patient believed their rights were violated. Senator Bjerke pointed out that during the COVID-19 pandemic some visitors did not have enough time to file complaints and seek administrative relief before their loved one passed away . He asked how hospitals would deal with those kinds of situations. Ms. Lawson observed during the COVID-19 pandemic hospitals were bound by the federal government to institute strict visitation policies and violation of these polices could result in staf f losing their license. She mentioned that hospitals had learned a lot about these policies and procedures during the pandemic and would handle the situation dif ferently now . Senator Bjerke asked if this bill could help hospitals in their relationship with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS). Ms. Lawson replied that while the intent of the bill was to help hospitals, it puts hospitals in the middle of two dif ferent sets of rules and expectations between the State and CMS. Senator Harris asked if there were any amendments that could be made to the bill to help Idaho hospitals. Ms. Lawson explained that the main sections of the bill that posed a problem for hospitals was the emergency clause of enactment, as there were sections of the bill that violated CMS rules. MOTION: Senator Harris moved to send H 193 to the 14th Order of Business for possible amendment. Senator W introw seconded the motion. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Senator Bjerke moved to send H 193 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion failed by voice vote . F AILED SUBSTITUTE MOTION AND VOTE ON ORIGINAL MOTION: Chairman V anOrden said the original motion is now before the Committee. The motion to send H 193 to the floor for possible amendment was carried by voice vote . H 244 Health - Amends existing law to provide in-person visitation rights for residents in certain facilities and to provide that visitation shall not be precluded based on vaccination status . Representative Y oung detailed the provisions of the bill and how it would af fect patient visitation. She explained the bill added new language to Idaho Code which stated a facility could not require precautions for visitors that were more stringent than what was required by the staf f of the facility . She stated this established parity and guaranteed fairness for visitors and staf f. The bill established that no individual would be denied visitation of a patient on the preclusion of vaccination status. She mentioned patients had the right to deny visits from individuals who were not vaccinated, but the healthcare facility itself could not make that determination. DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked if the bill would require potential visitors to be vaccinated for the same diseases that were required of staf f in order to visit. Representative Y oung clarified that discrimination based upon vaccination status was prohibited, but that all other precautions that were required of staf f was also required of visitors. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Thursday , March 16, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 3 TESTIMONY : V iki Purdy testified in opposition of H 244 . She stated it required visitors to take the same precautions as the staf f of the healthcare facility . She believed it would add another barrier between the patient's family and other potential visitors. She expressed concern that public health facilities would be penalized if complaints were filed against them for failing to enforce this section of the bill. MOTION: Senator Bjerke moved to send H 244 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion passed by a voice vote . H 215 Insurance - Amends existing law to provide for enforcement of provisions applicable to pharmacy benefit managers . Representative Redman explained this bill added additional amendments to a previous law regarding pharmacy benefit mangers (PBM). These amendments would create an enforcement policy for this section of Idaho Code, and would entrust the authority of enforcement to the Department of Insurance. MOTION: Senator Harris moved to send H 215 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator T aylor seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . H 291 Fair Pharmacy Audits Act - Adds to existing law to implement the Fair Pharmacy Audits Act . Representative Redman reported H 291 established uniform and minimum standards and criteria for auditing pharmacy records on behalf of PBMs. He highlighted how the legislation was created to defend small business pharmacies in Idaho from overreach and unfair practices from PBMs. Pam Eaton , Chief Executive Of ficer , Idaho Retailers Association, expanded on how PBMs audit pharmacies and how the current system created harm for local pharmacies. She mentioned there were no uniform standards and procedures on how the audit was performed. Pharmacies had no expectations on how each audit would proceed and no way to prepare for these audits. This bill established a uniform criteria and standard for those audits and specified charge backs could not be based on clerical or recordkeeping errors. TESTIMONY : Korey Kreider , Donald Smith, T yler Higgins, Idaho State Pharmacy Association, Will Edwards, and Douglas Fuchs all testified in favor of H 291 . All of those who testified spoke to the flaws of the current audit system and how it had ef fected their particular business. They expressed their support for the proposed audit standards and indicated that this bill would benefit small, independent pharmacies the most. MOTION: Senator W introw moved to send H 291 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote .

Mr . Cyr gave a brief overview of his background. He stated he was involved in environmental issuses in the Kootenai County area for quite some time. Senator W introw asked what role he would play on the board, and what were some of his experiences and personal skills that would make him a good board member . Mr . Cyr stated he sat on multiple Committees, which included the Coeur d'Alene Lake Advisory Committee. He was involved in air quality issues from 2000-2006. GUBERNA T ORIAL APPOINTMENT : Committee Consideration of the Gubernatorial Appointment of John Sigler to the Board of Environmental Quality (DEQ) , for a term commencing March 8, 2023 and expiring July 1, 2023. Mr . Sigler gave an extensive overview of his background in natural resources. Senator W introw asked why he was a good fit for the board position. Mr . Sigler replied the last 50 years of his career gave him a perspective that was quite unique. He had dabbled in water quality since 1972 when he was working on his Masters in Bear Lake, which required a fairly extensive set of water chemistry studies along the western shore, as well as using radioactive carbon 14 to measure primary productivity . Y ears later he worked on primary productivity in Lake Powell after it had filled the well of two locations. GUBERNA T ORIAL APPOINTMENT : Committee Consideration of the Gubernatorial Appointment of LeAnn Gelskey to the Commission for the Blind & V isually Impaired , for a term commencing October 13, 2022 and expiring July 1, 2025.

HJM 4 W A TER QUALITY ST ANDARDS - States findings of the Legislature declaring opposition to EP A proposed rules regarding water quality standards. Senator Harris explained Idaho had one of the most sophisticated water quality standards in the United States, The EP A had proposed a rule to get rid of all water quality standards and favored going to an unknown standard based in 1850. TESTIMONY : Scott Hauser , Executive Director of the Upper Snake River T ribes Foundation, testified in opposition of HJM 4 . He stated in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EP A) proposed rules, in part was a response to the failure of Idaho's process to recognize tribal treaty and reserved rights for tribal health and meaningful engagement and collaborate with Idaho tribes. Jonathan Oppenheimer , External Relations Director , Idaho Conservation League, testified in opposition of HJM 4 . He explained the proposed rule addressed required the EP A to consider tribal reserve treaty rights when approving statewide water quality standards. In addition, that rule would require states to include analysis on how proposed water quality standards account for and comply with any applicable tribal reserved rights as part of their overall water quality standards. From their perspective, nothing in that EP A rule would mandate any retroactivity to review . DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked if this rule were finalized by the EP A, would those future water quality standards need to be consistent with treaty reserves. Mr . Oppenheimer replied Idaho spent a lot of time determining their water quality standards. Those studies that were done by both the Nez Perce T ribes and the Shoshone Bannock T ribes, looked at relative rates of fish consumption and the cancer risk associated with eating that fish because of mercury content in particular . The water quality standards that were established by Idaho and approved by EP A took those into consideration. Senator W introw asked if there would be fears about water quality , where rules might be set in place that would interfere with tribal treaties. Mr . Oppenheimer replied yes, there were obligations made between the United States government and Native American tribes that needed to be adhered to, as they pre-dated the statehood of Idaho. Senator W introw asked what he saw as the problem going forward with HJM 4 . Mr . Oppenheimer stated it did not recognize the commitment made to Native American T ribes. TESTIMONY : Alex LaBeau , President, Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry , testified in support of HJM 4 . He stated their organization was deeply involved in the last process when they established Idaho's water quality standards. They had come to the legislature and asked for a grant for a study that was completed by Boise State University to figure out exactly how much fish our populations consumed. The reason the EP A wanted to do that on a broad, nationwide scale was because if the state was not able to comply with the water quality standards of that state, then every single permit would be put into a process of variance, which means every single detail within your permit had to be renegotiated through a process. DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked how the language in the bill made it sound like it undermined tribal treaties. Mr . LaBeau replied there was nothing the State of Idaho could do to undermine those treaties. MOTION: Senator Bjerke moved to send HJM 4 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Harris seconded the motion. The motion passed by voice vote . Senator W introw and Senator T aylor asked they be recorded as voting nay . HCR 9 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION - States findings of the Legislature and establishing a task force to study Medicaid Managed Care and to make recommendations to the Legislature. Representative Redman explained this resolution would bring stakeholders from around the state together to consider dif ferent options to gain stability , not only with the budget, but also with the quality of care. He believed the findings from this task force would give us clarity for our state Medicaid program going forward. SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , March 20, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked if the disabled community was incorporated into that group to provide input. Representative Redman replied yes. TESTIMONY : Brian Whitlock , Idaho Hospital Association, testified in support of HCR 9 . He stated providers around the state wanted a program that was sustainable, and that supported budget predictability . In evaluation of containing the costs of Medicaid, the impact of such loss of access to care and adverse health outcomes must be considered. DISCUSSION: Senator W introw asked what should be considered as the task force moved forward to address those things. Mr . Whitlock stated cost containment could not be looked at in a vacuum. In the words of this resolution, they gave him hope and some promise that it was more than just cost containment, as those beneficiaries of the Medicaid program need to have a say in that. Senator W introw asked if there were individuals that had recommendations of who should be on that list to provide that to the Legislative Council and make sure no one was left out, or was there a process by which he was thinking. Representative Redman responded that he believed there were lists going around and spoken about that with Ledge Council. The chairman on the House side had some ideas on that as well. MOTION: Senator T aylor moved to send HCR 9 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Bjerke seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . H 161 PUBLIC ASSIST ANCE - Amends existing law to establish provisions regarding work requirements for participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Representative Andrus explained he brought the bill because he was on a mission to get people back to work that were able. He introduced Scott Centrino, Foundation for Government Accountability , who gave further explanation. Mr . Certrino stated there was a work requirement for able bodied adults without dependents, and a general work requirement, which applied to a broader population. Senator W introw asked what the eligibility was, how many people would be af fected and what the amount of the budget was. Representative Redman replied eligibility in general was 130 percent of the federal poverty level. Idaho was higher because of the categorical eligibility . There were no requirements to have a disability or the need to meet other conditions of eligibility under federal law . Senator W introw asked what amount of money were we talking about, especially in an economy where people were struggling, as she did not want that to be harmful. Representative Redman replied he did not have the exact administrative costs in the budget. MOTION: Senator Bjerke moved to send H 161 to the floor with a do pass recommendation. Senator Zuiderveld seconded the motion. The motion carried by voice vote . Senator W introw asked to be recorded as voting nay .

Representative Gallagher explained the Idaho legislature could ensure state sovereignty from federal overreach of currently legal dietary supplements. This bill did not prevent future Idaho legislative action on any specific dietary supplement. The bill guaranteed free market access of the current dietary supplements to our citizens and health care providers. She referenced a very large Idaho company that sold health products and supplements, and provided 1700 jobs to Idahoans. This was Idaho's largest e-commerce company and in the top 100 in North America as of 2020. DISCUSSION: Senator T aylor asked if he had heard back from that company . Representative Gallagher replied no. Senator T aylor asked who was trying to introduce the federal legislation. Representative Gallagher replied it was U.S. Senator Dick Durbin. Senator T aylor inquired how federal overreach would af fect the supplement business if they already displayed what would most likely be required on their labels. Representative Gallagher replied the proposed legislation attempted to reclassify those regulations to treat vitamins and supplements as drugs. Senator W introw asked if Idaho passed this legislation, would it conflict with federal law , and would that be something Idaho needed litigate. Representative Gallagher replied several states had legalized marijuana, which was not legal on a federal level. TESTIMONY : Steven Keyser testified in support of H 82 . He stated his wife currently used several supplements that seemed to be very ef fective. Her condition had significantly improved. He believed the issue was a legitimate concern because of the tremendous power , money and influence of the pharmaceutical industries, where if they had more control through the FDA, it would become extremely expensive to go through that approval processes.

H 223 HEAL TH - Amends and repeals existing law to update terminology in the Medical Consent and Natural Death Act.

H 224 HEAL TH - Adds to existing law to prohibit pelvic exams of anesthetized and unconscious patients except under certain circumstances.
