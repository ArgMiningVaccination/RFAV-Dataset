It was conducted at the request of the Iowa Departmen t of Human Services as part of their continuing quality assurance activities. The basis for the survey instrument was the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS\u00ae), which is part of a national effort to evaluate health program s and provide consumers and purchasers with information about the quality of care provided through these program s. CAHPS is sponsored by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ). The CAHPS instrument was modified for use in this study by researchers at The University of Iowa Public Policy Center, in collaboration with the Iowa Department of Human Services (IDHS). The core CAHPS survey instrument was modified to include additional questions about access to care, dental care, and how respondents rec eived information if they had questions about the Medicaid program . Researchers at The University of Iowa Public Policy Center conducted this study with funding provided by the IDHS and the US Department of Health and Human Services Center for Medicare an d Medicaid Services (CMS). Information and conclusions presented in this report are the responsibility of the authors, and do not represent the views of the IDHS, the CMS, the health programs , or The University of Iowa. 2 Contents PREFACE ................................................................................................................................... 2 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS ......................................................................................................... 7 KEY FINDINGS FROM TH E 2014 MEDICAID CONS UMER SURVEYS ...................... 8 MAIN CONCLUSIONS -CHILDREN ................................ ....................................................................... 8 MAIN CONCLUSIONS VS.

Parents ' rating of children on the 17 item Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC 17) indicated that about one in ten children ha d some psychosocial problems. The oral health status of children in Medicaid was rated lower than their general health and lower than other children statewide. Fewer had a dental visit in the past year (73%) than children statewide (89%). The most commonly reported chronic health conditions were attention problems (14%), chronic allergies or sinus problems (13%), and behaviora l or emotional problems (13%) . Behavioral/emotional health status was generally high , with 79% rated excellent or very good; however, of those who needed mental health counseling or treatment, 21% could not get the care they needed. In general, health status, health care and program ratings did not differ across the programs . There were seven domains measured to assess the medical home . Of note with regard to these, most of the ch ildren in Medicaid had a personal doctor (87%), and about one in six parents reported that their child always (57%) received timely care. 39% of children needed care right away in a clinic, ER, or doctor's office in the past 6 months . o Of those who went to an ER (25% of all children) 74% of parents said that the care received could have been provided in a doctor's office. Overall , the 2014 CAHPS ratings are slightly better than in 2013, h owever, they are lower than the national ratings . For instance, the child's health program rating for 2014 was higher than in 2013 (56% vs. 50% rating the program either a 9 or 10). However, the rating was lower than the national rating for Medicaid health plan s. Main conclusions -Adults Adult health status was rated lower than for children and was relatively consistent over time and programs . 75% had one or more chronic heal th condition s, with the most common being: o Allergies, back/neck problems, and migraine headaches . 50% of adults had one or more mental or emotional health condition s - anxiety and depression being the most common (3 8%). Adults rated their oral health lower than their general health . Fewer adults had a regular source of dental care or a dental check -up in the previous year than did children . In general, health status, health care an d program ratings did not differ across the program s. 8 There were seven domains measured to assess the medical home . Of note , o 81% of adult s reported that they have a personal doctor, However, almost half of adult in HMO program (45%) had big problem finding a personal doctor that they liked. o Four in ten adults (38%) reported that they always got timely care , and o About half (48%) reported that they always received proper care coor dination . Access to prescription medication continues to be an issue, as does access to dental care, with 17% of all adults having an unmet need for prescription drugs (this is about one in four adults who takes medicatio n could not get it for any reason) and 13% for dental care . 35% of adults visited an e mergency department in the past 6 months . o Of those who went to an ER 71% said that the care received could have been provided in a doct or's office. Less than half of adult Medicaid members reported that they had a preventive visits in the past year . Overall, the 2014 CAHPS ratings are slightly better than the 2013 ratings , however, they are lower th an the national data. For instance, the adult's Medicaid program rating for 2014 was higher than in 2013 (43% vs. 41% rating the program either a 9 or 10). However, the rating was lower than the national rating for Medicaid health plan s. Main conclusions -SSI vs. Medicaid Children in SSI had lower health status, more chronic conditions , and were more likely to report need for care. However, p arents reported similar ratings in Medical Home care components as well as CAHPS ratings compared to other children in Medicaid (FFS, HMO, and MediPass combined) . Adults in SSI had a lower health status, more chronic conditions , and were more likely to report need for care. Medical home domains and CAHPS ratings were similar to other adult s in Medicaid (FFS, HMO, and MediPass combined). However, adults in SSI were significantly more likely to report a better experience with office staff than other adults in Medicaid (FFS, HMO, and MediP ass combined) . 9 Chapter 1: Introduction and Methods Introduction As part of the ongoing quality assurance activities of Iowa's Medicaid Managed Care Program, the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise (IME) contracted with researchers at The University of Iowa Public P olicy Center to conduct a survey of adults and parents/guardians of children enrolled in the Iowa Medicaid programs. These programs include: 1) MediPASS is the primary care case management (PCCM) model in which members have the opportunity to choose a primary care physician who acts as their primary care case manager; the identified primary care physician then approves use of specialty and emergency services , 2) The Medicaid Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), served through the Meridian Health program, works under a contract with the IME , 3) Traditional Medicaid encompassing a Fee -for-service( FFS) payment mechanism for providers, and 4) The Medicaid Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI), the program for low-income Iowans with disabilities . Income eligible chil dren and adults in counties with a managed care option may choose a MediPASS provider or enroll in the HMO. In counties without a managed care option, children and adults remain in the traditional Fee- for-service (FFS) program. Children and adults with a disability are enrolled into the SSI program which utilizes a fee -for-service payment model . As of August 2014, t here were 115,423 children (less than 18 years old) enrolled in MediPASS, 21,926 children enrolled in the HMO, 5,788 children enrolled in the Medicaid SSI, and there were 19,867 children enrolled in FFS, for at least 6 months with no Medicare Part A or Part B eligibility. As of August 2014 (when the sample was drawn), there were 28,529 adults 18 -64 enrolled in MediPASS ; 8,060 adults ages 18 -64 enr olled in the HMO ; 31,407 adults 18- 64 enrolled in the Medicaid SSI ; and there were 8,081 adults ages 18 -64 enrolled in FFS, for at least 6 months with no Medicare Part A or Part B eligibility. Data from past years, as well as information from the CAHPS Dat abase were used when appropriate. The CAHPS online reporting system that contains National Comparative Data 2 (NCD) for the CAHPS health program s was used when appropriate. Some results from children enrolled in Medicaid are compared t he 2010 Iowa Household Health Survey (IHHS). The 2010 IHHS3 was a population -based statewide 2 Formerly known as National CAHPS Benchmarking Database (NCBD). 3 More i nformation available a t: 10 survey using a mixed -mode data collection. During the core data collection period, 2,386 parent s/guardian s of one randomly selected child age 0 -17 years living in the household particip ated . The data were weighted to account for family size and post - stratified to reflect the 2010 child population in Iowa . Figure 1 -1. Iowa Medicaid managed health care program s by county4, as December 2014. Methodology The Survey of Iowa Medicaid (Title 19) Enrollees was conducted during the fall of 2014 using a mail -back survey methodology with an opportunity to complete the questionnaire online. Questionnaires were mailed to program -stratified random samples of Medicaid members who had been in their cu rrent program for at least six months prior to survey administration . Random samples of child ren were drawn from four health programs (SSI, HMO, MediPASS, and FFS), and random samples of adult s were drawn from four health programs (SSI, HMO, MediPASS, and FFS) from Medicaid enrollment data current as of August 2014. Only one person was selected per household to reduce the relatedness of the responses and respondent burden. The http://ppc.uiowa.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/health/ihhs/hhs_ -_statewide_result.pdf 4 Downloaded from http://dhs.iowa.gov/ime/about/iowa -health -and-wellness -program 11 samples were comprised of 5,400 children (1,350 each from SSI, HMO, MediPASS, and FFS) and 5,400 adults (1,350 each from Medicaid SSI, HMO, MediPASS, and FFS) . In households with more than one child enrolled in Medicaid, one child was selected at random as the \" participant child.\" The survey was addressed to the parent or guardian with instructions to complete the survey based on their experiences obtaining health care for this child only. The initial mailing was sent to 5,400 adults and the parents /guardians of 5,400 child ren, followed by a reminder postcard fourteen days later. A seco nd survey packet was sent to non -respondents two weeks after the reminder card mailing. All the mailings included instructions for an online version of the questionnaire. To maximize response rates for the mailed survey, both a premium and an incentive were used during the first mailing. Each survey packet included a $2 bill. In addition, survey respondents completing the questionnaire within the first two weeks of the study were entered into a random drawing for one of twenty $25 Wal -Mart gift cards. Survey responses were obtained for 1,037 children and 1,036 adults, for unadjusted response rates of 19% for the adult and child surveys (Table 1 -1 and Table 1 -2). After adjusting for members who were not eligible for the study (e.g., moved out of the state, invalid address), the response rates were 22%. Table 1 -1. Sampling and response rates : Children Program Number Sampled Number of Respondents Response Rate SSI 1,350 223 17% HMO 1,350 237 18% FFS 1,350 291 22% 1,037 22% * Adjusted for ineligibles Table 1 -2.

A number of items were added to the CAHPS survey from a variety of sources as listed below. The CAHPS Patient -Centered Medical Home (PCMH) items were added 5. The PCMH items allow to assess Medicaid enrollees with their primary care providers. o In the child surve y, PCMH items assessed the following topic areas: 1) having a personal doctor, 2) timely access to care and use of services, 3) coordination of care, 4) communication with the doctor and interaction with staff, 5) advice about their child's safety and hea lth, 6) shared decision making, and 7) self -management and support. o In the adult survey, PCMH items assessed the following topic areas: 1) having a personal doctor, 2) timely access to care, 3) coordination of care, 4) communication with the doctor and int eractions with staff, 5) comprehensive care, 6) shared decision making, and 7) self - management and support. The Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) screening instrument was developed by the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (CAHMI) , and The Pediatric Symptom Checklist with 17 items (PSC -17) generates 3 indicators identifying attention problems, impairment due to anxiety and/or depression, and conduct problems . Data analysis The data was post -stratified to control for potential systematic biases created from collecting data from a str atified sample by Medicaid program . This simple weighting factor was added to make the data representative of all Medicaid members statewide and adjusted for the fact that there were not equal numbers of members in each Medicaid program (FFS, HMO, and MediPASS). Data were tabulated and bivariate analyses (i.e., chi -square, t -test and nonparametric tests for group differences) were conducted using SPSS. CAHPS composite ratings were analyzed with a SAS macro program developed by the CAHPS team. This program generates CAHPS results adjusted for case -mix variables such as age, education, and health status. The macro, accompanying programs, and documentation are available for download from the C AHPS Survey Users Network web site. 5 More information about the CAPHS PCMH item set can be found at https://cahps.ahrq.gov/surveys- guidance/item -sets/PCMH/index.html Downloaded on March 24th, 2014. 13 Limitations There are some limitations of this study due to non -response bias. Other studies among Medicaid members have shown that respondents were more likely to be women, white, and older than those who were non -respondents . Additionally , study findings may be overestimating the rates of chronic conditions, health care use, and overnight hospitalization6. However, studies in nonresponse bias in CAHPS hospital surveys reveals that survey nonresponse may produce little or no bias when comparing across the hospitals. When using nonresponse weight and case -mix adjustments on respondents CAHPS estimates, case -mix adjustments eliminate most of the bias due to nonresponse when comparing hospitals' performance7,8. Thus, nonre sponse weight does not necessarily improve overall estimation across the groups. In these Medicaid surveys, t he demographics of the population sample (all Medicaid adult s and children) were matched with the respondents , and key demographic variables -sex, age, and race - were cross -tabulated by respondents and non- respondents. However, nonresponse weights were not estimated following the findings from the previous studies in CAHPS measures. In the adult sample, the demographics of respondents in Medicaid (F FS, HMO, MediPASS) were more likely to be women, white, and older than those who were non - respondents (see Table 1 -3). Similar relationships were found in adult SSI respondents vs. non -respondents for sex and age. However, the race composition was not significantly different (see Table 1-4) for SSI Medicaid. 6 See Gallagher, Fowler, & Stringfellow (2005).

However, there were not significant difference s by child sex and age between children whose parents participated and those parents who did not participate in the study (see Table 1 -5). In the SSI Me dicaid , children whose parents participated in the study did not differ from children in SSI Medicaid who se parents did not participat e in the study (see Table 1 -6). 16 Table 1 -5.

Responses to each item in the questionnaire are in Appendix A. Demographics Responses were equally divided by sex. There was more racial/ethnic diversity in the Medicaid population than in the state as a whole (Table 2 -1). Table 2 -1.

In addition, compared with data for children in Iowa as a whole, those in the Medicaid program were reported to be in worse health. Table 2 -2. Health status of children Global health rating Iowa Medicaid 2014 Iowa Medicaid 2013 Iowa Medicaid 2011* State of Iowa 2010 Excellent *2011 data includ e children in the SSI program who by definition will have lower health status Children with special health care needs Less than one in three children ( 29%) in Medicaid met screening criteria as being a Child or Youth with a Special Health Care Need (CYSHCN ). There were no significant difference between children in MediPASS ( 29%), FFS (31%) or HMO (2 8%), however children in Medicaid were more likely to be a CYSHCN than children statewide (19%) (Table 2 -2). Psychosocial indicators The questionnaire assessed psychosocial problems using the 17 -item Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC -17). The PSC -17 generates 3 indicators identifying attention problems, impairment due to anxiety and/or depression, and conduct problems . 7% of children were classified with attention problems. 14% of children were classified with impairments due to anxiety and/or depression . 10% of children were classified with conduct problems . There was no significant difference between children in MediPASS, FFS or HMO in the psychosocial indicators . Dental health Dental health and health care was assessed by evaluating the child's overall dental health, last dental checkup, presence of a usual source of dental care, and ability to get needed dental care. 83% had a regular source of dental care (one main place) . 73% had a dental check -up in the last year (Table 2 -3). 19 27% of children needed dental care in the last 6 months . o Of these, 8 2% needed checkups and cleaning , 44% needed other dental treatment such as fillings, and 5% needed emergency care. o Abo ut one in five children (23%) could not get needed dental care. Table 2 -3. Children's last dental check -up Ratings of children's dental health were similar to 20 13 (Table 2 -4) but significantly lower than ratings of general physical health (see F igure 2-1). The ratings did not vary across children in MediPASS, HMO or FFS .

The most common chronic physical health conditions are shown in Table 2 -5. Half of parents (50%) reported that their child had seen a doctor or other health provider 3 or more times for the same condition or problem and of those, 47% reported that their ch ild ha d been taking prescription medica tion for a t least 3 months for any of those conditions . Table 2-5. Most commonly reported chronic health conditions Chronic health conditions Iowa Medicaid 2014 Attention problems 14% Chronic allergies or sinus prob lems 13% Behavioral or emotional problems 12% Asthma 11% Anxiety 10% Vision problems 8% Behavioral and emotional health care To assess mental health status and access to care, parents were asked to rate their child's current overall mental and emotio nal health, the need for and receipt of any treatment or counseling, the degree to which their child was helped by the counseling or treatment they received, and the unmet need for treatment or counseling for mental or emotional health problem s. Sixteen percent of parents reported that their children need mental health counseling or treatment . Of those who needed mental health counseling or treatment, 21% could not get the care they needed 21 Behavioral/emotional health status was generally high with 79% rat ed excellent or very good (Figure 2 -2). Children in the HMO were more likely to be reported as having excellent or very good behavioral/emotional health compared to children in FFS or MediPASS. Figure 2 -2. Behavioral/emotional health status by program Attributes of a Medical Home The child's access to a m edical home was assessed by eval uating several domains: 1) having a personal doctor, 2) timely access to care and use of services , 3) coordination of care, 4) communication with the doctor and interacti on with staff, 5) advice about their child 's safety and health, 6) shared decision making, and 7 ) self -management and support. Personal Doctor Parents were asked several questions about their child's personal doctor. 87% of children were reported to have a personal doctor . Children in FFS were least likely to have a personal doctor compared to HMO and MediPASS (see Figure 2 -3). 11% had tried to find a new personal doctor in the last six months . o Of these , 88% did not have a problem doing so , while o 3% had a b ig problem. 53% of children have been going to the same personal doctor for three years or more. 9%5%12%16% 12%10%28% 25%27%47% 59%51% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% FFS HMO MediPASSExcellent Very good Good Fair/poor 22 Figure 2 -3. Personal doctor by program Access to timely care and use of services Access to health care for children was assessed with five CAHPS items . The first two items resulted in the following findings. When the child needed care right away, 82% reported that they always received the care as soon as needed. Not counting the time the child needed care right away, 65 % reported that they always got an appo intment for a check -up or routine care at a doctor 's office as soon as needed. The CAHPS online reporting system that contains Comparative Data9 (NCD) for the CAHPS health program s uses these two items to assess getting care quickly. About seven in ten children (74%) always got care quickly. This is similar to the national CAHPS -NCD data . The composite scores are shown in Figure 2 -4. There were no differences across the program s. 9 Formerly known as National CAHPS 23 Figure 2-4. Getting care quickly (with 2 items) by program and CAHPS -NCD Three additional CAHPS items were used to ass ess timely care. When they phoned the doctor's office during regular office hours, 55 % reported that they always got answer s for their medical questions or concerns in the same day . When they phoned the doctor's office after regular office hours, 54% reported they always got answers for their medical questions or concerns as soon as needed. 20% reported that the child saw a doctor within 15 minutes of the appointment time . A composite scor e using CAHPS items (incl uding the first two) is shown in Figure 2 -5. Nearly six in ten parents of children in Medicaid ( 57%) reported that they always got timely care for their child. There were no significant differences across the program s. Figure 2-5. Timely care (with 5 ite ms) 24 Coordination of care Coordination of care for children was assessed with two CAHPS items regarding physician orders and care from a specialist. When the doctor's office ordered a blood test, x -ray, or other test for them, 72% reported that the doctor's office always follow ed up to give th em the results . 49% reported that the doctor 's office always seem ed informed and up -to-date about the care their child got from a specialist . The composite scor e for coordination of care is shown in Figure 2-6. About six in ten (61%) reported their children always received proper care coordination. There was no difference by Medicaid program . Figure 2-6. Care coordination by program Communication with the doctor and interaction with staff Eighty -seven percent of children had a personal doctor. Of th ose who had a personal doctor , 78% had visited the doctor in the last 6 months. About three- fourths of parents reported their child's personal doctor always explained things in a way that was easy to underst and ( 77%) . 79% of parents reported their child's personal doctor always listened carefully to them . 82% reported that their child's doctor showed respect for what they had to say . 78% reported that their child's doctor spent enough time with their children . 68% of parents reported their child's personal doctor always explained things in a way that was easy for their child to understand . The CAHPS -NCD uses these five items to assess doctors' communication (Figure 2-7). About eight in ten (7 8%) reported that the child's doctor always communicated well. This is similar to the national CAHPS -NCD data, and t here were no differences 2-7. Communication with the child's personal doctor (5 items) by program and CAHPS -NCD Three more CAHPS items were used to further assess doctors' communication . About three- fourths of parents reported their child's personal doctor always listen s carefully to their child (77%) . 72% of parents reported their child's personal doctor always gave them easy to understand information about these he alth questions and concerns. 72% reported their child's person al doctor seem ed to know the important information about the ir child's medical history . A composite score using these eight items (including the first five) is shown i n the Figure 2-8. About eight in ten (76%) reported that the child's doctor always communicated well. This is similar to the national CAHPS -NCD data, and there were no significant differences by program . Figure 2-8. Communication with the child's persona l doctor Sometimes/never 26 The questionnaire also included t wo questions ask ing how the family was treated by the office staff. Six in ten parents (60%) reported that the staff was always helpful, and 74% of parents reported that the staff treat ed \"you and your child with courtesy and respect \". A composite score using these two items is shown in the Figure 2-9. About two-thirds of parents (66%) reported that the office staff was always courteous, respectful, and helpful . Figure 2-9. Child's personal doctor's staff was courteous, respectful, and helpful by program Advice about their child's safety and health Seven items assessed if the parent received advice about their child's safety and health whil e visiting the child's personal doctor . About four -fifths of parents reported that they talked with their child's personal doctor about how their child is feeling, growing, or behaving (81%). About two -thirds of parents reported that they talked about specific things they could do to prevent illness in their child (63%). About h alf of the parents reported that they talked with their child's personal doctor about thing s they could do to keep their child from getting injured (52%). 31% indicated that the child's personal doctor gave them printed handouts or booklets with information about how to keep th eir child from getting injured. Six ou t of ten parents reported that the child's personal doctor asked about how much or what kind of food their child eats ( 61%) . Half of the parents reported that the child's pers onal doctor asked how much or what kind of exercise their child gets ( 50%). Over one third of parents talked with their child's personal doctor regarding any problems in the household that might affect their child (38 %). A composite score of advi ce using t hese 7 items is shown in the Figure 2-10. Slightly less than half (4 5%) reported that they ha d received advi ce about health. Parents of children in HMO (61%) were more likely to have received advi ce compared to parents of children in FFS (52%) and MediPASS (53%). Figure 2-10. Advice about child's safety and health by program Shared decision making Three items assessed shared decision making by asking questions regarding their experience being prescribed medication while visiting their child's personal doctor. 59% reported that the doctor talked to them a lot about the reasons the ir child might want to take a medicine . 23% reported that the doctor talked to them a lot about the reasons the ir child might not want to take a medicin e. 72% reported that doctor asked them what they thought was the best for the ir child . A composite score for shared decision -making indicated that about half of parents (51%) experienced shared decision making in the past 6 months. There were no significan t differences across program s (Figure 2-11). 52%61%53%48%39%47% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% FFS HMO MediPASSNo Yes 28 Figure 2-11.

A composite score of self -management and support using the se two items is shown in Figure 2-12. About one third (33%) reported they received self -management and support from the providers. Parents of children in MediPASS (29%) were less likely to receive this support compared to parents of children in FFS (34%) o r HMO (37%). Figure 2 -12. Self -management child's MediPASSNo Yes 29 Health care in the last 6 months Unmet need for care Overall rates of unmet need for various types of health care among children in Medicaid ranged from 1% to 6%. Unmet need for all types of care remained about the same compared to 2013. Percent of unmet need was highest for routine care and dental care (Table 2 -6). These rates are for all children in MediPASS, HMO, or FFS , whether they needed the service or not. Table 2 -6.

Percentages are for all children in Medicaid, not just th ose reporting need for services Outpatient Visits Office visits Parents were asked about their child's health care in the last six months, not including overnight stays in a hospital or dental c are visits. 76% of children had an office visit in the last six months (Figure 2 -13). 30 Figure 2 -13. Outpatient visits in the last six months The vast majority of parents (95%) stayed in the exam room with their child. Of these, 53% reported that the doct or told them that they needed to do something to follow up on the care of their child and everyone (100%) received enough informati on about what they needed to do . Care during evenings, weekends, and holidays About one in four parents (23%) reported that t heir child needed care during evenings , weekends, and holidays. Of children needing care du ring evening s, weekends, and holidays , 54% always were able to get the care needed from a doctor's office. Reminder between visits About half of parents (49%) report ed that they have received reminder s about tests, treatment or appointments between visits . Getting needed care Nearly two -thirds of parents (64%) reported that it was always easy to get the care, tests or treatment they thought their child needed. Al so, 5 9% of parents reported they always got an appointment for their child to see a specialist as soon as he or she needed it. The CAHPS -NCD uses these two items to assess access to needed care. A composite score using these items is shown in the Figure 2-14. Nearly two -thirds (64%) reported that they always got the care needed for their child as soon as needed. This is similar to the national CAHPS -NCD data, and there were no of office visits, 2013Number of office visits, 2014 None 1 2 3 or more 31 Figure 2 -14. Getting needed care (2 items) by program and C AHPS-NCD Care right away (including e mergency care ) About four in ten parents (39%) reported that their child needed care right away in a clinic, emergency room (ER), or doctor 's office. Of these parents, 25% waited one or more days for an appointment. Less than o ne in four children had visited an ER (23%) in the last six months (Figure 2 - 15) and the number of ER visit continues to decrease compared to 2011 and 2013 data. Of these, about three- fourths of parents (74%) thought that the care their child r eceived at his or her most recent visit to the ER could have been provided in a doctor's office if one was available at the time. Figure 2 -15. Emergency department visits in the last 6 months Preventive care Parents were asked about preventive health care s ervices in the past 6 months and receipt of the flu shot . More than three- quarters of children (7 7%) had a preventive health visit in past of ER visits, 2013Number of ER visits, 2014 None 1 2 3 or more 32 About half (4 8%) had a flu shot during the past flu season . Children in FFS were least likely to have a flu sh ot as compared to children in the HMO or MediPASS (see Figure 2 -16). Figure 2-16. Had a flu shot during the past flu season Specialty care Twenty -one percent of parents indicated their children had seen a specialist in past six months . 10% of children who saw a specialist saw 3 or more specialists. Hospital stay Three percent (N=25) of all children stayed one or more night s in the hospital . Of the 25 children with a hospital stay , 7 went back to the hospital soon after being allowed to go home . These resu lts should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of respondents. Prescription medication Parents were asked about their child's need for prescription medicine, and times when the child was unable to get it for any reason . 45% of children needed a prescription medication in the last six months ; o Of these, 9 0% reported that someone in the provider's office talk ed with them at each visit about all of the prescription medicines their child was taking . o Among those who needed prescription medication, a bout half of parents (51%) reported that the doctor talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine for their child, and 72% reported that the doctor asked them what the y thought was best for their child . o Among those who ne eded prescription medic ation, 10% could not 51%64%51% 49% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% FFS HMO MediPASSNo Yes 33 Quality of health care Parents rated their child's health care, personal doctor and specialist (if applicable) on the CAHPS global rating scale, where 0 = worst possible and 10 = best possible health care. Rating of all health care Overall rating of the care that children received remained quite high (Figure 2 -17). On a 0-10 scale, care for 60% of children was rated either a 9 or 10. Results were slightly lower than for children nationally. There was no differenc e between children in MediPASS, HMO or FFS . Figure 2 -17. Rating of children's overall health care Rating of child's personal doctor Personal doctor rating s for children remained generally high, with more than seven in ten rating the ir child's doctor as a 9 or 10, similar to national data (Figure 2 -18). There was no difference by Medicaid or 8 9 or 10 34 Figure 2 -18.

Rating of child's specialist Rating of child's dental care Among children who saw a dentist, rating of the care they received was slightly higher than in 2013, with only 59% rating the care as a 9 or 10 (Figure 2 -20). There was no difference by Medicaid or 8 9 or 10 35 Figure 2 -20. Rating of child's dental care Rating of Medicai d The health program rating for 2014 was higher than in 2013.

Figure 2-24. Looked for information in written materials or on the Internet The CAHP S helpline staff question reflects how often respondents thought that staff at the Medicaid helpline gave the information or help needed and if helpline staff was courteous, respectful and helpful. Only 37 parents/guardians called the helpline. Less than half of these 37 parents/guardians ( 43%) reported that the helpline staff always gave the information needed and that they were courteous, respectful, and helpful.

And, almost three- quarters ( 73%) reported that their doctor understands how any health problems they have affect their day -to-day life . Medical Home Access to a medical home was assessed with seven domains: 1) h aving a p ersonal doctor, 2) timely access to care, 3) coordination of care, 4) communication with the doctor and interaction s with staff, 5) c omprehensive care, 6) shared decision making , and 7 ) self -management and support. Personal Doctor Eighty -one percent of adu lts reported having a personal doctor . Adults in MediPASS were more likely to have a personal doctor compared to adults in FFS or HMO (Figure 3-2). Figure 3-2. Have FFS HMO MediPASSNo Yes 44 24% had tried to find a new personal doctor in the last six months . Of respondents who tried to find a new personal doctor in the last six month, 54% did not have a problem, while 25% had a big problem finding a new personal doctor that t hey liked. o Adults in MediPASS were least likely to encounter a problem finding a new per sonal doctor compared to adults in FFS and HMO (Figure 3 - 3). Figure 3 -3. Problem finding a personal doctor they liked Access to timely care and use of services Access t o health care was assessed with five CAHPS questions . Counting only the time s when t hey needed care right away, 5 6% always got care as soon as they needed it. Not counting the time s they needed care right away, 4 2% always got an appointment for a check -up or routine care at a doctor 's office or clinic as soon as it was needed. The CAHPS h ealth program s composite score uses these two items to assess getting care quickly. About half of these adults (49%) always got care quickly. This is lower than the national CAHPS -NCD data. The composite scores are shown in the Figure 3 -4. There were no di fferences across the FFS HMO Small problem Big problem 45 Figure 3-4. Getting care quickly (with 2 items) by program and CAHPS -NCD Three more CAHPS items were used to further assess timely care. 14% were always able to see a doctor within 15 minutes of their appointment time . 42% always got an answer to their medical questions in the same day when they phoned a doctor's office during office hours . 38% always got an answer to their medical questions as soon as needed when they phoned a doctor's office after regular office hours . A composite scoring of these five items together (including the first two) shows that four in ten adul ts (38%) reported that they always got timely care. There was no significant difference between program s (Figure 3 -5). Figure 3-5.

A composite score using these two items is shown in the Figure 3-9. Slightly over half of adults (55%) reported that the office staff was always courteous, respectful, and helpful. There were no significant differences by program . Figure 3-9. Personal doctor's staff was courteous, respectful, and helpful by program Comprehensive care Comprehensive care means that the medical home provides services accounting for the majority of patient needs, including mental health. Three items assessed if anyone in a doctor 's office asked them about their mental and emotional health. 55% of adults in the Medicaid program reported that someone in a doctor 's office asked if there w as a period of time when they felt sad, empty, or depressed. 49% reported that they were as ked about thing s in their life that worry them or cause them stress . 38% reported they were asked about a personal problem, family problem, alcohol use, drug use, or a mental or emotional illness .

Office visits Seventy -eight percent of all adults had at least one visit to any doctor's office or clinic in the 6 months prior to the survey (Figure 3 -13). 48% of all adults had three or more outpatient visits . Of these, 91% had visited their personal doctor in the last 6 months . 52 Figure 3-13. Adult outpatient visits in the last 6 months Care during evenings, weekends, and holidays Slightly less than half of adult s (47%) reported receiv ing information about what to do if they needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays . One in four adults (26%) needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays . Of those needing care during evening, weekend, or holidays , 30% were always able to get the care they needed from a doctor's office during evenings, weekends, or holidays . Reminder between visits Nearly two thirds of adults ( 63%) received reminders about tests, treatment or appointments between visits . Getting needed care Among adults who tr ied to get any type of care (60%), 45% said it was always easy to get the care, tests, or treatment they needed. Also, 42% of adults reported that always got an appointment to see a specialist as soon as needed. The CAHPS -NCD uses t hese two items to assess access to needed care. A composite score using these items is shown in Figure 3-14. About four in ten (42%) reported that they always got care as soon as needed. This is lower than the national CAHPS -NCD data, and there were of office visits, 2013Number of office visits, 2014 None 1 2 3 or more 53 Figure 3-14. Getting needed care (2 items) by program and CAHPS -NCD Emergency care Thirty -five percent of adults had visited a hospital emergency department (ER) at least once in the last 6 months , which is comparable to previous years (Figure 3 -15). Of th ose who went to a n ER, 71% said that the care received could have been provided in a doctor's office if one was available at the time . Figure 3-15. Adult emergency department visits in the last 6 months Preventive care Regarding p reventive care, respondents were asked about preventive health services in the past 6 months and receipt of a flu shot . 48% reported that they had a preventive visit, such as a physical exam or mammogram, within the last year , compared to 44% in 2013 and 6 6% in 2011.

Prescription medication Respondents were ask ed about their need for any prescription medic ations. Two - thirds of adults ( 67%) needed or took a prescription medication . Additional results for adults needing or taking a prescription medication are: o 65% needed or took the medication for a chronic condition lasting at least 3 m onths , o 86% had someone in a provider's office talk to them at each visit about all the prescription medicines they were taking , o 52% had a doctor or other health providers talk about starting or stopping a prescription medicine , o 26% needed prescription medi cation but could not get it for any reason , and o 44% always got the prescription medicine easily through Medicaid. Transportation Five question s asked about transportation used to get care. The most commonly reported way to get care was by driving their o wn car (72%) or have someone else drive them using driver's car (15%) . About one in eight adults (13%) always needed assistance from other sources (such as friends, family, public transportation, etc.) to get to their health care visits . 8% of adults indic ated they had ever used transportation paid by Medicaid. 55 About one in eight adults ( 13%) worried a great deal about how to pay for their transportation . Nearly one in eight adults (12%) needed transportation to or from a health care visit but could not get it. Quality of health care Adult Medicaid members rated their health care, personal doctor, and specialist (if applicable) on the CAHPS global 0 -10 rating scale, where 0 = worst possible and 10 = best possible. Rating of all health care The overall ratin g of health care for adults was higher than the 2013 rating , but lower than the national data (Figure 3-17). Figure 3-17. Rating of all health 8 9 or 10 56 Fewer a dults in the HMO rated their health care as a 9 or 10 (34%) than adults in MediPASS (42%) or FFS ( 40%). Figure 3-18. Rating of all health care for adults by program Rating of personal doctor The 2014 rating of personal doctor s was higher than in 2013 with about six out of ten rating their personal doctor as a 9 or 10. This was similar to national rating s for personal doctor (Figure 3-19). Figure 3-19. Rating of adult's personal doctor Adults in MediPASS were more likely to rate their personal doctor as a 9 or 10 (66%) than adults in or 8 9 or 10 57 Figure 3 -20.

How often was it easy to get information and d o paperwork? The CAHPS helpline staff item reflects how often respondents thought that staff at the Medicaid helpline gave the information or help needed and if helpline staff was courteous, respectful and helpful. Only 55 adults indicated that they had c alled the helpline. Of these 55 adults, 59% reported that the helpline staff always gave the information needed and were courteous, respectful, and helpful . These results should be interpreted with caution due to the low number & information, 2013Easy form & information, 2014 Never/sometimes Usually Always 61 Chapter 4 : SSI Child 2014 Results The Medicaid SSI program covers children who have a disability as defined by the Social Security Administration, and whose income is below 300% of the federal poverty level. The following is a summary of results from the Survey of Iowa Medicaid (Title 19) Enrollees for children (0 -18 years old) in the SSI program The survey was sent to parents or guardians of a random sample of children enrolled in SSI using the same methods as for parents of children enrolled in other Medicaid program s. Where appropriate, comparisons are made with results from children in FFS, HMO, and MediPASS. Responses to each item in the questionnaire are in Appendix A . Demographics The demographic make- up of children in the Medicaid SSI program is significantly different from that of children in other Medicaid program s (Table 4 -1). The upper threshold of the Medicaid SSI income limit is significantly higher than for children in other Medicaid program s. Also, because children must have a disability to qualify fo r SSI, more enrolled children have a special health care need. Additionally, it is noteworthy that about two -thirds of children in the SSI are male, thus, two -thirds of the parent/guardian respondents were representing male children. Table 4-1.

Health status Because enrollment in SSI is dependent on h aving a disability, the health status of children is expected to be lower than in the FFS or MediPASS and we expect to see more children in the SSI who meet the criteria for having a special health care need (Table 4 -2). 62 Overall health status Children in SSI were reported to have much lower health status than other children in Medicaid .

Health status of children Global health rating Iowa Medicaid SSI 2014 Iowa Medicaid SSI 2013 Iowa Medicaid SSI 2011 Iowa Medicaid 2014 Excellent 18% 18% 87% 29% Children with special care needs Less than nine out of ten ( 86%) children in SSI met the screening criteria for Children or Youth with a Special Health Care Need (CYSHCN) compared to 29% of other children in Medicaid meeting the criteria . Psychosocial indicators The questionnaire assessed psychosocial problem s using 17 items from the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC -17). The PSC -17 generat es 3 indicators identifying attention problems, internalizing problems with possible anxiety and/or depression, and externalizing conduct problems . 26% of children in SSI were classified with attention problems compared to 7 % of other children in Medicaid. 26% of children in SSI were classified with internalizing issues compared to 14% of other children in Medicaid. 29% of children in SSI were classified with externalizing issues compared to 10% of other children in Medicaid. Dental health Oral health and dental care w ere assessed by evaluating the child's overall dental health, timing of last dental checkup, access to a dental home, and ab ility to get needed dental care. 82% had a regular source of dental care (one main place) . 71% had a dental check -up in the last year (Table 4 -3). 32% of children needed dental care in the last 6 months . The types and rates of need were as follows: o 80% needed checkups , o 48% needed other dental treatment such as fillings , and o 7% needed emergency care. One in five ( 24%) of tho se who needed dental care indicated they could not get it 63 Table 4 -3.

These ratings were similar to those in the 2013 survey . Figure 4-1. Dental vs. overall health stat us Rating of the children's oral health was consistent among children in SSI over time but lower than other children in Medicaid (Table 4 -4). Table 4 -4. Children's dental health Dental health rating Iowa Medicaid SSI 2014 Iowa Medicaid SSI 2013 Iowa Medic aid SSI 2011 Iowa Medicaid 2014 Excellent Very good Good Fair/poor 64 Chronic conditions Nine in ten parents (91%) reported that their child ha d one or more chronic conditions that lasted or are expected to last for at least 3 months. This was significantly higher than the rate of chronic conditions among other Medicaid children (46%). The most common chronic physical health conditions are shown in Table 4 -5. Sixty -nine percent of parents rep orted that their child had seen a doctor or other health provider 3 or more times for the same condition or problem and of those, 62% reported that their child has bee n taking prescription medication for at least 3 months for any of these conditions.

About one in five (19%) rated t heir child's behavioral and emotional care as excellent . This rate was significantly lower th an for other children in Medicaid (Table 4-6). 65 Table 4 -6. Children 's behavioral/emotional health status by program Iowa Medicaid SSI 2014 Iowa Medicaid SSI 2013 Iowa Medicaid SSI 2011 Iowa Medicaid 2014 Behavioral/emotional health rating Excellent were reported to need mental health counseli ng or treatment compared to 1 6% of Medicaid children and o 22% of these could not get the care they needed. This was similar to other children in Medicaid (21%). Medical Home Access to a m edical home was assessed with seven domains: 1) h aving a personal doctor, 2) timely access to care, 3) coordination of care, 4) communication with the doctor and interaction with staff, 5) advi ce about their child 's safety and health, 6) shared decision making, and 7) self -management and support. Personal Doctor Respondent s were asked about their child's personal doctor. 89% of children were reported to have a personal doctor. 17% had tried to find a new personal doctor in the last six months and of these, o 82% did not have a problem , while o 10% had a big problem . 61% of chi ldren have been going to the same personal doctor for three years or more . Access to timely care and use of services Access to health care for children was assessed with five CAHPS items . When the child needed care right away, 8 6% of parents reported that they always received care as soon as needed. Not counting the time s the child needed care right away, 6 7% reported that they always got an appointment for a check -up or routine care at their child's doctor 's office as soon as needed . 66 The CAHPS online reporting system that contains Comparative Data10 (NCD) for the CAHPS health program s uses these two items to assess getting care quickly. About eight in ten children (7 6%) always got care quickly. The composite scores are shown in Figure 4-2. There were no diff erences between children in SSI and other children in Medicaid . Figure 4-2. Getting care quickly (2 items) Three more CAHPS items were used to further assess timely care. When they phoned to the doctor's office during regular office hours, 5 2% of parent s reported that they always got an answer to their medical questions or concerns in the same day . When they phoned the doctor's offic e after regular office hours, 5 0% reported they always got the answers to the medical questions or concerns about their child as soon as needed . 17% reported that the child saw a doctor within 15 minutes of the appointment time . A composite scor e using these five ite ms is shown in Figure 4 -3. Almost s ix in ten parents of SSI children ( 55%) reported that they always got timely care. There were no differences between children in SSI and other children in Medicaid. 10 Formerly known a s National CAHPS Figure 4-3. Timely care Coordination of care Coordination of care for children was assessed with two CAHPS items . 67% of parents reported that when the doctor's offi ce ordered a blood test, x - ray, or other test for their child , the office always follow ed up to give them those results . 57% of parents reported that the doctor 's office always seem ed informed and up-to-date about the care their child got from a specialist . The composite scor e for coordination of care is shown in F igure 4-4. Slightly more than six in ten parent s of children in SSI (62%) reported that their child always received proper care coordination. There were no differences between children in SSI and other children in Medicaid. Figure 4-4. Care coordination Usually Sometime/never 68 Communication with the doctor and interaction with staff As mentioned, 89% of SSI children had a personal doctor. Of those who had a personal doctor 84% had visited the doctor in the last 6 months. During these visits: Over two-thirds of parents reported their child's personal doctor always explained things in a way that was easy to understand (68%) , About seven in ten parents reported their child's personal doctor always listened carefully to t hem (71%), About four -fifths of parents reported their child's personal doctor s howed respect for what they had to say (78%) , Nearly two-thirds of parents reported their child's personal doctor spen t enough time with their children (65%), and Nearly six of ten parents reported their child's personal doctor always explained things in a way that was easy for their child to understand (59%) A composite score using these five items is shown in the Figure 4-5.

Of these children who saw a specialist , 35% saw 3 or more specialist s. Hospital stay Parents were asked if their child needed to stay in a hospital. Ten percent of all children in SSI stayed one or more night s in the hospital (N=22 ). Of children who stayed in the hospital , 5 children went back to the hos pital soon after being allowed to go home . Prescription medication Parents were asked about their child's need for prescription medicine, and times when the child was unable to get it for any reason . 66% of children needed a prescription medication in the last six months and of these: o 90% reported that someone in the provider's office talked with them at each visit about all the prescription medicines their child was taking , o About half of parents (55%) reported that the doctor talked about starting or stopp ing a prescription medicine for their child, o 81% reported that the doctor asked them what the y thought was best for their child , and o 15% could not get it for any reason .

Rating of child's health program Program customer service & information Parents were asked about their experience trying to find information or completing paperwork regarding their child's health program in the last six months . 37% were aware of the toll -free Medicaid help line and o 14% of these had called for help or information . 25% had to complete program -related paperwork in the last 6 months , o Of these , 50% always found these forms easy to fill out . 15% had looked for information in written materials or on the Internet a bout how the ir child's Medicaid program works and o Of these , 10% always found the needed information Doctor or office staff (12%) and written materials from Medicaid (8%) were the most frequently used and most helpful sources of information, followed by friend s and family ( 5%) and DHS caseworker s (5%). The CAHPS helpline staff question reflects how often respondents thought that staff at the Medicaid helpline gave the information or help needed and if helpline staff was courteous, respectful and helpful. On ly 11 parents reported using 9 or 10 78 helpline. Of these 11 parents, a bout one third of parents (36%) reported that the helpline staff always gave the information needed and were courteous, respectful, and helpful. These results should be interpreted w ith caution due to the low number of respondents. 79 Chapter 5: SSI Adult 20 14 Results The Medicaid SSI program covers adults if they are low income and either11: 1) at least 65 years of age, and/or 2) blind or disabled . The following is a summary of result s from the Survey of Iowa Medicaid (Title 19) Enrollee s for adults in the SSI program . Responses to each item in the questionnaire are in Appendix B .

After using student loans to put braces on my child it would have been nice to know that because he was so \"in need\" of them that Medicaid would have paid for them. Close denta l help is a problem. Dental seems to be an issue. Finding dentists who accept Medicaid should not be so frustrating. Difficult to get dental care in my town. Hate the stigma attached to being on Medicaid. Hard to find a reputable dentist that accepts Me dicaid. Have more specialists on your list that work in [CITY] instead of [CITY], some people have a hard time getting there. Have no idea each visit if they have decided to continue or discontinue their insurance. It also took months and months for them to approve therapy visits in the past. We didn't know until months after the fact that we could possibly be responsible for ill if Medicaid wouldn't pay. I am unhappy that there aren't more dentists that take on new patients with Medicaid. I also think you should be allowed to go wherever you want to doctor (another state), without a referral. I dislike that I am unable to continue to use the dentist we have gone to for years. My son has [MEDICAL CONDITION], and has a relationship with our dentist that h elped him through his visits. Now he will struggle to cope with his future appointments. I do not like that Medicaid dictates what doctor you go to when the child gets to 18 when they can stay with the pediatric doctor they have had all their life. I also do not like that some ER docs and nurses think you are less of a person when they notice that you have Medicaid, or they treat you like you don't have any intelligence. I do not like the fact that I have to go to [DENTAL PROVIDER] for my child to receive free dental care. I don't like how my daughter had to wait three months to get her dental x -rays back. We wait almost a year to get her braces. I don't like that I have to get referrals for specific medical problems to be treated, that means 2 doctor visits for referrals which caused me to change clinics now I can do it all at one place for one of my kids. I don't like that if your primary doctor is a [HOSPITAL] doctor you cannot ever go to a [HOSPITAL] unless you want to pay out of pocket. I don't lik e being limited on options to see a doctor. Our PCP is always booked at least two weeks in advance. My daughter had to suffer with a sinus infection because I couldn't get her an appointment. I don't like that some healthcare providers now have weekly lim its of number of patients that they will see on Medicaid (or new patients) like the dentist office. I feel Medicaid serves a much needed hole in healthcare for my children. Sometimes the only problem is with providers of healthcare, i.e. some dentist etc. that do not accept Medicaid patients. I feel that since my son had Medicaid, he did not get the care he needed when he had [HEALTH CONDITION]. I had to ask for the test as well as for him to be kept for observation. We went to the Dr. three times & hospi tal twice before they would do anything. I hate that I can't find a dentist in my area that will take new patients with Medicaid. I have had severe problems getting transportation from the rural area I live in. Also there are no services on the weekends, plus no afterhours clinics in my area. There needs to be more accessible healthcare needs for the low -income in rural areas. Even he senior citizens in my area are suffering! [COUNTY NAME] is grossly underserved!!!! The transportation service sucks and th ey only serve who they want. If you aren't severely disabled, obviously giving the sate more of a financial advantage, you can't get serviced. Also my other child has Autism, his services were stopped and or denied because some paperwork was missing on the ir part! I was on Hawk -I but having another child put both my kids on Medicaid. Due to Medicaid setting prices I feel dentists don't want to take it as private insurance. I went to my dentist (didn't take Title 19) and [DAUGHTER] had a perfect exam each t ime. 1st time I take her to Title 19 provider [PROVIDER NAME] they say she has cavities but refuse to give/show me x -rays. I will admit making people wait a certain amount of time to get meds or schedule an appt. is ridiculous. 180 I wish I could have the sh ots done at my doctor's office at her check -ups instead of going downtown on different days. I wish more local dentists would participate in Medicaid. I would like to be able to go to different clinics. Impossible to find dentist that accepts Medicaid, haven't been able to get in. Policies of community centers are ridiculous. In the past it has been difficult to find a provider that accepts Medicaid, especially dentists. It is hard making her shot appointments a different location/time as her check -ups, it would be nice to get them all done at one time. It was difficult to find a dentist in [CITY], Iowa that accepts Iowa Medicaid. I was only able to find one dentist in town that accepts Iowa Medicaid. It's hard to get into the doctors down here. Denti st is the same way. Then the doctor spends 5 min with you and tells you you're good to go. But you're not. Like ease of going to doctor's office. Dislike variety of who accepts Medicaid for dental and vision. Dislike the difficulty in filing paperwork to qualify. Like I mentioned before, our dentist of 6 years dropped us because they are on Title 19. I am having trouble finding anyone who will take new patients. I'm lucky to have a pediatrician because it is hard to find doctor offices that will take Titl e 19 too. Long waits in waiting rooms just so doctors can charge more money. Medicaid is not so much the problem as it is to find offices that take Medicaid. The only reason I have doctors and dentists is because they took me in when he was really young and we have kept up with all annual check -ups. Otherwise no one accepts Medicaid. Medicaid is very easy to use and takes care of everything which is a big plus. The only complaint I have is not everywhere accepts it. I wanted to switch my kids to my dentist just because it's more convenient and they don't except Medicaid. Medipass makes getting health care hard. Doctors office will not give shots to kids. Refused [CITY] referral for Autism. Medicaid was worthless in helping resolve. AEA had to tell doctor office they needed to do referral, AEA could not. Now on disability he has straight Title 19 which makes it a lot easier to get care when needed. Other son still has Medipass and provider makes it hard to get referrals. Example: they can't see him, but wo n't give referral to go to convenient care, so my son can't get care. Straight Title 19 is easier because I feel I have a say in my son's health care. Medipass traps people to where they have no say in their child's health care. They are at the mercy of the provider. More pediatric dentists who take Medicaid. The closest to us is one and a half hour drive one way. My child needs braces for correction of his teeth and the only way for him to receive this care is for us to drive five hours one way to [CITY] . As a low income family, we cannot afford the trip so he still doesn't have braces. My daughter requires braces for her teeth & have had to wait for one day a month to get an appt for the orthodontist locally to take a very limited number of Medicaid patients. Very frustrating & unfair. Need to have services for braces for teeth and some other things available somewhere other than [CITY]. That is far to travel and make appointments when you work. Not all dentists will accept Medicaid patients. Not enou gh dental clinics accept Medicaid. Not enough dentist participate. Not enough doctors or dentists that take new patients. One thing I don't like is they are always trying to change his doctor. And when trying to change his doctor it is one that is over 50 miles away. With no transportation and a doctor's office and hospital four blocks away we like, there is no way I will change doctors but Medicaid/Medicare doesn't get that. Please give more funding to Medicaid for afterhours clinics in rural areas Some doctors will not take Medicaid. So hard to find a new doctor. Which I am in the process of finding. That there are many dentists that will only take 1 new patient a month that have Medicaid it is frustrating that I would need to drive more than 30 minu tes to see a dentist. The most difficult part about using Medicaid is finding medical providers that will accept Medicaid. We recently moved to Iowa from [STATE]. We have found it much easier to get services for our 181 children in Iowa using Medicaid than it was in [STATE]. It can still be challenging at times though. Or when you do find a provider, it may take a while to get an appointment. Overall though, we have had much more success in Iowa getting the services we need. The variety/options in doctors is lacking. The constant forms to recertify can be hard to keep up with amongst caring for 3 children, a household and home schooling. There are no dentists in our area who take it. There are not enough dentists who accept Medicaid in [CITY]. Trouble getti ng appt with specialists that take Medicaid. Getting tests ok'd. Typically, when my child needs to be seen by a doctor, we have to go to the urgent care clinic. My child has not been seen by his primary care physician in almost two years, but he usually sees another provider within the clinic. His primary care physician is usually not available for at least one week when he does need an appointment. Very hard to find dentist in area that takes it. Hard to get in when I find one. Very hard to find dentist s that take Medicaid which makes it hard to get good dental care. Very hard to find doctors that are ok with unvaccinated children and on Medicaid. Very poor availability of orthodontic services. I am paying out -of-pocket for these services in order to get him treatment. Family doctor very exceptional, but VERY difficult to get an appointment in less than 6 weeks. Often have to see PA or ARNP when ill. We can only get into see local dentist when he has a student or it is an emergency as he doesn't normal ly accept Medicaid patients. We had lots of trouble finding a dentist in our area. Most dentist only take so many \"Medicaid\" patients. We finally call our community action group, we have just started going to them last month. We have a very hard time fin ding dental care with Medicaid. Working parents need after hours availability. Doctors seem too overwhelmed and want to rush you out, when you have some concerns they seem offended as if \"I'm the doctor, not you\". Too often appointments are lost in the \"s ystem\" and have to reschedule, take more time off work. PART 2: NEED ADDITIO NAL MEDICAID COVERAG E Additional help with dental work, braces, etc. Can't complain, it's free, but it is hard to get some medicines approved. A lot are not covered. Constant ly changing which glucose meters, strips, insulin's we can use a strict limit on those denying him the supplies he needs because they don't think he actually needs as many strips as the doctor ordered! Did not like that it would not cover the vitamins tha t the neonatal team prescribed for my micro preemie. Difficult to get medications that are prescribed by a doctor approved. Prior authorizations for another child of mine have been very difficult. He has a progressive, neurological, terminal illness & has epilepsy too. There have been times he went without medication that was prescribed for his seizures and pain due to the prior authorization process. Dislike the limited mental health care options. Doesn't always cover ALL prescriptions. Doesn't always tell you what is covered and what isn't. I'm paying medical bills that Medicaid claims they would cover. Follow up with me by doctor. For blood test results are only if they are concerned I believe. I tried to schedule him a psychological evaluation but M edicaid wouldn't approve it and wrap around wouldn't help fund it because I have Medicaid. The doctor's office absorbed the cost. Getting medications that require special approval are very difficult. Hard to get meds my daughter needs because they aren't carried where I live or not covered by this insurance. I dislike that Medicaid will not pay for my daughters braces. I don't like Title 19 due to the fact that they don't pay for everything. I don't like how difficult it is to get dental care for eithe r myself or my child. The [PROVIDER] website does not have up to date information on dental providers. All dental providers listed are not 182 taking new patients. When I call or email [PROVIDER] for information they refer me back to the website. I don't like how Medicaid doesn't pay for glasses anymore all 4 of my kids wear glasses and it took me a long time to find an eye doctor that took [INSURANCE PROVIDER] for the exam and glasses and I have to go to Bettendorf and I don't always have the gas. I don't li ke that Medicaid denied my son his braces when he needed them. He was one point off. And I think if it's a need it should be covered. I can't afford the $4,000 to get him them. I feel genetic testing should be a covered expense. My son has a chromosome di sorder. I am apparently a carrier. I have 3 other kids that are suspected to have it but doctors won't test them because Medicaid won't pay for it. Several doctors have told me it would affect treatment options and would be CHEAPER in the long run. I have four children and for another one of them he has ADHD inattentive type and I'm having problems with Medicaid getting him on meds. I like that I don't have to do tons of paperwork and most generally, it's easy to get medical supplies he needs. I don't lik e that I couldn't get a certain Rx because he was \"too old\", not because of a health problem. I like that I know my daughter has medical care available for her which takes care of what she needs. I don't like that should the time come she would need glass es (both her parents do), there is to my knowledge no coverage for glasses, which can be difficult for families to afford. I need to know why Medicaid denied my granddaughter for her wheelchair at [SERVICE PROVIDER] that was ordered and still pending for [GRAND DAUGHTER'S NAME] was it not the right color? I really think my 11 year old daughter should have received braces and she was denied. I think I need braces too, but was denied as a child. I wish Medicaid would cover the blood test for muscular dystr ophy. It is suspected my son has it and Medicaid won't cover it. There is no way I can afford the test! So therefore he will have to go untested/unknown. I wish they would have paid for braces. She was declined even though she has teeth that will never grow in, making her teeth terribly crooked. And instead of under bite/overbite, hers in sideways. This is cosmetic, but it's led to depression which is much more expensive for Medicaid in the long run. I would like the process to find new health care for ki ds after over income for Medicaid. My child is on monthly meds and I can't afford them so therefore it keeps her from school. I am still waiting to see what medical they are going to give her. I'm trying to get my granddaughter a wheelchair stroller, beca use her legs give out sometime and she was denied by Medicaid, and also am trying to get her accepted through [ORGANIZATION] speech therapy and she is still waiting. Thank you. [NAME] Magellan dismissed our daughter from PMIC as 6 months was reached, she is mentally ill. We seek a placement currently, as [CHILD'S NAME] needs help desperately. She has huge mental health issues. Medicaid has cancelled my dental care, when two weeks after I had an appointment for dental care. I was not told about the cancell ation. Medicaid is ok but I don't like Medicaid because we are limited to do eye visits. More therapy options for children with Asperger's would be great. My child goes without medications due to prior authorization. Needs respite but doesn't quality! My child has bad acne most meds to help her takes a lot of red tape to get the stuff that works for her. My daughter got really sick while we were on vacation and Medicaid did not pay her ER bill. My son is autistic and he struggles daily to purchase the needed supplements for him for daily functions and none of these are covered for him. Thank you. My son needs braces, is there any plan available or program with affordable payment plans? Only problem we are having is Medicaid fighting his scripts don't think they take in consideration he's only 5! Right now she has no coverage and can't get her medicines wish they would expedite her medical coverage when they make too much for Medicaid. Please need coverage for her medicines. Sometimes when he is pres cribed a medication Medicaid will not pay for it and he has to be prescribed a different medication. Thank you for allowing us to be able to have Medicaid and for me and my boys to not have an outstanding co -pay or a bill. But I would like to add please a llow Medicaid to help people that can't 183 lose weight due to health I would love to get the band but I can't afford it. Also I do eat healthy and exercise just don't lose weight I tried everything. Also pills please help me out on this just once. Please. God bless. That I cannot get my children to see a dentist because medicine won't cover and I need to get another medical sheet. The big problem with Medicaid is that they do not pay medical bill on time, or never. Specially dentals. Worst part is they send you a bill after 1 year. Even I call them and asked them why is not paid when we wouldn't be seen by dentist less is approved by Medicaid. Hard to explain. No matter what you end up on collection agency list. The biggest problem we have with Medicaid is o nce we cross state lines we no longer have coverage. This has been a BIG problem for us. I think more information needs to be given on what to do when you travel out of state. The one thing I am unhappy with is when doctor prescribes a medication that may help my child. Medicaid has denied it for various reasons, even when we have tried all other options. There is not great coverage for reflux meds. Otherwise, no problems. It has really helped us financially. My daughter is on due to medical reasons. There needs to be more than a three day window between prescription refills. They could be better with dental (teeth cleaning). Tests being done, doctors not being rude because you have Medicaid. Covering cough syrups for kids. They don't always do what the doctor wants kids to do. They don't always give out the right medicines. They make it difficult to get, and the doctors treat you like garbage because you are on it and avoid phone calls about med refills, etc. They will require multiple appointments for an ongoing condition in order to receive treatment. Yet other people I know who have ADHD kids don't have to go in to the doctor multiple times to get their prescriptions. It doesn't cover the treatment needed (therapy) and only covers certain medications and the ones he needs are too expensive. [CHILD NAME] was adopted at age 8 with a history of mental illness, we continue to seek safety as she cannot make good decisions. She was progressing at [PROVIDER NAME], a PMIC placement, however Magellan says no more at 6 mon. She needs to stay in [PROVIDER NAME] longer. We now have to start the progress all over to get [CHILD NAME] committed. Was able to get braces for 17 year old but refused for 15 year old that has large gaps in teeth. When the doctor prescri bes a medication there is a reason, fill the prescription, I am tired of hearing that for some stupid reason title 19 does not cover it! When my insurance would pay for it! Ridiculous! Get it together, why make my child suffer because of that! Would be gr eat if the physicians on Medicaid we saw had better \"bedside manners\" and were more knowledgeable. Mostly I tell them what is wrong and they take my opinion as diagnosis and they're rude. Overall, Medicaid is a great insurance because it covers costs for u s. Thank you. Would like to have more options for mental health. I currently pay very expensive doctor bills for his behavioral/mental health visits. PART 3: PROBLEMS WIT H COST OF MEDICAID P ROGRAM Co-pays. Typically if you eligible for Medicaid then you are financially challenged so co -pays don't make it easier. Medicaid transportation is very difficult to work with. We have chosen not to use this service due to the difficulty in getting reimbursement. My child wanted/needs braces but I cannot affor d them. My daughter needs braces as does my son. The out of pocket expense is too high. My son needs extensive teeth pulling and there is no help from Medicaid. What can I do? My granddaughter needs braces but I am unable to pay for them. Her dentist has said she needs them because if she falls, it could chip her teeth. Medicaid will not pay for it. That it don't pay all of my seizure medicine bills when I am raising a 5 year old who needs stuff so I end up having to ask people to borrow money. 184 PART 4: COMMUNICATION PROBLE MS WITH MEDICAID OR PROVIDERS Can never get a hold of anyone through calls to Medicaid. Communication between Medicaid and [INSURANCE PROVIDER] is limited, this is frustrating when health care bills get denied and you are trying to figure out why. I also have a 5 -year old son who is on Medicaid. Last year he had to get a physical and immunizations for daycare and preschool. This year he needed to get a Kindergarten physical, but we weren't able to have it done in time for school to start because it hadn't been 365 days since his last physical. (School started a little earlier this year, and last year we weren't able to get into the doctor very quickly, as we had just moved to town.) It isn't necessarily a bad thing to have to wait a year, but it was frustrating to find out that, had the receptionist not caught the date of last year's exam when I was trying to schedule for this year, I would have owed over $200 for an office visit (that I obviously can't afford). It would have been nic e to know that this was the rule prior to trying to make an appointment! Other than that, I have been fairly satisfied with Iowa's Medicaid system. (We moved from another state two years ago, and I would say that it's pretty comparable to what I experience d in [STATE].) I believe the forms to apply for Medicaid could be more user friendly. Very hard to understand sometimes and the questions are not always clear. I feel it would be helpful if we got dental office information on our town of who accepts Titl e 19. I wish it was easier to understand what services it provides. But I also was unaware of the 800 number I can call. I would also use a website if there's one. I wish that my family would've received information about Medicaid through the mail, espec ially since we cannot afford internet access at our house. If there is a clear book to show Medicaid plans and who accept Medicaid insurance and what kind of treatment can be covered by. Thanks for your efforts. Inability to reach a worker with applicati on questions. It is almost impossible to speak directly to a case worker. Some medicines aren't covered and require pre authorization forms which take sometimes weeks to get approved. Horrible wait times on returned phone calls. Medicaid only cons is the ir notifications are difficult to understand as they're all in terms without explanations. More information for SSI mothers that don't have baby day around or help with health after 1 year. More information with new programs. Muchas gracias por prestarm e su apreciado espaci\u00f3 mire mi inquietud es que un d\u00eda yo con medicaid y era para un llevar mi ni\u00f1a mi familia Que tenga bonito d\u00eda Only issue that I've had is they have certain procedures that have to have approval and they took over two weeks to approve the procedure. If th ey could have a list of what can be approved and make wait times shorter. Sometimes services available are \"fuzzy\". Don't know enough about what services. Our family is generally healthy so we have few needs but if we did...? In general no complaints. Thank s. The paperwork that is sent is due within two days of receiving it. It is difficult for working families to get copies of proof for these forms in that time. Their website to find covered services is hard to use/locate. Too much paperwork to fill out when applying for Medicaid and it's very hard to understand. Was never sent any ID cards for my children. The office always asks for them but I don't have any. We weren't aware that we still had Medicaid until one of our other children had to seek emerge ncy medical care. When you call and leave a message you may not get a returned phone call, or they can't tell you who you can talk to if they don't know. When you call in for some questions you can never get in. The line is always on a message machine. M y child gets very good care from his health provider and walk -in visits. 185 PART 5: NEGATIVE EXP ERIENCES WITH PROVID ERS / TREATED DIFFER ENTLY Child born with [CONDITION] that caused [CONDITION]. Multiple providers ignored/downplayed condition and did not offer sufficient therapy because we were on T19. T19 patients do not get equal medical treatment at [HOSPITAL] or elsewhere! I answered that sometimes receptionists were rude. I've seen this rarely but it happens and is absolutely unacceptable. Being on Medicaid should not warrant negativity from staff. I dislike having to call down to the [PROVIDER NAME] b \\c they are rude! I do appreciate the access to insurance and healthcare for children from lower income families. However, I also feel like there are times we are judged or given less or shortened treatment due to the lower reimbursement rates of Medicaid. I also have had access to hawk -I in the past for my older children & the difference was amazing. More access to care, less judgment, better reimburs ement rates for healthcare providers, and a low premium that I would be willing to pay for better care. Unfortunately we do not qualify for hawk -I anymore. Medicaid is a great program but I wish it was viewed in a more positive manner. I do not like that doctor's offices only take so many Medicaid clients. It seems discriminating. I don't like that some medications are not available. Sometimes the flu shot isn't available right away. Some providers don't provide services outside of certain hours/days. Feels like we get less special treatment than those with private insurance. [TOWN] ER treated us very poorly. They refused treatment unless we paid $280.00. Had to take her to a different ER the next night to get the care she needed. After calling the doctor offices first. Our daughter had a twin who died 6 days after birth. He was denied Medicaid 10+ times despite being eligible due to prematurity. This is a ridiculous burden on a grieving family and a system problem. I do not know how a family w/o the know ledge and resources our family has would even be successful in getting the services they NEED! The lack of compassion and understanding by staff was astounding. It wasn't until after many battles and aid of [HOSPITAL] social worker that finally received me dicine for our son, nearly 7 months later. You can feel free to call w/questions. Sometimes I feel that I get treated different because of what type of healthcare I have. That people look down on you for having it and are slightly less helpful about bill ing with it. The customer service is horrible. The workers talk down to you like they are better than you are. There have been many times my child has been refused care due to his Medicaid or have reduced care needed because on Medicaid. This is usually related to mental health care. We have to drive to the [HOSPITAL] for dental care for her. Our [PROVIDER] has made degrading comments about people on Medicaid about being lazy or living off others. I am on disability and would love to not be on Medicaid b ut can't get insurance. PART 6: NEGATIVE EXP ERIENCES WITH MEDICA ID Application and renewal process always having to speak to someone different. Not having a set worker/person to talk to like you used to. Very unorganized, I've gotten 4 letters in 3 day s all saying something different about my coverage/eligibility and can't get anyone to answer phone or return calls. [DATE] wife (x -wife) moved out w/kids. [DATE] she was arrested for [CRIME]. I got custody of my four kids 2013, she told me that she recei ved new Medicaid card for [CHILD NAME]. I did not receive one. Kids in my care, I could not get any info on [CHILD NAME]'s Medicaid cause I was not in the system, I was before. Took a lot of phone calls and paperwork to get straightened out. Really frustra ting could not get an answer why this happened when [CHILD NAME] was in my care. Still no answer. [DOCTOR NAME] is a complete incompetent, rude man. I feel it is a waste of tax payers $ to make the patient visit the PCP for referrals (if the PCP is aware of the need for referrals). I have never had a problem getting care or respect from anyone in the health care services aspect of Medicaid. However, [PROVIDER] has been incredibly hard to work with, and treated me as if I was less intelligent than they we re. I can't seem to get a hold of the right person, and couldn't even tell you who my worker is if I tried. 186 I like Hawk -I better. We can pick our dentist and we receive copies of medical bills and coverage. They are easier to work with. I felt like I get bounced around between departments when I make a call with questions. I lost his Medicaid card when he was about 3 months old, and refused to send a new one. Was told they don't reissue new cards. I often feel that the doctor office is fine, but when we have to go to the VNA for medical care or treatment, we are not treated well. Medicaid is a great program, but I have had several issues with them not paying for services that were supposed to be covered. It can take 6- 12 months of repeated calls on an is sue before it is finally paid. They refused to pay for a dental cleaning, then paid, then took the money back from the provider, I am still fighting it. My son has a mental illness that hasn't been properly assessed. He has been seen by a few doctors and been on meds the side effects were unbearable, doctors won't give him liquid meds, he can't swallow pills. Sometimes it seems that Medicaid is a little rigid on the time allowed to make appointments. Like for example, dental visits or well check visits ha ve to be scheduled on a time consistent to the last one. It has to be a certain day from the last visit it can't be made earlier or later or it won't be paid for. The clinic in my neighborhood never has the same doctor, so every time we go we see a new doctor. I hate that. Sometimes the wait is so long because they are so overbooked. I hate that. I also can never get an appointment if he is sick at night and call in the next day so we just go to the ER. I also do not like how we are treated because Medicai d uses the generic drug first. For my son's rash the specialist new the generic wouldn't work but we had to try it anyway. The fact that they assigned a doctor to me and my children when we already had one. Then I had to pay out of pocket to see a special ist for baby. Fixed now but very unnerving. The fact when I did not have transportation they want me to come pick up bus passes. Okay, that makes no sense, when I obviously can't go to the doctors, how can I pick the bus pass up. To me that is ridiculous! Other than that, I am happy with Medicaid. PART 7: POSITIVE COM MENTS ABOUT MEDICAID 1) Great staff at our doctor's office. 2) Everything is explained. 3) X -ray results given in 15 min. of being taken. Appreciate having it for my children. Without it they wouldn't have any health insurance because I couldn't afford it even though I have a job and work hard every day. Grateful. Everything is good so far. Thank you. Everything is just fine. Never had a problem. Thanks, have a great day. Good job, I h ave two other kids on your plan, it is the best, and God bless you. Thank you for your help and concern. Good program, excellent access, no special needs. Good program. Great service. Have had no problems. Have not had any problems at all. Thank God f or Medicaid. I am so grateful to have Medicaid for my grandson. It has really been a God -send. I am very thankful for Medicaid, having insurance to help me with all the medical bills. Without it, I wouldn't be functioning at all. I am in severe pain ever y day 24/7!!! Therefore, I wouldn't be able to function if it wasn't for the pain doctors putting me on medication that helps me to function every day! So, Thank You so much! [NAME] I appreciate all the help received through Title 19 when needed. Thank yo u! I appreciate having Medicaid. It eliminates the worry about expensive health care. I appreciate the help that Medicaid provides for the low income families. I enjoyed it. It's okay. I feel Medicaid has been a great product for medical service offere d for my adopted children. I have never experienced any problems for my children. Keep up the hard work and dedication. 187 I have been pleasantly surprised at how great coverage is, much better and easier than the coverage I received through employers in the past, sadly. You don't get what you pay for when it comes to insurance apparently. I have no problems with Medicaid. Works fine for our needs so far. I like everybody is wonderful people, always nice respectful. Dislike, sometimes we need more people sp eak Spanish, is hard to explain for us. Maybe, more paperwork in Spanish. Thanks. I like everything about Medicaid, it really helps my child. So proud to be part of it. Oh and I really do enjoyed filling the survey out. I like how Medicaid is good to peo ple with low income and has a lot of clinics and dentist options even though I love mine, there are options. Thank you. I like Medicaid because my son needed a helmet and everyone kept telling me you wouldn't pay for it. But then I found out if it's sever e enough you do. I was very happy with Medicaid for that. His head had a 16 mm diff between the two sides. So thank you! I like that I can talk to the doctor and if he needs to see specialist I can get an appt. I like that my child has insurance and that I am able to take him to the doctor when needed. I like the program and I has saved my family. We were finally able to get medical attention and be healthy. I love our doctor and dentist. I so appreciate Medicaid, I don't know what I would do without i t. Just like most families. Thank you so much for putting my grandson through medical attention if needed. I think it is a great idea and I think more people should be able to get it if they are below the poverty line. I think Medicaid is great for peopl e that cannot afford private insurance and can still get the medical care they need. We should be thankful for this program. I think the Medicaid Program is a great program for people with low or no income. My child has benefited from the program since we've been here in Iowa. Thank you for helping me take care of my child. I want to appreciate you people for every help. I wish I qualified for it. Otherwise, I'm glad my kids do qualify and get it. I'm glad my children have Medicaid. I'm happy that we a re able to pick out the doctor we want for the child. I'm happy with Iowa Medicaid program, I've lived in [CITY], and their Medicaid program was good too. But [STATE] Medicaid is horrible. I'm happy with Medicaid. Thank you. I'm very happy with the Medi caid program because it helps my family a lot. It has been great to/for us. We have never had any problems or complaints with the doctors/hospitals. We have never been to the dentist yet. It helps me feel that my kids can go to the doctor when needed and doesn't \"break the bank\". This family struggles with money, without Medicaid my children would not have insurance. It's easy to use I call requested info they send me a week's worth of reading - phone, contact info, doctor list clinics that take Medicaid , three cards in case I lose one. They called to verify things and update info. It's good. It's nice to not have to worry if we can afford having insurance on our child. Even if it's only for a check -up. Love everything about Medicaid it is so helpful f or my family! Love Medicaid. It helps so much. Medicaid has been an amazing asset to my family. So helpful. Medicaid has been very helpful in the time we have used it. Thank you. Medicaid has been very helpful to me especially paying my unpaid hospital bills. I am so thankful. And I can't thank Medicaid enough. My question is my 12 year old needs braces is there any help I can get from Medicaid? Thanks! Medicaid has been very useful for my child, but we've gotten really wonderful care for my husband, who has had many medical problems. He receives the necessary preventative care because of Medicaid. We are very grateful. Medicaid is a blessing to have, without it my kids would not have health care. Medicaid is a great program. I don't know what I would do without it. 188 Medicaid is a no nonsense way for me to be able to get the care my child needs without worrying about how I am going to pay for it. I appreciate that very much. Medicaid is a very good insurance, my grandson's prescriptions at no cost and there is no co -pay. He has a doctor, specialist hematology oncology doctor at the [HOSPITAL] and regular doctor at [CLINIC], that he has just recently seen. Medicaid is awesome. It has been a godsend to make sure we can care for our children's health properly. One of the most worthwhile programs in the state. Medicaid is supplemental as part of adoption agreement for our family. It has been very helpful with all the behavioral problems. Medicaid is very helpful for me and my son with all the therapies h e needs. Medicaid really helps with my child's meds, they can be very expensive. My child is adopted and considered special needs. She has Medicaid because of an adoption subsidy. Medicaid is a secondary insurance for my child. She is also covered under federal [INSURANCE PROVIDER] and [INSURANCE PROVIDER] dental. I am happy with Medicaid coverage. No comments at this moment, I'm satisfied. No. I've had no problems with them at all. Thank you. None it is good and helps out a lot with bills and care for my family. Thank you. She is normal for a 3 year old child. She goes to [DOCTOR NAME] at [CLINIC] and always have and will. [DOCTOR NAME] been with me since my oldest boy was born in [DATE]. So he knows everything about my 3 kids and I love him as a doct or. [CHILD NAME] is my daughter. My name is [NAME]. So far our experience has been great and helpful. Thank you Thank you very much. Thank you! Thank you! I don't know what we would have done without the assistance of Medicaid. Financially, it's neces sary. There are no comments from me. I am very much satisfied with Medicaid and the doctors who look after my kids. There is no any comments from my side, everything's good and satisfied. Think Medicaid is great, helps a lot. Thanks. This is great, Med icaid, especially for low income. I wouldn't change one thing about it. We are grateful and blessed to have this program available. We are very grateful for Medicaid and thankfully don't have health issues to have to use it a lot. We don't abuse this cov erage and appreciate any and all help from Medicaid. Thank you! We are very grateful for Medicaid. It helps our family a lot. We are very thankful for it. We don't take it for granted. We have been extremely grateful for Medicaid. It has allowed us to h elp care for our children and keep them healthy. We have been very fortunate to have many amazing doctors through Medicaid. They are all knowledgeable and try to provide me with the best answers for all of his health care needs. We really are pleased wit h Medicaid, our other insurance isn't affordable for us and this one has been great. Thank you. What I would like to take this time and say is \"thank you\" so much for the help that Medicaid gives. I am forever grateful. Working well, thank you. You do a very good job thank you! PART 8: OTHER COMMEN TS [CHILD NAME] is a lovable little guy. He tries so hard to do what's right, medical problems he has was not his fault. His real mother did drugs while she was pregnant affected [CHILD NAME] in a lot of wa ys. Slow but maybe someday he may or may not outgrow it. Medication [MED NAME] helps. We're trying new meds. Haven't quite got it yet still working without doctor which is helping with his case, and school works with us. Even if bills are paid I'd like to see copies for medical records personally. 189 I am not completely sure about all the benefits yet but I will soon. I don't think I have any of the dislike about this Medicaid. I feel that Medicaid has the right goal (healthcare for those who can't afford much) but since it doesn't cost for the recipient, I feel the system could be abused and the care given not valued. Therefore, taxing our health system and leading to overworked healthcare workers. I hate that my situation is the way that it is and that w e use this as insurance, but without it, we wouldn't have any. For my son's needs, it has been very nice to have, as we don't use it frequently. I have a good doctor and have had him since my son was born. I have no problems what so ever I have wanted t o switch my daughter to Hawk -I and Medicaid says no because she is eligible for Medicaid first before she can get Hawk -I. I will be taking her to her doctor to see if she is ADD and will be setting up and appointment to see a counselor. If this were a su rvey for another one of my children some of the answers would be completely different. She has Medicaid as a secondary insurance and it took a month for an MRI approval on a severe injury. That injury occurred in June and is still (in October) receiving tr eatment. If this were for one of my other children I would have a couple things to say. Medicaid is a worry free insurance with a peace of mind. My kids always got what they needed when they had it. But the income guidelines need to be a little more real istic with today's wages and economy. My child also has a primary insurance through his father's work. My child does not receive Medicaid. My child has Medicaid as a second insurance. His primary insurance is [INSURANCE PROVIDER]. Sir, I received a let ter telling me that my daughter's Medicaid has been canceled, because they have not received the return form sent to the [CLINIC]. Therefore I want you help make an appeal for them to restore my daughter's Medicaid. I really enjoy the service. So many que stions. Still waiting to be (re) approved. The income guidelines are too strict. We need the help from Medicaid and it is hard to get it! This is his secondary insurance. His primary is [INSURANCE PROVIDER]. We wish we would be sent an itemized list of what is billed to Medicaid like we do for private insurance so we can verify if is correct. Is very easy to defraud the system as a medical provider. Well I was taken off and I was getting disability for several months but got taken off husband made to much money and I lost Medicaid and have a lot of health problems and don't think I was treated fairly. Thank you, [NAME]. Takes too long for changes to be made. 190 Appendix D. Survey Comments: Enrollee Perspectives (Adult) about the Iowa Medicaid Program Table of Contents: Page Part 1: Problems with Access to Care / Few Providers Accept Medicaid 2 Part 2: Need Additional Medicaid Coverage 8 Part 3: Problems with Cost of Medicaid Program 16 Part 4: Communication Problems with Medicaid or Providers 18 Part 5: Negative Experiences with Providers / Treated Differently 19 Part 6: Negative Experiences with Medicaid 23 Part 7: Positive Comments about Medicaid 24 Part 8: Other Comments 31 191 PART 1: PROBLEMS WIT H ACCESS TO CARE / FEW PROVIDERS ACCEPT MED ICAID Medicaid paid for his flu shot. The [CLINIC NAME] where he went for several years closed down and opened in a new location where they no longer accept Medicaid patients. Even though I'm sure a large percentage of their patients were on Medicaid, as they have mental health issues, really shameful. We haven't tried to find a new mental health provider yet, but I know that the options are very limited for Medicaid patients. 1) It is a problem sometimes finding a healthcare doctor that you would like that takes Medicaid. 2) It is a huge problem finding a dentist, oral surgeon, orthodontist that takes Medicaid in my area. 3) It is a huge problem getting the right medicine and or treatments that Medicaid will pay for. I have named my number three big problems when it comes to using my Medicaid. Thank you. 1) Need more assistance with transportation to healthcare. Appointments ranging from here in town to [CITY], [CITY], and [CITY]. Cannot afford costly gas charges. 2) Finding dental care covering dental by Medicaid. 3) Doctors available, not so many nurse practitioners, though they do help. Like - dental coverage, psychiatric coverage, being able to choose own practitioner, medication coverage. Almost every time I t ry to get a prescription refill. It has to be preauthorized and I have to wait an extra two to five days to get it filled. This is frustrating as I cannot get it filled until I only have one or two pills left. Then I am without medicines for a few days. I understand the concept but all of my medicines I have taken for several years. The same goes for my daughters ADD medication. Always have an issue refilling my inhalers. My Medicaid program won't pay for it most times (always a refill too soon) but I need it and cannot afford to purchase the inhalers without insurance. Because of my rare problems I have found doctors not knowing how to treat. It was very hard to get SSI. Can't find a dentist to go to because none accept new people with this type of insur ance. Current wait list for mental health is over a year long. Dental care is near impossible to get for adults on Medicaid. Dentists refuse to take new patients and the big dentists that will have an average wait time of three plus months for routine ch eckups. Emergency dental is nonexistent other than [CLINIC]. Other than the dental I believe Medicaid is a great program and has helped myself and my daughter tremendously. Dental in [TOWN] is very hard to get and no one does a root canal on anything majo r without charging. The dentists seem to not be as nice to their patients that do accept. I would be lost without this help for my medical. Dental providers are very few. Many do not accept or once find out have Medicaid gives crappy care. I recently left a dentist that I have been with for over 20 years because once I switched to Medicaid his care and concern for my teeth deteriorated. Billing me outrageous prices after convincing me a procedure needed to be done and Medicaid didn't cover it. I went to an other dentist only to find out that they do, but the dentist does take a loss. Dislike having to occasionally (too often) require a preauthorization for a regular medication to be covered, ones I've taken for years. Emergency care is great. 2 months wait ing for an appointment w/doctor for a checkup, not cool. Generally, I am quite satisfied with my Medicaid. I have had good care with quality facilities and physicians and staff. My only problem has been locating a dentist. I called the 800 number provided in question 84, the individual I spoke with could only offer to mail me a packet of information that I haven't received yet. There needs to be more dental care available. In the meantime the customer service people at that 800 number need more to offer th an a packet of information. I'm reasonably certain that I have that from when I first enrolled. Good health coverage but annoying process to get personal doctor who takes Medicaid. Can't be in contact with doctor until Medicaid gives permission or approve . Hard to find a doctor to take this insurance (dental) care. Have to start driving a long way to see a dentist. Have to wait in doctor's exam room sometimes longer than I thought. Having problems finding the right doctor and dentist. But I have had pne umonia twice and surgery on my right hand and elbow. Broke my left ankle twice and have lower back and leg pain all the time. I already had my providers from having [INSURANCE] when I started having Medicaid for insurance. So, I was able to keep the docto rs I already liked. What I dislike the most about 192 Medicaid is that if I need to find a new doctor I won't be able to pick who I want. I now have to drive 90 minutes one way for appointment since moving, but do it because I know it will be difficult to find a doctor that will take Medicaid that I will want that is closer to where I live. From what I understand most doctors don't want Medicaid if they can find enough clientele with other insurance. I am very appreciative for Medicaid and all they do for my s on and I. But I don't like how you can't pick your own doctor. I feel I should be able to choose my own doctor. Not them and if I want to change doctors I shouldn't have to go through such a long process. I can't get my medication on time. Can't be seen w hen I need to go to the doctor due to a $22.00 balance. I dislike co pay on medicine and I dislike not being covered for root canal. They just take my tooth instead of saving it so I can eat better. I dislike some of their preapproval methods I have to wa it on to get certain tests. I do like knowing I can get care when I need it knowing I can't afford it. I don't like the fact that I would have to wait to change my doctor if I moved to a different area. They only let you change if there is a doctor leavin g or every six months we can change or keep the doctors we have. I don't like how long it takes to get medications approved. I also don't like how you have to go in to the office for the same thing, when nothing has changed, because a lot of times they ar e just referring you on anyway. Then it takes forever to get a visit with the regular doctor, then it takes even longer with the specialist, so by the time you get the problem addressed it's been like two months. Also their needs to be more providers for m ental health. I don't like Medicaid limits to a lot of things because that reasons why people don't get help because we really can't afford it. They limit the doctors we can see. I feel it's unfair that we are unable to receive medications that a doctor prescribes and the pharmacy tells me it was denied, or I receive notification in the mail of the denial. And the medication that is substituted with doesn't work as well or not at all, and the dosage can't be raised any higher since it's already at maximum dose. For instance, I keep getting denials for my ADHD med because I'm an adult. Instead Medicaid wants me to take [DRUG NAME] which doesn't work for my ADHS at its highest dosage available. Also when my doctor and I have tried several different meds and they did not help me at all. I'm also having a big problem finding a new doctor because my 2 favorite doctors are no longer taking new patients due to him retiring and the other one took a new job elsewhere. I have a hard time as it is with changes and fin ding a new doctor with the qualities of care, compassion, and bedside manner w/honest concern and comforting I received from [DOCTOR NAME] and [DOCTOR NAME]. I would recommend them to everyone, but [DOCTOR NAME] is retiring. Also I'm having trouble finding a doctor because of having to cancel appointments too late due to transportation difficulties, either my ride can't take me, or I have an anxiety attack which prevents me from leaving my apartment to catch the bus by myself, or I don't have bus fare for m e let alone for someone to ride with me. I also have to try to make appointments so that my 15 year old can go on the bus with me to my appointments but then the appointments are so late in the day that the buses aren't running any longer when I'm done wit h my appointment so since I've called and cancelled too late or didn't show due to transportation issues then I can't no longer be seen at that office any longer and several occasions it would've been the first appointment. It's very hard for me to get tra nsportation to any appointments for the past 6 or more months because I don't have any kind of income to give someone for gas, to ride a bus, take a taxi, and none are close enough for me to walk because of my diabetic neuropathy in my feet and now spreadi ng up to my lower calves and shins. I have found that people who only have Medicaid have an extremely difficult time getting a family doctor. I believe the program needs a complete overhaul. I could go on but the bottom line is the program isn't of much u se if you cannot get a doctor to accept it. I have no comments on improving Medicaid or the program in general. My only issue is getting to doctors and specialists, as there is only one doctor in the town I live in. I have problems with my teeth and have not been able to find a dentist close enough to drive to - or - that the wait is until 6 or more months that accepts Medicaid. Other than that I have not had problems with Medicaid. I have to go through a complicated process to change my current healthca re provider and I have been having difficulty finding one that truly listens to me. I like Medicaid but when I need dental attention like teeth cleaning or a tooth filled most dentists will not take Medicaid patients. Where can I go to get tooth cleaning every six months? [DOCTOR NAME] in [TOWN], IA will not do it. Please help. 193 I liked when I could go to more than one doctor. Now if I can't get into my primary doctor I may have to wait a week before I can be seen. I need to find a dentist, there is no on e in my area who accepts Title 19. I have tried to find someone and gave up and when I did have a regular dentist they said I need work done but insurance company wouldn't cover. I wish that the amount you can make for being able to Medicaid or qualify fo r Medicaid in the first place. Being able to only make $600 to $620 a month should be raised to $1000. Because when you get turned down or make a little more and get denied medical care and I look for help I can't afford it and pay my bills. I wish there were naturopathic doctors in the [CITY] area. I want to have the opportunity to be able to use natural and earthly healing. Not having doctors who want to just prescribe medications but who actually want to heal patients, without the incessant use of manma de pharmaceuticals. I'm pregnant and finding a doctor to treat my prenatal needs was almost impossible. I'm pretty happy with the service, it's just very hard to find a doctor that I like that will accept the insurance. I'm trying to get dental care but nobody wants to take Medicaid. It is difficult to find a dentist for adults that accept Medicaid. It is sometimes hard to find a doctor or a dentist, especially which accept Title 19. Often they are in other towns and it makes it hard to get there. It would be great if I could get a list of providers like [COUNTY] does because the doctor I was assigned is not accepting new clients. It would be nice if ALL doctors took Medicaid! I don't feel that is fair at all! It's difficult to find a provider that h as openings for new patients. It's difficult to find doctors who accept Medicaid. Also it's hard to get rides who are dependable. The rides thru Medicaid don't always show up. I've almost been kicked out of my pain management clinic because my ride doesn' t show up, even when I've given them 5 day's notice. It's hard to find a doctor or dentist that takes new patients and accepts Medicaid/Title 19. You don't have many choices to pick from. Sometimes it is easier just to see the E.R. at the hospital. It can take a few days just to get in to see someone. As to the hospital you may have to wait a few hours but at least you're being seen that day. Cons - 1) Not a variety of doctors accept it. Have to look for doctors in the plan. I only wish two things and th at is that more dentists would take it. I was lucky with it to as I've had the same dentist since I was a child so they kept me. And #2 is that with my Asthma I had same inhaler for years and years and it was the best for me, but when I went to pick one sc ript up for it, it was a totally different one and I gave it a try but it keeps making me choke (not good when having an attack). I called my pharmacy and they said it was changed because Medicaid wouldn't cover the other any longer as the new one is cheaper. I felt safer with my [MEDICATION] one. As for all else I love the Medicaid insurance. Thank you so much. Medicaid has been wonderful when it comes to my general care and emergency care, but I have had horrible experiences when it comes to dentists. I feel that my choices of dentists are very limited and the ones I have gone to lack in quality care. Thank you. Medicaid is a great program, however, big hospitals, such as [HOSPITAL] don't like this insurance. I had to wait 3 1/2 months to get in for a 10 minute appointment. Also, when working with [HOSPITAL], it wouldn't communicate with my insurance policy or vice versa. Not sure what happened but I had to personally call and get an approval number and then call [HOSPITAL] back with that number. Also, cu stomer service for Medicaid is not very helpful and you usually wait on hold for at least 10 minutes. Medicaid is a great program. The only issue I have is most dentists do not take Medicaid. I have not been able to see a dentist in over two years due to not being able to find a dentist that accepts Medicaid. But overall Medicaid has been wonderful for me and my family. Medicaid, in my opinion, is kind of a rip -off. Sure I get to go to the doctor if I really need to, but only certain doctors, and even mor e complicated when it comes to specialists for example I need my wisdom teeth out, but the only oral surgeon that takes Medicaid is the [HOSPITAL]. My current dentist won't refer me to anyone else and I can't trek up to [CITY] whenever I please. Please expand Medicaid. Most of the time I'm unable to get to my appointment, lack of transportation and because of my mental illnesses taking public transportations is very difficult. As for getting the meds I need they get denied or I can't pay the co pay because I don't have an income of any kind. In August my 194 medical doctor took a different job and I've been afraid to see a new doctor for my diabetes, COPD, and other health problems. Since I don't do well with changes and starting all over again. I'm not very tr usting. When I was supposed to see a new doctor a month ago I had no way to get there. Because I didn't have money for the bus there and back, and no one could take me because they didn't have the gas nor did I have money to give them for gas to get me to and from. Or it interfered with them getting their children from school. I can tell the 2 doctors I love was [DOCTOR NAME] and [DOCTOR NAME]. It's hard to find another doctor to fill their shoes! My big problem is finding a dentist for my toddler. Most de ntists have all places filled or I will have to drive close to an hour to get there. My doctor doesn't accept Medicaid, so I accepted it as a back -up for things like the hospital. I don't even know if it will be accepted when I go to the hospital. I had to choose a doctor that I will never even see. My medical experience has been good with Medicaid, but the dental side is not good. It is hard to find a provider that accepts it in the area I live in without having to go to [CITY]. This is especially true f or my children. I have not found a child's dentist that will take Medicaid in our area. Thank you for the survey. One question that should really be asked is if you live in a rural area, which has a big factor in the healthcare that is received. Need afte r hour holiday and weekend care. Not getting my medicines I needed until last minute. Overall I have not had any problems with Medicaid. One thing that I dislike though is that I am not able to see my old doctor who did surgery on my arm. After the surgery, I moved to Iowa for college and cannot go back to see that doctor and have him finish my surgery. Other than this I have not had any problems with Medicaid. Sometimes it is hard to find a local dentist. Sometimes it's an inconvenience to me while I h ave to wait for a prior authorization before I'm able to pick up my medication because it has taken up to sometimes a week to get to be able to get them and that's a week I'm going without my medication. That I can't go to [MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER] and the re is no dentist in Iowa that takes it. And if you have to be the first 100 people to get the surgeon to pull a tooth. The doctor's offices that I have tried to use would not see me because they didn't accept Iowa Medicaid patients (new patients) as they had met their \"quota\" for new Medicaid patients. Another office wouldn't see me because my husband had a bill outstanding there, not my bill, but they wouldn't see me, even though I had Iowa Medicaid. The number of doctors who are not treating a patient b ecause they will have Medicaid. The loss of income is something they aren't willing to do. The only issue I have had with Medicaid is the Lock -in-Program. I don't have an issue specifically using my doctor's office or specific pharmacy. It has been diffic ult obtaining prescriptions since I was locked into a specific pharmacy then moved and was unable to pick up prescriptions. Then they did a special approval for my local [PHARMACY] here and to be locked into [PHARMACY] (my choice). They never locked me int o [PHARMACY] but have continued paying for my prescriptions at [PHARMACY]. I have stayed with [PHARMACY] since I am satisfied, but if I would need a prescription right away in the weekend/evening timeframe, it may be difficult to obtain since [PHARMACY] is not a 24 hour pharmacy. The only problem with Medicaid is more a problem with dentists. I have poor dental which has been made much worse over the last years by the kinds of medicines I must take. I take 10 prescribed, six over the counter plus three prescribed topical ointments for a skin condition. But I need serious dental care as all my medical doctors concur but most dentist will not take me. I need surgery probably to remove some of my teeth but all the ones in my area work only on children. Now I'm 65 and have Medicare and Medicaid and I think this is worse. So I get wonderful healthcare, but my teeth are rotting out. I thought dental health was important to medical help but I don't think our system thinks so. That is all. The only thing I found ha rd was trying to find a dentist to take my Medicaid. I was told at every dentist office that they only take people with Medicaid from their town which was a problem for me because I don't live in a town with a dentist office so that are you supposed to do. I had to drive 60 miles round trip to a dentist I used to see years ago because I was already a patient there so they would accept my Medicaid. Otherwise everything else was fine with Medicaid. 195 They could provide more places where I can get help and use my Medicaid. Because some doctors won't take it and some doctors don't like people on Medicaid, so it's kind of hard to get the help I need. They need to offer more options in healthcare, that more doctors are willing to accept the insurance, and more qua lity case workers, some are rude and make it feel like it's a burden that you are on Medicare. And get back to you in a timely manner instead of always waiting around for a call back. To use Medicaid, this will result in choosing a doctor you may not like because some doctors do not accept Medicaid. Most of the time, our prescription decline from medicate because the medications is not generic. A clinic like [CLINIC NAME] in [CITY], they do care to call the patient and inform him about the test result he h as been taken for almost three weeks. [CLINIC NAME] waiting time to be called and see the doctor is less than the [HOSPITAL NAME], but I think the team who work with doctor \"Nurses\" do not care enough. Very hard to find a dentist that takes Medicaid. We need more dentists and pediatric. Dentist want to accept Medicaid, Title XIX it is so hard to find. And psychiatric doctors too. Wish dental visits were easy to get but I can't get a dentist to take my insurance so I can keep up on my oral health. With M edicaid I was not able to find a health care physician other than at a walk -in clinic that would help me because I am on Medicaid. Also, while out of state I was not able to find a doctor for a minor problem at the time who would take my insurance. Another thing, I have a problem with it trying to obtain help with mental health problems. Doctors have never really asked anything about my mental health and when trying to find someone to help me there weren't many that would even take Medicaid and if they do t here was many stipulations that I did not qualify for. PART 2: NEED ADDITIO NAL MEDICAID COVERAG E All medicines are not covered by Medicaid. Can get an eye exam every year but only new glasses every two years. When the dentist says we need specific th ings done (crowns, dentures, etc.) and Medicaid denies request and says we don't. And the one thing that bothers me the most, for single parents on Medicaid. The parents that are out there working, going to school and trying to do what they can for their f amilies get cut off Title XIX after a certain point (time or over income). Then there are people who are making no effort to work, but are more than capable of working and receiving Title XIX, FIP, food stamps and other government assistance. Where is the incentive for them to get off welfare? I think benefits should be extended or be a little bit better for parents who are working and trying to make a living and not be penalized by getting cut off assistance. I believe parents who are capable of working an d are just sitting on welfare should have their benefit decrease little by little as an incentive to get out and work. Can't get the meds my head doctor said I need because Medicaid won't pay so I have to wait longer for [PHARMACY] to send again. Dental benefits are extremely limited. Not many dentists to choose from. My child has a crooked tooth that literally cuts her tongue but she doesn't qualify to get it aligned with braces even though she does have issues requiring braces. Dislike they won't pay t o have a tooth put in. Doctors don't seem to know what medicines are covered by Medicaid. It's very frustrating to sit at the pharmacy for over an hour while the doctor and pharmacist discuss what different prescriptions they should use that will be cover ed by Medicaid. This has happened repeatedly and it's a waste of time. Especially when you are sick waiting in a store for your prescription. Don't seem to be getting hepatitis shots, working on that! Hate waiting for preapprovals on medicine and procedu res such as CT scans. I have either a bulged disk or herniated disk in my back. My doctor (and I) felt the need for an MRI to determine cause for pain and lack of mobility. Medicaid denies the test b/c I need physical therapy or medication. 1) Physical th erapy makes my pain escalate to the point it hurts to walk. 2) Medication is only \"knocking me out\" and the side effects are much worse. Hence, I have to deal with this CONSTANT pain b/c Medicaid won't allow the MRI! 196 Title 19 does not want to pay for my m edications. Keeps denying me for what reason I don't know. Also have asthma and have been hospitalized numerous times yet here I sit with no help going stir crazy. Have walked into hospitals asking for my shots and no one will help me. The hot flashes, the migraines, the stress and not the matter on my brain. Unbelievable. I just want some help and no one wants to seem to help me. My doctor has done all she can, but without the okay from Medicaid there is not much more that she can do for me. I've just abou t given up on the whole state system. I appreciate Medicaid very much, ever since I lost my [INSURANCE PROVIDER] in 2011. I don't understand the dental part of Medicaid, I know the cost is high, but do some dentists really have to do an unsatisfying job that the patient has to keep going back for care on the same issue? I don't know much about the mental part of Medicaid except that it isn't covered. I am so severely depressed and my anxiety is so high that even gaining or seeking employment is extremely difficult for me. I have an associate's degree and diploma in medical field with no luck. Because I don't know who to talk to about that. Anyway, Medicaid is doing just fine. Lord knows I'm grateful. I cannot take some generic meds, but Medicaid will not p ay for name brands. I dislike the fact that some of medicines are either the ones I was taking or ones I'd like to try, not approved by Medicaid. I dislike the partial coverage of hospitalization cost. It should be fully covered. Thank you. I do feel li ke the amount paid by Medicaid is not a fair amount and affects the care people are able to get. I personally have private insurance as primary and believe this makes a big difference for the care I received. I did about six years ago have a motorcycle accident and only had Medicaid insurance during the care and feel like I did not get the best care and now have long term issues that have not ever been addressed. Some such as memory and cognitive, pain and functionality of my right arm, hand and shoulder. I don't like that Medicaid doesn't pay for some medicines that were prescribed to me in the past. I don't like the fact that it covers so much for glasses at the eye doctor I'm going to. Other than that I love this plan. I don't like the fact that some m edications aren't covered even with preauthorization or even in a generic form. I think all medication is important because everybody has different problems will withstand because it's not covered by Medicaid. Plus if I could afford it there wouldn't be a need for me to receive Medicaid. I don't understand why my medical doesn't pay for my dental care, such as braces and oral surgery. I feel at times certain medicines or tests are hard to be approved for due to certain guidelines attached to the medicines or tests. I feel if the medicines or tests are requested/prescribed by a doctor, which in itself should make it necessary. I greatly appreciate that Medicaid exists and I am incredibly grateful for the program. That being said it is very frustrating that doctors have to jump through hoops to get a medication I need, approved. Also, basic medications that I can't afford (cough medicine) aren't covered since they can be bought over the counter. And if my doctor prescribes something needed, but Medicaid will only cover a certain brand, I have had to wait days just for confirmation and additional approval when this happens. To this day Medicaid still won't approve a cold sore medication, the only one that works as a preventative for me and does not cause adver se side effects like those that Medicaid will cover, that I need to make a difference. That is very frustrating. But again, the coverage that is there which would otherwise not be means the world to me as a single mother. I had a hard time getting my syri nges. I need them for my [HEALTH CONDITION]. I cannot take it without the syringe. I take this for my RA. I hate it because sometimes it doesn't cover my prescription for weight loss. I could at least get a discount and if I would like to go to another doctor I can't I need a referral if they are not my primary. I think we should be able to choose even though we don't go to the same one (doctor) all the time. I have a hard time getting some of my medicines I need like my weight loss medicines. I'm very over weight and need these medicines to help me lose weight. Also my insulin, sometimes I have to get a preauthorization and it sometimes takes weeks before I get those medicines. I go weeks without my medicines. I'm interested in weight loss surgery and did n't know if insurance paid for that kind of surgery. I have a son who is nine months. How do I get a baby sitter for him? The lady has babysat for him since he was born. I don't have a job but I have been going to school. She needs to be paid. Please help me get money to pay her. I don't care if you know who I am. 197 I have a very hard time getting meds at times because I have to have a pre authorization from the doctor and sometimes it takes weeks to get it and by that time I'm out of my meds. For example, my insulin. I have been paying out of pocket for my medication because Medicaid won't pay the generic brand, only will pay for the name brand. The name brand is impossible to find where I live. It makes no sense to me because the name brand is more expens ive. I am also unsure of when my coverage is effective. I go to the doctor or pick up meds with my fingers crossed that I have coverage. I have been taking same medication for 10 years and Medicaid doesn't want to pay for it anymore. So I have to myself. My doctor has sent in why I need it but they want me to start at the beginning. Therapy different, need pain specialist and shots. I have had a lot of problems getting prescriptions the doctors want me to take, and go sometimes 2 months without them due to all the required paperwork the doctor has to send in and the pharmacy waiting on your okay. My doctors have had to change 2 of my medicines due to this and my long wait without them. Now one of them has been discontinued by the company. Also Nitro spray is not covered, the tablets will not dissolve so I have to depend on samples from the doctors when they get them. This all is a great problem and a lot of stress on me. Don't understand why people can't get what the doctor says you need. As far as doctor, test and hospital the program is great! I have several teeth missing, have asked my dentist for partials and was denied. It can be very difficult to eat at times. I was without medical for six years. Previously went in for gallstones and my surgeon took it upon himself to fix a hernia I wasn't aware of. This was in 1999. I wasn't asked at all, he just did it and for years after that I had problems having bowel movements or doing anything that involved my tummy muscles. It came back a few times. Still to th is day I have issues with my tummy. I like having Medicaid but it doesn't cover things when you really need them. Thank you. I live everyday with extreme chronic pain due to medical conditions, which causes me to suffer more depression from it. And every single medication any doctor has tried to prescribe me, it's not at the pharmacy when I go to pick it up due to needing a pre- authorization from Medicaid first or being fully denied to be covered by it. There has been many times that I'd been on a medicati on that was working very well for me, then just out of the blue with no pre -warning first, Medicaid decides not to cover it anymore. Then have to be left suffering once again until I can schedule an appointment, find a ride to it and wait for doctor to be able to find something close enough to it and then hope it's at the pharmacy without needing pre -approval first. I need 17P injections to prevent preterm labor. Medicaid will not pay for them. I need dental work, I lost a filling but because no one in my area is taking Title 19 patients and money constraints make it very difficult to travel 50 miles for a visit. I need new dentures. Can Medicaid help me pay for them and fine me a dentist that accepts Medicaid? I needed dental care badly, could not get i t and now have dentures, old dentures, but cannot afford new ones. Dental care leaves a lot to be desired! Sorry I did not fill out dental questions. I think it's wrong that the doctor won't give patches and we have to go through ***** to get help to quit smoking. I think they need to widen their views on medicines. Sometimes I couldn't get meds because my insurance won't cover it. Also, I think people, including me, should have better options for help to quit smoking. I use a nebulizer three times a day , but because a certain breathing piece is better, easier and helps me breathe better I have to use the one that isn't as expensive. I was injured in a motorcycle accident and Medicaid isn't paying for a lot of things needed to help me, so I have to lay a nd suffer because my driver wasn't insured. I wish it was easier to get medical help such as a CT scan or MRI with NO problems being on Medicaid! I feel when you are on Medicaid doctors hesitate to order it because it's too expensive and won't get paid fu ll amount by insurance company, especially in a serious chronic disability kind of situation, they should work on that system. I wish Medicaid would help pay for the brand drug, [DRUG NAME] which is different than the generic because it works better for m y thyroid problem and is $49.00 a month. I work two to three days a week and I have someone living with me to help clean the house, do laundry, do my cooking and make sure I take my medicines every day. Her name is [NAME], she is a [PROVIDER] but I am try ing to get her approved to get paid by my case worker. I have not had any luck. She has been my in home helper since 2013 and has never received any payments. She 198 takes me to all my doctor appointments and she also takes me shopping. I have filled out the waiver but I have not heard anything from the case worker. I hope you can help me. I cannot live alone because of health issues. I would like to have the benefits returned that were taken away, like having crowns for teeth. If at least to be able to buy o r pay for better insurance to be able to get those benefits back. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with Medicaid or the doctors, but I find that a lot of unnecessary tests are requested when an MRI or CT scan would eliminate tons of the same tests. I'm not sure if MRI's or CT scans are not covered by Medicaid, but with all of my issues and concerns I have never been offered one, when that would find or cover most of my problems. The lack of knowledge and help I receive from doctors is immense. They keep running same tests over and over and this doesn't solve my issues. Then they say see you in three months while you are left to deal with your pain of disability for three months while you wait to be seen. I have been having a hard time finding a doctor who is knowledgeable in my condition, and Medicaid won't pay for an out of state doctor who specializes in my condition. This would eliminate a lot of irrelevant testing. I'm pregnant and I only got one ultrasound. Would have liked one more to be sure e verything is okay. In questions 1 -26 I was referring to my pain management physician. In questions 27 - 41 I was referring to my primary care doctor. For routine and pain management care I've had minimal concerns, perhaps, only that I've expressed concer n about increasing anxiety and its negative impact on my daily life and nothing is ever done about my concerns. In relation to dental care, my dentist and I were both disappointed at the care Medicaid refused to pay for. Lastly, I would love to attempt to quit smoking again. I tried previously using a quit line and the medication [MEDICATION]. Medicaid unfortunately refused and quit paying for the medication despite my compliance with the quit line program as required. It does not cover a lot of stuff anym ore eye, dental medicines. Why did all of this change? It is hard to get new medicines. I take [MEDICATION] and it is brand new. I have tried other anti - depressants but none work like this one does. Since it is like impossible to get, I have to rely on samples or spend $400. Another thing is bariatric surgery. My fianc\u00e9 went through the whole six months process only to be turned down because a psychiatrist that saw him for 30 minutes, diagnosed him with something he doesn't have. You would think that his w eight would have been the main factor. It won't cover a lot of my medicines. I've been trying to receive a dental appointment since March 2014 and have yet to receive one. Also I'm 18 weeks pregnant and I called the healthcare line about receiving breast -pumps after birth and they told me they don't cover breast pumps. These are the only things I dislike about Medicaid. I've been waiting for almost four months now so that I could get braces. The first request was denied and now waiting for another respon se. My teeth are shifting and it hurts every day. You'd think if my orthodontist thought they were that bad I wouldn't have to wait so long. Thank you. Just one thing happened. My little girl couldn't receive her flu shot when I wanted due to insurance and there's a short supply of it. But we finally did get them. I wish there was a way that insurance would not make a decision if someone is trying to get preventive health care. Thank you. Likes - Financial assistance is wonderful. Dislikes - Denials for n eeded tests are ridiculous. Denials for medicine refills. Especially the 30 day supplies for seizure patients. I'll be on the medicines all my life and not to be able to get medicines and tests is sad. Medicaid did not cover lead testing for my daughter. Now we owe $90. I also wish healthcare providers would inform individuals if a test they are requesting is not covered on their healthcare plan so we do not run into surprises like the above stated. Medicaid does not cover certain prescriptions. Medicaid does not cover prostate exams until age 50. A lot of dentists don't take Medicaid patients. Eye and hearing exams I am in need of, but don't know who takes Medicaid patients. Medicaid does not cover OTC allergy meds which are very expensive for someone on SSI. Medicaid has helped me tremendously, throughout the years especially through my college years. The only problem I have come across is treatment for a certain condition. I have [HEALTH CONDITION] which leads to terrible sweating under the arms, I was prescribed hyper -care solution which unfortunately does not work for me. I was sent to a dermatologist who was supposed to administer Botox injections which would have paralyzed the sweat glands. I got to my appointment only to be told Medicaid does not c over it, so I asked why, the dermatologist said they must not find 199 it necessary. So until Medicaid finds it okay I will have to go to work and continue to meet people and socialize with huge sweat rings around my armpits which do cause irritation as well f rom the constant moisture and rubbing of skin. Medicaid has made it very hard for me to get help by a doctor for substance abuse. Not only that but after I finally found a substance abuse doctor (on my own) I had a very, very hard time getting Medicaid to even approve him. Then we have my medications. Its hell trying to get my medicines filled every time they need to be filled. The problem I have with Medicaid is that they do not seem to be supportive or even want to deal with substance abuse help. I liter ally went through hell with them and still continue to, just to stay clean. I see a specialty doctor for substance abuse and it was very hard to approve him and the medication I take to stay sober and not use drugs. It's an ongoing problem I've been dealin g with it for a long time and I've even though many times to just drop Medicaid because of all the problems I have with it. If I could afford to I sure the hell would. Medicaid is not helpful and to me it's a joke. Medicaid is often wonderful for my needs . I am on approximately or over 20 items (prescriptions). There is no way I could afford to pay for the medicine. However, there are times when I need a certain medication and the government will not approve. Example, eye drops and diabetic medicine. Thank s. Medicaid should try to look at more of the big picture and not think everyone is out to scam them and they wouldn't waste so much money. I NEED to have a breast reduction and that would probably end all my back problems but Medicaid won't pay for it. I nstead they would rather I keep going back to the doctor repeatedly for years to get medicine and try other expensive treatments than make the onetime payment of $8,000 to end it. I am giving you a common sense solution Medicaid -LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS/PA TIENTS! Medicaid will not pay for the examination necessary for health assessment before chiropractic care can be administered, and this poses a real obstacle for me in getting the chiropractic care that would help me significantly. If Medicaid covered ma ssage therapy, it would be very helpful for patients with anxiety, PTSD, depression, or any condition that would could improve from the stress reduction as well as additional physical benefits of massage therapy. I raised my two children as a single parent while living in poverty, (albeit \"American style.\") Having access to Medicaid and the overall excellent health care coverage we received through Medicaid was a HUGE BLESSING. I considered it our \"single payer healthcare\" and felt no shame in accepting and using it. My family did not make unnecessary use of Emergency Room care, a behavior often attributed to Medicaid recipients. Reimbursement rates could be better, of course, encouraging ALL health care providers to accept Medicaid insurance. Most of the t imes latest, new medicines are not covered by Medicaid. My only complaint about being on Medicaid is that the doctor's hands are literally \"tied\" as to the amount of care they are allowed to give the patient. The hospitals are told how far to go with treatment with patients on Medicaid. Many medications you can't have what your doctor wants you to have because you are on Medicaid. I am thankful for the Medicaid program for the people who honestly need it. But I feel it is also a program that is abused by a lot of people who are capable of holding jobs, etc. My only issue with Medicaid is having the ability to get certain drugs, tests, procedures in a cost effective way. I've been fighting to get disability for three years now and I'm currently taking eigh t [MEDICATION] a day for pain. I barely am able to function and yet I have to keep fighting. I'm not eligible for things I need until I'm labeled disabled by SSI. Need dental care. Need glasses and teeth. Need to cover more medical things for people whe n it is needed. Need to get teeth pulled as I have a crowded mouth. Dentist wanted me to have braces to correct several things. Don't know if anyone can help with that. Off brand medicines, medicines that Medicaid will not pay for. Should be able to hav e more blood work when wanted to be tested for other things. Some kind of medications don't cover by Medicaid, so that may need extra time until the pharmacy contact the doctor to change it. Some doctors don't accept Medicaid that result in choosing what available in the list that most we don't know any information about them. Some medicines are difficult to get prescribed, morphine for instance they are scared to prescribe (I feel). 200 Stopped giving me ADD medication because Medicaid said they wouldn't pa y for it. Not enough anti - anxiety medicines. The Medicaid for dental is horrible. No one accepts Medicaid and there is only dental clinics. They are terrible. The medical card is not available to adults in the state of IA. If they have any type of job. O ur children have it but my wife and I do not. That is why this survey is not valid for me as I was dropped from it once my wife started working. The only problem I have with Medicaid is trying to get prescriptions filled within a timely fashion can be dif ficult and frustrating when you have to have that medication but can't get it filled it causes more issues than we already have to deal with each day. The process of getting prescriptions approved is difficult and time consuming. The wait on prescription s, whether they are first time fills or refills. Especially when it happens to be when I call to refill on a Thursday or Friday, because on the weekend the pharmacy is closed and I'm told there is a hold on the prescription or it's too soon to fill. Then I 'm without my medicines for two to three days. There is a specific medication that I need that Medicaid won't pay for (it's over $3,000/mo) instead they gave one option of another cheaper drug that is very difficult to procure has a lot of side effects an d is marginally helpful. I'm also told I will develop a tolerance to it eventually so I have to pick and choose when I take it. This is a very protected drug and I run out every month waiting not only for the doctor to write a paper RX but then the pharmac y has to order it which can sometimes take over 7 days. I think it is terrible that Medicaid is taking the place of my neurologist and deciding which medicine is best for me. It is not my best interest of health they are concerned with, they just don't wan t to pay for it. This is my opinion, is very, very wrong. There is nothing about vision in here. My Medicaid plan does not cover my vision so we pay out of pocket because I need a specialist. There was a form of birth control Medicaid did not cover. I wa s breast feeding at the time. Some birth controls are compatible with breast feeding. I had tried a few that were and reacted badly to them. The one I could use Medicaid did not cover. I was a little disappointed considering it was the only one that would not make me very sick and it was compatible with breast feeding. It is called the [MEDICATION]. They (Medicaid) paid for most of my prescriptions but not for the doctor visits. That's why I can't get to the doctor very often. Supposedly I have Medicaid bu t I always receive a bill for the doctor visits. I had to go thru the pharmaceutical company directly to get most of my prescriptions as Medicaid only paid for some of them. It's hard finding dentists and eye doctors that will accept \"new\" patients. I owe so much money to doctors from the past 6 months. I don't get how this is good insurance. I wish I hadn't gone to the doctors. I don't know how I'm going to be able to pay the doctor bills. They are entirely too picky of what they will cover. It makes it v ery difficult when they change the rules when I still have refills and can't use them. They keep changing the rules of how much I can get for needles or lancets for my diabetic needs. They also changed which lancets they would cover for my blood test mach ine, but still pay for my chem strips, which makes no sense. I'm lucky my daughter helps me keep track of it with them changing things all the time. Too restrictive. Too intolerant. Trying to get help for taking care of my daughter since she left the nur sing home. She needs 24/7 care so I cannot work and just have my SS to try and make ends meet. The waiver programs suck too long of wait periods when caring for her at home versus a nursing home where you would have to pay more. She was in a nursing home f or about nine months and has been with me for little over a year with no help at all. I am a certified Cdak provider without any pay. When I need to get certain medicines, I can't get because insurance won't pay for it. Like I need [MEDICATION] once in a while, but can't get it. I don't have the money to pay full price when you are on SSI. If doctor wants you to have, there shouldn't be a real big problem to get it. Will not help provide adaptations needed in my home, bathroom equipment. Would like bette r glasses coverage. Would like to mention that my doctor prescribed the shingles shot but I am not old enough to get it. I have been plagued with shingles since I was 21 years old and I am now 45. I don't feel I should have to endure undue pain when I cou ld get the shot, if only I were older. There is no way I can 201 pay for it so I keep using the pills and ointment that cost probably more yearly than the shop would cost. Yes, I want transportation to help me pay my car fare. I don't need them to come and ge t me. They didn't do at all. PART 3: PROBLEMS WIT H COST OF MEDICAID P ROGRAM Cost risen with prescription. I only have Medicaid as back up to Medicare which prices have risen. Some drugs covered, some not. Having to find or use secondary medicines in replacing the old medicines when people find out you're on Medicaid they treat you less like a person, more like cattle. I dislike having the co pays because I have other bills that have to be paid to keep my family afloat. I have to forego medication and d octor visits because of the co pays. Plus I don't like the fact some meds require prior authorizations to have. I feel if for some reason or any reason you cannot afford your co pay for visits or your medicines they should allow your doctor and/or pharmac y to give you your healthcare and/or medication free of charge up to three times per year. I have diabetes and have a hard time paying for my testing supplies. Medicaid stopped paying for them. I can't afford them on my own. I use my testing supplies to m anage my diabetes, why won't they pay for them anymore? I don't get any information about why Medicaid just stops paying until I go to the drug store or the doctor bills me. I am on disability and can't pay for the medical care I need, because I can't work anymore. I have diabetes and Medicaid refuses to pay for my lancets but approved testing strips. Now does that make any sense? They also refused to pay to cap a tooth which further prevents tooth decay which cost more in the long run. Now does that make sense? I am on SSI and I don't have the extra money to pay for these medical needs because I don't get much money to pay for my housing and food and my 11 prescriptions every month. If the cost of living keeps going up I will not be able to pay for my basi c needs. I need my diabetes lancets to manage my diabetes so it will not get out of control to the point I need hospitalization. That will cost Medicaid more money compared to approving a $16.00 box of lancets a month. My dental care will also cost Medicaid more once decay becomes out of control instead of authorizing a cap. Medicaid needs to authorize these low cost preventative alternatives. I have two bulging discs in my back. However, never have an extra $31.00 for patches that only last me a few days. I live on 442.00 a month. There's months that I can't even afford my medicines that I need daily, and test strips for my diabetes. I don't even have money to put gas in my vehicle, when I do have gas money, I put 8 dollars and last 2 or 3 months. A frien d gives me cigarettes. If Medicare doesn't pay then neither does Medicaid. I now have doctor bills to pay because some doctor misinformed me that I was preapproved for diabetic classes by Medicare for 10 classes over a 12 month period. After a few classes I was informed that neither insurance would pay for any more than two classes. So now I am paying the hospital for this bill that has two account numbers for the same bill. The way I have it figured I have left to pay $66.00 toward these classes and the hospital is trying to charge me twice for the same bill. I live on SSI and Social Security and work at a piece rate job. More assistance is needed to help pay for these mistakes that doctors make and expect the patient to pay out of pocket for. If you're i n the hospital for observation for 24 hours they won't pay for your meds, therefore [INSURANCE PROVIDER] won't pay it either. The hospital has my number for Medicaid but I've never heard from them how to fight to get help for payment. Thank you. It would be nice if Medicaid would pay for part of this medicine and the name of the medicine is [MEDICATION]. I think all medicine should be covered by health insurance. It shouldn't matter if private health insurance or if it is Medicaid. They should have to pay part of the medicine. It would be nice one day if medicine wasn't so expensive and more supply, tax dollars would go further but not everybody would get a yearly raise, everybody should be able to live by their means not above. With so much sickness in th e world, physically and mentally, it is getting worse and worse every single moment. It's simple. Lower all costs, make more money, live within your means. Sorry I wrote a book, just had to get this off my chest. Thank you for your time. 202 Medicaid doesn't like to go and help get my test strips for my blood sugar monitor a lot of the time. One test six to eight times a day. I only get SSI for income, I can't afford to see my doctors I need for everything because I get bills I cannot afford. It's nice to have help but it isn't really help anymore. My biggest problem is paying co pays for office visits and medications I do not have a job and usually either have to go without or ask friends for money. This also affects me to be able to get my medications. My ph armacy is 20 miles from my house one way and I don't always have the gas to get there. Right now my doctor wants me to take a medication that you do not cover and there are others you don't cover due to them being \"supplements\". They are not supplements to me because I had gastric bypass surgery nine years ago so my body can't absorb them from the foods I eat so my body needs these supplements to work properly. I think this should be an exception to the rule. My Medicaid will not pay completely for a motor ized wheelchair for me, to help me get around. I use a cane now but it is hard getting around. Sometimes the doctor tells me to get my daughter's things over the counter. Which means I have to pay for them. That is the reason I have Medicaid. I can't afford to pay for the medications. Dentist is hard to find a place for new patients with Medicaid. Medicaid has helped so much with doctor visits. Thanks. Took 6 month old daughter to ER (high fever, ear infection, problem breathing). Took 3 1/2 hours in ER. ER not very busy, waited 1 hour for someone from x -ray to come. Bill was enormous (over $3,000) billed me for $298.00. Well I can't see a doctor in [TOWN], because the [COUNTY NAME] won't let me see a doctor who is associated with the hospital. Because I owe them some money. So when I need to see a doctor I have to go to the emergency room. That's why I don't see a doctor very often. When I try to make a doctor's appointment they say I can't get one. If you could help me with this I would be grateful. Would like it if they would cover you even if you make more than a certain amount of money. Healthcare is expensive and I worry I won't be able to get my RX due to price. I have diabetes and the insulin is expensive I won't be able to buy insurance and pay fo r doctors' visits and medicines every month. That worries me. What if something really bad happens, I can't pay for anything. PART 4: COMMUNICATIO N PROBLEMS WITH MEDI CAID OR PROVIDERS Called hotline and told dental was not covered. Then to learn it was covered six months later. Eye care is not covered as I was told but plan to check into that now that I know I was given false information. It would be nice to be able to check what is covered for individual Medicaid recipients online. Actually have up to date providers. DHS office is helpful with paperwork over the phone, but there is no [PROVIDER] office in my county where I could talk to someone in person. Dislike how it is difficult to get things answered over the phone. Long wait times on the phone. Hard to get in touch with the right person. Overall Medicaid is pretty confusing. I am a little concerned at the amount of time they give you to fill out reevaluation papers when sending them. This time around I was mailed forms to fill out, but they were due two days later. I did not know that I am covered by Medicare. I go to the V.A. Hospital. I don't have a local doctor. I don't feel that information for anything beyond a regular doctor is easily accessible. I am aware I can get dental and mental hea lth care, but I have no idea how to go about it. I don't know who provides it or what is actually covered. Until this survey, I had no idea there was a help line. I plan to use it and hope to find it's useful and not like all the other [PROVIDER] numbers. I end up calling a bunch of numbers off of recordings and end up right back where I started. It's very frustrating. When I first had my son, we actually had a social worker assigned to us and I knew I could call with questions and get a response then, or a t the very least leave a message and get a call back soon. I had just recently got a letter saying I lost Medicaid one day before it became effective. Now if my son needs medical attention I have no insurance. They also gave me no reason as to why I have yet to return any of my five phone calls regarding the situation. I would like to know the difference between Medicaid and Medicare and what doctors take Medicaid. Would like to get healthy, but don't know what doctors it can use. Our community healthcare down here in [CITY], Iowa doesn't accept any new patients. The lack of communication between doctors is great. I don't know why they request your medical records when it's clear they don't even read them. 203 It is difficult to know when Medicaid ends. Som etime paperwork is mailed but not received until the deadline. It is very difficult to get duplicate insurance cards. I have asked over a dozen times. My grandma and grandpa are retired. Grandma cares for my 10 month old son and I am going to school. Can grandma get daycare pay for watching my son? Will she have to pay taxes on payment if she can get paid? She wants to do this so she can give me the money to spend while I'm going to school. I am in my second part of CNA and want to go to nurse's training. Please call or write me [PHONE NUMBER, NAME, ADDRESS]. Once your spouse dies and you get a little extra money they take your Medicaid away, saying you are denied. It would be nice, if when you're denied, they give you a list of places you can go to for supplemental insurance that will pick up where Medicaid left off. Filled out by son. Sometimes I am not clear on whether or not I have coverage or if my coverage has ended. Also, sometimes I am not sure whether or not Medicaid will pay for a particular med ical service, prescription, etc. It would be nice to receive notice when things have been paid for. For example, I go to the doctor and the appointment is paid for, it would be nice to receive something in the mail that says \"paid\" so I'm not wondering. I really appreciate the coverage though, going to the doctor is easy and hassle free. The only thing I dislike is the wait when you call Medicaid to change any of your information. I was on hold for fifteen minutes before anyone even answered. The wait tim e to hear if you're still covered. There's nothing I dislike. I just don't understand which doctors I can go to. I used to receive a list. I'm too shy to call and ask. They have never sent me a medical card. Called them and they still never sent it. Don' t understand how to use Medicaid. No information sent to explain it. When I did need to make a call to [PROVIDER] office the message machine said they were open until 4PM. I waited on hold for 37 minutes when I called at 2:15PM, not on a holiday. No one e ver called me back. Very frustrating. When starting Medicaid it would be nice to receive a list of family doctors that are approved by Medicaid. PART 5: NEGATIVE EXP ERIENCES WITH PROVID ERS / TREATED DIFFER ENTLY I am embarrassed to be on Medicaid. It is obvious I am treated differently. I believe Medicaid is a great program. Medicaid has helped me and my daughter so much until I am able to get a full time job. The only dislike about Medicaid is being looked down on, by others for having it. My daughte r was a surprise and I'm in school. I don't want to be on it forever. I appreciate having it, but it sometimes hurts being judged. I do not appreciate that doctors are not current on the availability of new drugs for people on Medicaid. I was told that I could not get a drug to replace [DRUG NAME], but I pressed on and could get it but I had to educate my specialist that I could and what was required and why to get it. I went recently to have a mass taken from my left brow and the room was freezing, not ju st cool, but if you needed to store a beef steak you could have left it on the counter in that room and it would have kept for a week. I was asked if I wanted my entire body checked for skin growths, a wise thing under normal conditions (a room not set at \"arctic expedition\"). They did not volunteer a different exam room and I was not interested in catching pneumonia, so I passed on the exam. In the age of impersonal technology, computers and \"smart\" phones maybe these sorts of problems are due to social dy sfunction in general, but I wonder if Mrs. [NAME] would be treated in the same way. I don't think they keep you in hospital long enough to explain your exact health problems, what to do about then when you get home. I.e.: rest. Get some help when get worn out. When need help. Last time doctor didn't even dismiss me, had mean nurse do it. And then my mom had a stroke 2 weeks later, got same nurse for 1 day, said he was abusive and rude and she could see how I could have gotten upset with him and swore at hi m. I don't like the stigma attached to Medicaid. I don't like feeling judged for having it. Also only being able to get government approved prescriptions and go to doctor's offices that accept it, is frustrating. But it's free so I shouldn't complain. Tha nks 204 I feel degraded due to having Medicaid. Like I'm not good enough for some doctors or some prescriptions due to my income. I feel that I do not get in for some tests as soon as people that have good medical insurance. I'm very dissatisfied with my de ntal care. It's the only office in town that takes Medicaid and I accidentally missed one appointment and it's the only one I've ever missed and it was because that morning I found out my mom was going through kidney failure. So obviously I was distracted and it was an honest mistake. I have called the dental office repeatedly and left messages (because nobody ever answers the phone), come to find out nobody returns calls in that office either. I've needed fillings done for the past 6 months but I can't get a hold of anyone to reschedule. My suggestion would be to have more dental offices that take Medicaid because one office that won't return calls is not working. Also there are stereotypical people within the system who shouldn't just assume a person is a certain way just because they are on Medicaid. These people need to be educated that every person on Medicaid has a story or a problem that Medicaid can help with. If I could give advice it would be to all who work in the field to always be sensitive and friendly, especially on the phone or in the field. Medicaid is a good program but there is room for changing the stigma about it through public service announcements and media on down to local levels of pamphlets and public info! It's not necessarily a di slike about Medicaid. I wish my doctor didn't always seem to be in such a hurry to get to his next patient. Most of the time I feel like I sit in the waiting area for 20 mins -45 minutes after my appointment time. When I finally get in a room and see a nurs e and she does what she needs to do I am waiting again for the doctor to come in maybe 5 -15 more minutes. When we gets in there it seems like he's in a hurry to get to the next patient. That's not my fault that he is running behind schedule so why do I nee d to suffer for it, feels that way? The mental health I have been getting is very poor! The Doctor [DOCTOR NAME] and other doctors have been very good to me. So when I answered the q's about mental health, it was very hard to answer. The mental health tre atment I've been getting is by far the worst I have ever seen or had, in the 40 five years by [DOCTOR NAME]. I have seen other doctors throughout the years, but this doctor is the worse. [DOCTOR NAME] is the best I have had in 25 years but he is retiring v ery soon. I need help for mental health very much. Medicaid in itself is not bad. It is the stigma that people who use Medicaid have. I feel like once some doctors see that you have Medicaid, they treat you differently like a poor person. Patients want to be treated as patients and not treated differently because of the type of insurance they have. However, there are also some medications that are not covered by Medicaid. Medicaid is a great program. My only real complaint would be that sometimes I feel I 'm not getting the full care others would get with personal insurance. Like they will cover the basics but not dig too deep into a problem before giving up. Medicaid is fine! The doctors and nurses can be arrogant, mean, cruel, and incompetent. [DOCTOR NAME] is good. [DOCTOR NAME] hurt me. Most nurses and blood collectors are incompetent! 2 nurses out of 20 were good at their job! Medicaid seems to be decent enough for people in need. I grew up with private insurance. Doctors seem to actually care. I had two C -sections, one on private insurance and one on Medicaid. I will tell you what, what a big difference, it seems like the doctors who accept Medicaid could care less. I sometimes feel like an animal. I been going to [DOCTOR NAME] for 2 years complaining about my breath, I went from 40 hours a week to 20 hours. She told me to go to dentist, they said there is nothing orally wrong. Kept going back to [DOCTOR NAME] and I would hope for some help maybe referring me to someone. I am 26 years old and can't liv e life because my breath smells like death (dry blood). Maybe I have something internally wrong, but basically Medicaid doctors don't care. Thank you. Most doctors dismiss what you have to say. I know that I am young and that it is unlikely for me to have back problems, it took over a year of persistent complaining before they finally ordered an x - ray of my lumbar spine. They found degenerative bone spurring. It is mild the doctor has made no suggestions as to what I can do to keep it from getting worse, n o treatment or physical therapy, no exercises. Just a curt 2 minute phone call to tell me what they found. I'm tired of being brushed under the rug because Medicaid only pays the minimum amount and they rush you in and out so they can get another consumer in who has regular insurance and they can charge a higher premium. I'm also tired of being looked at like I'm a common pill seeker. Yes, I am young. No, I don't have a lot of money and I am on social security, but I deserve common courtesy just like everyo ne else and it should not have taken a year to find the bone spurs. I think because I'm on 205 Medicare and because pill seeking is very rampant this is the category I was stuck in. This is becoming an all too common practice. My assigned provider does not kn ow how Medicaid and referrals work or pretend, not to. [PROVIDER] makes a huge deal and fuss every time I need referred to another place such as my midwife ore chiropractor. They often tell me completely wrong information regarding Medicaid and referrals. They do not deserve the business. They also handout antibiotics like candy, the male doctor in particular, who is also incompetent in other areas including listening and diagnosis. It's scary. My four children and I have all had the same family doctor sin ce my kids were born and myself since a child. Stop sending letters with different doctors and switching our family doctor because then we have to wait for an approval from Medicaid. I also have top dentures and the dentist who did them messed them up to t he point I can't wear them or to where the new dentist I am seeing can fix them. The new dentist said my medical only covers them every five years. That's fine, I understand but it's clearly not my fault I have to have a whole new denture and have to pay out of pocket for them or wait five years. I say call the previous dentist who screwed them up in the first place and billed my insurance numerous times for his mess up and make him pay the entire bill process back and allow me to get a new top denture. It is not good when you're told why you can't have this done or can't have this medicine because you are on Medicaid. While in the hospital I've had to leave because they weren't allowed to do anymore because I was Medicaid. I'm not ashamed of Medicaid, but I don't abuse it. I do deserve the right to be treated equal as if I had a million dollars. After all, I am a human being and I like to be treated as one and tell them so. Medically, Medicaid people are not treated equal. Never have been never will be. My personal doctor is junk. She's never available to see me. She is rude. Now my OB doctor at [CLINIC] was awesome, she always checks me in and has taken awesome care of me. When I'm due she makes sure I'm in. I needed 3 neg on my cervix, she made sure I was in and took care of me. My teeth are shattered from grinding. I went to a dentist and clearly told him that I have a plastic allergy in a pre- question form and verbally. He ignored my plastic allergy and told me that he would make me dentures (from plast ic). I said exceptions could be made for implants in such a case and he told me no. I called Medicaid, they said I was correct. I went to another dentist and told him they could make exceptions if he filed an exception form. He did the exam then said I needed a doctor's excuse and he could carve some out of wood. In 1996 I had blood poisoning from wearing pleather shoes. So I don't expose myself to plastic. So it is not something I get any regular treatment for. It was an emergency room case and not a perso nal doctor from 18 years ago. It does not make sense that I need an excuse from a doctor that does not know me. So basically I was very humiliated because I had Medicaid and not cash nor was I believed because if I had the cash I would not have been treate d so poorly. One of the things I dislike about Medicaid is that although you are assigned to one doctor, because you receive Medicaid you are given different doctors all the time, or student doctors. You never know who you will see at each appointment. Service is good much of time. Just wished the doctors would listen to their patients, rather than thinking their ideas are better. Example, pushing their ideas on patient. Understanding, listen. Sometimes I think since they changed the Title 19 the doctors really don't care about what problem you have because they don't take the time to really figure out the problem. I had a problem about 10 months ago where I almost died. I had emergency surgery over a girl issue and got really sick after surgery but all t he doctor was worried about it wasn't the surgery that made me sick but I was fine until I had surgery. Sometimes it feels like the doctors treat you different or with less compassion because you're just another Medicaid patient like you don't matter beca use you're not paying for your medical care. Especially my dentist which is why I'm looking for a new dentist. Also it's annoying having to go certain places because they're the only ones who except Medicaid. The people at the [OFFICE NAME] are useless, u nhelpful and very rude. When calling to ask questions or even to update things on your benefits the receptionist and or secretary could be more polite and not treat people like they are low life. I'm very grateful for all the help my daughter and I have r eceived and want to say thank you. [HOSPITAL] in [TOWN] Iowa, has had many people, including myself whom have been there in the past, that have said that anyone who is on Medicaid gets treated poorly and like crap. I was pushed 206 back on a much needed docto r's appointment while trying to schedule an appointment before. They'd said when I could be seen again, and when asked what type of insurance I had, I responded Title 19 at the same time as the person next to me responded self -pay and gave them payment then. Suddenly that person was already filling in that time slot and I was asked if I minded taking another day and time further away. We get treated differently and not as good as those with cash or better insurance. It's wrong in many ways than one the trea tment we Medicaid users get compared to all others. PART 6: NEGATIVE EXP ERIENCES WITH MEDICA ID Medicaid approved us, years back and later came back and said they made an error and we owe them all the money they paid on our behalf. Even though it was their error, we have to pay everything back. Had we known we shouldn't have been approved, we wouldn't have used it. Now w/ Obama Care, we are supposed to be qualified, however we worry that Medicaid will come back on us again so we try not to use it. Filin g for Medicaid has been a Nightmare mostly because the people taking and processing applications don't know what they are doing. It is IMPOSSIBLE to talk to someone regarding your applications 1) Couldn't find a dental office that accepted Medicaid. Was r ecently dropped from Medicaid, not sure why. Letter I received stated I made too much money to receive benefits but the wages they thought I grossed were untrue. As a patient our med. cost is $1, but for kids there's no cost but they give us the cheap gen eric medicines and they're not as good as the name brand are and we all get stressed so have it where it pays for a massage one time a month. If I don't get a gift card then don't send me anything more. This was too much time and effort to spend for nothin g. It's a waste of time and energy for only $2. I don't like that after all the years I have been seeing and taking all these medicines, you are going to tell me what I have to try. That's *****. I have bounced around so much my head hurts. I had to figh t with Iowa Medicaid to cover me for surgery out of state after it was proven no doctor in Iowa would/could do the surgery for a rare disorder. I eventually got the coverage after enlisting Senator Grassley's help, but the surgery was unsuccessful. Now the out of state hospital where I had the surgery done will not allow me back for further treatment because they won't accept the small amount Iowa Medicaid pays them. So I can't get needed further treatment there. They told me Iowa Medicaid pays out the leas t amount of all 50 states and they cannot accept that small a reimbursement. I have no problem with Medicaid at all, however I do have a big problem with doctors that do not listen. If they don't listen, how can they understand? If they don't understand, how can they accurately diagnose a problem? Shortened therapy time. Generic drugs only. Bad, bad, bad. Sometimes during review periods or if I report a change of income I get switched from doctor to doctor. It makes finding medical records difficult, suc h as when I tried to send the [HOSPITAL] my immunization records, which took a couple months. Otherwise I have no complaints. The biggest problem I had is they insisted I had other insurance when I had none. The only issue I have is my wife was removed w ithout any notice. I don't like being required to have it. I can't afford my own, so the State gave me the Medicaid when I applied for it for my child. I hate Obama Care too, it should be repealed. And Obama should be impeached immediately. I work hard fo r a living, and it is with deep regret that I must decline the use of Medicaid for my own personal use. I pay taxes into this system, and I would rather be a contributor than a further drain on an already over -burdened public health care system. PART 7: POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT MEDICAID All I would like to say is keep helping those people who need the help. All in all it has been a good experience. Appreciate being helped (me and my son) with being on Medicaid. Thanks again. 207 Asthma medicine is $270 to $70 inhaler. That's a lot that is why I like the plan I'm on. Awesome DCS. Everything great. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Thanks a lot for good care and survey. Everything is great. Thank you Everything is okay and I don't think there is anything I disliked. Fine program For me, Medicaid was a blessing. After I lost my job, I went for over 3 years without any health care! I lost or went through all my retirement, house, cars, having to live off credit cards. At least I could go to the doctor without getting totally stressed out, how I would pay for the office visit or any meds ordered. My father was a dentist, even graduated from the [UNIVERSITY], I wasn't able to go to the dentist for 3 years. I'm not told I've been moved to Medicare and been assigned to a secondary insurance. Thank you for this opportunity, I appreciate your time and concerns. Great program, very thankful it is available. Thank you. Great. Should look into helping more people who need it and not just anyone. I used this only as secondary. Thanks. Happy to help you. Happy with most of my medical treatment. Mostly. I absolutely love my Medicaid coverage for my child and I. To know I can take my daughter to the doctor without stressing about how I'm going to afford it is a great feeling. And I have very weak teeth and the coverage allows me to get them fixed and also get my glasses for my horrible eyesight. I would be lost without my Medicaid. Thank you for everything. I am extremely grateful to have Medicaid. Over t he past few years, I don't know how I would have managed without it. Medicaid has helped me with the birth of two children, great pre -natal care. Emergency hospital with gall bladder removal, managing of my diabetes by diet alone, allergy care, skin cancer , and a lot more I can't remember. Knowing that I am covered with insurance if I need care has been a life saver. Before joining Medicaid I was uninsured for several years. Having peace of mind regarding healthcare has taken a great concern off my shoulder s. Again, I am so thankful for the care I've been given. The only problem I've had was a medication for my migraines was not approved. But my doctor worked to find me another that is helping. I am glad to be on Medicaid, it helps me out a lot and my child ren and being a single mother I am thankful for programs to help me and my children. I am happy and humble to be allowed Medicaid. Thank you. I am newly diagnosed with cancer, so I am so very thankful to have Medicaid. Without this medical coverage I cou ld not get the treatment I have been getting and I would die in a short amount of time. I am satisfied with all my medical needs. I am very grateful for Medicaid. When I needed help, Medicaid came through for me. I was going blind and my health was very poor. Because I received Medicaid my mental condition has become much better. My health is still poor but I have learned how to deal with and use my medications properly. Thank you very much. I am very happy and I like to be in your program. Also God bles s all who think to me. I am very happy and pleased with Medicaid. It provides health and dental care for my son and myself. I would be lost without it. My son and I only go to the doctor when it is absolutely necessary and we only go to the dentist twice a year for check -ups and cleanings. We do not abuse the system because we know it is a blessing. I only had one incident with the paperwork that Medicaid had sent. It was extremely confusing. But the Medicaid staff was very helpful and the situation was ha ndled in a timely manner. I am very pleased with the care and services I receive with Medicaid. I am well satisfied with my healthcare. I am 95 years old and have had three by -pass heart surgeries, total hip replacement and two bones repaired. I feel I'm doing quite well. I depend on Medicaid, without it I'd be dead. It's necessary for us poor people. Since we are all wards of the state (slaves) we need to be cared for. Thank you. I find Medicaid to be a wonderful insurance and do not mind the new 1 co pay for appts or prescriptions. I greatly appreciate the help I get from Medicaid. Thank you very much. 208 I have been able to receive the care I need. I rarely go to the doctor and have a primary physician but usually anyone in the practice can see me. The only major use of the insurance was for a total knee replacement in 2013. I have yearly dental and every other year eye exams. I have been on Medicaid for a while and like it very much it definitely helps out so much. I thank God that I am able to have it. I have severe anxiety issues and panic all the time and it helps when I can go in and have no problems. Thank you. I have been pleased with the help I get. I have honestly received great healthcare from the time I got put on Medicaid, almost a year ag o when I got pregnant. I was and have always been treated very kindly and compassionate during all my visits. I broke my hand a couple months ago and got amazing care. My son's pediatrician calls on his days off to see how he's doing. I rate your whole sys tem a 10 and thank you for this amazing healthcare. I have [INSURANCE PROVIDER]. I have Medicaid for dental and eye glasses and to pick up what my other insurance doesn't. Also for help on medication. I'll soon be 79 years old and haven't been able to wor k for several years so Medicaid is a wonderful help. I have not had any issues. I have talked to several people and have always been treated with respect. Thank you. I have nothing bad to say about Medicaid. They are there if I need them. I have Type 2 diabetes and see a Nurse Practitioner. I feel she is very competent and I also feel free to be active in my healthcare. She has asked me to use cholesterol medicine, however I do not choose to. I go to see the ARNP every three months. I hope it doesn't ch ange unless for the better. I like and I am thankful to be on Medicaid it helps a lot. Financial wise I am not stable to afford my own insurance for my family and myself. So to be on Medicaid I feel very grateful. Thank you. I like being to get Medicaid because it's so much help me to go through any hospital that when I need to go. And I would like to get through every time and would like to get the information through how's I'll get in. Although I always feel more and more confidence about my Medicaid. A nd I would like to get always. I like how affordable it is and how easy it is to use. I was on other insurance before Medicaid and was paying outrageous amounts for doctor visits, medicine, etc. I like how it helps with my medical bills. I like if I hav e a question there is someone to answer or find out a solution for me and my kids. I like it so far. I like it, because I can get my medication cheaper and the doctor's bills are free. It helps me a lot. I like Medicaid and I wouldn't change it at all, it's a great help, especially for my family and myself. Good job and thank you. I like Medicaid because it is helping the needed people to stay healthy and enjoy life. Thank you Medicaid for your good services to the people. God bless you. I like Medicai d because the doctors are very nice and it helps to pay for medicine that I usually wouldn't be able to have even when I need them. I would like a list of all doctors like family doctors and dentists that take Medicaid please. Thank you. I like Medicaid, it helps me with my visits and medicine for my health. I like that it is helping my daughter and myself, so I am able to finish my Bachelor's Degree. After that I will no longer be a burden on state assistance. I really appreciate all the help in the proc ess though. I wouldn't be able to go to school without all the help and would probably be needing/qualifying for it forever. I like the usage of Medicaid because I could not afford doctors or hospital visits if I didn't have the help. Now do I really want to be on Medicaid, no I feel bad to be using up tax dollars that could be used for something else like roads or whatever tax dollars are spent on? I like to get information every six months and to assist my life forever and also the God bless all who do things to help for my life. Thank you so much. I love Medicaid a lot and I wish to stay on it. Please don't take me off this, I need it. I love Medicaid and am so grateful for it. Thank you. I'm not happy with the [HOSPITAL] here at all and have heard no thing good about it from anyone. I was given two wrong prescriptions. They do not take time to thoroughly do their job. I could go on, but however my prayers were answered when the [CLINIC] came here to [TOWN], they are the best. So now I go to them. They care and they make sure they get to the problem the first time, they explain everything so you understand and I've been telling everyone. 209 I only have to sign up once a year to be approved or disapproved. Once approved I never hear from the department and I have a permanent card that is always accepted, as they pay what Medicare doesn't. Without Medicaid I could not afford my medicine or doctor's appointments. I personally feel this is by far the best insurance for me and my children. I really like Medica id. It's affordable insurance for families with little or no income, and you really get to see some great doctors. I really like the Medicaid for me and my kids, it really helps us out and we have not had any problems since we have been on Medicaid. I jus t want to say thank you because I am a single parent and Medicaid really helps me out. I still have back problems often, sinus often, shoulder, knee, I think Medicaid has been very helpful. I thank God for Medicaid because I could never pay for my care. I think everyone who works for Medicaid does an excellent job. If anything wait times on the phone for help (on helpline) are lengthy. I think it's great I'm fortunate to have the coverage. I think Medicaid is a wonderful program, it's just a bit confus ing. I think Medicaid is good care. I think Medicaid is well managed, organized effectively. I am really satisfied with my experience with Medicaid and this type of research would be very helpful to improve the program. I just would like to thank the gre at people who are behind this program and special thanks to the people who conduct this medical research to understand the experiences of the people who are using the program and how can be improved effectively. Thanks to you all. I think that Medicaid is very helpful to people like me. I'm very grateful for the benefits I receive and for the information I'm always updated on through the mail or phone by [INSURANCE PROVIDER]. Thank you. I want to start out with, I really truly appreciate all the help that Medicaid has given me for my health problems. I have a lot of health issues. Thank you and God bless. Just wish that I could get transportation brochure for the person that takes me to my doctor appointments or my surgeries, but especially for the appoint ments and surgeries that are 2 to 4 hours away. Thank you for all your help, it has been so greatly appreciated. I would like to say without this insurance I would have nothing and no care! If I didn't have Medicaid, I wouldn't be able to afford healthca re. Medicaid has saved my life. I am grateful every day for Medicaid. I'm happy for the coverage. I'm perfectly satisfied with my doctor and treatment. I'm really grateful for this Medicaid program. Thank you very much. God bless. I'm so thankful for M edicaid. I have so many bills these last couple of years, my eyes, now my kidneys, and my back. After my Medicare pays, I really appreciate Medicaid. I have been on disability for 25 years with seizures and mental health problems. I'm now 74 years. Special ist for kidney failure and back trouble, bulging discs, narrowing nerves, etc. just in the last six months. My eyes are also a big problem. I have only reading vision out of one eye, very little vision out of right eye. My memory isn't the best. So, poor h ealth. Thank you for Medicaid. Takes a great deal of worry off my mind. Take lots of medication. It has helped me get the medical treatment that I needed. Because when I didn't have it I would not go to the doctor unless it was very necessary. It has hel ped my family and I out for years. It is a good program, it has helped me a lot in the past as well as now. It's very good. Just I want to say thank you very much Medicaid for helping me. I really appreciate it. Like - 1) Offer variety of services. 2) Low to no co pay/deductible especially for my kids and me. 3) I'm able to work and take care of my kids with no worries. 4) Covers medical, dental and vision. 5) Really appreciate what you do. I didn't have a job a few months ago and no car. Medicaid tran sport really helped me when taking my kids for appointments. They were never late and promptly picked us up after appointment. Really appreciated. I'm getting back on my feet now but will not forget all that help, reduced my stress. Thank you. Medicaid be en good in every state I have been blessed to live in and had to use Medicaid. 210 Medicaid came through for me when I was unable to work full time because of a family situation where I had to adopt my three grandchildren. I thank you for that, because withou t my health I couldn't do this. Medicaid got my newborn added to my account and mailed her card fast and I was able to give the card to the clinic at her one month exam with no problems Medicaid has always been very good to my children and I. Medicaid h as been available for me during the hardest times of my life. I've been very grateful. It was during two times in two very different years when my husband was laid off from his jobs due to company budget cuts. Those two times I was pregnant and became anxi ous about how my family and I were going to provide money to pay for having a baby in the hospital. Both times I was able to obtain Medicaid and able to have my babies at hospitals that I felt comfortable at. Both hospitals were different and had different staff. Medicaid took care of my stay at the hospitals and I am forever grateful. My family and I only use Medicaid when we really need it. We don't overuse our membership. Medicaid has been great for me. Don't know where I'd be without it. I can't say en ough what's it's meant to me (perfect) (grateful). Medicaid has been very good to me. I have been, life flighted about 6x. I have been taken by ambulance about 3 or 4 times. Thank you so much. Medicaid has helped me stay alive for many years. I am grate ful that it has been available to me. The Doctors who have taken care of me have always taken care of me and not shown any disrespect or animosity because I have Medicaid. I am very thankful and appreciative for the help I have and do get from Medicaid. Medicaid is there and the best when you need it. Sometimes it is all a person has. Thank God our state has such a good program, there are states that don't have what we have. Medicaid has helped me tremendously. If I didn't qualify for Medicaid I wouldn't b e able to afford health insurance. With Medicaid I was able to have a surgery that was much needed for years. Medicaid has helped my family a lot and greatly appreciated. I have a son whom is mentally disabled and Medicaid has helped in every way. Thank y ou so much. The only concern I have is trying to find a dentist that will take adult Medicaid that is not long distant traveling. Medicaid is a God send for me. Medicaid is a good program which helps people with low incomes as it is too hard to cover the health costs here in the United States. I am very thankful to the Medicaid Agency as it helps me to cover my health costs as I don't have enough income now. I like Medicaid. God bless this agency and its staff. Once again, Medicaid helps me to cover my family member's healthcare costs. This is a big help which I could not imagine and I could not be able to cover due to my family member's general income status. Medicaid is a very good thing for people. Medicaid is an awesome program. It has helped me and my son (3 years old) to our needs of healthcare. Thank you for all the help you have given us. God bless you. Medicaid is doing an excellent job, provide health care services to people of all ages. Thanks a million to Medicaid. Medicaid is very beneficia l to me. I have not had Medicaid for a year yet but it has helped me immensely the past nine months with doctors' visits for my pregnancy. I have [INSURANCE PROVIDER] for primary insurance and Medicaid has covered whatever [INSURANCE PROVIDER] has not. It is something I really need being a single mother. Medicaid it's very helpful for low income people like me, and I love the benefit that we receive with it. Most doctors and hospitals take it and I can't complain. Thank you guys. Medicaid ok. Reason for h ealth, God and his health. Medicaid to me is a God send. I'd probably be homeless if I hadn't received your help. My debt to you is great and I'm forever thankful. God bless you. My household is a one income household and we priced medical insurance thro ugh other companies and knew we couldn't afford it so I was going to go without insurance. Then I got pregnant and without the Medicaid program our lives would have been very difficult with all the medical bills. I appreciate the opportunity to have this p rogram available. Any procedures I had to have done throughout my pregnancy was covered and the only cost out of my pocket was maybe $1 for a prescription. That was a huge help to my husband and I. Thank you for everything. My income is so small I don't k now what I would have done without my Medicaid. It has taken care of all my medical expenses. It's a wonderful thing. 211 My most pressing concern is the availability of healthcare for my one year old son. Medicaid lets me be assured that he is well taken car e of and that to me is priceless. My name is [NAME]. I am 54 and glad to see this age. I used to be an alcoholic but due to my thinking more about my health and wanting to live, I no longer drink, it's been almost 15+ years! And it's a good feeling to be alive and knowing more about your health. I make all my doctor appointments I can due to my seizures or my transportation or the way I feel from meds, but most of the time I'm there rain or shine or snow! I'm very satisfied with the help and the aid am getting most of all I thank God. But it's you that count. I'm very pleased with your questionnaire, checking on me, thank you and I appreciate all my doctors. Nothing. I like the choice. One good thing, they have been there for me a lot when I needed them t o take care of things Medicare did not pay for, especially during my breast cancer time. It's been 11 years since then. They paid for a lot of medicines and other things for my care always. Don't know what I would have done without them helping me. Our fa mily enjoys having Medicaid. We may not know much about them but they make health coverage easy, less stressful. My husband and I are in good health so we don't see doctors much, we do however have two kids. We are also in poverty. Without Medicaid, things would be tricky. One of our kids has been diagnosed with Autism with a mild intellect disability. Medicaid offers her many services that others would not. Such as [SERVICE PROVIDER]. Without Medicaid finding a doctor would be hard. Medicaid makes it easier. They give us a list that shows which doctors cover and which do not. So if you're asking me if I like Medicaid, yes we do, even though we may not know behind closed doors. Our family is incredibly grateful for the Medicaid program. It has provided exce llent maternity and pre-natal care for us through two pregnancies/births. I'm very grateful for the dental coverage as part of the Medicaid program. My only issue was getting timely dental appointments to have work done after my exam and x -rays. The office was booked out several weeks for repair appointments and pushed me close to my cutoff date 60 days after birth. I was unable to do exam prior to birth of my baby due to need of x -ray for identifying problem areas on teeth (unable to do x -ray when pregnant ). Thus time to get work done was very limited before coverage dropped 60 days after. I had to pay out of pocket for final work completed due to inability to get appointments sooner. We are very thankful for coverage for newborn first year of life under Me dicaid as well. Medical treatment during these times are so critical and important. Thanks. Seven months pregnant and they took over my medical expenses when my primary insurance wouldn't. Also paid back bills I couldn't pay for. Six years ago my younges t daughter and I had a horrible car accident. I am still having pain from my 3rd degree burn on leg. Have hardware in right leg and had to have hardware removed from right ankle. I was under doctor's care for one and one half years. Spent six days in [HOSP ITAL] l and five days in [HOSPITAL] and then I had very good care at both hospitals. The home health took over when I was released from [HOSPITAL]. I have been very fortunate to have very good doctors, supportive friends and family. One does not realize wh at lies ahead and good thing we don't God knows. I believe Medicaid is a fair program. It has been in my long stint of recovery. So far everything is fine. So far no problems, thank you. So far so good. Thank you Medicaid. My mom is a single working par ent who has [INSURANCE PROVIDER] of Iowa and we also use Medicaid as secondary. This helps her/us a lot. Thanks So glad that I have this when I need it. As my mother and father are both dead and I'm trying to get a college education now. Thank you and al l the people who cared for me. God bless you all. Thank you for paying for all my costs when I had my baby last year. Thanks The most reason why I like about Medicaid is that I don't have to pay much money when I decide to go to doctor or get a prescrip tion drug. There's nothing I dislike about Medicaid. It has helped me out a lot if I didn't have Medicaid then I wouldn't be going to any doctor at all. They have always been there for me in things that they do cover. Had no problem what so ever. Very e asy and very thankful. We appreciate and couldn't get healthcare without it for me and my family. 212 We are grateful for this program as we would never be able to afford the leftover doctor bill balance after our primary insurance company paid. Our kids are also on Medicaid and with their medical conditions and medication they take we would be bankrupt if this Medicaid did not exist. Our 20 year old son would not be able to get his medication and he would not be able to get it otherwise. Our family is extrem ely grateful for the Medicaid program, it enables us to get checkups for our kids when they need it and dental care when needed. Some of our kids need more care than others. This is a good program for those who need it. Thank you. Well, Medicaid is a prog ram that helps people with any kind of health issues. Every hospital respect the program and it's a good program We've not had any problems and very much appreciate everything done for him. Without Medicaid I would not receive the valuable resources that my son needs. I would never be able to pay for the prescriptions that he needs. I think it is a wonderful program that everyone should be entitled to. You are doing great. PART 8: OTHER COMMEN TS About the only thing that comes to mind was the length of time it took to get approved for a partial from the dentist. But it's all done now, so no problem. Keep me in mind for future surveys and volunteer work. Breaking my bones with diabetes setting in my body. Dental \"care\". Transportation. Questions #97 , #101 (10, 17), #108 (PTSD) perhaps, #111, other things. #111 humans are not a collective. You are species of individuals, so you are a male or a female. The educational system with all of its flaws passed me through the cracks and just let me pass, the p oint I stopped school was a point that was undeserved, grade 11, should have been much lower grade. I don't get sucked into the politically \"correct\" mentality. My oral health is poor though my dental treatment is fair. Some of the Medicaid funded transpor tation is fair to poor in a few ways. My health providers and other \"professionals\" and other people, including myself do not have an absolute true understanding of how and why I am the I am. I am unique and justifiably don't get sucked into the \"one size fits all\" mentality. #101 I have a relatively variety of mental, emotional, physical, intellectual, neurological problems. Migraines are occasional but do occur. Have naturopathic doctors. Physicians who want to use alternative medicine instead of throwin g common pharmaceuticals at a person. Not just alternative but herbs and remedies from the earth. I do not know if Medicaid can help. I've had chronic back pain, I'm diabetic and my thyroid is out. I can't get anyone to hire me, I'm assuming it's my weigh t but of course they're not going to come right out and tell me. I need to know if they're some sort of temporary disability I can get on. I don't get sick ever, but I sometimes worry if I ever do I know I couldn't afford it. I don't have a doctor, and ha ve only been to a doctor 3 times in my life. If I have a pain I live with for I don't like pills. I have got to have some kind of insurance for I am almost 66 and I know my health won't stay as good as it is right now forever. Thank you. I don't know of a ny problems about Medicaid. I feel Medicaid should educate people on preventative holistic care. Meditation, massage, chiropractic care, diet, etc. The more people that are educated the better. There is more to health than going to a MD and receiving a pill to cause more side effects leading to another prescribed pill. Medicaid should inform patients and over natural approaches. I had amazing help from holistic doctors (they took care of the medical problem) where regular medical doctors said there was no thing to be done and sent me home. It would be nice to be able to choose holistic doctors too. Over all Medicaid has been so very helpful and wonderful. Thank you 100 times over. I have been very healthy this year and didn't require a doctor's visit. I have Medicare not Medicaid, but it is not bad but my doctor ask my all the time for Medicaid I used to have before. I myself have never had a problem. I received the BEST mental health services from: [MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER] I would like to go back to wo rk, but having trouble finding work and having a lot of trouble with my knee and hands. 213 Income guidelines that are set to qualify are set too high. I will soon lose my insurance and my current employer does not offer health insurance. Medicaid is not a f orever medical policy. Due to being unemployed, it is important that I have healthcare. When I do find employment which offers a benefits package, I will no longer use Medicaid. I do, however, am thankful that there is an option for coverage. My best frie nd helped in the above ways while I took care of children. My personal doctor is a specialist I have thyroid disease. My sister [NAME] helps me with all my appts, she makes them, she comes with me to explain things better, and she does my grocery shoppin g for me. The only problem I have right now is my back pain due to an accident I was on a bus. There is too much too write down/explain. You can feel free to contact me and I will gladly address my concerns with Medicaid. My number is [PHONE NUMBER] and my name is [NAME]. For Medicaid - 1) I don't have problems normally with insurance. 2) I feel like the frequent paper updates are unnecessary and repetitive. A quick phone call would save time, dollars, and paper. 3) Having caseworkers in same area would be helpful. 4) The system is great when it works. I think Medicaid is a great program to be enrolled in but think guidelines should be changed. Law states Everyone has to have insurance now and I was not eligible for Medicaid right away because my income was too high. However, I was on unemployment at the time and barely living week to week and until Obama Care was in effect I had no health insurance. My daughter qualified but I did not. I understand it's a congress/state thing but need to fight for the \"p oor people\". 214 "}
