For the study, sixty rats were divided into six groups. The control group was given distilled water. Group two was CUS-induced rats given distilled water, while group three was CUS rats dosed with anti-depressant drug sertraline (10mg). Group four CUS rats received 0.35g of XPJY, group five CUS plus 0.7g XPJY and group six got CUS plus 1.4g of XPJY. In the Morris Water Maze test, the CUS rats that received 1.4g of XPJY took the least amount of time to find the platform on day one. \"The present study found that the escape latency (time to find the platform) in the XPJY 1.4 g group on the first day was significantly shortened, but the difference for the sertraline group was not statistically significant,\" researchers wrote. \"These results shows XPJY could increase the ability of spatial learning of depression rats by CUS.\" Memory improvements A spatial exploration test also revealed the memory-boosting benefits of the XPJY 1.4g group, and of the sertraline group, by day five. \"It indicated both sertraline and XPJY can achieve improvement with regards to rats' memory capability, while the efficacy of the XPJY 1.4g group was more significant. This results show XPJY increased the ability of spatial learning memory better than sertraline,\" researchers said. XPJY also inhibited weight loss among stressed rats. \"The experimental results are consistent with actual situation. The primary findings of the present study show that CUS causes cognitive decline and depression-like symptoms whereas XPJY showed ameliorating potential against detrimental effect of CUS,\" the study revealed. \"These results are in agreement with several other studies which also showed that CUS causes cognitive decline and depression like behavior in animal models.\" Source: BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine [DOI 10.1186/s12906-016-1543-9](http://bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-016-1543-9) \"Effect XingPiJieYu decoction on spatial learning and memory and cAMP-PKA-CREBBDNF pathway in rat model of depression through chronic unpredictable stress\" Authors: Chunye Wang, Jianyou Guo and Rongjuan Guo.
