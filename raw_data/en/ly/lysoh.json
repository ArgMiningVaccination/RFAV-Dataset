One reason: you may be too caught up re-living the past or planning your future to appreciate what the present moment has to offer. Another reason: you could be carrying unwanted thoughts and conditioning that no longer suit you. When you're too busy living in the negative thinking of \"I'm not good enough\" or \"life is too hard\" you're sending messages out into the universe that you are not ready and open for remarkable miracles and opportunities. Our favorite way to move forward and create new beginnings? A cleansing ritual! First, burn sage. Burning sage is one of the oldest and purest rituals for cleansing, most commonly recognized by the Native Americans. The burning of herbs is said to rid of any negative energy helping to heal the mind, body and spirit. You can purchase white sage from your local farmer's market or health food store or you can also order it online [here](http://www.yogaoutlet.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=8115371&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bing%2Bshopping&Click=2510030). While the smell can be very strong, many people find the aromas quite soothing. Before lighting sage, it's important that your intention for new beginnings remain present in your mind. When ready to burn, place the bundle of sage into a heavy pot and let the flame linger for a few seconds before blowing it out and letting the smoke flow freely to begin the purification of your space. Then, write a list of ways you let yourself down, didn't meet your own expectations, had negative thought patterns or limiting beliefs, and then release it. You can throw your list away or burn it and affirm what you do want for yourself. This is an offering to the universe \u2014 we are releasing what no longer serves us and creating space for what we do want. Next, sit quietly and visualize. Visualization is a very powerful cleansing tool if practiced properly and mindfully. Find a quiet area and sit cross-legged, palms facing down on the thighs and eyes closed. Begin by imagining a time that you felt low self-worth or a situation where you would like to go back and do it differently because you did not show up as your best self. Hold that vision and imagine how you would've liked it to play out. Perhaps you are a little kinder, more patient or confident. As you begin to rewrite the story, see if you're breath feels deeper and the tension you were once holding is lighter. Then, use that sense of calm and openness to visualize a new beginning. It could look like more stress-free interactions at work or what it would feel like not to worry about money. Really embody what this would feel like mentally, emotionally and even physically in your body. When you feel more of a positive shift, gently come back to the breath and flutter the eyes open. Practice this cleansing meditation often, especially if you're feeling fearful of change and new opportunity. Lastly, take a long bath in Epson salts. In detoxification circles, your skin is known as the third kidney and toxins are released through bathing. Soaking in the tub will wipe away any of the unwanted spiritual poisons still lingering from the sage ritual. Take at least 40 minutes to rest and cleanse. The first 20 minutes works to detract toxins and the last 20 minutes are for the reabsorption of minerals from the water. The sulfates in Epson salts also help flush toxins and form more protein in your brain tissue and joints helping your body feel healthier and your mind clearer. And of course, we recommend juice cleansing throughout the year.
