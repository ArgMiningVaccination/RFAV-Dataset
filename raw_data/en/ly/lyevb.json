She wears a highly potent blend of essential oils, and has been moved to another floor in an attempt to mitigate the impact on another employee's asthma. She firmly believes this treatment cured her of cancer and continues to keep her well. Talk of \"reasonable accommodations\" under the ADA is the tone of any conversation on the matter. I've left work twice because the smell triggered a migraine (I really can't stress how unpleasant, strong, and lingering it is), and I know of at least two other employees who have major problems with it. Everyone takes extra allergy medication. But ... that's nuts, right? A reasonable accommodation shouldn't negatively impact the rest of the workforce, right? A treatment should be based in science somehow, right? When talk of unusual accommodations comes up, people often speculate on what would happen if an office had two conflicting accommodation requests at once, and now we get to find out! I ran this letter past employment lawyer extraordinaire Donna Ballman, author of the excellent book Stand Up For Yourself Without Getting Fired. She says: So you have one ADA accommodation being granted, but that accommodation is causing other employees to have allergic reactions and migraines. What a pickle for an employer! I would suggest, for the employees who are being affected, that you each go to your doctors and get a note requesting the reasonable accommodation that you be moved away from the offending oils causing your reaction, or be given a filter or mask to wear. The issue of conflicting accommodations is one that employers sometimes have to deal with, and it's a balancing act they have to do. They must engage in the interactive process with each employee to determine what would be a reasonable accommodation. The employer may ultimately determine that this employee's requested accommodation of the smelly oils is an undue hardship due to the multiple chemical sensitivities it is triggering among other employees. That means the employer could work with this employee to find another accommodation that would work, such as providing her with a mask or filter. What the employer can't do is just fire her because of her smelly oils. It needs to work with her (or the other employees, or both) to determine a reasonable accommodation that is not an undue hardship on the company. I asked Donna about whether a medical accommodation has to be based in science in some way. Does it have to be something the employee's doctor is recommending? Could it be total quackery and the employer would still have to try to accommodate it? She says: The accommodation should normally be something the doctor recommended, but I have doctors who recommend homeopathic remedies all the time, so it's possible the doctor did or would recommend it. The employer has to engage in the interactive process with the employee and her doctor to come up with a reasonable accommodation that is not an undue hardship on the employer. So, back to you, letter-writer. It sounds like you and other employees impacted by the oils need to approach your company, explain the problems the smell is causing for you, and ask for your own accommodations. * I make a commission if you use that Amazon link.
