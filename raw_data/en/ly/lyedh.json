Chiropractic Committee organized to present to the MCAC in reinstating Chiropractic for the Medicaid population. Reasons to remove barriers to Chiropractic care for Alaska Medicaid p opulation: Brings Alaska into alignment with other state Medicaid Programs. Satisfies federal requirements of implementing alternative pain management strategies for acute and chronic pain patients. Having a non- pharmaceutical option prior to providing pain medication. Chiropractic care reduces the overall healthcare costs by eliminating the need for certain surgeries, advanced imaging studies, injections, Emergency Room visits, opioids and total prescriptions. Chiropractic reduces the initial use and prescriptions of opioids. Chiropractic is an effective treatment for Medicaid recipients. Southcentral Foundation recommends full scope chiropractic services for decreasing opioid utilization and decreasing emergency room visits. Patients who saw a chiropractor as their initial provider for low back pain (LBP) had 90% decreased odds of both early and long- term opioid use. Chiropractic Services reduces all the costs associated with pain diagnosis and Opioid Rx cost. The Chiropractic Committee is asking for coverage for the full scope of Chiropractic Services as it's outlined in the Chiropractic Statutes which includes the initial exam being paid for. Medicaid patients that are being cov ered which are the ages of 6 to 20 the parents are forced to pay upfront which then makes it so they are unable to get those services. This forces people go to a medical doctor instead which then by statistic show they have a higher rate of being prescrib ed medication. So, by allowing access to care for all ages of Medicaid beneficiaries which would be based on medical necessity patience would not have the out -of-pocket expense on the initial exam. Chiropractic Medicaid Coverage by State: State Adult Coverage Alaska No benefit Florida 24 CMT/Year Indiana 50 unites/year to include CMT, office visits, lab, x- ray and therapy Iowa 12-28 CMT/year depending on diagnosis Kentucky Full scope; 26 visits max Massachusetts Up to 20 CMT/year, based on medical necessity Minnesota 24 CMT The VA has taken care of Chiropractic care and has shown a 50% decrease in opioid use since it was implemented. We have seen in Road Island they have decreased their medical by 27%, their ER visits by 61%, and prescriptions by 62 and opioid prescription decreased by 86%. In New Hampshire when they had Chiropractic first, they had 55% lower opioid use. Blue Cross in their 85,000 beneficiaries had chiropractic first had they say that 20% had initiated care with a medical doctor previously. United Health Care also has a report that states that Chiropractic first decreases the use of utilization of care on the system. Question for Angela by Jeannie: Does the recommendation include any limits or just unlimited care? Response: The recommendation is what is deemed medically necessary so it would be up to the provider based upon the exam on how long the treatment plan should go. The secure care would be there to be as the checks and balances to prevent unlimited treatment. General q uestion by Jeannie: Who would be the one to make the recommendation to have Chiropractic Care covered by Medicaid? Response: MCAC group would make a recommendation to the Commissioner to cover this request. Question for Angela by Dane: Did you have any proposed fee schedule? Response: There is not a specific fee schedule. The Chiropractic Group have to discuss it. The Chiropractic Group would be willing to work with Alaska Medicaid and come up with a fee schedule. 3:15p.m. - 3:30pm. MCAC reviews and approves December 7, 2020 minutes . Discussion of new Chair. Dane steps down as Chair and Jeannie Monk states she is willing to step up. o MCAC officially votes for Jeannie Monk to assume the responsibilities of Chair. Dr. Julius \"Pepper\" Goslin - Update on the workgroups. The workgroups have not change significantly but a lot of work has happened since the last time. Pediatric telehealth and genetic testing have had a lot of work done. Pain in SUD workgroup that is in scoping. Goal is to get high quality of information. 4:00p.m. - 4:15p.m. Matthew Hirschfeld - Draft Alaska Medicaid Policy Clarification for Genetic Testing . Group was put together that would look at Genetic Testing for Medicaid. Challenges with Genetic Testing: Can be very expensive in some areas. Can be difficult to determine physician's area of expertise. Genetic testing is complex. Discovered issue: Some patients we not getting the initial round of testing. o This lack of initial testing delayed treatment by months and even years. Genetic Testing Group tasked with: Which genetic tests are appropriate for primary people to use? Which genetic tests should be saved for the geneticists? Goal is to improve efficiency of care, allow to get the patient to get the right care at the right time and improve payment for Medicaid for the appropriate tests. The Draft Alaska Medicaid Policy allows the primary care person to see a patient , determine if they fit the criteria for Chromosomal Microarray and order a test to get the process moving. This allows the geneticists order specific tests. Types of genetic testing: Chromosomal Microarray Analysis. Fragile X -associated primary tremor/ataxia and Fragile X -associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Single Gene Testing. Panel Gene Testing. Whole Exome Sequencing. Matthew Hirschfeld -P ediatric T elehealth MCAC Workgroup - Reviewed report from workgroup Behavior Health was able to utilize Telehealth fast and continue to provide services. Decrease by professional claims such as fever or strep laryngitis. Decrease in transportation expenses such as taxi vouchers, and hotel/meals.
