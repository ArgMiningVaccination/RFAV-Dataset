The Segue to Optimum Health Vermont,2018 Part 1 Stephen Sinatra, MD, FACC, FACN Presentation Objectives Learn how optimal nutrition provides the basic foundation for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Discuss some of the most popular nutritional trials demonstrating significant efficacy in coronary heart disease prevention. Discover why olive oil is the secret sauce of the Mediterranean Diet. Learn the beneficial effects of grounding on the human body.We live in an electrical universe where everything is interconnected! Pathology or disease is frequently an electrical malfunction (example - ventricular PVCs and meridians) and vibrational medicine is often the solution! Vibration Everything from mineral -enriched soils and rocks -to trees and plants -to animals and humans -have a vibration in their structure and being. *Sitting in a movie theater, cocktail party, dinner, or any eventVibration The goal is to enhance the vibration of cellular activity to support aliveness, creativity and health while diminishing stagnation and pathology at the same time. In the anti -aging movement, a higher vibration translates to 70 becoming the new 50. Micro -voltage of cells is the key (pulsation) - cancer, health , love . Cardiac Disease Energetic Considerations 4thChakra is in heart & lung area Heartbreak and Heart Disease Loss of love -unconditional love - cardiac risk The healing power of love PetsThe Paradigm of Vibrational Medicine All humans are conglomerations of electromagnetic energy Every cell transmits and receives energy Harmonious vs non -harmonious frequencies support or threaten healing Heart, brain and reproductive organs are most vulnerable to toxic frequencies Future of the healing arts is the application of positive vibrational energy vital forceVibration -The Precursor to Vital Force Vital force is our vital energy. It is call Chi by the Chinese; Ki by the Japanese; Prana by the Hindus, and Breath of God by Hebrews and Christians Scientific types refer to vital force when they focus on the mitochondria that produce it Mitochondrial dysfunction is at the heart of most diseases of the 21stCentury. Heart disease and cancer, Alzheimer's and even aging itselfVital Force and Mitochondria Every living thing is permeated with a special vital force at conception. It can be life force, general vitality or simply vibration. A person's vital force or vibration increases or decreases based on mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual choices. Thus, it makes perfect sense -the better the choices, the higher the vibration or your vital force energy and the stronger and healthier you become. Thus, vital force, mitochondrial energy, and vibrations are all connected.What Will Decrease Vibrational Energy Toxic energy fields -WiFi, smart meters, cellular and cordless phones, etc. Drugs/Alcohol/Sugar Chronic illness Negative emotions -Hostility, fear, anger, shame, resentment, depression... Over-vaccination in the newborn and infants Living in the energy of entitlement Living in a false self -My life is a lie Any misrepresentation of...The Truth!What Will Increase Vibrational Energy Sleep/rest Organically grown foods Non-inflammatory diet High zeta potential water Mind/body interactions -meditation, prayer, yoga, Reiki, etc. Exercise Nutritional supplements Detoxification Taking in or giving unconditional love Self love GroundingHealing Foods Wisdom of the Ancients Long before the age of microwaves, convenience and mass produced food, the ancient Greeks were buzzing about the idea of energy and its direct effect on all living things, especially humans. The ancient Greeks were routed in the philosophy that the energy you take in affects the energy you put out and believed that high energy foods connected them most closely with spirit. The Greeks believed that eating foods considered to be \"high energy\" or what we call foods of \"higher vibration\", or \"high vibrational foods\" intersects with science. For example, Greek athletes believed that bee pollen was a superfood as it contained unpolluted and natural nutrients from the bee and the sun that supported performance and endurance.80% of CAD Prevention Exercise Weight management Smoking cessation Mild ETOH Optimal nutrition**Okinawa/Mediterranean Diet Although the Okinawa diet has been touted as an anti -inflammatory and anti-aging diet, as the average Okinawan lives longer than the average American, the Mediterranean diet has the most scientific literature demonstrating its remarkable anti - inflammatory and anti -aging benefits.Mediterranean Diet and PREDIMED Study 4.8 year primary prevention Total CV deaths reduced 28% with nuts and 30% with 4 tablespoons daily of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) Reduction in CVA was 33% from EVOO and 46% from nuts Reduction in MI -20% with EVOO and 26% reduction from nuts New onset type 2 diabetes decreased 40% with EVOO and 18% nutsMediterranean Diet Mechanisms Olive oil is secret sauce 4 Tbsp of olive oil alters pro - inflammatory genetic expression including genes for arthrosclerosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular immune dysfunction, type 2 diabetes and hypertensionMediterranean Diet Effects Lowers BP Improves serum lipids -Lowers total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, oxidized LDL, and LP(a) and increases HDL while decreasing the total LDL particle number Improves type 2 diabetes Reduces inflammation, lowers hsCRP , interleukin - 6 (IL6), lowers vascular adhesion molecules Decreases brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) Reduces MI, CHD, and CVA Reduces homocysteineVegetarian Diets and Plant Based Nutrition Study of 44,500 participants followed for 11.6 years in GB.
