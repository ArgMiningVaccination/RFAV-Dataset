The medical approach has its foundation in a [ spiritual-scientific understanding of the human being](/wiki/Woo) that regards human [wellness](/wiki/Wellness) and illness as biographical events connected to the body, soul and [ spirit](/wiki/Spirits) of an individual. In the 1920s Rudolf Steiner - in conjunction with Ita Wegman - invented the anthroposophical medical system as an extension to conventional [medicine](/wiki/Medicine) based on the spiritual philosophy of anthroposophy. Anthroposophical physicians must have a conventional medical education, including a degree from an established and certified medical school, as well as doing extensive post-graduate study. Anthroposophical medical practices operate [when?](/wiki/Template:When%3F) in 80 countries worldwide. Waldorf education[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Anthroposophy&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Steiner also started an educational system known as [Waldorf](/wiki/Waldorf) or Steiner schools, most of which are in [Germany](/wiki/Germany) but also in the [US](/wiki/US), the [UK](/wiki/UK), [Australia](/wiki/Australia) and other countries. They place much emphasis on expression, art and integrating children's sensory development by age-level (e.g. they feel that TV and computers harm the imagination if introduced too early). Their use of religious themes has so far prevented them from receiving government funding in the US (except for one school in [Montana](/wiki/Montana)) despite many attempts, which the organization PLANS, Inc. (People for Legal and Non-Sectarian Schools) has fought. Most do not openly teach anthroposophical ideas, but the basis is still underlying it. Beliefs[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Anthroposophy&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Anthroposophy has beliefs taken from Eastern and Western religious ideas, such as veneration of [Christ](/wiki/Christ) along with [reincarnation](/wiki/Reincarnation). Anthroposophists believe not just in an immortal [soul](/wiki/Soul), but in a number of other spiritual entities, called astral, ethereal, etc. Their [anti-vaccination](/wiki/Anti-vaccination) stance derives from a dangerous and ignorant belief in [diseases](/wiki/Disease) being something you must go through to strengthen the soul in its present incarnation. Reincarnation - according to Anthroposophy - occurs regularly in 500-year cycles to enlighten the soul over time, and suffering that occurs during life (including that from diseases, hence their stance against vaccinations) is deemed necessary for this. Still, treatment of diseases through conventional medicine is not discouraged by practising anthroposophic physicians - anthroposophical medicine is primarily used as an additional way of treating diseases where conventional medicine is believed to fall short. Many other pseudoscientific beliefs stem from Anthroposophy, such as [Astrosophy](/wiki/Astrosophy).
