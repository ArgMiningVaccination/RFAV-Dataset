O'Quin Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Bohland, Lilly) and Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine (Arruda, O'Quin), Gigi's Shelter for Dogs (Herron). Abstract : Millions of dogs are adopted from shelters in the United States every year, but very little is known about their long- term behavior post-adoption. Our study aimed at identifying the prevalence of behavior problems in dogs after adoption and how those behav iors changed throughout the first six months post -adoption. Ninety -nine dogs adopted from five area shelters were tracked for six months after adoption. Owners were surveyed electronically about their dog's behavior at 10 , 30, 90, and 180 days after adopti on The Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) was used to track behavior over time. A multivariate model was created for each C -BARQ trait, controlling for multiple canine and household factors : use of behavior medications , acquir ing other pets, household moves , work schedule changes , shelter origin, age, sex, length of stay, shelter intake reason, and health status in the shelter . At each timepoint owners were also asked about overall satisfaction of their dog a s well. The following C -BARQ traits significantly increased during the study period: stranger -directed aggression, attachment and attention -seeking , behavior s, excitability, touch sensitivity , trainability , and chasing behavior . There were no significant differences in scores for fa miliar dog aggression, owner - directed aggression, dog- directed aggression, stranger -directed fear, nonsocial fear , dog-directed fear , or energy level . Despite increases in several undesirable C-BARQ traits during the study period there was overall very high owner satisfaction throughout the study . Across all timepoints, 98% of owners indicated their dog adjusted to the new home extremely or moderately well. 93% rated their dog's overall behavior as excellent or good. Additionally, 72% of owners described their dog's behavior as improved throughout the study. This information w ill provide veterinarians, canine behavior professionals, and shelter staff information to better council owners on the potential behavior changes in dogs after adoption from a shelter.

Bowlby , Z. Belacic, S. Long, S. Durgam Abstract : INTRODUCTION: Intrasynovial tendon injuries are common debilitating conditions in horses . Macrophages are key immune cells recruited to the injury site, secrete inflammatory mediators , affect tenocyte phenotype, and contribute to dysregulated intrasynovial healing. The research objectives include (1) optimizing equine monocyte- derived m acrophage in vitro differentiation, and subsequently determining their inflammatory (M1) and regulatory (M2) cytokine s, and (2) investigating intrasynovial flexor tenocyte- macrophage interactions eripheral blood CD14+ monocytes (n=5) were cultured with or without GM -CSF (6 days) followed by inflammatory (LPS+IFN ) and regulatory (IL- 4+IL-10) priming ( 24 hours) and subsequently their morphology, proliferation (MTT) and secretory profiles (ELISA) were assessed. (2) Donor -matched intrasynovial deep digital flexor tenocytes and inflammatory or regulatory macrophage co- cultures (n=4) were established in direct and tr answell systems. Following co- culture, mRNA (qPCR) and secretory profiles (ELISA) were assessed. Data were analyzed with one- way ANOVA and significance was set at p0.05. RESULTS: (1) Inflammatory (GM- CSF and LPS+IFN priming) M1 secrete significant (p=0.012) and TNF for regulatory (M2 -like) macrophages . Control and treated macrophages secrete equivalent TGF ; and IL -6 is not quantifiable in M1 or M2 media . (2) In culture and co- culture medium . Compared to transwell, direct co -culture significantly down -regulates SOX9, COL1A1 and COL2A1 mRNA regulates MMP13 mRNA. DISCUSSION: Equine M1 and M2 macrophages secrete distinct cytokines; IL -1 and TNF are the key cytokines. IL -6 is induced only during macrophage- tenocyte co -culture conditions. Tendon matrix gene alterations occur only during direct co- culture suggesting cell - to-cell contact mediated interactions between macrophages and tenocytes; and are equivalent among M1 and M2 m acrophages. Identifying innate immune mechanisms impacting tendon healing is vital for developing immunomodulatory approaches to enhance healing.

Capria , J. Kieffer, T. Cheng, A. Arruda, M. Campler, S. Moeller, and A. Bowman. Departments of Veterinary Preventive Medicine and Animal Sciences Abstract : Current options for depopulation of adult cattle outlined in the AVMA Guidelines for the Depopulation of Animals are limited, have logistic constraints, and may not be practical on a large scale. Water -based foam is advantageous because the necessary equip ment is readily available, easy to use, and presents minimal personnel risk. Foam has been successfully used to depopulate poultry but no research has been conducted on cattle. With the use of a modified rendering trailer in a field setting, we evaluated t he efficacy of aspirated water - based foam for depopulation of adult cattle. Animals were immersed in non- toxic foam to block respiratory exchange of gases and a gated approach with anesthetized cattle was used prior to conscious replicates. A total of 84 head of cattle were used and a subset was implanted with subcutaneous telemetry devices that recorded activity and electrocardiograms. In all trials, cattle were loaded onto the trailer using a single- file ramp and three gasoline- powered pumps delivered foa m into the trailer with a 15min foam dwell period. Average (\u00b1 SD) time to completely fill the trailer was 85 \u00b1 10s. Average (\u00b1 SD) time from container fill to last movement subjectively heard by observers was 187 \u00b1 70s. No animal vocalizations were heard d uring foam application or the dwell period, and all animals were confirmed dead upon removal from the container at 15min. Necropsies of the first 12 cattle revealed foam extending to at least the tracheal bifurcation and exceeding this level in 67% (8/12) animals. Average (\u00b1 SD) time for cessation of movement as determined by activity data was 151.8 \u00b1 76.4s. The results of this study indicate water -based foam is a rapid, effective, and safe method for depopulation of adult cattle with potential operational advantages over current methods.

Chen, J. Howard, A. Rudinky, K. Tolbert, G. Atiee, H.Connell , B. Cunningham, W. Deal, M. DiCicco, C. Fuerst, M. Gonzalez, L. Harjes, T. Hill, A. Jergens, J -S. Palerme, R. Riggs, A. Whitlark, A. Woolcock, J. Steiner, V. Parker, J. Winston Abstract : Chronic enteropathy (CE), protein -losing enteropathy (PLE), and intestinal lymphoma (LSA) are common gastrointestinal conditions in dogs. The goal of this study was to determine whether gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation or histopathologic diagnosis influenced clinician case management of these diseases. We hypothe sized that interpretation of endoscopic data and histology results would affect clinician decisions regarding case management in CE, PLE, and LSA in dogs. Ten cases of CE, 10 cases of PLE, and 9 cases of LSA were retrospectively identified by histopatholo gy reports. Each case was curated into 3 case presentations: 1. Total case data including history, physical exam, all diagnostics including endoscopy and biopsy results, 2. Case data without biopsy results, and 3. Case data without both endoscopy and biops y results. Four academic internists (AI), 4 private practice internists (PI), and 7 general practitioners (GP) were surveyed to evaluate the impact of these scenarios on treatment strategies. Treatment approach in case presentation 1 and case presentatio n 2 were compared to case presentation 3 for consistency. Frequencies at which treatment decisions were affected or not by additional diagnostic data were compared with chi -squared between diagnoses and practice types. The inclusion of endoscopic data al tered treatment decisions in 69.8% of all case scenarios (69.8% CE cases, 64.7% PLE, 75.6% LSA). The frequency at which endoscopic data affected treatment was not significantly different between diagnoses for all practice types. The inclusion of histolog ic data altered treatment decisions in 81.6% of scenarios (76.2% CE cases, 79.9% PLE, 89.6% LSA). Based on these results, endoscopic and histologic data were used clinically by clinicians of various practice types and influenced the treatment strategies elected. Further evaluation is warranted to investigate the impact of these decisions on clinical outcomes.

Clark , R. Winter, T . Aarnes, E . Green, P . Ruz, D . Addison, J. Rhinehart, K. Schober, and H. Friel. Dept of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Dept of Medicine (Division of Cardiovascular Medicine), Philips Medical Systems. Abstract : Background - Some dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) develop progressive volume overload and cardiomegaly. Histopathologic studies, but not antemortem evaluations, have demonstrated myocardial fibrosis in some of these dogs. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) aids in antemortem diagnosis of myocardial fibrosis in humans. Hypothesis/Objectives - The objectives were to evaluate dogs with MMVD and healthy dogs for myocardial ischemia and fibrosis using serum biomarkers and CMR. We hypothesized that myocardial changes would be evident on both modalities in affected dogs. Animals - Six dogs with MMVD stage B2 and six healthy dogs recruited from a hospital population. Methods - Prospective case- control study. Dogs underwent echocardiography and serum cardiac biomarker measurement (cardiac troponin I (cTnI), galectin- 3 (Gal -3)). Dogs were anesthetized for CMR, where T2 weighted images and pre- and post-gadolinium contrast T1 weighted images were acquired and analyzed on dedicated software. Data were analyzed for normality and expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or median ( interquartile range). Student's t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sums tests were performed. Results - No significant differences were observed for pre- contrast T1 values, post -contrast Serum cTnI Myocardial fibrosis detected by CMR and Gal -3 were not more common in MMVD dogs than controls. Dogs with MMVD stage B2 may not have clinically relevant myocardial fib rosis.

Authors : J. Copio, M. Walker, S. Meeker. University Laboratory Animal Resources Abstract : Efforts to maintain aseptic technique and standard of care while also maximizing efficiency of material use and cost are important goals for research investigators and clinicains to consider, particularly when conducting serial batch surgical procedures. At OSU -University Laboratory Animal Resources, one new, sterile suture pack per mouse is required per institutional guidelines. We hypothesized that, with appropriate aseptic and surgical technique, one pack of sterile suture can be utilized for up to five mice from a single cohort and during the same surgical session. For these studies, mice were randomly assigned to groups in which either one suture pack per mouse was used (N=13) or one suture pack per cohort of five mice was used (N=13). Following euthan asia and aseptic surgical preparation, a dorsal skin incision was created and closed with three simple interrupted 4- 0 braided Vicryl suture. Samples were collected immediately following the procedure and incubated in BHI broth at 37\u00b0C for 24 hr. 25\u00b5 of this broth was then plated on TSA agar media in 1:1 to 1:100,000 dilutions. CFU per plate were quantified after 48 hours of incubation. Positive and negative controls were employed to ensure sterility on fresh suture packs and the capacity for microbial grow th on heavily contaminated suture. This study found that, when aseptic technique was followed, reuse of suture on up to five mice did not cause bacterial contamination as evidenced by microbial culture. Our data support the reuse of suture on up to five mi ce from a single cohort and during the same surgical session providing strict aseptic technique is followed. This procedural refinement offers an efficient option for investigators who commonly conduct rodent batch surgeries, while not compromising animal welfare or aseptic standards.

Eicher1, A. Hoover1, K. Kuo2, and J . Her1. 1Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbus, Ohio, USA. 2Department of Clinical Sciences, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, USA. Abstract : High flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) provides warmed, humidified oxygen via a specialized nasal cannula . This modality reduces the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation for severe hypoxemic patients failing traditional oxygen support. In human respiratory therapy , the respiratory -oxygenation index (ROX ) has been validated when evaluating HFNC success or failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate predictors of outcome in dogs treated with HFNC. Eighty -one client owned dogs at two university teaching hospital s were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Medical records were reviewed to identify dogs treated with HFNC and data was collected for statistical analysis. The ROX was defined as the SpO2:FiO2 ratio divided by respiratory r ate and the modified ROX index (m-ROX) was defined as the ROX divided by heart rate multiplied by 100. HFNC failure was defined as worsening respiratory status, requirement for mechanical ventilation, or euthanasia due to declining respiratory status. Over all success rate of HFNC was 44. 4% (36/81). After 6 hours of HFNC treatment, SF demonstrated the best prediction accuracy (AUC 0.86; P < 0.0001), followed by the ROX P < 0.002) and the m-ROX (AUC 0.73; P < 0.122). Specifically, patients with SF ratio of 143 at hour 6 of HFNC had a 72% probability of failure with sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 93% respectively. A ROX 3.68 at hour 6 of HFNC had a 69% probability of failure with sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 92% respectively. The ROX index , m-ROX index , and SF ratio are easily attainable and noninvasive parameters that are useful predictors of HFNC outcome. Prospective studies in these indices are warranted to confirm the findings and to optimize cut -off values to predict outcome in dogs undergoing HFNC.

Abstract : Microperfusion is critical to maintain organ function, but may not directly correlate with macroperfusion especially in critically -ill surgical dark -field microscopy (DFM) to assess microperfusion was validated in healthy horses, b ut not yet evaluated in surgical colic patients. We aimed to measure micro- and macroperfusion parameters during colic surgery, to assess changes over time, and describe correlations between micro- and macroperfusion. Buccal mucosal microperfusion vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel density (PVD), and proportion of perfused vessels (PPV). Macroperfusion measurements included direct arterial blood pressure (MAP), HR, and cardiac output (CO) measured by lithium dilutio n method. Measurements were recorded at 30, 90, and 150 minutes after anesthetic induction. Data were collected for 9 adult horses during emergency colic surgery. Median for PVD, PPV, parameters negative correlation (rho = -0.23, -0.23) with CO and weak positive correlation (rho = 0.23, 0.22) with systemic vascular resistance. Poor systemic circulation could have resulted in tissue hypoxic vasodilation. Preferential shunting of blood from the buccal mucosa to other areas of the body could have resulted in even more pronounced local hypoxia and subsequent local vasodilation. The limitations include a small cohort and inherent variation of multiple operators. It is feasible to measure buccal mucosal microperfusion in clinical patients with surgical colic. The results reinforce that macrovascular parameters such as MAP do not adequ ately Keywords for abstract: Equine Anesthesia CR - 11 Title of abstract: Physical Exam and Metal Accumulations in Three Wetland Species Authors : J. Heinz, M. Flint Abstract : Heavy metal toxicity has significant effects on the health of animals and many heavy metals can be found as pollutants after human disturbance of the land. Wetlands help to filter pollutants from the environment and therefore concentrate these heavy metals, which leads to increased heavy metal exposure for natural inhabitants. In this study, two wetland locations with distinct pollution impacts were evaluated. Wetlands at the Wilds are impacted by previous strip-mining, which results in acid mine drainage and metal contamination of the environment; at Winous Point the wetlands are impacted by agricultural polluta nts and runoff. Within these wetlands, three wildlife species were evaluated: painted turtles Ten individuals of each species were collected at each site for a total of 60 individuals. Physical exams were performed and liver samples were collected and tested for eleven metals. Blood was collected on the turtles as well. Hepatic metal accumulations were found to vary based on location and as well as species. Cad mium was only found at Winous Point, with highest prevalence in catfish (1.09\u00b1 1.09ug/g). Arsenic was highest in bluegill at Winous Point (1.24 \u00b1 0.63ug/g), while lead was highest in catfish at the Wilds (0.71 \u00b1 0.21ug/g). Iron was higher in at the Wilds t han at Winous Point for each species, with catfish having the highest concentrations (8659 \u00b1 4196ug/g). Turtles at the Wilds had significantly higher estimates (28.38 \u00b1 6.93K/uL), while female bluegill at Winous Point had a higher rate of being g ravid (5/5), which may indicate differences in health of species between sites. Variation in hepatic heavy metal accumulations between species and sites demonstrate the prolonged impact and complex relationship between exposure and health homeostasis in wi ldlife species, highlighting the need for multifaceted evaluation and monitoring of pollutants in ecosystems.

Kinsella, L. Hostnik, J. Summers, H. Snyder, A. Gerding, T. Burns, R. Toribio Abstract : Recently, our laboratory showed healthy neonatal foals exhibit more robust endocrine responses to ingestion of mare's milk compared to equivalent doses of carbohydrates (lactose, dextrose) enterally and parenterally. To further understand the foal's biological response to administered nutrition, this study investigated the glucose and insulin response to mare's milk consumed via direct nursing versus nasogastric intubation (NGT). Twelve healthy Standardbred foals 4 days of age received: 1) 500 ml mare's milk via NGT (n = 5; MM), 2) nursed directly from the mare's teat for 5 minutes (n = 5; DN), and 3) 500 ml of isotonic crystalloid via NGT (n = 2; CON). Blood samples were drawn frequently for 210 minutes. Foals were allowed to nurse ad libitum at 180 minutes. Blood glucose (BG) concentrations were determined via a point -of-care glucometer and insulin concentrations were measured using a human -specific ELISA. Area under the glucose (AUCglu) and insulin (AUCins) curves were calcu lated and were compared at all timepoints using two -way ANOVA. All time points were compared to baseline (time 0) using Friedman's test (not normally distributed). AUCgluc and AUCins were significantly higher for MM and DN compared to CON at all timepoints (P < 0.0001). AUCgluc was not different between MM and DN at any timepoint. AUCins was significantly higher for DN compared to MM foals at all timepoints (P < 0.001). Neither glucose nor insulin concentrations were significantly different compared to baseline at any timepoint. When foals were allowed to nurse, robust elevations in insulin and glucose were observed (P < 0.003). Our results suggest that suckling (DN) stimulates more robust insulin responses than MM. In addition, enteral nutrition after prolonged fasting may stimulate exaggerated insulin and glucose responses. This may be a mechanism for foals to compensate for reduced energy stores within the first days of life.

Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Abstract : Ursodiol is a naturally occurring bile acid prescribed to cats for a wide range of gallbladder and liver conditions. Ursodiol is known for its ability to expand the bile acid pool by increasing bile flow and displacing hepatotoxic bile acids. Additionally, ursodiol has anti - inflammatory and anti -fibrotic properties. Therefore, ursodiol i s used in a variety of feline hepatic diseases, including acute/chronic hepatopathies, cholangiohepatitis, and for gallbladder abnormalities. Veterinarians prescribe a wide range of dosages and duration of ursodiol administration. Prescribing trends and cl inical characteristics of feline patients receiving ursodiol is unknown. This retrospective study aimed to determine the clinical use, dosage, and duration of therapy of ursodiol administration in feline patients at a teaching hospital over 13 years (2008- 2021). Since 2008, 88 feline patients were prescribed ursodiol at the Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center and were included in this retrospective study. Metadata from these patients, including signalment, history, diagnostics (including laborat ory data and diagnostic imaging), ursodiol dosage/duration, and patient outcomes were recorded. Ursodiol was most prescribed as a hepatoprotectant (29/88, (17/88; 19%) in feline patients. The mo st common prescribed dose was 10.89 mg/kg/day (range 5.2 to 33.9 mg/kg/day). An accurate duration of ursodiol administration was unable to be determined. Overall, these findings document ursodiol prescribing trends and clinical characteristics of feline pa tients presenting to a teaching hospital. These results can help guide novel applications of ursodiol administration in feline patients.

Husbands, and L. Selmic. Depts. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences. Outside contri butors: M. Cook, K. Mariato, J. Lenz, Veytsman, B. Janssens, Abstract : Feline renal carcinomas (RC) are uncommonly encountered. Limited information regarding clinical presentation, post -surgical outcomes, and survival times are available. The purpose of this multi - institutional, retrospective study was to describe the presenting features and clinical outcomes of cats with RC treated with nephrectomy. Thirty -six client -owned cats were included. Medical records f rom participating institutions were searched to identify cats that underwent nephrectomy and had a histopathologic diagnosis of RC. The most common presenting complaints were weight loss (n = 13) and hyporexia (n = 11). Twenty -eight cats survived to discharge (77.8%). Median progression free interval (PFI) could not be determined, as only 6 cats had suspected recurrence (16.7%) and 7 cats had suspected metastasis (19.4%). The median survival time (MST) for all cats was 203 days (95% CI: 84, 1379 days). However, when cases that died prior to discharge were excluded, MST increased to 1217 days (95% CI: 127, 1641 days). Preoperative erythrocytosis had a protective effect, as these patients had significantly longer MST (p = 0.006). Pre- surgical azotemia, renal tumor size, mitotic index, and tumor histologic subtype were not statistically prognostic. For cats surviving to discharge, prolonged survival times were possible. Due to varied post -operative treatment approaches, conclusions regarding the impact of chemot herapy could not be made. Further studies are necessary to elucidate other potential prognostic factors, the utility of adjuvant treatment, and to identify patients at -risk in the perioperative period.

COMMERCIAL THERAPEUTIC DIETS FOR DOGS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE Authors : G. Kratzer , J. Winston, A. Rudinsky, and V. Parker (Dept. of Vet. Clin. Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). M. Shepherd (Dept. of LA Clin. Sciences, Virginia- Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Blacksburg, VA). S. Delaney (Balance IT, A DBA of Davis Veterinary Medical Consulting, Inc., Davis, CA ) Abstract : Nutrition plays a fundamental role in management of canine chronic enteropathies (CCEs). Dog owners may choose to feed home- cooked diets (HCDs) over commercially -prepared diets (CPDs) due to a perceived lower cost; however, there is a paucity of data compa ring the cost of these options. We hypothesize that complete and balanced HCDs are more expensive than nutritionally comparable CPDs. Eight HCD recipes (e.g., limited antigen, low fat) were formulated by two board certified veterinary nutritionists to mimi c the nutritional and primary ingredient profiles of CPDs designed for the management of CCEs. The total cost [on a per 100 calorie (kcal) basis] of each recipe was determined via collection of raw ingredient prices from the three largest grocery stores in the United States and online supplement prices (e.g., multivitamin/multiminerals, amino acids, omega- 3 fatty acids). Prices of dry and canned CPDs were obtained from a national online retailer. Maintenance energy requirements [MER; 1.6 x (70 x BW kg0.75)] were calculated for 3 dog sizes (5, 20, 40 kg), and the costs of feeding dogs their MER from HCDs versus CPDs were compared with a Kruskal -Wallis test and post -hoc testing. Feeding HCDs was significantly more expensive than feeding dry CPDs ( P < .0001) but not canned CPDs ( P > 0.99).

Authors : D. Lantz and E. Green. Diagnostic Imaging Department. Abstract : The hazards of radiation exposure are well documented. Despite this, poor compliance to safety standards persists in veterinary medicine. The primary methods of protection from excess radiation are: reduce radiation field size with proper collimation, increase personnel distance from the primary beam, decrease exposure time, and wear protective equipment which absorbs scatter radiation. These concepts have been well -known for decades and yet, consistent application of these principles in daily practice is ignored due to perceived inconvenience, improper technique acquiring images, or lack of education about radiation safety. Multiple arti cles regarding radiation safety in veterinary medicine, spanning from the 1950's to the 2010's, all reveal similarly concerning themes. Namely, the recognition that radiation exposure is dangerous, that protective equipment is available, and that the risk s of radiation exposure are known; yet there remains a lack of consistent application of safe practices and use of protective equipment. Collimation is a frequently ignored safety practice in veterinary medicine. The purposes of this study are to compare the average absorbed doses of radiation received between radiographs performed with proper collimation, to those which mimic common ways radiation safety standards are disregarded. We will focus on the following unsafe practices: 1) poor collimation, 2) inclusion of the hand in the primary beam, and 3) use of a lead glove placed on top of the hand rather than properly worn. Furthermore, we will extrapolate risks to the restrainer by comparing these absorbed doses to effective doses which are known to lea d to deleterious effects.

Long+, G. Maleas*, H Rice+, and S. Durgam+ +Dept. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The Ohio State University *Tierklinik in L\u00fcsche GmbH, Germany Abstract : aspirate (BMAC) and platelet are gaining traction for treating equine articular and tendon/ligament injuries due to their anti -inflammatory properties and autologous nature. T heir clinical use is incumbent on clinician preference/exper ience, diagnosis, clinical signs, and feasibility. Injury - specific treatment protocols are lacking and necessitates delineating their comparative features . This study assesses the cellular, growth factor, and cytokine compositions of paired BMAC and PRP fr om 27 horses and tests the hypothesis that they will be equivalent in BMAC and PRP . METHODS: BMAC and PRP were prepared via differential centrifugation of bone marrow buffy coat and whole blood, respectively. The c ellular composition, growth standard automated hemoanalyzer and ELISA techniques , respectively. Data analyses were conducted w ith Two -way ANOVA for repeated measures with significance at p<0.05. RESULTS: The monocyte (8- fold), lymphocyte (3- fold), neutrophil (14- fold), and leukocyte (6- fold) numbers are significantly increased (p<0.0001) in BMAC compared to matched PRP isolates . In contrast, thrombocyte numbers are 5- fold (p<0.0001) increased in PRP relative to BMAC. Anti - inflammatory protein, IL1Ra (114- fold), tissue anabolic factor, angiogenic (259 -fold) are significantly enriched (p<0.0001) in BMAC ; and in PRP, PDGF (4 -fold) is increased (p<0.0003). DISCUSSION: Bone marrow -derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a promising biologic therapy ; however, isolating MSC requires expensive laboratory processing and handling, and as such presents clinical challenges for routine use. In this respect, although BMAC contains fewer MSC, we demonstrate that cellular components of the innate immune system and anabolic growth factors are enriched in 'p oint of care' equine BMAC . Delineating factor and cytokine contents of equine BMAC and PRP is foundational to develop injury -specific applications of these orthobiologic therapies , and subsequent use in equine practice.

Lu1, J. Her1. 1Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbus, Ohio, USA. Abstract : High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy has been gaining popularity in veterinary medicine as an advanced oxygen supplementation for patients that require support beyond conventional oxygen supplementation. For patients receiving HFNC, the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PF ratio) is used as a clinical i ndicator of disease severity. Alternatively, oxygen saturation measured via pulse oximetry (SpO2) to FiO2 (SF) ratio has been suggested as a surrogate for the PF ratio. H uman studies validated SF ratio to be a reliable surrogate for the PF ratio. However, this correlation has not been investigated in dogs receiving HFNC. The aim of this study is to assess the correlation between PF and SF ratios in dogs treated with HFNC. Medical records from nineteen client - owned dogs underwent HFNC w ere reviewed. A total of thirty data points with concurrent SpO2 and PaO2 measure ment were identified . SpO2, PaO2, and FiO2 were used to calculate the PF and SF ratio. Median PF ratio was 168 (interquartile range; IQR 108 -297) and median SF ratio was 186 (IQR 97- 243). Correlation coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all the data with Spearman correlation analysis and alternatively with Pearson's weighted correlation analysis of dog averages (weighted by number of measurements per dog) to account for repeated measurements within dogs. PF ratio was positively correlated with SF ratio in dogs treated with HFNC have good correlation, suggesting that SF ratio may be a useful, noninvasive surrogate for PF ratio when assessing oxygenation. Further studies are warranted to confirm and validate this relationship in larger number of dogs, and to assess the ability of SF ratio to predict outcome.

Lymphadenomegaly and fine needle aspiration with cytological evaluation of regional lymph nodes in melanocytic neoplasms is shown to have a poor correlation with histopathology and survival. Radiomics is a developing field that uses textural analysis of medical imaging to evaluate tumor heterogeneity in an attempt to predict biol ogical characteristics of a tumor. In this retrospective study, 18 patients met the inclusion criteria of a head CT with intravenous contrast and lymph node histopathology within 14 days of one another. This created a population of 40 benign lymph nodes and 8 metastatic lymph nodes. Post-contrast head CT images were uploaded into LIFEx Software where segmentation was used to create a volume of interest around the sampled mandibular and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Radiomic features were analyzed usi ng various voxel sizes, with only the 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm3 size sufficient for analysis. No statistical significance (p- value of 0.05) was demonstrated across the various radiomics features analyzed. In cases of oral melanoma, radiomic histogram medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes were not predictive of metastatic disease.

Ma , R. Cianciolo, J. Hokamp Abstract : Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is an important cause of glomerular damage and subsequent protein- losing nephropathy in dogs. Renal biopsy is required to definitively diagnosis MPGN and mixed MPGN (both have subendothelial immune deposits) and guide immunosuppressive therapy, which is indicated for immune -mediated causes of glomerular damage only. Therefore, minimally invasive and economical methods of MPGN diagnosis are needed. In a preliminary study, liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) found is a candidate urine biomarker of canine MPGN. The present study (retrospective, case- control) aims to o ptimize an antibody for Western blot detection of canine urine ApoB100, confirm LC -MS/MS data, and explore urine ApoB100 as a biomarker of canine MPGN . Human ApoB100 antibody was optimized for Western blot detection of canine urine ApoB100. A 550 kDa band, compatible with ApoB100, was confirmed in urine samples in which ApoB100 had previously been detected by LC -MS/MS. Urine supernatant from 86 dogs wit with Human ApoB100 antibody . Results were designated positive for ApoB100 if a band was present at 550 kDa and negative if the band was absent. Chi -squared analysis was used to assess for a significant difference in ApoB100 positivity between MPGN and non-MPGN urine samples. Urine samples were positive for ApoB100 in a significantly greater proportion of dogs with MPGN (68%, n=27) than in dogs with non- MPGN glomerular diseases (26%, n=12) (p < 0.05). In conclusion, Western blot results confirm LC -MS/MS data and further suggests urine ApoB100 is a biomarker of canine MPGN. Future studies aim to quantify ApoB100 in MPGN and non- MPGN urine samples via quantitative Western blot to establish reference intervals, sensitivity, and specificity.

Moore. Dept. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Abstract : Background - Spasticity following spinal cord injury (SCI) occurs commonly, but ways to measure this in dogs are underexplored. Dynamometry is commonly used to quantify spasticity in people. Objectives - Evaluate a handheld dynamometer for quantifying spasticity in healthy dogs and SCI -affected dogs. Animals - Prospective cohort study in 11 healthy dogs and 10 with acute TL- IVDE (SCI -affected). Methods - A handheld dynamometer (The Commander console and muscle test er, JTECH Medical) was used to perform measurements at multiple thoracic and pelvic limb joints. Healthy dogs were evaluated at two sessions in a 24- hour period. SCIaffected dogs were evaluated 0, 14, 30, and 60 days after surgical decompression. Measureme nts were compared between sessions in healthy dogs and between healthy and SCI -affected dogs using a Wilcoxon matched- pairs signed rank test and a Mann Whitney test, respectively. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results - Apart from the carpi, measure ments were consistent across sessions in healthy dogs. Measurements were higher in SCI - affected dogs for the carpi at day 0 (P < 0.0003); for the carpi and stifles at 14 days (P < 0.015); and for the carpi, stifles and tarsi at days 30 and 60 (P < 0.03). Conclusions - Dynamometry measurements for most joints are consistent across sessions in healthy dogs, but differ between healthy and SCI -affected dogs for at least 60 days after TL- IVDE. The inconsistency in carpal measurements require further investigati on. Dynamometry might represent a helpful quantitative measure of spasticity of pelvic limbs after SCI in dogs and could be used in future clinical studies.

Mrofchak, R. Madan, C. Madden, S. Justice, A. Rudinsky, J. Hokamp, and V. Hale. College of Nursing (Justice), Depts. of Veterinary Preventive Medicine (McGlynn, Madan, Mrofchak, Madden, Hale), Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Rudinsky), and Veterinary Biosciences (Hokamp). Abstract : Urine properties such as pH, urine specific gravity (USG), and protein profiles are routinely measured during a urinalysis to assess canine health. Clinicians have well -established reference ranges to assess urine in patients with urinary tract diseases, such as urinary tract infections. Despite this, less is known ab out the natural fluctuations of urine properties in healthy dogs over time. In this study, mid -stream free catch urine was collected from 14 healthy dogs (7 male, 7 female) over 12 time points that were hours, days, and months apart. We hypothesized that urine pH and USG would vary significantly over time, while protein profiles would be stable due to consistent protein filtration by the kidneys. Urine pH was measured via pH meter; USG was measured via refractometer, and proteins were profiled via 4- 12% Bis - Tris gel electrophoresis. Preliminary data showed that USG varied significantly (p < 0.0001) between dogs but was consistent over time within dogs (p = 0.2) while urine pH did not vary significantly between dogs (p = 0.588) because pH was so highly variab le within dogs over time. Urine proteins ranged from none to trace amounts. The most commonly detected proteins were at molecular weights consistent with Tamm Horsfall and albumin. Statistics on urine proteins are forthcoming. Our hypothesis for USG was un supported as it did not vary significantly over time, indicating that a USG measurement at any time should be representative for that dog, while pH was so variable that it should be measured at multiple time points before altering clinical decisions. These findings help define normal variations in urine properties, which can inform clinical decision- making around urine sampling and urinalyses.

Squamous cell carcinoma closely follows and is the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor of the feline middle ear. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cat s diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. The objective of this study was to describe the outcome of cats diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. Medical records from January 1, 2010 through January 1, 2021 were reviewed to identify cats with a definitive diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma based on histopathology. Twenty -eight cats were identified. Overall, one cat was euthanized following diagnosis, eight cats were treated with medical management, three cats were treated with coarse fractionated radiation therapy, one cat was treated with systemic chemotherapy, two cats were treated with a combination of coarse fractionated radiation therapy and chemotherapy, eleven cats were treated with surgery, and one cat was treated with a combination of surgery and coarse fractionated radiation therapy. Median survival time of cats treated with surgery was 168 days, compared to 85 days for those treated palliatively with either medical management, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. A poor prognosis was associated with neurologic signs at the time of diagnosis and evidence of vascular invasion on histopathology. While squamous cell carcinoma of the ear canal is a locally aggressive tumor that carries an overall poor prognosis, this case series documented improved outcomes for cats that underwent surgery versus other therapies.

Nealon1, H. Klein1, M. Salerno1, and J.A. Winston1 1. Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences. The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine. Columbus, Ohio. 43210. Abstract : Microbiome -based fecal evaluations are promising diagnostic tools or assessing feline health. However, given inherent daily changes in the gut microbiome, the ideal sampling frequency is unknown. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of different sampling frequencies on the resolution of fecal microbiome data (i.e. changes in species abundance and presence/absence). Our hypothesis is that daily fecal sampling is more effective than weekly or bi/tri -weekly sampling at capturing changes in the feline fecal microbiome in response to a new diet. This clinical trial was performed in six healthy and sterilized purpose- bred cats (3 male, 3 female) group- housed in a research facility. All cats were fed an adult commercial wet food diet, at maintenance needs, to which they had no previous exposure. Feces was collected daily for 36 days. 16s rRNA microbiome analysis (V4 region) was performed using R -Studio. Pairwise PERMANOVA evaluated changes in composition. S ubset s of data (i.e., once- weekly samples) was compared to the full (daily) dataset to evaluate daily versus lower frequency (i.e. once- weekly) fecal sampling effects. With daily sampling, twice weekly and three times weekly sampling, the fecal microbiome composition of each cat differed by day for t he study duration (p<0.01). Despite being co- housed, daily sampling identified distin ct microbiome compositions between cats at all time points (p<0.0001). When once weekly data was sub- sampled, no compositional differences between cats were detected and there were decreased differences over time (sampling week), (p<0.05) for all cats. Daily sampling or a pooled 2- 3 day samples may more accurately represent the fecal microbiome versus weekly sampling, which is the sampling norm for many companion animal studies. Ongoing analysis will evaluate taxa contributing to daily microbiome changes and compare sampling frequency schemes to establish appropriate study designs for future fecal microbiome studies .

Toribio, and T. Burns. Depts. Of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Abstract : 5'-adenosine monophosphate -activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonists, such as metformin (MET) and aspirin (ASP), have been shown to improve experimentally -induced insulin dysregulation (ID) when co- administered. Resveratrol (RES) is an AMPK agonist and also inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which is activated in laminitis, making this an attractive therapeutic target for equine metabolic syndrome- associated laminitis (EMSAL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combination treatments with RES (10 mg/kg PO q12hr), MET (30 mg/kg PO q12hr), and ASP (20 mg/kg PO q24hr) on experimentally -induced ID. We hypothesized that co- administration of AMPK agonists would improve insulin and glucose dynamics in horses with experiment ally- induced ID. ID was induced in 24 healthy adult light -breed horses using dexamethasone (0.08 mg/kg PO q24hr ). Horses were assigned of 5 treatment groups: RES, MET/ASP, RES/ASP, RES/MET/ASP, and control (CON). Frequently -sampled insulin- modified IV glucose tolerance tests (FSIGTT) and oral sugar tests (OST) were performed at baseline, one week after ID, and after ID plus one week of treatment. Insulin sensitivity (SI) and disposition index (DI) decreased, while basal insulin and glucose concentrat ions increased following experimentally -induced ID (p < 0.0001). Area under the glucose curve (AUC g) during OST decreased after combination treatment with RES/MET/ASP (P = 0.0013). Dexamethasone- induced ID alters glucose and insulin dynamics in horses refl ected in minimal model parameters. Additionally, treatment with a combination of RES/MET/ASP significantly attenuates post -prandial hyperglycemia and should be evaluated as a novel treatment for equine ID. Keywords for is a malignant tumor of the anal gland of the dog and represents approximately 2% of all skin and subcutaneous tumors in this species. The treatment of choice for this tumor type often involves surgery, radiation, or a combination of these modalities with minimal benefit proven with the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy. While more thorough staging of these patients increasingly includes a CT scan of the primary tumor and abdomen, the question remains as to how results of this CT imaging may relate to prognosis , or other features of the disease . This study aims to retrospectively evaluate the effect of primary tumor and metastatic lymph node dimensions using CT on the survi val time of patients and the probability of having contra or ipsilateral lymphatic involvement. Given the variable sizes of patients, a secondary goal involves using a standardiz ed ratio comparing these measurements to the diameter of the aorta at L4 in or der to better understand the effect of the relative size of tumors and metastatic disease on the above parameters. Between July 2016 and August 2021, 44 abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans were completed o n 37 canine patients diagnosed with AGASAC at The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center . Patients were included if they had a histopathological diagnosis of AGASAC and were treated at OSU with surgery , with or without the addition of radiation therapy. Data reviewed included histopathologic al subtype of AGASAC, surgical margins, disease progression, and types of treatments performed. With this information, we hope to provide prognostic information for patients following imaging that can help guide treatment options for both clinicians and ow ners.

Rudinsky Abstract : Probiotics are among the most commonly used therapies in veterinary medicine. E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is classified as a non - pathogenic probiotic strain with the ability to produce bacteriocins that exhibit antimicrobial activity against closely related bacteria. We have shown that EcN displays antimicrobial activity against feline uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) isolates in vitro. UPEC causes of the majority of diagnosed UTIs in felines. The action of EcN on UPEC strains in vitro indicates that UTIs represent another area where EcN could have a positive impact on small animal veterinary medicine. The objectives of this study were to detect short term colonization of EcN in the feline microbiome, to observe strain level diversity of E. Coli following EcN ing estion, and to look at the impact of EcN on the overall healthy cat microbiome. The methods used were to collect fecal samples from five healthy research cats at baseline (day - 2 to 0), and throughout the study (days 1 -28). Fecal samples were collected, a nd placed in macconkey broth to isolate E. Coli. The isolated samples were plated onto macconkey agar for 24 hours. Twenty colonies per sample were then plated onto luria agar and incubated for 24 hours before being banked at -80 degrees. DNA extraction wa s then performed to evaluate how long EcN stays present in the feline microbiome. Although this is an ongoing investigation, there has been E. Coli growth in over 90% of samples, and DNA has been identified and extracted in the first 5 days of collection. Keywords for abstract: Probiotics E.

Randolph*, M. Salerno *, H. Klein, J. Winston. Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences *Authors contributed equally Abstract : Background: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the delivery of fecal material from a healthy donor into a diseased recipient to confer a health benefit. FMT is routinely delivered as a slurry via enema or nasogastri c tube, but can also be encapsulated for convenient oral administration. The microbial impacts of processing feces for encapsulation are unknown. Hypothesis/Objectives: We aimed to investigate if standardized fecal processing into a 10% glycerol FMT slu rry alters the microbial community structure. We hypothesized that microbial community structure would not vary between processing steps. Animals: Feces from four screened healthy canine fecal donors at The Ohio State University Companion Animal Fecal Bank were utilized for this study. Methods : Batches of canine feces underwent a standardized FMT processing protocol. Samples from each donor, acros s multiple batches, were pulled from specific steps during processing and underwent DNA extraction and Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicon sequence analysis was performed using MOTHUR, DADA2 and R. Results: Analysis revealed significant differences in alpha diversity (Shannon index) and beta diversity (NMDS, Jaccard index) measures between donors. Within an individual donor, no significant differences were observed between processing steps (AMOVA). Sequence analysis usin g amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) both yielded similar results. Conclusions and clinical importance: Standardized FMT processing for encapsulation does not significantly alter the microbial composition of feces fr om healthy canine donors, further promoting the practicality of oral FMT administration in canine medicine. Additional studies evaluating microbial viability are required.

Seeley , K. Proudfoot Abstract (300 word limit) Stress is unavoidable and can be an adaptive mechanism for survival. However, chronic stress has been linked to poor health outcomes and increased morbidity. The concept of allostasis describes the physiologic dysregulation that occurs when an organism is exposed to chronic stressors. Allostatic load is estimated in human populations using an allostatic load index (ALI). ALIs have tremendous potential in animal populations and may serve as a tool for evaluating chronic stress across multiple taxa. In order to understand how the concepts of allostasis and allostatic load (AL) have been used i n animal species and identify the gaps a scoping review of the literature was conducted. The aim s of this review were to 1) describe the extent to which the concepts of allostasis and allostatic load are being applied theoretically to animal populations, with a focus on which taxa and species are represented; 2) identify when direct assessments of allostasis or allostatic load are being made, which species and contexts are represented, and what biomarkers are being used; and 3) describe gaps in the literature and identify areas for future research. A total of 572 papers met inclusion criteria for the review, all taxa were represented with mammals (n=177), fish (n=143) and birds (n=134) being the most commonly studied groups. A subset of these papers (n=63) m ade direct assessments about allostatic load, however only 6 publications utilized an ALI to do so. Numerous papers made direct conclusions about AL based on a single glucocorticoid biomarker which is problematic, since it is commonly accepted that no single biomarker can serve as a pro xy for allostatic load. This review identified significant gaps in the literature and provides directions for future research.

SUMMERS, J. HORTON, H. KINSELLA, R. TORIBIO Abstract : During late pregnancy the equine placenta acquires steroidogenic functions including the synthesis of androgens and estrogens using fetal progestogens as precursors. Previous studies have shown that abnormally high concentrations of progestogens and androgens are linked to sepsis and neonatal maladjustment syndrome. Therefore, endocrine dysregulation contributes to mortality in critically ill foals. We have shown serum estrone sulfate concentrations are higher in septic compared foals (P<0.05). Estrogens (17-estradiol, estrone, tota l investigated in sick foals. We hypothesize that during hospitalization, critically ill foals will have higher estrogen concentrations that will be proportional to disease severity. In addition, foals with persistent elevation of estrogens wi ll have more severe laboratory abnormalities and increased risk of mortality. This was a prospective, multicenter, and descriptive study in hospitalized (n = 80; 50 septic, 30 sick non- septic) and healthy (n = 20) foals of < 3 days of age at 4 institutions . Blood samples were collected at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h for estrogen measurement via immunoassays (ELISA, RIA). Data were assessed for normality. Clinical information will be retrieved from the medical records (ongoing). Measurement of estrogen concentrations has been completed. Preliminary results showed that hospitalized (septic, sick non- septic) foals had higher total estrogen concentrations compared to healthy foals (P<0.01). Non-surviving foals had reduced clearance of estrone and 17-estradiol (P<0.05). Results from this study will enhance our understanding on the role of estrogens (and other sex hormones) on disease development and progression in sick foals in the immediate post-partum period.

Hostnik, H. Kinsella, H. Snyder, J. Horton, R. Toribio Abstract : Sepsis is a major cause of foal mortality and is responsible for disorders of mineral homeostasis. Vitamin D is essential for calcium and phosphorus regulation, musculoskeletal health, and immunity. However, little is known about its role in disease progression and mineral dysregulation in critically ill foals. The goal of this project was to determine the dynamics of 25- hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations over time in hospitalized versus healthy foals while associating metabolite changes with laboratory variables (e.g. calcium a nd phosphorus), disease severity and mortality. We hypothesized that during hospitalization, critically ill foals will have low 25(OH)D 3 levels, increased PTH concentrations, and that persistent hypovitaminosis D will be linked to disease severity and increased risk of mortality. Blood samples were collected from healthy, septic and sick non- septic foals of 72 hours of age (n=42) at 0 (admission), 24, 48, and 72h. Concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, PTH, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations were measured using immunoassays (ELISA) and chemistry/hematology analyzers . Data was assessed for normality and analyzed by parametric and non- parametric statistical methods. On preliminary analy sis, 25(OH)D 3 concentrations were higher in septic and SNS than healthy foals, which was unexpected . PTH analysis is ongoing (assay discontinued by the company). Septic foals had lower calcium and higher phosphorus concentrations compared to other groups. Non- surviving foals had lowe r calcium and higher phosphorus concentrations compared to survivors. Our initial findings indicate that septic foals develop hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia , which could result in endocrine imbalances. Due to conflicting results, we will be carrying ou t measurement of 25(OH)D 3 in a larger population of sick and healthy foals.

Kisseberth 1 1 Department s of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Veterinary Biosciences , Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 2 Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus Ohio Abstract : Osteosarcoma is one of the most common bone tumors in humans and dogs. Limb amputation with adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care but has limited survival benefit. Canine osteosarcoma shares many features with human osteosarcoma, making it an important comparative oncology model. We previously described a method for generating TGF -resistant NK cells, which could provide a means to overcome TGF -induced immunosuppression in osteosarcoma. We adapted this approach to expand large numbers of allogeneic (A) TGF -resistant (T) canine NK cells from healthy blood bank donors (AT -NK). To test the safety, toxicity, and preliminary evidence of efficacy of \"off -the-shelf\" AT -NK, we are conducting a phase 1 study in dogs with osteosarcoma. Dogs with osteosarcoma undergo limb amputation and four infusions of peri -operative AT -NK, followed by four cycles of carboplatin chemotherapy every three weeks with two infusions of AT-NK weekly after each dose of carboplatin. The dose escalation occurs in a 3+3 design for AT -NK (1x106/kg, 1x107/kg, and 1x108/kg) to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Monitoring during the study includes physical exam, CBC, serum chemistry profile, and restaging with thoracic radiographs. Samples of tumor and blood samples collected pre- or post -infusion are collected for correlative studies. NK cells were expanded from 7 donors, with a median of 4.9x109 NK cells generated from each canine buffy coat. Three dogs completed AT-NK infusions at dose level -1 (1x106/kg) and 2 at dose level -2 (1x107/kg), receiving a total of 54 NK cell infusions. Four out of 5 patients showed no lung metastases, 2 of these developed metastases at other sites. Other than acute infusion reacti ons that were eliminated by modifying the cryopreservation medium, AT -NK cells have been well tolerated so far in this study and no toxicity related to AT -NK was observed. This study will inform further development of \"off -the-shelf\" AT -NK therapy.

Equine metabolic syndrome is similarly characterized by insulin dysregulatio n and dyslipidemias, which could contribute to a form of NAFLD. This study investigated the effect of a high non- structural carbohydrate (NSC) diet and corticosteroid administration on liver lipid content in healthy adult ponies and horses. Mixed- breed po nies were allocated into four groups based on body condition score (BCS) (Lean; [BCS] 4, obese; BCS 7) and diet (Control; NSC ~6%, High NSC; NSC ~42%): Lean (n=6), Obese Control (n=4), Obese High NSC (n=5) and fed their respect ive diet for 7d. Liver samples were collected at the end of the feeding protocol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Liver biopsies were obtained from 14 light -breed horses before and after dexamethasone administration (0.08 mg/kg PO q24) for 7d and stained with H&E. Liver samples were evaluated by light microscopy and scored using a NAFLD scoring system adapted from humans: Steatosis (0- 3), (0- inflammation (0- 3), and steatosis location (0- 3). The Lean and Obese High NSC diet ponies had higher NAFLD scores compared to control fed obese ponies (P = 0.01, 0.04, respectively). The NAFLD scores following dexamethasone treatment were increased compared to baseline (P < 0.001). These findings suggest a high NSC diet and dexamethasone administration can induce histopathologic changes consistent with NAFLD in equids within 7 days.

Nealon, H. Klein, A. Rudinsky, M. Salerno, J. Quimby, V. Parker, J. Howard, J.A. Winston Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Abstract : Background: Fecal collection in cats is required for research and clinical purposes but fecal identification is limited by feline elimination behaviors in group- housing and multi -cat households. Crayon shavings and glitter have been used as fecal markers, but their impact on the fecal microbiome is unknown. Objective: To determine the impact of fecal identification markers, specifically crayon and glitter, on the feline microbiome. Animals : This clinical trial was performed i n six healthy and sterilized purpose- bred cats (3 male, 3 female) group -housed in a dedicated research facility. Methods: A randomized crossover experiment was performed. Cats received either glitter or crayon shavings mixed in a feline adult maintenance diet for 14 days. A 14- day washout was performed between crossovers. Feces was collected daily from each cat for 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region). Amplicon -studio (dada2; phyloseq). Pairwise PERMANOVA analysis compared samples across experimental phases and marker order. Results: Fecal identification markers were readily identified in the feces of all cats. Statistically significant changes to the microbiome were identified with marker order (P < 0.05) and across experimental phases (P < 0.05) for 5/6 cats. Microbiome changes were cat -dependent (P < 0.001), suggesting idiosyncratic microbiome responses to glitter and crayon. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Both glitter and crayon allow for identification of individua l feline fecal samples; however, these markers may impact the microbiome and therefore are not recommended in studies with microbiome endpoints. The difference in response to these markers among cats highlights the individuality of the feline microbiome.

Mordoh , R. Toribio, M. Mudge, A. Gardner Abstract : Rapid decision making in an equine acute colic episode is critical, but current diagnostics do not always lead to a clear recommendation of surgical versus medical management. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate whether there was a diagnostic and value of the inflammato ry biomarker procalcitonin versus the acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and to (2) determine whether there was a correlation between procalcitonin, SAA, and previously reported markers of colic severity. The study included 45 horses with colic admi tted to our referral hospital and 20 healthy horses. Blood was obtained via jugular venipuncture at time of arrival. Each colic was categorized according to lesion (medically managed non - inflammatory, medically managed inflammatory, surgical non- strangulat ing, and surgical strangulating), as well as according to treatment (medical vs. surgical). Data were tested for normality, and analyzed using a t -test, ANOVA, or Pearson's r where appropriate, or each test's non- parametric corollary if indicated. Results were considered significant if p<0.05. Admission heart rate was significantly different in horses with medical (non- inflammatory and inflammatory) and surgical (non- strangulating lesions) versus the healthy population. Admission respiratory rate was signi ficantly different in horses with surgical lesions (strangulating and non- strangulating) versus healthy horses. Serum amyloid A and procalcitionin were both significantly different in horses that received surgical intervention versus those medically manage d. Heart rate was weakly to moderately positively correlated with admission hematocrit, peripheral lactate, SAA, and respiratory rate. Admission hematocrit was also weakly correlated with admission respiratory rate. Procalcitonin and SAA were successful in predicting surgical versus medical management of colics within the population. Further work on other inflammatory biomarkers such as serum C -reactive protein and soluble CD14 may yield further results in this population. Furthermore, a larger sample size may be needed as several values approached but did not achieve significance (p<0.05).

Cheng , W. A. Lopez, and A. G. Arruda. Depts. of Veterinary Preventive Medicine in College of Veterinary Medicine at the Ohio State University and Technical Services Wean to Finish at Pig Improvement Company (PIC) Abstract : OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the potential relationship between weaning age/weight and post -weaning mortality in commercial wean -to-finish swine production systems. METHODS: Swine production data of 224 closeouts (4,852,489 pigs in total) were collected from 52 North American wean- to-finish (WTF) farms between December 2016 and October 2020. Average weight (kg), age (day), and the detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (yes/no) at weaning were recorded at the closeout level. Weaning weight and age were individually fitted into generalized linear mixed m odels (M -weight and M -age) along with the count of total WTF pig death (outcome), the count of starting closeout inventory (offset), the detection of PEDV and PRRSV (fixed effects), and interactions among fixed effects under Poisson distribution. Origin so w farms and WTF farm IDs were included as random effects. RESULTS: WTF mortality ranged between 4.3% and 73.4%. Weaning weight and age (median\u00b1IQR) were 6.3\u00b11.3 kg and 22.7\u00b14.1 days. Higher WTF in observed regardless of PRRSV status (16.5\u00b111.9% vs 16.2\u00b112.9%). WTF death counts increased as weaning weight (M -weight) and age (M-age) decreased. T here was a significant interaction (p < 0.001; F- test) between the PEDV detection and weaning weight/age. By decreasing one kg in weaning weight or one day in weaning age, WTF mortality in PEDV -positive closeouts increased higher level; 47.7% (M -weigh t) and 4.8% (M -age), compared PEDV - closeouts increased as weaning weight and age decreased, with higher increments i n PEDV -positive closeouts. These associations may be used as indices of the quality of piglets at weaning and help producers to predict WTF mortality.

Fernandez , V. Capria, V Bergdall. The Ohio State University Laboratory Animal Resources Abstract : Sanitation of the animal facility, including the floors, is essential for maintaining biosecurity, and meeting regulatory requirements. However, best practices for method, frequency, and evaluation techniques used to assess floor cle aning and disinfection have not been established in laboratory animal facilities. Research done in human hospital settings suggests that traditional cotton string mop and bucket systems can spread microbial contaminants across floors. Therefore, we evaluat ed two mopping systems with two different disinfectants: quaternary ammonium compound (QUAT) and cotton string mop, QUAT and microfiber mop, hydrogen peroxide- based disinfectant (HPD) and cotton string mop, and HPD and microfiber mop. Each mop and detergen t condition was used to clean two rooms housing mice twice a week for two weeks. The floors were swept then sampled before and after mopping. RODAC plates and ATP swabs were utilized to evaluate disinfection and cleaning. The time to mop each room, time for the floor to dry, and amount of detergent used was recorded. The percent change between the pre- cleaning and post -cleaning samples were compared between each group using the Kruskal Wallis test. The QUAT and cotton string mop condition had a significantl y smaller percent reduction in CFU than the other three conditions. Additionally, both QUAT conditions had significantly smaller percent reduction in ATP RLU measurements than the HPD conditions. However, during the first mopping session, only one of the c onditions had statistically significant differences: the QUAT + microfiber had a greater CFU reduction compared to the HPD + cotton string . A cost estimate was performed, and the microfiber cleaning process is estimated to be more cost effective due to tim e saved in personnel hours. The results of this study can be used to select floor sanitation practices in laboratory animal facilities.

Fischer, J. Pempek, K. George, J. Flint, T. Wittum, and M. Flint . Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine and Department of Animal Sciences, College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences Abstract : Aquatic ecosystems are currently facing a multitude of stressors from anthropogenic impacts, including climate change, p ollution, and overfishing. Public aquariums positively contribute to ecosystems through conservation, education, and scientific advancement, but may also negatively detract through wild collection and sourcing from commercial suppliers. Although changes in industry have occurred, evidence- based assessments of how aquariums maintain their populations to determine sustainability are still needed. The objective of this study is to develop and implement a One Welfare- based ecosystem model to assess impacts of h arvesting of fishes for public aquariums. Indicators will be selected, nested into physical -chemical, biological, and socio- economic categories, compared to reference parameters, assigned weightings, and included in the model for an overall assessment of ecosystem health of each area. This will be accomplished through 1) assessment of ecosystem health of wild collection sites using physical -chemical, biological, and socio- economic indicators; 2) evaluation of welfare of species at aquariums through semi -annual assessments and behavioral observations; and 3) comparison of ecosystem health of harvesting sites vs. assessments of an aquaculture facility. Data collection is being completed in three parts: 1) holistic assessments of harvesing sites including water and sediment chemistries, population surveying and health assessments of sentinel species, and inclusion of socio- economic impacts of selected aquariums; 2) objective measurements of animal welfare and behavior using scan sampling at aquariums; and 3) ide ntical ecosystem health and welfare assessments at an aquaculture supplier to be compared to wild collection. Strong partnerships with two aquariums and an aquaculture facility have previously been established. Preliminary results show low parasitic loads at wild collection sites and the aquaculture facility (37% and 0.05%) . Diversity indexes at aquarium sites ranged from 0.28- 1.83 demonstrating potentially stressed aquatic environments. Through this study, we hope to influence use of the developed One Welfare and aquaculture frameworks at additonal aquariums in the future.

Golconda , H. Yu, D. Xue, A. Baek, G. Lee, M. Oglesbee, S. Faith and S. Kim. Dept s. of Veterinary Biosciences and Microbiology Abstract : SARS -CoV-2 shed in the feces of infected individuals has launched wastewater surveillance as a tool to track viral prevalence and evolution. However, challenges include the scarcity of viral RNA and potential mix of SARS -CoV-2 variants. An ideal tool shoul d accurately and sensitively determine variants at the single RNA molecule level and detect unique combinations of variant -specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Reverse- transcription (RT) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can only provide information on a single signature mutation site. Current short -read SARS- CoV-2 genome sequencing methods, such as the widely used Artic method, also have several technical limitations: (i) the short -read target -specific amplicons of about 400 bases; (ii) the limited read accuracy with Oxford Nanopore sequencing; and (iii) the limited detection sensitivity with random -primer RT and target - specific cDNA amplification. To address these, we are developing a new high- fidelity (HiFi) long -read Nanopore sequencing method to sequence and quantify SARS -CoV-2 variants within wastewater. We use specific RT primers targeting signature SNV sites and a new hairpin ligation method for cDNA PCR. This approach allowed 97% detection of cDNA regardless of length and generated SARS -CoV-2 amplicons up to 6 kb. For HiFi long- read sequencing, we employed rolling circle amplification (RCA) that creates long DNA containing multiple copies of the target. Following Nanopore sequencing, raw subreads within a single RCA read generate consensus sequences with Q30 level (99.9%) accuracy. By developing a new analytic pipeline for SARS -CoV-2 variant calling based on both the global GISAID database for SARS -CoV-2 genome sequences and OSU Infectious Disease Institute's local variant sequences , we could identify circulating variants among wastewater of local communities which were consistent with variants found in patient samples collected from similar areas and times. This study demonstrat es a new wastewater pathogen surveillance tool for on- site, high- accuracy detection of viral strains for SARS- CoV-2 and, potentially , other targeted respiratory viruses.

Locke and G. Habing Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine Abstract : Environmental persistence of microbes can be facilitated by biofilm formation. In Gram -negative pathogens, increased biofilm density has been correlated with decreased biocide efficacy. Although Salmonella biofilms have received attention in food processin g facilities, little is known regarding the biofilm forming capabilities of a somewhat distinct population of Salmonellae responsible for illnesses in livestock and humans. Indeed, routine cleaning and disinfection protocols applied in preharvest environments often fail to eradicate Salmonella biofilms. Disrupting the environmental survival of Salmonella via biofilm removal, particularly for virulent strains with abundant biofilm growth, will be critical to reduce carriage in livestock reservoirs and the ri sk of foodborne illness in humans. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the biofilm forming abilities of Salmonellae relevant to livestock and human health. Seventy -six isolates from 8 serovars ( S. 4,[5],12:i: -, Agona, Dublin, Enterid itis, Heidelberg, Montevideo, Newport, Typhimurium) recovered from poultry and clinically ill cattle, swine, and equine were utilized. We hypothesized that biofilm density varies between serovar and increases from 48 to 168 hrs. Isolates were grown in 24- well microplates in tryptone soy broth at ambient temperature. Biofilm density was quantified at each timepoint using crystal violet assays. At 48 hrs., 35.5% (27/76) of isolates were categorized as strong, 42.1% considered strong biofilm formers and 17.1% (13/76) were considered moderate. Most weak biofilm formers were S. Dublin or Montevideo (15/16). Regardless of serovar, median biofilm density was greater at 168 hrs. relative to 48 hrs. (p < 0.005). Results suggest inconsistent (i.e., weekly) cleaning may allow for establishment of mature biofilms in on- farm environments. This study provides baseline data necessary to develop evidence- based cleaning and disinfection protocols effective against the most prolific biofilm forming strains of virulent Salmonella.

Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA 2. Biostatistics Division, College of Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. 3. Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA Abstract : In the United States, diverse lineages of influenza A virus (IAV) are introduced into exhibition swine populations where frequent movement of pigs within networks of shows and fairs facilita tes the dissemination and interspecies transmission of IAV. The reduction of zoonotic IAV risk in the US necessitates mitigation of IAV in exhibition swine. Because IAV is likely to be introduced into county fairs via infected, asymptomatic pigs, it is cri tical to reduce IAV transmission within swine populations at individual fairs. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of shortening swine exhibitions to 72- hours or less to reduce zoonotic IAV risk; a measure offered by the Swine Exhibitions Zoonotic Influenza Working Group. We longitudinally sampled every pig daily for the full duration of 16 county fair events during 2014 and 2015 for a total 39,768 nasal wipes from 6,768 individual pigs. Additionally, we estimated IAV prevalence at 195 county fair events during 2018 and 2019 to test the hypothesis that fairs which shortened their swine exhibition to 72-hours or less would have lower IAV prevalence in their swine by the end of the fair. In both longitudinal and cross -sectional studies, we found that shorter duration of swine shows drastically reduces IAV prevalence in exhibition swine at county fairs. Reduction of viral load in the barn within a county fair is critical to reduce the risk of interspecies IAV transmission and ultimately pandemic potenti al. We find substantial evidence to support the recommendation of limiting swine shows to 72 hours as a measure to reduce zoonotic IAV.

V. V. Pereira, G. G. Habing Abstract : Antimicrobials are critical to preserve animal health and improve animal welfare. However, their use and abuse represent a public health threat for increasing antimicrobial resistance. Veterinarians prescribed antimicrobials, but farmworkers are responsible for making treatment decisions. Therefore, quantification of antimicrobial usage (AMU) is vital to promote on- farm responsible use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of farmworker antimic robial stewardship (AMS) training through the quantification of on- farm AMU. We designed a quasi -experimental study with nine conventional dairy farms enrolled in Ohio and Indiana. Six farms received AMS training (training group) and three farms did not (c ontrol group). Farmworkers from the training group were invited to participate in a 12- week training program focused on accurate identification of sick cows requiring antimicrobials. We quantified on- farm AMU using the inventory of empty drug containers be fore, during and after the implementation of the educational training. We located plastic bins per farm at places considered appropriate to collect empty drug containers. Treatment incidence using animal daily -doses (ADD) was calculated based on the active drug ingredient, the on- label recommended dose, and 600 kg of standard- weight per adult cow. Across all farms, a total of 405.7 defined doses (ADD/1000 cow - days) was obtained before, during, and after the intervention. Each farm uses a mean of 15.0 ADD/10 00 cow-days with a range of 1.7 to 71.6 ADD/1000 cow -days. A decreased of ADD mean was exhibited for all trained farms from 13.9 pre- intervention to 12.2 ADD/1000 cow -days post -intervention. On the contrary, two of three controls showed an increase in the ADD mean from 7.44 pre- intervention to 9.82 ADD/1000 cow -days post-intervention. Results suggested that AMU among enrolled farms varied significantly and stewardship training influenced AMU on trained farms. Future research on stewardship intervention shou ld include social science approaches to consider ways to overcome barriers and stimulate responsible AMU.

Shields, R. Pesapane. Dept. of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, T. Roth. San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control District, and M. Miller. Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center, California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Abstract : Marine mammals are hosts for several parasitic nasal mites (Halarachnidae) which impair bronchitis, lutris ) and negatively impact survival post -release. Despite disinfection in marine mammal care facilities, infestation is associated with captivity, suggesting that current husbandry practices are inadequate. The risk of environmental transmission and disinfectant efficacy is unknown. To examine whether environment al transmission represents viable risks, and the ability of disinfectants to control mites, this study will analyze mite survival under various environments and disinfectants. Live mites will be exposed to common disinfectants as well as microcosms that mi mic the temperature and salinity of enclosures. Mites will be stimulated at regular intervals to evaluate survival and mortality rate survivorship curves will be created. The results will determine whether mites can persist environmentally, potentially infesting na\u00efve animals, as well as the efficacy of disinfectants. Future mite- specific protocols can then be developed to improve animal welfare at marine mammal institutions. Additionally, characterization of mite- host associations has been complicated by repeated revisions to halarachnid mite taxonomy and reclassification of misidentified specimens. Species identification currently requires multiple keys, knowledge of revisions to species classification through time, and training in acarology, which is impr actical for marine mammal clinicians. A simple pictorial key to species of halarachnids based on published keys was generated to aid in future identification of mite species.

Souza, M. Markzs, J. Flint Abstract : Human -wildlife conflicts have become a daily occurrence in urban areas. Some of these conflicts are linked to high rate of mortality in vulnerable wildlife species. An analysis of the Ohio Wildlife Center's (OWC) admittance data shows an overwhelming number of wildlife presenting to the rehabilitation center with injuries or as orphaned infants due directly to an interaction with a domestic animal, cats and dogs. I reviewed 30,029 representing seventy -six different species admitted to the hospital over a four year period (2016- 2020). I identified that domestic animal interactions make up 18% of total wildlife deaths brought to OWC. This conclusion supports the need for further investigation of domestic animal interactions with wildlife to understand and address the need to protect vulnerable wildlife species from domestic animal injurie s. This information will aid veterinarians in the effort to both directly protect domestic animals from zoonotic diseases and indirectly protect wildlife populations from increasing rates of mortality due to inappropriate predation.

Of Prev entive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, College of Public Health, and Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; College of Public Health, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA Abstract : Nowadays, more and more people rely on nonparental care while they're working outside the home. However, children in daycare centers are more likely to get enteric diseases than those who are in home care. Children's unhygienic habits, such as mouthing and touching objects and other people, facilitate the spread of infectious agents. The objective of this study is to quantify enteric disease transmission risks in infants using video data and apply this observation method to the animal population for disease s transmitted through the same route in the future. 18 infants from 8 different rooms at 3 daycare centers were selected to participate. Diarrheal illnesses of infants were reported from parents, facility records, and pathogen detection from fecal samples. However, only 13 infants from 6 rooms were documented on the videos. The caretakers from other two rooms refuse to be filmed on the camera. 3 to 4 on- site cameras were placed in each room to provide structured observations. One- minute videos from the same room with different views were then complied into a ten- minute video for enumerators to view at once. A specialized software, LiveTrack, was used to translate the video into a digital record. After thorough observation of infants' behavior and facility in frastructure, categories of locations, object mouthed, object touched, human interaction and diapering were customized to annotate the videos. Specific protocols were established to reduce inter -observer errors. Annotation testing was used to train enumerators to decrease intra-observer variation, and the output data was then evaluated using Krippendorff's Alpha to measure inter -observer reliability.

Arruda1 1 Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210 2 Department of Animal Sciences, College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210 Abstract : Swine populations are susceptible to infectious diseases, and urgent responses including large- scale depopulation may be required to control and prevent farm -to-farm transmission during foreign animal disease outbreaks. Several swine depopulation methods suggested by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) are debatable in their efficiency. In this study, water -based foam (WBF), an AVMA- approved method in poultry, was adapted to swine. Two trials (1 and 2) were conducted for a stepwise evaluation on the use of WBF in swine. Trial 1 assessed time to unconsciousness by submerg ing 72 feeder pigs (6 pigs each replicate for 12 replicates) in WBF for 6 time periods (2.5- 15min (MPF) in 2.5min intervals ). Unconsciousness le vels were assessed, and regular gasping and corneal reflex were observed, respectively, in 3 and 12 pigs at 2.5 MPF. Consciousness signs compatible with recoverability were absent at 5 MPF . In Trial 2, cull sows (3 replicates of 25 sows) were loaded into an adapted rendering dump trailer (40x8.5\u00d76 feet) and submerg ed in WBF for 5 MPF . Acti vity bio - loggers were implanted in 6 sows per replicate to measure movements. In Trial 2, the mean durations between end of trailer WBF fill and last animal movement (min:sec) as per bio- loggers were 2:03 and 1:45 (SD=0:47) for replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All sows were deemed unconscious after unloading from the trailer . Based on our studies, WBF could be an effective method for emergency depopulation in swine. Given our assessment of time to unconsciousness in feeder pigs and the field validation in sows, we recommend that 7.5 minutes of submersion should be used to ensure unconsciousness and subsequent death.

Kenney1 1Center for Food Animal Health, Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University, Wooster Abstract : Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of hepatitis E, is an important zoonotic human pathogen. Avian HEV is an important pathogen within the poultry industry and, although it does not infect humans, is used to model human disease. Lack of an efficient cell culture system complicates study of avian HEV. Quasispecies of human HEV can possess natural insertions of ribosomal protein (RP) S17 that bestows growth advantage and expands their host tropism in vitro. RPS17 is part of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is involved in eIF -2 binding. The objective of the study was to construct an avian HEV with the RPS17 insertion to further characterize its replication and pathogenesis. Avian HEV with the RPS17 insertion in the hypervariable region of the non- structur al protein was constructed. Capped RNA transcripts of RPS17 were replication - competent after transfection of LMH chicken liver cells. Chickens inoculated intrahepatically with RNA transcripts of avian HEV RPS17 developed active infection as evidenced by fe cal virus shedding and viremia. To characterize the pathogenicity, inoculum (104 GE/0.5 ml) was prepared from bile, liver homogenate, ileal and cecal contents and given orally to birds. Cloacal swabs and body weights were collected every 3 days. Blood was collected every 7 days. Several birds were necropsied every 8 th day until day 40; bile was collected, and organ mass index of liver and spleen were determined. Birds were examined for gross and microscopic liver lesions. RNA was extracted from cloacal swabs, serum, liver, spleen, pancreas, jejunum, bile samples and quantified by RT -qPCR. In conclusion, RPS17 insertion into avian HEV was not only replication competent but enhanced its replication ability in chicken liver cells as well as in SPF chickens when compared to wild type virus by increased capsid protein detected by flow cytometry, indirect immunofluorescence assay and genomes quantified via RT q-PCR.

Vincent , J. Flint, A. Bowman, M. Flint, De pt of Veterinary Preventive Medicine Abstract : Multiple areas of Lake Erie are regularly dredged to maintain navigation channel depths needed for safe commercial and recreational boating. Dredged material is dumped into in- water or upland \"confined disposal facilities\" (CDFs), which can include the creation of dredge spoil islands. Although islands created using dredged materials can provide valuable habitats for wildlife, there remain concerns about the release of industrial contaminants a nd other pollutants from this material that could have long- term health implications in wildlife species. Our project uses a One Health approach to evaluate the impacts of dredge islands on ecosystem health in southwestern Lake Erie at two sites: a preserv ed coastal wetland and a CDF. Fish species will be captured to assess biodiversity, parasite burden, immune function, and overall health of fish populations. During a pilot study in November 2021, 2572 fish representing 13 species were captured in a single night. Gizzard shad ( Dorosoma cepedianum ) were No external parasites were noted on skin, fin, or gill cytology. Painted turtles ( Chrysemys picta ) will be captured at each site for physical exams and morphometric data. Turtles will be tested for infectious diseases (Chlamydia, herpesvirus, Ranavirus/FV3- like virus, Mycoplasma, and adenovi rus). Blood from painted turtles will be used for estimated white blood cell counts, differentials, lactate levels, and plasma protein electrophoresis testing. In addition, samples from mammal species including Ondatra zibethicus will be collected. Serum, lung tissue, and mucosal swabs from mammals will be analyzed for SARS -CoV-2 PCR and sequencing. Mammals will also be tested for Chlamydia with conjunctival and nasal/oral sw abs. Data will be analyzed and used to assess differences in overall ecosystem health between these two sites.

Infection with FECV is mostly asymptomatic and transient, but it can mutate into FIP virus (FIPV) causing non- specific, and ultimately fatal c linical signs. Diagnostic testing for FIP is often ambiguous and usually presumptive, with most available tests unable to distinguish between the two different pathotypes (FECV vs. FIPV). A definitive diagnosis is usually made by biopsy and examination of tissue post -mortem. The aim of this study is to develop and optimize a flow cytometric assay for the detection of FIPV within feline macrophages. Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf) cells are grown in standard media. Cells are infected with FIPV, along with sham- infected controls. Then, cells are harvested, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti -vimentin and anti -feline coronavirus antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. Preliminary results show that flow cytometry detects stained FIPV within fcwf cells, and eventually, we expect this within fluid macrophages from feline patients suspected of having FIP. We anticipate that our flow cytometry - based assay for FIP will be more diagnostically reliable (higher specificity) than currently available assays. A definitive antemortem diagnosis is crucial to veterinarians and clients when it comes to making treatment or euthanasia decisions surrounding FIP. The next steps for this study include testing fluid samples from suspected FIP patients in a clinical diagnosti c trial.

The S protein trimer is anchored in the virion membrane in its prefusion (preS) but metastable form . The preS protein was previously stabilized by strategically introducing two or six proline substitutions, to generate stabilized, soluble 2P or HexaPro (6P) preS proteins. HexaPro has been shown to be more stable than 2P, but it is not known which form i s the most immunogenic. Here, we generated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus -2P, preS full -length S, and their immunogenicity in mice and hamsters. rVSV rVSV- preS -2P. Immunization of mice and hamsters with a single dose of each recombinant virus was sufficient to induce high levels of SARS - CoV-2 preS -specific and B.1.617.2 variants 4 times than those induced by preS -2P. Furthermore, preS -HexaPro induced a more robust Th1- biased cellular immune response than preS -2P. A single, low dose (104 PFU) -preS -HexaPro and rVSV -preS - challenge with mouse- adapted SARS- CoV-2 and B.1.617.2 delta variant, wher eas rVSV- S only conferred partial protection. When the immunization dose was lowered to 103 PFU, rVSV- preS -HexaPro induced substantial protection whereas rVSV -preS - 2P was not protective. Collectively, our data demonstrate that of the three proteins tested, preS - HexaPro induces the most effective immune response, highlighting the advantages of using preS -HexaPro in the next generation of SARS -CoV-2 vaccines.

Chien , M. Lin, Y. Rikihisa. Department of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is an emerging, tick -borne febrile illness life- threatening infections. Ehrlichia chaffeensis monocytes and macrophages. The in vivo pathogenesis of severe or fatal HME is not completely understood. Our laboratory developed a fatal HME mouse model by culture isolating Ehrlichia japonica , a bacterium closely related to E. chaffeensis , which causes severe diseases and death in immunocompetent mice due to cytokine storm and toxic shock- like syndrome. By using Himar1 transposon random mutagenesis system, we recently identified two novel virulence factors of E. japonica (EHF_0962 and EHF_RS04100) in the mutants H59 a nd H43B, respectively. Although these virulence factors dispensable in vitro for infecting macrophage (DH82), endothelial (RF/6A), (ISE6) cell lines, the and H43B mutants cannot rapidly replicate and spread systemically to kill immunocompe tent mice. My hypothesis is that the mutants lost ability to overcome in vivo innate immune response such as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generated by phagocytes . To investigate the virulence loss of the mutants, we will establish a time -coursed infection in the mouse model and design specific experiments for testing host innate immune responses . Furthermore, we will generate rescue plasmids to restore the virulence gene in the mutants for the complementation assays. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical knowledge of treating and preventing severe HME.

School of Environment and Natural Resources, College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio Abstract : Currently no livestock -specific tick studies in Ohio are pu blished in the literature, despite recurring outbreaks of bovine anaplasmosis in the state and the presence of five tick species of veterinary concern. The presence of bovine anaplasmosis in the United States is attributed to an obligate intra- erythrocytic rickettsial bacteria, Anaplasma marginale , which can be transmitted in three ways, including: mechanically via biting insects or blood- contaminated instruments (i.e fomites), biologically via ticks, and vertically from mother to calf. Bovine anaplasmosis manifests in cattle as reduced milk production, fever, weight loss, abortion, and many times, death. While there are numerous genotypes of A. marginale present in the U.S, it is not currently known which genotypes are circulating in Ohio. In addition to th is, Ohio is facing invasion by an exotic tick which targets livestock \u2014the Asian longhorned tick ( orientalis which can cause bovine theileriosis. The aim of this investigation is to determine if the ticks which infect Ohio livestock carry the pathogens Anaplasma marginale or Theileria orientalis , and to begin to characterize the species and genotypes of the pathogens present in cattle herds.

Evans , C. Zeng, C. Carlin, J.S. Bednash, Gumina, and S.L. Liu Depts. Of Veterinary Biosciences, Internal Medicine, Pathology, Animal Sciences, Veterinary Preventive Medicine, and Microbial Infection and Immunity Abstract : SARS -CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic which has resulted in nearly 400 million cases and over 5 million deaths. Unprecedented efforts from the scientific community led to the development of two mRNA vaccines, among others, that have helped to control the worst impacts of the pandemic. However, the durability of protection for these vaccines and how they compare to immunity from natural infection, remain critical concerns. Additionally, the emergence of SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) which exhibit resistance to v accine -induced neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), continue to threaten the efficacy of the mRNA vaccines. To address these concerns we developed a highly sensitive pseudotyped lentivirus -base virus neutralization assay to COVID -19 patien ts and mRNA vaccine recipients. With this we demonstrate that mRNA vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) reliably exhibit strong nAb response. However, the VOCs exhibit varying degrees of nAb escape with the Omicron variant exhibiting near complete escape from 2 -dose mRNA vaccine -induced nAbs, and 2 - dose induced nAbs wane substantially 6 months after vaccination against all VOCs. Following booster vaccination 83.3% of HCWs exhibited detectable nAb titers against Omicron, indicating a need for booster vaccine administration for strong protection from Omicron. Additional examination of sera from Delta and Omicron COVID -19 patients demonstrated strong resistance of Omicron to Delta patient sera but sensitivity to Omicron patient sera. Omicron variant sub- lineag es were also examined to discern any differences in sensitivity to mRNA -vaccine - or Omicron -infection- induced nAbs. Overall, our results serve to inform the administration of booster doses and any need for a reformulation of mRNA vaccines.

Xu, S.L. Liu Abstract : In April of 2020, a variant of SARS -CoV-2 resulting from a mink to human transmission emerged on a mink farm in the Netherlands, marking the first known animal to human transmission event since the start of the COVID -19 pandemic. This mink cluster five var iant (MC5V) carries five mutations in the spike protein including the ancestral D614G mutation, the characteristic mink -adapted receptor binding domain (RBD) mutation Y453F, deletion of H69- V70 in the N-terminal domain (NTD), I692V in S2, and M1229I in the transmembrane domain. MC5V has been reported to have reduced pathogenicity in humans compared to the ancestral Wuhan strain, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we conduct a mutational analysis of ancestral and MC5V spike proteins to characteriz e the impacts of these key residues. We identify the I692V mutation, which is located immediately after the furin cleavage site in the MC5V spike protein, as the key determinant of the low infectivity of MC5V. Specifically, we observed that the introduction of V692 reduces D614G spike furin processing, reduces fusion, and diminishes pseudotyped lentivirus infectivity. Critically, we confirm that introducing the I692 reversion partially restored MC5V spike processing and fusogenicity , and increased pseudotyped virus infectivity to levels comparable with D614G. Structural modeling of the SARS -CoV-2 spike containing I692V, which is located immediately after the furin cleavage site in the spike protein, revealed that the mutation disrupt s local hydrophobic interactions, likely affecting the conformation of the cleavage site and/or overall spike trimer stability. Therefore, results of this study suggest a critical role for the I692V mutation for impacting furin cleavage site accessibility, emphasizing the importance of non- RBD spike mutations in modulating viral infectivity, transmission, and -CoV-2. -CoV-2 IMMUNE PREDICTORS OF ENHANCED CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK IN COVID- 19 INDIVIDUALS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio state university, 2 Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, 3 The Ohio State University, College of Medicine, 4 Northern Kentucky University, 5 Marker Therapeutics Inc., Houston, TX, United States, Abstract : COVID -19, a disease produced by the SARS -CoV-2 virus, has triggered a global p ublic health crisis. SARS -CoV-2 infected patients show a wide range of clinical symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe sequelae and death. People of any age with a history of serious past chronic health problems are more vulnerable to COVID -19, possibly due to a weakened immune system. Such comorbidities include heart and brain problems, kidney impairment, cancer, immunological disorders, obesity and diabetes. The relationship between COVID -19 and diabetes (DM) is complicated and bidirectional. Studies have shown an increased risk of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) in COVID -19 patients with preexisting diabetes. However,the exact mechanism of increased cardiovascular risk in pre -DM, severe COVID -19 patients still unknown. Thus, in this study, we investigated possib le immunological markers that predict cardiovascular risk in pre -DM compared to non -DM severe COVID -19 patients. We used fresh whole blood to carry out high dimensional flowcytomtery and plasma biomarker assays.Multi variant analysis was conducted on Pre-T2DM (n=10) and non- DM (n=7) severe COVID -19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit at OSU medical center. We investigated known cardiovascular immune biomarkers and potential new biomarkers that predict increased risk of CVD. Parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Kruskal -Wallis) statistical tests, as well as Dunn's and Tukey's post hoc tests, were used to evaluate multiple group comparisons. We found, significantly higher Neutrophils, Intermediate monocytes and activated NKT-like cells in pre T2DM s evere COVID -19 patients. Contrary, NKG2A+CD56DimCD16+ NK cells and activated T cells were significantly lower in the pre -T2DM group. In the severe COVID -19 T2DM patients, we identified higher levels of LBP (Lipopolysaccharide binding protein), FABP4 (Fatty acid-binding protein 4) and sCD14 compared to non -diabetic patients. These data suggest that a dysregulated immune response can exacerbate the viral immune response and CVD risk in pre- DM severe - COVID -19 patients.

Authors : M.R. Joldrichsen , E. Kim, H. Steiner, E. Cormet -Boyaka, P.N. Boyaka. Department of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : Paneth cells are a subset of small intestinal epithelial cells specialized in the production of antimicrobial products and cytokines. Gastrointestinal dysbiosis has been linked to many health concerns and is believed to be a contributing factor in obesity. Despite the role of Paneth cells as a major source of antimicrobial products, the contribution of these cells to health or disease conditions has not been fully explored. We examine the impact loss of Paneth cells would have on the gut microbiota and whet her the subsequent dysbiosis could affect metabolic functions of the host and fat accumulation in a mouse model of diet induced obesity. For this purpose, were used wild- type and Sox9 IEC mice, which lack Paneth cells due to a Sox9 gene deletion within the intestinal epithelium. Compared to control wild- type mice, the small intestine of Sox9IEC exhibited altered profile of ILCs characterized by increase ILC2 and decrease ILC3 numbers. After exposure to a high- fat diet for 13 weeks, the Sox9IEC mice gained more weight and had higher glucose intolerance. The intestinal homeostasis was also affected, with an increase in intestinal permeability and an increase in ILC1s within the small intestine of Sox9 IEC mice. In the abdominal fat Sox9IEC mice showed incre ased numbers of immune cells including inflammatory macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Finally, fecal material transplantation experiments revealed that fecal material from the Sox9IEC mice transfer the phenotype in recipient germ -free mice as indicated by a trend towards an increase in weight gain and immune cell infiltration of abdominal fat. These results highlight the importance of Paneth cells as regulators of metabolic functions of the host and fat accumulation.

Kang , O. Harder, and S. Niewiesk . Dep ts. Of Veterinary Bioscience Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infection. We wished to investigate whether RSV infection induces inflammatory proteins as e.g., infection with SARS- COV -2. The inflammatory proteins tested include C reactive protein (CRP), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1), and prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2). We investigated in the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus ) which inflammatory protein correlated with RSV infection. CRP is often used as a marker of inflammation during bacterial infection but is typically not highly elevated d uring viral infection. During RSV infection in adult cotton rats, the level of CRP slightly increased during virus replication. The inflammatory protein HMGB1 triggers TLR4 signaling, which induces COX - 2 and subsequently PGD 2 expression. Increased PGD 2 production can negatively affect the migration of dendritic cells and the activation of T cells during viral infection. Our results demonstrated that the level of HMGB1 increased during viral growth, peaked during viral clearance, and remained stable for 4 days after complete clearance of virus. For PGD 2, there was an initially peak on day 1 after infection, then a secondary, larger peak during viral clearance. Therefore, in adult cotton rats, CRP may be used as a control for inflammatory protein during infect ion. In contrast, the increased expression of both HMGB1 and PGD 2 and their role in the pathogenesis of RSV infection need to be investigated further.

Patil1, R. Gourapura1, SP. Kenney1 1Center for Food Animal Health, Department of Veterinary Preventative Medicine, Department of Animal Sciences, The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH. Abstract : The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), a novel Betacoronavirus, has resulted in extensive social and economic impacts worldwide. Preclinical studies in suitable animal models are used to study infection mechanisms and in the development of therapeutics against this rapidly mutating virus . Intranasal nanoparticle vaccines have been shown to induce long- lasting mucosal and systemic immune responses . Thus, an intranasal delivered SARS -CoV-2 vaccine will be a noninvasive and promising prophylactic candidate against circulating and emerging viral mutants . Here, we report the effectiveness of a candidate SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in ferrets ( Mustela male ferrets (n=6 per group) were inoculated intranasally twice in a 3- week interval with lipid nanoparticle entrapped receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS- CoV-2 along with a n adjuvant monosodium urate crystal (MSU), and then challenged intranasally with SARS -CoV-2 (1 x106 TCID 50/ml). The control groups were vaccinated with adjuvant or empty liposomes, respectively. Ferrets were sampled at several timepoints throughout the study to examine changes in viral RNA, infectious viral titers, and immune gene expression in the respiratory tract. Three animals in each group were euthanized for necropsy at 7- and 14- days post challenge . We found infectious live virus levels significantly reduced in the lungs, trachea, nasal turbinate, nasal cavity, and oro -pharynx of vaccinated ferrets. Further more , RNA viral load was markedly reduced in bronchioalveolar lavage and lung and tracheal tissues of the vaccinates. Immune gene expression profil ing in lungs and nasal turbinate of the vaccinates revealed elevated levels of key cytokines and chemokines such as IFN, IL-17, granzyme A, and MCP1 compared to mock and vaccine controls. These promising results necessitate ongoing development of this intranasal vaccine candidate and provide support for its potential application in humans.

Lee, A. Baek, S. Golconda, C . Kimmel, D . Xue, and S. Kim. Depts. Of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : Viruses utilize epitranscriptomic regulation as a survival strategy to enhance viral replication and evade host innate immune responses. Here, we introduce a novel concept of viral epitranscriptomics that addresses epitranscriptomic diversity and its dynamic changes as a viral survival strategy. Our group has adopted long- read direct RNA sequencing and bioinformatic tools to analyze the viral epitranscriptomic landscape of full -length HIV -1 RNA and we identified three dominant N6 -methyladenosi ne (m6A) modifications in the HIV -1 genome. Point -mutations targeting each of the three dominant m6A significantly reduced corresponding methylation signals, but total viral production and infection rates remained similar to those of wild- type viruses. Fro m single virus level analysis, we found several subgroups of viruses with unique m6A modification patterns. When any of the dominant m6A was removed by mutation, the composition of these subgroups significantly changed, suggesting the expansion of more res ilient subgroups. In order to further evaluate the compensatory effects and accurately quantify the subgroups, we trained a machine learning model that determines m6A on a per -read, per -position basis . Combined machine learning and clustering analysis show ed that the new compensatory subgroups increased by 1.3- 3.3 fold, compared to the wild- type, while the other subgroups without such compensatory effects decreased by 0.34- 0.75 fold. Interestingly, a combination of mutations that remove d all three major m6A significantly reduced total viral RNA production, and showed only modest expansions of the compensatory subgroups, indicating the crucial importance of these dominant m6A and the limitation of compensatory behaviors when all three are missing . Taken together, HIV -1 RNA modification generates various epitranscriptomically distinctive subgroups even among genetically identical viruses, and dynamic changes in the subgroup composition can compensate for major RNA modification deficienc ies. This study will provide insights into the viral epitranscriptomic diversity of HIV -1 populations and its dynamics that maximize viral adaptability and survival in diverse host environments.

Li, D. Diaz -Vergara, and S. Evans. Depts of Biosciences and Veterinary Clinical Sciences. Abstract : Bacterial sepsis is a life -threatening condition with a high case - fatality rate in which rapid diagnosis is critical for survival. The current primary diagnostic tools for identifying septic cavity effusions are bacterial culture, which has slow turnaround time, and fluid cytology, which suffers from low sensitivity. Fountain FlowTM Cytometry (FFC) is a recently developed, compact tool designed to enumerate microbes at very low concentrations in municipal and commercial fluids. A preliminary FFC diagnostic trial conducted by our laboratory on cavity fluids from 60 septic mammalian patients demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 94.4%, respectively. The RapidBacTM Vet (RBV) test is an immunoassay designed for point -of-care detection of bacteria in small animal urine. Both FFC and the RBV test are inexpensive, quick (requiring less than 20 minutes), and relatively simplistic to perform. The aim of this study was to both optimize the use of FFC and to assess the capabilities of the RBV test, for d etection of septic effusions. Sterile cavity effusions from mammalian patients were spiked with known quantities of bacteria and then analyzed by FFC. Significant losses of bacteria were observed (32.4% -97.7%) and determined to be due to sample preparation methods. This finding potentially accounts for the previously observed low sensitivity. A case control study (n=18) of the RBV test using 1- 2 day - old, refrigerated mammalian cavity effusions yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 50%, respectiv ely, indicating false positives may be problematic for RBV use to detect septic effusions, and that a more controlled study involving fresh samples is warranted. FFC offers multiple advantages over currently used methods of septic effusion detection and th us warrants further testing.

Linn1,2, L. Schwartz2, J.D. Spencer2,3 1. The Ohio State University, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Columbus, OH, USA 2. Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Kidney and Urinary Tract Center at The Abigail Wexner Research Institute, Columbus, OH, USA 3. The Ohio State University, Department of Pediatrics, Columbus, OH, USA Abstract : Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common across species. Intercalated cells (ICs), positioned in the kidney collecting duct, combat UTIs by secreting antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) into the urine to kill bacteria. The mechanisms regulating IC AMP production during UTI are unclear. Here, we challenged ICs in vitro with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) or bacterial cell membrane components to define the innate immune responses that control AMP production during UTI. Methods: ICs were infected with U PEC or challenged with UPEC cell membrane components including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and -D-Glu-mDAP (iE -DAP). Following stimulation, IC lysates were collected, and immune genes were profiled using an antimicrobial response PCR array or targeted qRT -PCR. Western blot was performed to confirm which immune pathways were activated. Results: In response to UPEC, ICs temporally activate immunomodulatory pathways and AMPs. Analysis of PCR array data via STRING and Ingenuity Pathway A nalysis identified 15 upregulated genes associated with Toll- like receptor (TLR), NOD -like receptor (NLR), and NF- kB signaling 4 hours post infection. Immunoblotting confirmed downstream targets in these pathways are activated in response to UPEC. qRT -PCR identified that AMPs like Lcn2 are activated while others are suppressed. Upon stimulation with MDP and LPS, qRT- PCR showed upregulation of multiple AMPs - suggesting that NOD2 and TLR4 activation, respectively, may regulate expression. Following stimulati on MDP, ICs demonstrate activation of NF -kB and MAPK signaling pathways via immunoblot, correlating to increased AMP expression which is inhibited using drug antagonists. iE -DAP did not affect AMP expression. Conclusion: During UPEC infection, TLR, NLR, a nd NF- kB responses are activated in ICs. Activation of TLR and NLR signaling may induce downstream targets like AMPs. Confirmation studies are needed to determine how these pathways regulate AMP expression and identify potential regulatory nodes which coul d serve as future targets to increase AMP production as an additional means to treat UTIs.

Dept. of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that causes the emerging tick -borne disease, human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), a severe, influenza- like illness. The only treatment for HME is the broad- spectrum antibiotic Doxycycline, and there is no vaccine av ailable. Ehrlichia spp. lack conventional pathogen- associated molecular patterns, but surface proteins and virulence factors have been identified and their roles in transmission and disease have been studied. Entry -triggering protein of Ehrlichia (EtpE) is an invasin required for bacterial entry into human cells; the C-terminal (EtpE -C) binds DNase -X to induce -mediated Outer membrane proteins OMP -1B and P28 are immunodominant major surface proteins and porins expressed by bacteria in t icks and mammals, respectively. Ehrlichia spp. possess Type IV secretion system (T4SS) and VirB2 proteins function as major pilus subunits, thus playing an important role in binding of the host cell membrane and secretion of T4SS effectors into the host cell cytoplasm. The objective of this study is to determine the vaccine potential of four Ehrlichia surface proteins in the mouse model of acute fatal HME, using Ehrlichia sp. HF (EHF). The genes encoding each protein were cloned from the EHF genome into a protein expression vector, followed by expression and purification of the recombinant proteins. Five groups of immunocompetent mice were immunized with (ISCOM) adjuvant, or sham - immunized with ISCOM alone and will be challenged with EHF in tick cells and infected ticks. At euthanasia, blood, spleen, and liver will be collected for analysis of bacterial load and cytokine expression levels via qPCR and RT -qPCR, respectively. The immu ne cell population in spleen will be analyzed by flow cytometry. This project will lead to a more thorough understanding of the pathogenicity and immunological response in fatal ehrlichiosis patients and on the potential of these antigens for vaccination s trategies.

Miller1, O. Harder2, S. Niewiesk1 1Department of Veterinary Biosciences 2Comprehensive Cancer Center Abstract : Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of respiratory illness worldwide, and poses a serious health risk for the elderly. Among adults >65 years of age, RSV clearance is delayed, contributing to more severe clinical present ation and increased mortality. In the cotton rat model, RSV clearance is similarly delayed in geriatric animals. The delay in clearance is eliminated in geriatric cotton rats treated with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen, indicating that age- associated inflammation (inflammaging) contributes to delayed RSV clearance. In this study, we further characterized this inflammatory pathway. Prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), a product of the arachidonic acid cascade requiring COX activity, was elevated in airways of geriatric cotton rats infected with RSV compared to adults. Administration of PGD 2 to adults induced delayed RSV clearance kinetics similar to that seen in geriatric animals. Induction of low level inflammation through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a lso delayed viral clearance in adults. These results provide further evidence that inflammaging is an important and reversible contributor to the prolonged course of RSV - associated disease in the elderly, and indicate that PGD 2 is a key mediator in this pa thway. Experimentally, LPS and PGD 2 administration to adult cotton rats offers a model for inducing an inflammaging phenotype for further characterization of the inflammatory cascade leading to delayed RSV clearance.

Qu , C. Zeng, Y. Zheng, S. Liu. Depts. Of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : Interferon -induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit a number of viruses, including human coronaviruses SARS -CoV-1 and MERS -CoV, particularly at the step of entry. Interestingly, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have been shown to enhance human coronavirus OC43 (HC oV-OC43) infection by unknown mechanisms, and the effect of IFITMs on SARS -CoV-2 infection has been controversial. Here, we provide evidence that the effect of IFITM proteins on SARS -CoV-2 is cell- type as well as IFITM - ortholog dependent. IFITM2 and IFITM3 promote entry of SARS - 2 into 293T/ACE2 and H1299 cells; however, IFITM1 potently inhibits it. In Calu -3 cells, however, all three IFITM proteins are inhibitory against SARS -CoV-2 similar to SARS -CoV-1. Critically, we find that the differential effect s of IFITMs on SARS -CoV-2 is associated with ACE2 receptor expression in different cell types. In particular, overexpression of IFITM3 upregulates the expression level of ACE2 on the cell surface, likely by reducing its internalization, resulting in enhanc ed viral binding and spike- mediated membrane fusion. Consistent with this notion, deletion of the N -terminal 21 amino acids of IFITM3, which re- localizes the protein from predominantly endolysosomes to the plasma membrane, strongly increases its enhancing effect on SARS -CoV-2 entry. Protein pulldown assay shows that IFITM3 protein are complexed with the SARS -CoV-2 spike, suggesting a possible interaction that is stabilized by ACE2. Altogether, our study revealed some unique mechanisms of IFITM proteins in promoting SARS - CoV-2 entry, especially by engaging with the virus spike protein and ACE2 receptor on the plasma membrane.

Abstract : HIV-1 does not persistently infect macaques due to restriction by several type- I interferon host SIV host -factors and HIV -1 Envelope glycoprotein (Env), are used to infect macaques to model HIV -1 infection. A major limitation of the SHIV/macaque model is that SHIVs generated in vitro replicate poorly in macaques. A small subset of SHIVs has been successfully adapted for high- level repli cation through serial passage in macaques. We have previously identified that serial macaque -passage selects for IFN -resistant SHIV variants replication in macaque lymphocytes. The viral determinant(s) contributing to increased replication and IFN resistance in macaque- passaged SHIVs have not been examined. To identify the viral determinant(s) of macaque- passaged SHIVs that confer resistance to IFN , we generated SHIV infectious molecular clones (IMCs) encoding the parental env and represent ative env clones from sequential macaque- unpassaged, parental SHIV IMC is potently inhibited by IFN (mean IC 50 range 27.9 - 49.9 U/ml), whereas the SHIV IMCs encoding macaque- passaged (mean IC >5000 U/ml). In that SHIV IMCs encoding macaque- passaged envs have high replication capacity and most, but not all, have more virion Env content. Next, we took a gain- of-function approach and generated chimeras that introduce portions of env gene from this approach, we mapped the determinants of IFN resistance and high replication capacity to two N-linked glycosylation sites in the gp120 subunit of HIV -1 Env. In conclusion, the adaptive changes in HIV -1 env resulting from serial macaque- passage of SHIVs are sufficient to increase resistance to IFN, replication capacity, and virion Env content. Thus, the host IFN response serves as a strong selective pressure during the process of adaption of SHIV to macaques.

Haile, R. Woodfint , E. Kim, M. R Joldrichsen, N. Berhe, W. A Gebreyes, P. Boyaka Abstract : Antibiotics are extensively used worldwide for the treatment of common infections by agents such as E. coli and Salmonella. They also represent the most common cause of alteration of the microbiota in people. We addressed whether broad- spectrum and Gram -negative- targeting antibiotics differentially regulate systemic and mucosal immune responses to vaccines. Antibiotics treatment enhances serum IgG1 responses in mice immunized systemically with a model polyvalent vaccine. This increase was not seen for other IgG subclasses and was dependent on the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens. The broad- spectrum antibiotic cocktail also enhanced serum IgA responses. Interestingly, both the broad spectrum and the antibiotic targeting Gram -negative bact eria enhanced the number of IgA antibody secreting cells in the intestinal lamina propria. This effect was unlikely to be due to an increase in cells expressing gut -homing receptors (i.e., CCR9 and 47) in peripheral tissues. On the other hand, the microb iome in mice treated with antibiotics was characterized by an overall reduction of the number of firmicutes. Furthermore, Bacteroidetes were increased by either treatment, and Proteobacteria were increased by the broad- spectrum antibiotics cocktail. Thus, immunoglobulin isotype and subclass responses are differentially regulated by oral antibiotics treatment and the gut microbiota shapes mucosal antibody responses after systemic immunization.

With the rapid increase in SARS -CoV-2 cases in children, a safe and effective vaccine for this population is urgently needed. The MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccine has been one of the safest and most effective human vaccines used in infants and children since the 1960s. Here, we developed live attenuated recombinant mumps virus (rMuV)- based SARS -CoV-2 vaccine candidates using the MuV Jeryl Lynn (JL2) vaccine backbone. The soluble -6P) MuV genome at the P -M or F-SH gene junctions in the MuV genome. preS efficiently expressed than and preS -6P expression from the P -M gene junction was more efficient than from the F -SH gene junction. In mice, the rMuV -preS -6P antibodies and in rMuV -preS -6P vaccine neutralized SARS -CoV-2 variants of concerns, including the delta variant equivalently. IFNAR1- /- mice and golden Syrian hamsters immunized with the rMuV -preS -6P vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies, mucosal IgA antibody, and T cell immune responses, and were completely protected from challenge by both SARS -CoV-2 USA -WA1/2020 and delta var iants. Therefore, rMuV -preS -6P is a highly promising vaccine candidate, warranting further development as a COVID -19 vaccine for infants and children.

Rikihisa1 1 Department of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : Ehrlichia spp. are emerging obligatory intracellular bacteria transmitted by particular species of ticks, and can cause subclinical or sometimes fatal diseases called ehrlichiosis in various species of mammals including humans . Our lab recently obtained an Ehrlichia sp. mutant that has the gene encoding a tandem repeat protein (TRP) disrupted as a result of Himar 1 transposon insertion. The Ehrlichia TRP is an abundantly produced type I secretion system effector that has been proposed to have multiple functio ns for ehrlichial infections in mammalian cells , but the exact role of the TRP in vivo remains to be determined. Our studies found that the TRP mutant is as virulent as wild- type (WT) Ehrlichia in mice with respect to clinical signs and infection of major organs , but has a significantly lower bacterial load in the bloods at 7 days post -infection. As ticks acquire Ehrlichia exclusively by blood feeding on infected mammals, we tested whether na\u00efve ticks allowed to feed on mice infected with the TRP mutant and WT could acquire Ehrlichia . Our studies showed that ticks cannot acquire the TRP mutant as effectively as WT. We also found the TRP mutant infects and proliferates in tick cell culture as effectively as WT. Thus, this result suggests that the TRP is a tic k transmission factor of Ehrlichia . Elucidating microbial factors that are required for transmission between ticks and mammals will help develop new therapeutic interventions and preventative measures by breaking the transmission cycle of the tick-borne di seases .

Even the state- of-the-art tools provide only partial and fragmented information lacking both precise modified nucleotide positions and virus -to-virus variations in epitranscriptomic landscape. Unlike other sequencing platforms, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), a new 3rd generation sequencing, enables extremely long- read sequencing and direct detection o f DNA/RNA modifications by sequencing native DNA/RNA molecules. This study demonstrates the first full -length 9kb mapping of HIV - 1 RNA modifications at both the nucleotide resolution and single RNA molecule level using ONT. Our optimized Nanopore direct RN A sequencing of near -full-length HIV -1 revealed unexpectedly simple modification patterns, presenting only a few dominant and site- specific modifications near the 3'end of the genome. Of 27 most prominent sites, 15 overlapped with m6A DRACH motifs. These potential m6A sites were evaluated and confirmed by (i) a treatment with m6A erasers (fat mass and obesity -associated protein and AlkB homolog 5), (ii) modeling with synthesized m6A oligo controls and (iii) LC -MS/MS. Point mutagenesis targeting three most d ominant m6A sites individually abolished corresponding methylation signals, but interestingly these single mutations did not make any notable impact on viral RNA production, packaging or infection. A combination of mutations that remove all the three domin ant m6A sites was needed to render a notable inhibition of viral packaging and infection, suggesting essential but compensatory roles of those dominant modifications on maintaining viral activity. This study thus establishes an innovative assay to study HI V-1 RNA modifications and reveal novel insights into the biology of epigenetic modification in HIV -1 pathogenesis.

Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine and OSUCCCC. Abstract : Thyroid cancer is the most common form of endocrine cancer worldwide, and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common subtype of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of all thyroid cancer diagnoses. Up to 83% of aggressive PTCs have BRAFV600E driver mutations that contribute to uncontrollable cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through MAPK signaling. We have identified a previously unknown signaling pathway in which BRAFV600E binds with and activates group I p- 21 activated kinases (PAKs). This pathway independently also enhances cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal motility, and apoptosis in vitro. To study the in vivo role of PAK activity in BRAFV600E -induced thyroid cancer, we fir st treated mice with thyroid- specific BRAFV600E overexpression with a PAK inhibitor (G5555) and showed that it reduces tumor growth and prevents cancer development. The current project builds on that work using mice with individual temporal control of thyr oidal BRAFV600E overexpression and a molecular inhibitor of group I PAKs (PID) that is highly specific for the thyroid. We tested both prevention and treatment of BRAFV600- inducible PTC using this model. In preliminary data, we demonstrated that PID activa tion can not only prevent and reverse BRAFV600E- mediated thyroid cancer, it also blocked dedifferentiation in the prevention model and reversed dedifferentiation in the treatment model. In addition, using a single copy knock- in model of BRAFV600E that clos ely mimics human PTC, co -expression of PID with BRAFV600E also blocked PTC formation. These data suggest that PAK inhibitors may be an exciting new treatment option for BRAFV600E -derived thyroid cancer as both an anti -neoplastic and/or redifferentiating therapy.

Niewiesk, P. Green, and A. Panfil. Dept. of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : Background: HTLV -1 is the infectious cause of adult T -cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), an extremely aggressive and chemotherapy -resistant malignancy of CD4+ T -cells. Many current therapies improve ATL patient survival, but the patients consistently relapse. Therefore, a need exists to identify novel targets relevant to the pathophysiology of ATL and innovative approaches to hit these targets. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a type II PRMT enzyme that has been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of mult iple different lymphomas. Recently, our group found that PRMT5 in HTLV -1-transformed cell lines, during HTLV -1-mediated immortalization, and in ATL patient samples. Here, we hypothesized that PRMT5 over -expression is relevant to HTLV -1-drive n T-cell transformation and a commercially available inhibitor of PRMT5 activity (EPZ015666) would provide a novel approach to treating HTLV -1 malignancies. Methods: A variety of HTLV derived cell lines, and HTLV -1-negative T -cell lines were treated with EPZ015666 for 12 days. Cellular viability and apoptosis were measured by trypan blue exclusion and flow cytometry, respectively. Freshly isolated PBMCs were co- cultivated with lethally irradiated producer cells in the presence of titrating amounts of EPZ015666. Cellular viability and immortalization were measured over the course of 12 weeks. NOG mice transplanted with HTLV -1-transformed cells were treated with EPZ015666 and tumor burden, IL- 2R , and survival were measured over the course of 4 weeks. Results: Inhibition of PRMT5 with EPZ015666 resulted in 1) a dose- dependent selective toxicity in HTLV -1-infected cell lines compared to HTLV -1-negative cells, 2) of HTLV -1-mediated T -cell transformation in vitro , abstract: HTLV -1 PRMT5 Transformation EPZ015666 MCB - INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE MECHANISM OF ASIC of Veterinary Medicine 2Department of Neuroscience, College of Medicine Abstract : Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are voltage -insensitive cation channels that open in response to acidic extracellular pH. Physiologically, they are important for normal behavior including learning/memory and fear -conditioning. Pathologically, they contri bute to neuronal death following cerebral ischemia and inflammation: two conditions where the extracellular pH in the brain becomes acidic for long periods of time. ASIC -dependent neuronal death has traditionally been attributed to excess calcium influx fr om prolonged channel activation. However, it has recently been proposed that this ASIC -dependent acidotoxicity is initiated by conformation changes in ASICs which alter protein- protein interactions within the intracellular domain of the channels and activa te programmed cell death through necroptosis. Recently, we discovered that activation of certain G protein coupled receptors prevents ASIC -mediated cell death without affecting ASIC ion conduction and calcium influx. We hypothesize that activation of these G-protein coupled receptors interferes with the signaling cascades that link ASIC's conformation changes to cell death. The goal of my project is to determine how ASIC -mediated necroptosis differs from classic necroptotic pathways and how activation of specific G -protein coupled receptors interfere with these cellular signaling pathways to prevent acidotoxicity. To this end, I am identifying the ASIC -induced necroptotic signaling pathway in neuronal -like cell lines, primary neurons and isolated brain slic es. Using Western blots, we have found that the levels of the necroptosis inducer RIPK1 are profoundly affected by acid exposure in cell lines and primary neurons. Further, the levels of RIPK1 in the brain are not uniform and sensitive to tissue manipulati on. These results suggest that ASIC -mediated necroptosis involves a specific RIPK1 -dependent pathway. Further work will elucidate the other partners in the ASIC -necroptosis signaling cascades and the impact of GPCR activation on sensitivity to acidotoxicit y.

Smith, J. Seth, C. Phelps, S. Niewiesk, Y. Satou, P.L. Green, and A.R. Panfil Abstract : Human T -cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV -1) is the causative infectious agent of adult T -cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and chronic neurological disease. The disparity between silenced sense transcription versus constitutively active antisense (Hbz) transcription from the integrated provirus is not fully understood. The presence of an internal viral enhancer has recently been discovered in the Tax gene near the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) of HTLV -1. In vitro, this enhancer has been s hown to bind host transcription factors, maintain chromatin openness and viral gene transcription, and induce aberrant host gene transcription near viral integration sites. However, the function of the viral enhancer in the context of early HTLV -1 infectio n events remains unknown. In this study, we generated a mutant Enhancer virus (mEnhancer) and evaluated the effects of the internal viral enhancer on HTLV -1- mediated in vitro immortalization, establishment of persistent infection in an in vivo rabbit model , and disease development in a humanized immune system (HIS) mouse model. The wild- type (wt) and mEnhancer viruses demonstrated similar capabilities in 5' LTR transactivation, virus production, and immortalization efficiency in vitro. Over a 25-week study, the mEnhancer virus was able to establish persistent infection in rabbits, and there were no significant differences in proviral load or HTLV -1-specific antibody responses in animals infected with the mutant compared to wtHTLV -1. HIS mice infected with wt or mEnhancer virus also showed similar disease progression. These results suggest that alone, the viral enhancer mutant has no defect in immortalization, establishment of infection, or disease development. Further studies should be performed to discern wh ether the viral enhancer cooperates with other transcriptional regulatory elements to induce viral gene expression and contribute to HTLV -1 persistence and pathogenesis.

Depts. of Veterinary Biosciences, Center for Retrovirus Research, and Comprehensive Cancer Center and Solove Research Institute Abstract : Human T -cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV -1) infects an estimated 5-10 million people worldwide and ~5- 10% of infected people develop clinical disease (T -cell leukemia or neurodegenerative disease) after a prolonged clinical latency period of several decades. However, progression of disease is not well understood, and patient prognosis is poor with limited treatment options available. The viral protein Hbz was initially identified as an antagonist to the viral oncoprotein and transcriptional activator, Tax. Based on subsequent studies, Hbz is also thought to play a role in infected cell maintenance and oncogenesis. This viral gene is often the only viral transcript expressed in patient cells and its precise role in cell survival remains poorly understood. Our lab recently identified that Hbz interacts with the cellular protein YBX1 via mass spectrometry. YBX1 is a transcription factor involved in growth- associated gene expression. Thus, we hypothesized that the Hbz/YBX1 interaction may play a key role in oncog enesis. Our studies have found that YBX1 activates viral transcription, and we find a synergistic positive effect on transcription with both Tax and YBX1. Hbz is able to repress Tax -mediated viral transcription, and exogenous YBX1 alleviates this repression. Using affinity pulldowns, we found YBX1 interacts with the central basic region of Hbz. Interestingly, we also found that cellular distribution of YBX1 is both cytoplasmic and nuclear, suggesting possible roles for YBX1 outside of HTLV -1 transcriptional regulation. Our work will help to further define the mechanism of action of Hbz and the proteins it interacts with during HTLV - 1 pathogenesis. These studies are critical for defining potential targets in future gene editing therapeutic approaches.

Dept. of Veterinary Biosciences Abstract : The majority of breast cancer (BC) mortalities can be attributed to metastasis to distant organs. The overall survival for BCs is about 90% but decreases to less than 30% in cases of metastasis to distant organs. In triple negative BCs (TNBCs), an aggressive subtype of B Cs, metastasis to the lung results in poorest clinical outcomes, with overall 5- year survival of about 10%. Genetically, TNBCs lack the classical hormone receptors - estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) - and human epidermal growth factor r eceptor 2 (HER2) expression but over express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Further, downstream EGFR targets Ras/extracellular signal -regulated kinase (Ras/ERK) proteins are highly activated. However, targeted therapies against EGFR and Ras/ERK a re largely ineffective in TNBCs. The largest contributor to acquired resistance in TNBCs is the developing early metastatic niche. Development of the metastatic niche is a crucial step in cancer cell metastasis, aiding cells in the colonization of secondar y tissues. However, how the metastatic niche affects cancer cell signaling is not well understood. Cellular signaling fluctuations result in temporal variability in gene expression and consequently affect cell fate, proliferation and survival. Using time- resolved live single cell imaging we show that the lung micro environment suppresses signaling in TNBCs. We identify EGFR as the primary driver of this suppression resulting in a decrease of single cell signaling variability ultimately leading to the ineffi cacy of EGFR therapies.

A major barrier to developing safe, effective treatments is that GBM mous e models are poor predictors of drug responses in humans. The NCI -led Comparative Brain Tumor Consortium is a multi- instiutional effort aimed at validating naturally occurring glioma in pet dogs as a n improved animal model for human GBM . While this team has made many advances in updating diagnostic criteria and ge netic characterization of canine glioma, there rem ains a scarcity of high grade canine glioma cell lines to use for in vitro studies . The goal of this project was to establish novel canine glioma cell lines to better represent the distinct types of glioma (oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma) through methods that avoid the use of fetal bovine serum and transformation in vitro , which are known to contribu te to gene expression changes and the acquisition of genetic aberrations. Through a multi -institutional col laboration, w e acquired two fresh and ten frozen samples of high grade canine glioma. Cells were implanted subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice then monitored for growth visually (SQ) or with microMRI imaging (IC). Upon identification of successful cell growth in mice, cells were harvested and mouse cells were depleted with magnetic cell sorting. Two lines were established , which exhibit a varied morphology, similar to human GBM lines cultured and established with similar methods . Both lines are sensitive to radiation and an experimental mitotic inhibitor, C38. Future work will focus on engrafting more samples and further characterizing the established lines with whole exome sequencing and array comparative hybridiz ation to to identify driver mutations, aneuploidies, duplications and deletions.

Scott1, M. Bernier2, C. 1Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine 2Ohio State University Campus Chemical Instrument Center 3Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine 4Ohio State University College of Nursing Abstract : Bladder cancer is the sixth most common form of cancer in the United States. Naturally occurring urothelial carcinoma (UC) in dogs closely mimics characteristics of human bladder cancer. The microbiome has been linked to tumor development and response to treatment in some cancer types; however, it is unknown what role microbes may be playing in UC development and progression in humans or in dogs. Urine from 11 dogs with and 11 dogs without bladder cancer underwent untargeted metabolomics followed by pathway analyses. We also identified differentially abundant metabolites between the groups. Overall, we observed global differences in metabolite profiles including specific pathways related to aromatic compound degradation. Aromatic compounds include petroleum distillates such as toluene, benzene, and xylene, and secondary metabolites linked to toluene metabolism include hippuric acid and o- cresol, which were both increased in the urine of dogs with cancer. These differences indicate differing metabolism in dogs with and without cancer. However, continued investigation is necessary to elucidate the role of host and microbes in metabolizing aromatic compounds and determining what role this metabolism may play in UC.

Abstract : Ibrutinib is widely used for patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma; however, the majority of patients ultimately develop resistance and face poor overall survival. There is an urgent need for novel therapies targeting pro- survival signalin g pathways triggered by ibrutinib resistance. Inhibition of Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5i) represents a novel approach to ibrutinib resistant MCL (IR -MCL). Genomic deletions -MCL and sensitizes cells to further inhibition of PRMT5. Although the published literature defines this therapeutic rationale for targeting PRMT5 in cancers with deletion of MTAP, the literature lacks studies specifically targeting PRMT5 in this context. Comparing MCL cell lines with primary ibrutinib resistance, we found an inverse correlation between PRMT5i and ibrutinib. In MCL cell lines, low expression of MTAP also correlated with lower global Symmetric Di -Methyl Arginine and enhanced sensitivity to PRMT5i. Genomic deletion of MTAP enhanced sensitivity to PRMT5i, whereas MTAP knock -in decreased sensitivity to PRMT5i. The treatment with MTA, further confirmed that genomic deletion of MTAP confers enhanced vulnerability to PRMT5i in MCL cell lines. In a mouse m odel from an MCL patient with IR -MCL, treatment with PRMT5i decreased tumor infiltration of multiple organs compared to ibrutinib or control. To mechanistically address the nature of the anti - tumor activity, we treated mice and subjected tumor cells to transcriptomic profiling by RNA -sequencing. We identified 1014- down and 1124- up differentially expressed genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified activation of the p53 pathway, with repression of E2F targets, and cell cycle checkpoints. In MCL, PRMT5i r esulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by transcriptional activation of TP53 target genes. Western blot analysis confirmed accumulation of DNA damage and apoptotic markers that are further enhanced with combination of doxorubicin. We are currently exploring novel combinations to maximize the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 inhibition in this disease.

Of Veterinary Biosciences and Cancer Biology & Genetics. Abstract : Human T -cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV -1) is an oncogenic retrovirus and both adult progressive chronic neurodegenerative. HTLV -1-associated malignancies occur after a prolonged clinical latency period of up to several decades, and very few successful treatment options exist. Unlike other oncogenic retroviruses, HTLV -1 does not encode host -derived oncogenes or lead to insertional cis -activation of a cellular oncogene. Instead, the virus encodes t wo genes that are essential for transformation and proliferation, Tax and Hbz. Tax is essential for de novo infection and cellular immortalization while Hbz promotes proliferation and survival of infected cells. Additionally, HTLV -1 uniquely persists in infected hosts through mitotic host cell division, and the viral genome is highly conserved. Given this conservation, genomic editing has strong promise. C lustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome editing of retroviral proviruses has been limited to HIV -1. We propose HTLV -1 as an excellent model to advance this technology. Our team constructed a library of 163 gRNAs covering the Tax, HBZ, and viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) coding regions. These gRNAs were sub- cloned int o a CRISPR lentiviral vector which expressed the Cas9 gene and a puromycin resistance gene. VSV T -cell lines. Following puromycin selection, the cellular proliferation rate was analy zed by MTS assay. Our preliminary results show 67 gRNAs significantly reduced cellular proliferation. Ongoing studies involve 1) investigation of off -target editing by gRNAs using an integrase- defective lentiviral vector and 2) measurement of viral transcr ipt levels. The top five gRNA candidates per viral gene/LTR will be selected for NSG sequencing and used in our in vivo transplantation NOG mouse model. Our experiments will determine the effectiveness of CRISPR genome editing for disabling HTLV -1 and further inform genome editing strategies - 12 Title of abstract: NRP2 SIGNALING IN MALIGNANT PERIPHERAL NERVE SHEATH TUMORS Authors : Tyler, K.A ., Shive, H.R. Abstract : Background: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft tissue sarcomas that have a notoriously poor response to conventional chemotherapy/radiation. Signaling pathways that contribute to MPNST pathogenesis are not yet fully defined. Neuropilins are cel l surface receptors that function as co- receptors for various transmembrane receptors and interact with many ligands. One such ligand is semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F), which is an extracellular signaling protein that plays a role in many pathways of growth and development, including tumorigenesis. Objective: Our objective was to determine how NRP2 and SEMA3F modify MPNST phenotypes. Using human MPNST cell lines, we investigated the role for the neuropilin receptor NPR2 in MPNST growth, migration, and invasion. Methods: MPNST cells underwent a co- culture migration assay with 293TN cells expressing SEMA3F. MPNST cells with NRP2 knockdown were analyzed for rate of cell growth by serial Cyquant assays, migration by transwell migration, and proliferation caspase 3/7 assay. Results: Migration of MPNST presence of SEMA3F. Cyquant assays revealed NRP2 knockdown cell lines have a lower rate of growth compared to controls. NRP2 knockdown cells lines also exhibited increased apopt osis compared to control lines. Conclusions: Our data suggest that NRP2 knockdown cell lines do not exhibit signs of growth and proliferation compared to controls, suggesting that NRP2 is necessary for development of MPNSTs in vitro. Our data also show th at MPNST migrated at increased rates in the presence of SEMA3F, suggesting that the relationship between NRP2 and Sema3F is important to MPNST behavior.

Walker , H. Powell. University Laboratory Animal Resources; Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Materials Science Abstract : Traumatic injuries, neoplasia, and osteolysis can result in large segmental bone defects that present particular clinical challenges. Autogenous bone grafts, allografts, and synthetic bone implants have been used to manage large defects; due to poor incorporation with the patient's bone, however, complications such as nonunion, malunion, and infection are common. The current project harnesses the osteogenic properties of periosteum to investigate its potential for segmental defect healing when used in conjunction with bioengineered nanofiber scaffolds. The periosteum provides vasculature, cytokines, proteins, and mesenchymal stem cells that are central to new bone formation. Biomimetic scaffolds act as a foundation on which periosteal cells can migrate to incorporate with host tissue. This investigation specifically aims to demonstrate isolation strategies that will provide an ample source of periosteal - derived cells (PDCs) from translational large animal models. Tissue from human femoral, porcine tibial, and ovine tibial specimens was minced, cultured, and quantified using both migration assay and enzymatic digestion with coll agenase. A central objective of cell isolation is to demonstrate that nanofiber scaffolds can promote expansion of periosteal cells. Bovine- extracted collagen nanofiber scaffolds were created in either an aligned or random orientation. Half of the scaffold s were doped with hydroxyapatite (HA). Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine the orientation (random v. aligned) and architecture (collagen v. HA - doped collagen) that resulted in maximum cellularity. Pilot results support the hypothesis that p eriosteal cell migration is successfully promoted on biomimetic scaffolds. In vitro optimization of this project will inform future trials in murine and large animal models with the ultimate goal of clinical implementation of the bioengineered construct in human patients.

My hypothesis is a putative T4SS effector APH0874 has a significant role in Aph infection of human cells . Aph mutant expressing FLAG -tagged APH0874 C -termin us (FLA G-APH0874C) Immunofluorescence assay shows that FLAG - APH0874C is produced by Aph mutant and secreted into the host cytoplasm and localize s to the Aph inclusion membrane . APH0874 C was cloned and expressed, and the recombinant protein was purified to immunize the rabbit for antibody pr oduction. By immunofluorescence assay with rabbit anti-APH0874C serum, native APH 0874 is also secreted and into or Aph-infected RF/6A cells, APH 0874 and APH 0874C1 localize to the Golgi apparatus in un- infected cells and to Aph inclusions in Aph-infected cells , suggesting a part of Golgi membrane is recruited to Aph inclusions by APH0874C1.

Makkawi and A. Davies Abstract : The lung is a common metastasis site for various cancers, such as sarcomas and breast cancer. During metastasis, disseminated cancer cells are able to adapt to the signaling cues in the lung microenvironment, resulting in changes in their signaling pathway s and their responsiveness to chemotherapeutics. Of particular interest is the PI3K/AKT pathway, which regulates cell growth and proliferation. It is dysregulated in a variety of human cancers, making it a potential target for therapy. AKT signaling is highly sensitive to Insulin -like growth factor (IGF) and its cognate receptor, IGFR. One of the key regulators of IGF signaling are IGF - binding proteins (IGFBP), a family of proteins that interact with IGF and both positively and negatively modulate its funct ion. Although the IGF - IGFBP signaling has been implicated in several cancers, how IGFBP production by cancer cells and cells of the microenvironment influence cancer cell signaling is yet to be studied in fine detail. We hypothesize that AKT signaling is r egulated by the IGF -IGFBP axis in a manner that favors persistent activation of pro- oncogenic AKT signaling in cancer cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, our preliminary data show that changes in IGF levels, or drug treatments, initially suppress AKT s ignaling but is followed by restoration of AKT signaling in cancer cells to basal levels over time. These changes correlate with altered IGFBP expression profiles in both cancer cells, and cells of the lung microenvironment, suggesting an adaptive regulato ry mechanism to compensate for low AKT signaling. Our future work aims to understand the regulation of cancer cell signaling more fully through IGF and IGFBPs in the metastatic microenvironment and develop strategies to suppress it.

L. Burroughs , G. Lorch, Y. Guo, K. Hill, E.L. Schroeder, L.K. Cole, and M.A. Phelps. Departments of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology Abstract : Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA) acts as an immunosuppressive agent. During biotransformation of MMF to MPA phenol glucoside (MPG) are for med. The objective of this study was to define the non- compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of three single doses of intravenous (IV) MMF and its downstream metabolites in healthy horses. Our hypothesis was that plasma concentrations of MPA, MPAG, AcMPAG, and MPG would increase with each incremental IV drug dose. Six healthy Standardbred mares were included. Generic M MF (Par Pharmaceuticals, Chestnut Ridge, NY, USA) was reconstituted and administered as a single IV -bolus at 1.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg and 10.0 mg/kg with an eight - day washout between treatments. Blood samples were collected immediately prior to MMF admi nistrat ion and over 24 hours . A liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry assay was developed following FDA guidance to determine plasma MMF, MPA, MPAG, AcMPAG, and MPG concentrations. Each horse was analyzed independently, followed by calculation of geometr ic mean and coefficient of variation. Non- compartmental PK parameters were determined for MMF and all metabolites at all doses. MMF was rapidly biotransformed to MPA within 30 minutes . At the 10.0 mg/kg dose, MPA, MPAG, AcMPAG AUC inf_obs were highest at the 10.0 mg/kg dose. Within the 10- fold dose range, the increase in C max and AUC inf_obs for MMF and its metabolites was horses biotransform MMF into MPA, MPAG, AcMPAG, MPG and glucosidation clearance pathways. Equine reference PK profiles for MPA and the metabolites MPAG, AcMPAG, and MPG were established. LYMPHOID B -CELL FOLLICLES PROTECT THEIR RESIDENT T CELLS FROM ANTIBODY -BASED T -CELL -TARGETING AGENTS Authors : S. Kim*, R. Shukla, S. Cressman, A. Kim, A. Tracey, N. Liyanage and S. Kim Depts. Of Veterinary Biosciences and Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH Abstract (300 word limit) Antibody and immunotoxin -mediated therapeutic T -cell depletion have become increasingly useful in T cell lymphoma, HIV/AIDS, allograft rejection, and transplant medicine. Despite the tremendous hope generated by these new agents, their treatment outcomes have often been limited and inconsistent for unclear reasons. Here, we demonstrate that B -cell follicles in secondary lymphoid organs protect their resident T cells (CXCR5+ T cells) against anti -CD3e toxin) -mediated T - cell killing in various organs. We found that both anti -CD3e mAb and CD3e -IT are effective and specific in depleting T cells in vivo . Remarkably, however, we found that CD3e -IT was ineffic ient at killing a subset of -cell populations express CXCR5, including follicular T -helper cells ( TFH), are an important therapeutic target in HIV/AIDS and T -cell lymphoma therapy. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that CD3e- IT efficiently deplete d T cells in the T cell zone outside the B follicles, whereas T cells within the follicles were enriched. When CXCR5(+) and CXCR5( -) T-cell killing efficiency was compared in vitro , there was no notable difference between these two cell types, indicating t hat CXCR5+ T cells are not intrinsically resistant to CD3e -IT. Our short -term in vivo - where CD3e- IT was retro -orbitally injected 8 minutes prior to euthanasia - also showed that, in spleen, CD3e- IT binds to CXCR5( -) T cells with a s ignificantly better efficiency than to CXCR5(+) T cells. Lastly, using CD4/iDTR transgenic mice that expressed Diphtheria toxin receptors on T cells, we compared in vivo T- cell depletion by three different protein reagents, including Diphtheria toxin, CD3e mAb and CD3e- IT, and the results showed that B -follicles protect their resident CXCR5+ T cells from all these protein agents. Our findings, therefore, suggest a potentially a new treatment resistance mechanism mediated by the normal lymphoid B-cell follic les against T -cell depletion protein agents.

Wittorff, R. Jennings Abstract : Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a group of mesenchymal neoplasms with the potential for metastasis and recurrence. The current method for determining excision status of soft tissue sarcomas is histological assessment of radial sections. However, recent research argues tangential, or en face, sectioning provides a complete margin evaluation and therefore, is a more sensitive method in some tumors. A more sensitive margin assessment may better inform prognosis. The goal of this study was to compare standard radial sectioning to t angential sectioning in a retrospective study of 21 canine soft tissue sarcomas. F or this study, cases of canine STS were evaluated by radial and tangential sectioning. The total percent \"dirty\" surface areas from tangential margins were measured and calculated using image analysis. The measured histologic tumor - free margins (HTFM) of t he radial sections were compared against the \"gold standard\" tangential results using statistical analysis and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Out of a total of 14 negative radial margins, 8 (57.1%) were positive on tangential margin analy sis. Histopathologic evaluation of radial sectioning had a low sensitivity (46.7%; 7/15) when compared to tangential sectioning when positive margins were defined as HTFM = 0 mm. Radial margin analysis reached 100% sensitivity when positive margins include d HTFMs 4 mm. The mean HTFM of negative tangential margins (n=6) was 6.79 \u00b1 4.58 mm while the mean HTFM of positive tangential margins (n=15) was 0.367 \u00b1 1.03 mm. These results suggest that radial sections with HTFMs > 0 mm should not always be considere d completely excised. F or canine STS with HTFM s between 0 mm and 4 mm, tangential margin analysis would be the more sensitive method. Future studies should use methods to increase the accuracy of image analysis and should consider case follow- up to determi ne the prognostic significance of positive margins detected by tangential sectioning.
