If You fail to seek Our Preauthorization for benefits subject to this section, We will pay an amount of $500 less than We would otherwise have paid for the care, or We will pay only 50% of the amount We would otherwise have paid for the care, whichever results in a greater benefit for You. You must pay the remaining cost for services. We will pay the amount specified above only if We determine the care was Medically Necessary even though You did not seek Our Preauthorization. If We determine that the services were not Medically Necessary, You will be responsible for paying the entire charge f or the service. I. Medical Management. The benefits available to You under this Certificate are subject to pre -service, concurrent and retrospective reviews to determine when services should be covered by Us. The purpose of these reviews is to promote the delivery of cost -effective medical care by reviewing the use of procedures and, where appropriate, the setting or place the services are performed. Covered Services must be Medically Necessary for benefits to be provided. J. Medical Necessity. We Cover benefits described in this Certificate as long as the health care service, procedure, treatment, test, device, Prescription Drug or supply (collectively, \"service\") is Medically Necessary. The fact that a Provider has furnished, prescribed, ordered , recommended, or approved the service does not make it Medically Necessary or mean that We have to Cover it. We may base Our decision on a review of: Your medical records; Our medical policies and clinical guidelines; Medical opinions of a professional society, peer review committee or other groups of Physicians; Reports in peer -reviewed medical literature; Reports and guidelines published by nationally -recognized health care organizations that include supporting scie ntific data; Professional standards of safety and effectiveness, which are generally - recognized in the United States for diagnosis, care, or treatment; 13 COL-17-NY (PY18) CERT The opinion of Health Care Professionals in the generally -recognized health specialty involved; The op inion of the attending Providers, which have credence but do not overrule contrary opinions.

For example we will not p rovide coverage for an inpatient admission for surgery if the surgery could have been performed on an outpatient basis. See the Utilization Review and External Appeal sections of this Certificate for Your right to an internal Appeal and external appeal of Our determination that a service is not Medically Necessary. K. Protection from Surprise Bills. 1. A surprise bill is a bill You receive for Covered Services in the following circumstances: For services performed by a non -participating Physician at a p articipating Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center, when: o A participating Physician is unavailable at the time the health care services are performed; o A non -participating Physician performs services without Your knowledge; or o Unforeseen medical issues or services arise at the time the health care services are performed. A surprise bill does not include a bill for health care services when a participating Physician is available and You elected to receive services from a non - participating Physician. You were referred by a participating Physician to a Non -Participating Provider without Your explicit written consent acknowledging that the Referral is to a Non-Participating Provider and it may result in costs not covered by Us. For a surprise bill, a referra l to a Non -Participating Provider means: o Covered Services are performed by a Non -Participating Provider in the participating Physician's office or practice during the same visit; o The participating Physician sends a specimen taken from You in the 14 COL-17-NY (PY18) CERT participating Physician's office to a non -participating laboratory or pathologist; or o For any other Covered Services performed by a Non -Participating Provider at the participating Physician's request, when Referrals are required under Your Certificate . You will be held harmless for any N on-Participating P rovider charges for the surprise bill that exceed Your In -Network Copayment, Coinsurance or Deductible if You assign benefits to the Non -Participating P rovider in writing. In such cases, the N on-Participa ting P rovider may only bill You for Your In -Network Copayment, Coinsurance or Deductible. The assignment of benefits form for surprise bills is available at www.dfs.ny.gov or You can visit Our website at www.uhcsr.com /nyumc for a copy of the form. You need to mail a copy of the assignment of benefits form to Us at the address on Our website and to Your Provider . 2. Independent Dispute Resolution Process. Either We or a Provider may submit a dispute involving a surprise bill to an independent dispute resolution entity (IDRE) assigned by the state. Disputes are submitted by completing the IDRE application form, which can be found at www. dfs.ny.gov. The IDR E will determine whether Our payment or Provider's charge is reasonable within 30 days of receiving the dispute. L. Delivery of Covered Services Using Telehealth. If Your Provider offers Covered Services using telehealth, We will not deny the Covered Services because they are delivered using telehealth. Covered Services delivered using telehealth may be subject to utilization review and quality assurance requirements and other terms and conditions of the Certificate that are at least as favorable as thos e requirements for the same service when not delivered using telehealth. \"Telehealth\" means the use of electronic information and communication technologies by a Provider to deliver Covered Services to You while Your location is different than Your Provid er's location . M. Case Management. Case management helps coordinate services for Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. Our programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the case management program to help meet their health -related needs. Our case management programs are confidential and voluntary. These programs are given at no extra cost to You and do not change Covered Services. If You meet program criteria and agree to take part, We will help You meet Your identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and team work with You and/or Your authorized representative, treating Physician(s), and other Providers. In addition, We 15 COL-17-NY (PY18) CERT may assist in coordinating care with existing community -based programs and services to meet Your needs, which may include giving You information about external agencies and community -based programs and services. In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, We may provide benefits for alternate care through Our case management program that is not listed as a Covered Service. We may also extend Covered Services beyond the benefit maximums of this Certificate. We will make Our decision on a case -by-case basis if We determin e the alternate or extended benefit is in the best interest of You and Us Nothing in this provision shall prevent You from appealing Our decision. A decision to provide extended benefits or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate Us to provid e the same benefits again to You or to any other Member. We reserve the right, at any time, to alter or stop providing extended benefits or approving alternate care. In such case, We will notify You or Your representative in writing.] N.

When You receive Covered Services from a Non -Participating Provider, in addition to the applicable Copayments, Deductible s and Coinsurance described in the Schedule of Benefits section of this Certificate , You must also pay the a mount, if any, by which the Non-Participating Provider's actual charge exceeds Our Allowed Amount. This means that the total of Our coverage and any Cost-Sharing amounts You pay may be less than the Non -Participating Provider's actual charge. When You receive Covered Services from a Non -Participating Provider, We will apply nationally -recognized payment rules to the claim submitted for those services. These rules evaluate the claim information and determine the accuracy of the procedure codes and diagn osis codes for the services You received. Sometimes, applying these rules will change the way that We pay for the services. This does not mean that the services were not Medically Necessary. It only means that the claim should have been submitted dif ferently. For example, Your P rovider may have billed using several procedure codes when there is a single code that includes all of the separate procedures. We will make one (1) inclusive payment in that case rather than a separate payment for each billed c ode. Another example of when We will apply the payment rules to a claim is when You have surgery that involves two (2) surgeons acting as \"co-surgeons\". Under the paym ent rules, the claim from each P rovider should have a \"modifier\" on it 21 COL-17-NY (PY18) CERT that identifie s it as coming from a co -surgeon. If We receive a claim that does not have the correct modifier, We will change it and make the appropriate payment. G. Allowed Amount. \"Allowed Amount\" means the maximum amount We will pa y for the services or suppli es Covered under this Certificate, before any applicable Copayment, Deductible and Coinsurance amounts are subtracted. We determine Our Allowed Amount as follows: The Allowed Amount for Participating Providers will be the amount We have negotiated with the Participating Provider. Our payments to Participating Providers may include financial incentives to help improve the quality of care and promote the delivery of Covered Services in a cost - efficient manner. Payments under this financial incentive program are not made as payment for a specific Covered Service provided to You. Your Cost -Sharing will not change based on any payments made to or received from Participating Providers as part of the financial incentive program.

For Facilities, the Allowed Amount will be the lesser of : The 80th percentile of the Fair Health rate The Facility's charge. A rate based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect the one (1) or more of the following factors: o The complexity or severity of treatment. o Level of skill and experience required for the treatment. o Comparable Facilities' fees and costs to deliver care. 2.
