It addresses grievances, coverage/organization determinations, and appeals for beneficiaries enrolled in a plan provided by a Medicare Advantage (MA) organization, a Medicare cost plan , health care prepayment plan (HCPP) , or a stand -alone Part D plan. The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. Additional information re lated to Part C and Part D grievances, coverage/organization determinations, and ap peals may be found on the following Appeals and Grievances guidance webpages: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Appeals -and-Grievances/MMCAG/index.html https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Appeals -and-Grievances/MedPrescriptDrugApplGriev/index 10.1 - Glossary For purposes of this guidance, the following terminology will be used as described in the corresponding instances : Refers to Part C Only Refers to Part D Only Refers to Both Parts C & D Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) , Medicare cost plan or health care prepayment plan (HCPP) Part D plan s ponsor or plan sponsor Plan Request for Organization Determination Request for Coverage Determination Coverage Request Organization Determination Coverage Determination Initial Determination Reconsideration* Redetermination Level 1 Appeal *This term is also used to refer to the IRE level of appeal (level 2 appeal ) under both Part C and Part D. Note: The term \"coverage decision\" will be used throughout this guidance in circumstances where the term applies to both an initial determination and a level 1 appeal decision. Unless othe rwise stated in this guidance , the following definitions apply: INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 6 Appeal: As defined at 42 CFR \u00a7422.561 and \u00a7423.560, the procedures that deal with the review of adverse initial determinations made by the plan on health care services or benefits under Part C or D the enrollee believes he or she is entitled to receive, including a delay in providing, arranging for, or approving the health care services or drug coverage (when a delay would adversely affect the health of the enrollee) or on any amounts the enr ollee must pay for a service or drug as defined in 42 CFR \u00a7422.566(b) and \u00a7423.566(b). These appeal procedures include a plan reconsideration or redetermination (also referred to as a l evel 1 appeal ), a reconsideration by an independent review entity (IRE), adjudication by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) or attorney adjudicator, review by the Medicare Appeals Council (Council), and judicial review. Beneficiary and Family Centered Care Quality Improv ement Organization (BFCC -QIO): Organizations comprised of practicing doctors and other health care experts under contract to the federal government to monitor and improve the care given to Medicare enrollees. The BFCC - QIOs review enrollee complaints abou t the quality of care provided by physicians, inpatient hospitals, hospital outpatient departments, hospital emergency rooms, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), home health agencies (HHAs), Medicare managed care plans, Medicare Part D prescription drug pla ns, and ambulatory surgical centers. The BFCC -QIOs also review continued stay denials in acute inpatient hospital facilities as well as coverage terminations in SNFs, HHAs, and comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities (CORFs). In some cases, th e BFCC -QIO can provide informal dispute resolution between the health care provider (e.g., physician, hospital, etc.) and enrollee. Clean Claim (Part C Only) : As defined at 42 CFR \u00a7422.500(b) , a claim that has no defect, impropriety, lack of any required substantiating documentation (consistent with 42 CFR \u00a7422.310(d)), or particular circumstance requiring special treatment that prevents timely payment and that otherwise conforms to the clean claim requirements for equivalent claims under O riginal Medicare. Dismissal: A decision not to review a request for a grievance, initial determination, or appeal because it is considered invalid or does not otherwise meet Medicare Advantage or Part D requir ements. Effectuation : Authorization or provision of a benefit that a plan has approved, payment of a claim or compliance with a complete or partial reversal of a plan's original adverse determination. Enrollee : An eligible individual who has elected a Medicare Advantage, Prescription Drug , or cost plan or health care prepayment plan ( HCPP). Grievance: An expression of dissatisfaction with any aspect of the operations, activities or behavior of a plan or its delegated entity in the provision of health care items, services , or prescription drugs, regardless of whether remedial action is requested or can be taken . A griev ance does not include, and is distinct from, a dispute of the appeal of an organization determinatio n or coverage determination or an LEP determination . INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 7 Independent Review Entity (IRE): An independent entity contract ed by CMS to review adverse level 1 ap peal decisions made by the plan . Under Part C, an IRE can review plan dismissals. Inquiry: Any verbal or written request for information to a plan or its delegated entity that does not express dissatisfaction or invoke a plan's grievance , coverage or appeals process, such as a routine question about a benefit. Non- Contract Provider: A provider or supplier that does not contract with a MA organization to provide services covered by the MA plan. Quality of Care Grievance: A grievance related to wheth er the quality of covered services provided by a plan or provider meets professionally recognized standards of health care, including whether appropria te health care services have been provided or have been provided in appropriate settings. Reconsideratio n: Under Part C, the first level in the appeals process which involves a review of an adverse organization determination by an MA plan, the evidence and findings upon which it was based, and any other evidence submitted by a party to the organization de termination, the MA plan or CMS. Under Part D, the second level in the appeals process which involves a review of an adver se coverage determination by an independent review entity (IRE), the evidence and findings upon which it was based, and any other evi dence the enrollee submits or the IRE obtains. As used in this guidance , the term may refer to the first level in the Part C appeals process in which the MA plan reviews an adverse Part C organization determination or the second level of appeal in both the Part C and Part D appeals process in which an independent review entity re views an adverse plan decision. Redetermination: First level in the Part D appeal process in which the plan sponsor reviews an adverse Part D coverage determination, including th e findings upon which the decision was based and any other evidence submitted or obtained. Reopening: A remedial action taken to change a binding determination or decision even though the determination or decision may have been correct at the time it was made based on the evidence of record. Representative: Under Part C, as defined in \u00a7422.561, an individual appointed by an enrollee or other party , or authorized under state or other applicable law , to act on behalf of an enrollee or other party involved in a grievance , organization determination, or appeal. Under Part D \u00a7423.560 defines \" representative\" as an individual either appointed by a n enrollee or authorized under s tate or other applicable law to act on behalf of the enrollee in filing a grievance, obtaining a coverage determination, or in dealing with any of the levels of the appeals process. For both Part C & Part D , unless otherwise provided in the applicable law, the representative will have all of the rights and responsibilities of an enrollee or other party, as applicable . Withdraw al: A voluntary verbal or written request to rescind or cancel a pending grievance, initial determination, or appeal request submitted by the same party . INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 8 10.2 - Applicability to Employer -Sponsored Benefits Part C Only Managed care appeal procedures apply to all benefits offered under an MA plan , including optional supplemental benefits. However, determinations on benefits purchased by an employer, over and above the Medicare approved benefit package provid ed by the MA plan, such as payments of premiums or enrollee cost sharing provided by the employer, are not subject to the requirements outlined in this guidance. Part D Only Part D appeal procedures apply to all Part D benefits offered under an Employer/ Union -Only Group Waiver Plan (EGWP). These plans are offered by Medicare Advantage Organizations, PDP Sponsors, or Cost Plan Sponsors. Part D plan sponsors of EGWPs must follow Part D determination, grievance, and appeal procedures in cases in which the provision of employer other health insurance is intertwined with drugs offered under the Part D benefit such that the two cannot be separated as a practical matter. See Chapter 12 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual for additional information on prescription drug benefits for EGWPs. 10.3 - Claims Processing and Appeals for Medicare Cost Plans and Health Care Prepayment Plans ( HCPPs ) It is often appropriate for the Medicare Administrative Contractors ( MACs ) to process claims for enrollees in cost plans (except as specified otherwise, these rules affecting cost plans also apply to HCPPs) as regular Part B claims (e.g., when enrollees see an out -of-network physician without plan authorization or for certain services such as physical therapy [see Chapter 17(B), \u00a7300 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual ]). It may also be appropriate for MACs to process Part B emergency or urgently needed services ( See 42 CFR \u00a7417.558). Similarly, it may be appropriate for a MAC to process claims for cost plan enrollees as regular Part A claims (e.g., when enrollees use an out -of-network facility or for certain services such as home health or hospice services [see Chapter 17(B), \u00a7300 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual]). Also, if a cost plan with a contract under section 1876 of the Social Security Act (the Act) elects \"billing option 1\" (i.e., chooses to have CMS pay for all hospital and skilled nursing facility ( SNF) services - see 42 CFR \u00a7417.532(c)), the MAC would process any claims received (including Part B hospital outpatient claims). However, regardless of who pays Part A or Part B claims, if an enrollee has received services through the cost plan's network, or out -of-network at the direction of the cost plan/network provider (e.g. referral), or because of an emergency inpatient admission, appeals concerning a denial of payment of such services are subject to the rules that apply to cost plan services . Pursuan t to \u00a7 417.600, those rights, procedures, and requirements pertaining to appeals contained INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 9 in 42 CFR Part 422 Subpart M are applicable to enrollees in 1876 cost plans. (In the case of an HCPP, \u00a7417.840 require s HCPPs to apply the MA regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.568 through 422.626 to appeals related to Part B services. Part A services are not covered under the HCPP agreement, and would always be processed under the 42 CFR Part 405 fee-for-service appeals rules.) Furthermore, the enrollee cannot be held liable for a Part A or Part B service just because a MAC denied the clai m under these circumstances. This is true even though the cost plan has no influence on the MAC decision. The 42 CFR Part 405 fee -for-service appeals rules apply to the first level appeal in an 1876 cost plan only in a case in which the enrollee self -referred out of the cost plan's provider network or hospital /SNF network without the cost plan s involvement (including outpatient emergency services at an out -of-network hospital). Any disputes involving applicable cost -sharing are subject to the rules that apply to cost plan services at 42 CFR Part 422 Subpart M. If an enrollee files an appeal with the cost plan when the appeal should have been filed with the MAC, the cost plan mus t inform the enrollee that the appeal should be filed with the MAC that denied the payment. The cost plan should direct the enrollee to the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) for an explanation of the 42 CFR Part 405 fee -for-service appeals process. The cost plan must inform the enrollee in the Evidence of Coverage (EOC) that the cost plan's appeals process is only for disputes relating to organization determinations made by the plan or certain emergency admissions. 10.4 - General Responsibilities of the Pla n 10.4.1 - Medical Exigency Standard The medical exigency standard requires a plan and the independent review entity to make decisions as \"expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires.\" This standard is set forth in regulations at Part 422 Subpart M and Part 423 Subpart M with respect to coverage requests and effectuation of favorable decisions. This standard requires that the plan or the independent review entity apply, at a minimum, established accepted standards of medical practice in assessing an individual's medical condition. Evidence of the individual's condition can be obtained from the treating provider or from the individual's medical record (e.g., diagnosis, symptoms, or test results). This standard was established by regulation to ensu re that plans develop a standard for determining the urgency of coverage requests, triage incoming requests against established criteria, and prioritize each request according to these standards. Plans must treat each case in a manner that is appropriate for the facts and circumstances of the enrollee's medical condition. Plans should not routinely take the maximum time permitted for adjudicating coverage requests. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 10 10.4.2 - Role of the Medical Director In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7422.562(a)(4) and 423.562(a)(5) , all plans must employ a medical director who is respons ible for ensuring the clinical accuracy of all coverage decisions made by the plan that involve medical necessity. CMS expects plans to have processes in place for elevating issues of clinical concern to the medical director; however, it is not expected that a plan's medical director will review every medical necessity decision . CMS considers the medical director to be fulfilling their responsibility through the plan's established process for when a medical director must be involved. The medical director has overall responsibility for the plan's clinical decision -making, and as such, is expected to be involved in various aspects of related plan policies and operations which may include : medical and utilization review, benefits and claims management, formulary administration, processing coverage decisions in accordance with adjudication timeframes and notice requirements, provider/prescriber outreach, staff training, and oversight of delegated entities. The medical director must be a physician, as defined i n section 1861(r) of the Act, with a current license to practice medicine in a state, territory, Commonwealth of the United States, or the District of Columbia. 10.4.3 - Delegation of Responsibilities With the exception of the employment of the medical director, a plan may delegate any of the responsibilities discussed in this guidance to another entity or individual that provides or arranges Part C or Part D benefits. In cases of delegation, the plan remains responsible and must therefore ensure that requirements are met completely by the delegated entity and/or individual. The plan must have a comprehensive and on -going monitoring and auditing process in place to validate the per formance of the delegated entities' compliance with applicable CMS requirements. 10.4.4 - Plan Communication to an Enrollee Plans must establish and maintain procedures for standard and expedited initial determinations, appeals and grievances. Written information about these procedures (including the quality of care grievance process available through the Beneficiary and Family Centered Care Quality Improvement Organization (BFCC -QIO)) must be provided or made available to enrollees at initial enrollmen t, upon an enrollee's request and annually thereafter, as well as in any circumstance that provides enrollee rights to initial determinations, appeals, and grievances as described throughout this guidance, including but not limited to: Grievance procedures available upon involuntary disenrollment initiated by the plan; Any changes to the plan's grievance or appeals procedures 30 days in advance of the effective date of the changes; and INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 11 Appeals procedures upon notification of an adverse initial determination or a service or coverage termination (e.g., hospital, CORF, HHA, or SNF settings). All written communication and notifications must be written in a manner that is understandable to the enrollee. Where applicable in standardized notices, the plan must use the approved notice language. (See \u00a7\u00a740.12 and 50.10 for notification requirements for initial determinations and level 1 appeals, respectively .) Plans must also provide wr itten communications and notices described in this guidance in alternate formats and languages consistent with Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 . In addition, a plan's fax and e -mail or web -based portal systems must meet the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy and security requirements. If the enrollee agrees, the MA plan may deliver written notices by fax or e -mail. Please see Medicare Marketing Guidelines regarding electronic communication with enrollees. Enrollees requesting an alternate format should have the same level of access to information as an individual not requesting information in an alternate format. The term \"access\" includes providing information in a format that the given individual can unde rstand. Delays in providing materials in alternate formats can impact timeframes that enrollees may have to take certain actions. For example, a disabled enrollee received services from a non -contract provider and now requests instructions in an alterna te format as to how to request that the plan reimburse the enrollee for the out -of-pocket claim. If the plan requires the claim to be filed within a certain amount of time, it must take into account the additional time that may be needed to provide the in structions in the alternate format and for the enrollee to submit the claim. The plan should accept the individual's claim as timely when it is submitted. Additionally, plans should ensure enrollees with limited English proficiency are able to communicat e with plans regarding initial determinations, appeals, and grievances. Enrollees with limited English proficiency should have the same level of access to plan representatives and information regarding initial determinations, appeals, and grievances as enrollees who are proficient in English. Plans may view the CMS Office of Minority Health website for strategies on how to ensure plan services to enrollees are culturally and linguistically equitable. For example, plans may incorporate the Building an Organizational Response to Health Disparities Resource Guide into plan operations. Plans may also incorporate the Office of Minority Health's Disparity Impact Statement into their operations to reduce health disparities among enrollees. 10.5 - Adjudication Requirements 10.5.1 -Calculation of Days for Assessing Plan Timeliness For the purpose of assessing the timeliness of a plan's completion of a grievance, initial INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 12 determination, or level 1 appeal , the day a plan receives the request is not counted as \"day one\". \"Day one \" is the day after receipt of the request . (Day/day s are calendar days unl ess otherwise specified and includes weekends and holidays) . Timeframes measured in hours must be met within the number of hours indicated. For e xample: An MA plan receives a request for a standard pre-service organ ization determination on May 1. The plan must notify the enrollee of its determination as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition r equires, but no later than 14 calendar days after the date the plan receives the request, which would be May 15. A Part D plan sponsor receives a request for an expedited coverage determination on May 1 at 10:30 am. Given the 24-hour timeframe, the plan must notify the enrollee of its determination n o later than 10:30 am on May 2. 10.5.2 - When a Request is Considered Received by the Plan Plans must have processes in place to accept requests (grievance, coverage , and appeal request s) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (including holidays). Requests (and for Part D, prescriber supporting statements for exception requests) are deemed \" received\" on the date and time: The plan initially stamps a document received by regular mail (i.e., U.S. Postal Service); A delivery service that has the ability to track when a shipment is delivered (e.g., U.S. Postal Service, UPS, FedEx, or DHL) delivers the document; A faxed document is successfully transmitted to the plan, as indicated on the fax transmission report ; A verbal request is made by telephone with a customer service representative; A message is left on the plan's voicemail system if the plan utilizes a voicemail system to accept requests or supporting statements after normal business hours; or A request is received through the plan's website, provided the website and/or portal meets all applicable regulatory requirements . Note: For standard requests, the processing timeframe begins when the plan , any unit in the plan, or a delegated entity (including a delegated entity that is not responsible for processing) receives a request. For expedited requests, the processing timeframe begins when the appropriate department receives the request. Plan material should clearly state where pre - and post- service requests should be sent, thus ensuring requests are received at the correct location and giving the plan the greatest amount of time to process the request. Plan policy and procedures should clearly indicate how to route requests that are received i n an incorrect location to the correct location as expeditiously as possible . INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 13 10.5.3 - When Notification is Considered Delivered by the Plan Unless otherwise specified (e.g., Section 40.8 of this guidance) , written notification is considered delivered on the date (and time, if applicable) the notice has left the possession of the plan or delegated entity . Generally, this occurs when the notice has been deposited into the courier drop box or external outgoi ng mail receptacle (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or FedEx bin) or for electronic delivery of required materials, the date the plan sends the materials to the enrollee (see Section 100.2.2 of the Medicare Marketing Guidelines for requirements on delivering electronic materials to enrollees). Placement into the plan or delegated entity's internal outgoing mail receptacle is not considered deliver ed. For electronic payments (i.e., EFTs), delivery occurs on the date (and time, if applicable) the plan distributes the funds for payment . Verbal notification is considered delivered on the date (and time, if applicable) a plan speaks directly to or leaves a voicemail for an enrollee or enrollee's representative. Plans may initially provide verbal notification to enrollees prior to issuing written notification. In circumstances when verbal notification is permitted per regulatory requirements and the plan successfully provides verbal notice (e.g., spoke with the person that submitted the request or was able to leave a voicemail message) , the required written notification must be sent by the plan within 3 calendar days of the verbal notice. If the plan is not able to successfully provide verbal notice (i.e., when a plan has an enrollee's telephone number on file, but is unable to reach the enrollee at the number provided because, for example, it is either incorrect, out-of- service, or no person (or no voicemail system) answers), written notice must be sent within the applicable timeframe. Information regarding verbal notification for expedited requests can be found at \u00a740.8 for initial determinations and \u00a750.2.2 for level 1 appeals. The regulations applicable to adjudication timeframes for standard Part C plan reconsiderations at 42 CFR \u00a7 422.590(a) and (c) and D redeterminat ions at 42 CFR \u00a7 423.590(a) do not address verbal notification . However, t he plan may choose to initially provide verbal notification of the decision, but the required written notification must be issued within the applicable adjudication timeframe. For Part C reconsiderations, the plan must issue the determination as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 30 calendar days from the date it receives the request for a standard reconsideration. For Part D redetermina tions, the plan must notify the enrollee in writing of its redetermination as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 7 calendar days from the date it receives the request for a standard redetermination. 10.6 - Outrea ch for Additional Information to Support Coverage Decisions Plans must have processes in place for making timely coverage decisions (initial requests and appeals), which includes soliciting clinical documentation, such as medical records, when necessary. If a plan does not have enough information to make a pre- service or pre -benefit coverage decision, it should make reasonable and diligent efforts to obtain all necessary information. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 14 Plans are only required to conduct outreach to request additional infor mation from a provider if the plan does not have all necessary information to make a coverage or appeal decision. In instances when outreach i s necessary to make a coverage or appeal decision, a minimum of one attempt to obtain additional information is s ufficient. Plans may adopt best practices for outreach, such as making multiple attempts, using multiple methods for requesting information (e.g., telephone, fax, e- mail, etc.), and/or and involving plan physicians in order to increase the likelihood of obtaining necessary information. If the plan does not receive any additional information, the plan should make the best decision it can based on the information available within the required adjudication timeframes. Plans are not required to conduct outre ach prior to denying claims payments if they believe they have all the necessary information needed to make a coverage decision. Part C Only For expedited organization determination and reconsideration requests, if medical information is needed from a non -contract provider, the MA plan must request the necessary information within 24 hours of receipt of the request. Part D Only For expedited redetermination requests, if medical information is needed, the Part D plan sponsor must request the information within 24 hours of receipt of the request. Plans should document all requests for information and maintain that documentation within the case file. If the plan issues an adverse decision due to the inability to obtain clinical information needed to approve coverage, the plan should clearly identify that basis and the necessary information in the written denial notice. See \u00a7 \u00a7 422.568(d) and ( e), 422.570(d), and 422.572(d) for denials related to Part A and B services , items and Part B drugs , and 423.568(f) and (g) for denials related to Part D benefits . Note: See \u00a7 20.2.1 for information regarding missing documentation for representation ( i.e., no appointment of representation form on file), and \u00a7 50.1.1 for missing Waiver of Liability form (WOL ) for non -contract providers . 20 - Representatives 20.1 - Representatives Filing on Behalf of Enrollees Individuals who represent enrollees may either be appointed or authorized (for purposes of this guidance, both are referred to as \"representatives\") to act on behalf of the enrollee in filing a grievance, requesting an initial determination, or in dealing with any of the levels of the appeals INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 15 process. Who Can Appoint a Representative Who Can Act or be A ppointed as a Representative Requirement for Representat ion Enrollee Any individual (e.g., relati ve, friend, advocate, attorney) The enrollee must submit Form CMS -1696, Appointment of Representative (AOR), or an equivalent written notice (hereinafter, collectively referred to as a representative form) . A court act ing in accordance with state or other applicable law * An individual authorized by the court. Could include, but is not limited to: Court appointed guardian Individual with durable power of a ttorney A health care proxy A person designated under a health care consent statute Executor of an estate A repre sentative form is not required. Authorized individual must produce appropriate legal papers supporting his or her status under state law. *Plans with service areas comprising more than one state should be aware of the different state representation requirements and are responsible for determining whether a person or entity who asserts surrogate status is an appropriate surrogate under st ate law. For plans that accept verbal requests, enrollees cannot verbally appoint a representative and must submit a valid representative form . However, if a purport ed representative makes a verbal request and the enrollee verbally confirms they want to file the request described by the purported representative, the re quest must be documented and processed as a request from the enrollee, not a representative. All communication (written and verbal ) must be delivered to the enrollee until a valid, written representative form is on file. In these instances, plans are not required to make efforts to obtain a written representative form. 20.2 - Appointment of Representative (AOR) Form or Equivalent Written Notice If an appointment is made using the OMB -approved Form CMS -1696 , Appointment of Representative (AOR) , or an equivalent written notice (see requirements below) the plan must accept it . Plans are prohibited from requiring the use of a specific form for appointments . The AOR contains the necessary elements to meet representation requirements, and is preferred . (Note: Section 4 of the AOR does not apply t o MA plan s or Part D p lan sponsors .) Plans may not require information beyond what is included in the AOR or the requirements outlined below for an equivalent written notice. Plans are required to accept an AOR with electronic signatures if the form is submitted through INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 16 the plan 's secure portal or other secure electronic means (e.g., a secure messaging system) , provided all applicable regulatory and CMS website /electronic communication requirements are met. AORs contain an enrollee's HICN (Health Insurance Claim Number), Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) or plan ID number and should be treated as protected information. An equivalent written notice includes the following: Name, address, and telephone number s of the enrollee and the individual being appointed; Enrollee's HICN or Medicare Beneficiary Identifier, or plan ID number; The appointed representative' s professional status or relationship to the party; A written explanation of the purpose and scope of the representation; A statement that the enrollee is authorizing the representative to act on his or her behalf for the claim(s) at issue, and a statement authorizing disclosure of individually identifying inform ation to the representative; A statement by the individual being appointed that he or she accepts the appointmen t; and Is signed and dated by the enrollee and the individual being appointed. A representative form is valid for one year from the date it has signatures for both the enrollee and the appointee , unless revoked . For example, if the enrollee signs the form on January 1, 2019 and the representative signs on January 3, 2019 (or vice ver sa), the form is effective for one year starting on January 3, 2019. If the enrollee would like the same individual to continue serving as a representative after one year, the enrollee must reappoint that person by submitting a new representative form . A form is valid for the life of a grievance, coverage request, or appeal if the grievance, coverage request , or appeal was received within one year of the date a representative form is signed by both the enrollee and appointee. If the representative form is maintained and accessible by the plan , a photocopy of the signed representative form is not required to be filed with future grievances , coverag e requests, or appeals made on behalf of the enrollee in order to continue representation. If the plan uses a representative form that is on file for request s, it must include a copy when sending a case file to higher level adjudicators, if applicable. Note: A representative form submitted with a request that specifically limits the appointment to MA or Part D benefits is not valid for requests that involve Part D or MA benefits, respectively. In these instances, the enrollee must properly execute separate representative form s. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 17 20.2.1 - Missing or Defective Representative Form When a request for an initial determination or level 1 appeal is filed by a person claiming to be a representative, but the party does not provide the valid representative documentation to show that the individual is authorized to act on the enrollee's behalf , the plan should : For expedited requests, d evelop procedures to ensure that expedited requests are not inappropriately delayed. Inform the enrollee and purported representative, in writing, that the coverage request, or appeal is not valid until documentation is provided. Make and document its reasonable efforts to secure the necessary representative documentation . The plan must not issue a decision until or unless such documentation is obtained. The plan is not required to undertake a review until or unless such documentation is obtained, but may choose to begin the review while continuing efforts to obtain the representative documentation. The timeframe for acting on a coverage request, or appeal begins when the representative documentation is received. If the plan does not receive representative documentation by the conclusion of the applicable timeframe , plus any applicable extension, the following apply : Dismissal of coverage and appeal requests : The request is dismissed because the person or entity making the request is not permitted to request a coverage decision or appeal or is not a proper party . The plan must mail or otherwise transmit a written dismissal notice to the enrollee (or other proper party) and should also send the notice to the person asserting representative status. The dismissal notice must state all of the following: (1) the reason for the dismissal; (2) the right to request that the plan vacate the dismissal action; and (3) the right to request review of the dismissal. The notice should also explain how the invalid request can be cured and that the request will be processed if the enrollee or representative submits a properly executed form. See 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 422.568(g) and (h), 422.582(f) and (g), 423.568(i) and (j), 423.582(e) and (f). See \u00a750.9 for additional information regarding reconsideration dismissal procedures. 20.3 - Authority of a Representative The representative has all of the rights and responsibilities of an enrollee in filing a grievance, obtaining a coverage request, or in dealing with any levels of the appeals process . If an enrollee has identified a representative, all notices or other correspondence that must be sent to the enrollee per the regulations at 42 CFR Part 422 or 423 Subpart M must be sent to the enrollee's representat ive instead of to the enrollee. Plans may send notices or correspondence to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 18 30 - Grievances A grievance is an expression of dissatisfaction with any aspect of the operations, activities , or behavior of a plan or its delegated entity in the provision of health care or prescription drug services or benefits, regardless of whether remedial action is requested. The regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7422 .564(a) and 423.564(a) require each plan to have meaningful procedures for the timely resolution of grievances between enrollees and the plan or any of its delegated entities. Plans must provide all enrollee s with written grievance procedures upon initial enrollment, involuntary disenrollmen t, annually, and upon request. The plan must also notify enrollees about any changes to its grievance procedures 30 days in advance of the effective date of the change. Decisions made under the grievance process are not subject to appeal. 30.1 - Classification between Grievances, Inquir ies, Coverage Requests , and Appeals An enrollee may contact a plan to file, make , or request a grievance, inquiry, coverage request , or appeal . Grievance procedures are separate and distinct from initial determination and appeal procedures. Any communication from an enrollee must be reviewed on a case- by-case basis to determine how it should be categorized. The enrollee is not required to use any specific language to indicate what they are requesting. Plans must determine whether the matter or the issue is a grievance, coverage request, appeal, or combination of more than one category and inform the enrollee ( verbal ly or i n writing) if the issue is a grievance or an appeal . If an enrollee raises two or more issues at the same time , then each issue should be processed separately and simultaneously (to the extent possible) under the appropriate procedure. Plans should ensure that customer service representatives are trained to distinguish between coverage requests, appeals, and grievances. Note : If the plan misclassifies a grievance as an appeal and the case goes to the IRE, the IRE will dismiss the appeal and return the ca se to the plan for proper processing. The plan must notify the enrollee in writing that the case was misclassified and will be handled through the plan's grievance process. For initial determination requests misclassified as grievances, see \u00a740.13. For appeals that are misclassified as grievances see \u00a750.11. Examples of Inquiries, Grievances, Coverage Requests , and Appeals Inquiries may include the following : An enrollee calls the plan to determine if a drug or service is covered, the plan tell s the enrollee that it is not covered, the enrollee does not complain about the exclusion or non - coverage, does not make a request for the drug or service, nor does the enrollee argu e that it should be covered under certain circumstances. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 19 Grievances may include the following: An enrollee's involuntary disenrollment initiated by the plan; A change in premiums or cost sharing arrangements from one contract year to the next; Lack of q uality of the care received ; Plan benefit design; Difficulty contacting the plan via phone; Interpersonal aspects of care; The appeals process; The p lan's decision not to expedite a coverage or appeal request; General dissatisfaction ab out a co -payment amount, but not a dispute about the amount the enrollee paid or is billed ; General issue about a drug not being on the formulary or listed as an excluded drug; or Calculation of True Out -of-Pocket (TrOOP) costs. Coverage Requests may include when an enrollee : Calls requesting or indicating they want a drug, service, or item; Wants to continue care with a provider who is no longer contracted with the plan (out of network coverage); Wants to continue receiving services already received in accordance with the original organization determination (this is a request for a new set of services); State s that their drug was rejected at the pharmacy but they need it; or States that a drug is not excluded from Part D coverage for the indication f or which it is being prescribed. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 20 Coverage Requests for Part D Only may include when an enrollee argues that : A drug is a covered Part D drug under \u00a71860D- 2(e)(1) of the Act or is covered under \u00a71860D- 2(e)(1) for a specific indication; A drug is not excluded under \u00a71860D -2(e)(2) of the Act or is not excluded under \u00a71860D- 2(e)(2) for a specific indication; A drug is not excluded under \u00a71860D-43 of the Act; or A drug is covered by the plan as a supplemental benefit. Conversely, if an enrollee agrees that a drug is not a covered Part D drug or is excluded from coverage, but has a question or general issue about the drug not being covered, the transaction should be processed as an inqu iry or a grievance, respectively. Appeals may include the following: An enrollee calls after receiving a bill stating they believe that the plan has required them to pay a co -pay amount that should be the plan's responsibility or they dispute the calculation of the co -pay amount . An enrollee calls his or her plan and states, \"I would like to file a grievance . You denied my request for drug X or service Y and I need it.\" When a n adverse initial determination has been made, the enrollee's dispute should be treated as an appeal of the denial. Therefore, either an appeal should be started or , if the plan does not accept verbal standard appeal requests , they must inform the enrollee of how to submit a written appeal request. Examples of Both a Grievance and a Coverage Request: An issue concerning untimely receipt of a service or Part D drug that has already been covered may be treated as a grievance. If the enrollee also states that he or she was unable to obtain the covered service or Part D drug and that the delay will adversely affect his or her health, it should be processed as a coverage request, as well as a quality of care grievance. An enrollee complains that th ey had to wait so long for a service or Part D drug that they went out -of-network . This should be treated as a coverage request for the out -of-network service or Part D drug, as well as a grievance about the timeliness of the service/benefit. An enrollee has a benefit that covers one pair of eyeglasses every 24 months with a maximum contribution of $70.00. The enrollee asserts that the prescription was wrong , and requests that the plan cover another pair of glasses. The enrollee indicates that the previously rendered services are inadequate, or substandard in quality. Therefore, this would be classified as a grievance (quality of care grievance ) and the request for a new pair of glasses is a new coverage request. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 21 30.1.1 - Inquiries Related to Non -Part D and Excluded Drugs (Part D Only) When a Part D plan sponsor receives an inquiry (that is, a question that is not a request for a coverage determination) about a drug that is never covered by Part D or is an excluded drug, it should explain the following to the requestor : Certain drugs (or the requested drug) are not covered Part D drugs under 1860D- 2(e)(1) of the Act, or are excluded from coverage under 1860D -2(e)(2) or 1860D-43 of the Act and the plan sponsor cannot or does not offer the drug as a supplemental benefit ; Because the drug is not a covered Part D drug under 1860D -2(e)(1) of the Act, or is excluded from coverage under 1860D- 2(e)(2) or 1860D -43 and is not offered as a supplemental benefit, the enrollee may not obtain it through the coverage determination, exceptions , or appeals processes; The enrollee should work with his or he r physician or other prescriber to determine whether a drug on the plan' s formulary is medically appropriate for treating the enrollee's condition; and The enrollee, physician, or other prescriber h as the right to contact the plan sponsor and request a coverage determination if he or she believes that the requested drug is: o A covered Part D drug under section 1860D -2(e)(1) of the Act or covered under 1860D- 2(e)(1) for the indication it is being prescribed for; o Not excluded under section 1860D -2(e)(2) of the Act or not excluded under 1860D- 2(e)(2) for the purpose for which it was prescribed; o Not excluded under section 1860D -43 of the Act; or o Covered by the plan as a supplemental benefit. A plan sponsor should provide this information either verbal ly or in writing. If a plan sponsor chooses to deliver this information in writing, it may use the model Notice of Inquiry . If a plan sponsor provide s this information verbal ly, this should be documented by the plan sponsor . 30.2 - Procedures for Handling a Grievance Procedures for processing a grievance are as follows: Filing Method Filing Deadline Processing Requirements In writing No later than 60 days after the incident that Plans must: Complete the investigation as expeditiously as the case requires, based on the enrollee's heath status, but no later INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 22 Filing Method Filing Deadline Processing Requirements precipitates the grievance* than 30 days of receipt of the request, or within 24 hours for expedited grievances. Note: Plans may take a 14 -day extension if the enrollee requests the extension or if the plan justifies a need for additional information and documents how the delay is in the best interest of the enrollee. Plan s must promptly notify the enrollee in writing if the extension is going to be taken and explain the reason for the delay. See: 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7422.564(e)(2) or 423.564(e)(2). Accept any information or evidence concerning the grievance. Take prompt, appropriate action, including a full investigation if necessary. Provide a response to all grievances raised in the written request . Have procedures for tracking and maintaining records about the receipt and disposition of grievances. Be able to log or capture enrollees' grievances in a centralized location that is readily accessible. The record should include documentation of all telephone calls, correspondence, and case notes related to the grievance. Expedite the grievance if: o It is related to a decision not to grant an enrollee's request to expedite an initial determination or appeal, and (for Part D Only ) the enrollee ha s not yet obtained the drug; or o Part C Only: it involves an MA plan 's decision to extend a timeframe related to an organization determination or appeal. Verbal Same as in writing. Same as in writing; however, if a verbal grievance can be resolved during the same call by the customer service representative, the plan must document details of the resolution and proceed to log and report the call as a grievance. *A plan may, but is not required to, accept and process a grievance that is filed after the 60 -day deadline. If the plan chooses not to accept untimely filing, t he plan may dismiss the grievance. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 23 ----30.2.1 - Notification Requirements for Grievances For grievances made in writing, the response must: Be in writing, address all issues raised in the grievance; and be written in a manner that is understandable to the enrollee. For grievances received verbally, the response may be verbal or in writing, unless specifically requested in writing or the grievance raises a quality of care issue (see \u00a730.3). For standard grievances, notification must be delivered no later than 30 days from receipt (plus a 14-day extension, if applicable). For expedited grievances, notification must be delivered no later than 24 hours from receipt. When written notification is required for expedited grievances, plans may initially provide verbal notification of its decision and must deliver written confirmation of its decision within 3 calendar days of the verbal notification. Note: If the enrollee's representative submits a request, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans may provide notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. 30.3 - Quality of Care Grievances A quality of care grievance is a type of grievance that is related to whether the quality of covered services provided by a plan or provider meets professionally recognized standards of health care. Examples of a quality of care grievance include any instances where an enrollee infers or states they believe: They were misdiagnosed; Treatment was not appropriate; and/or They received, or did not receive, care that adversely impacted or had the potential to adversely impact their health. Quality of care grievances may be received and acted upon by the plan, the Beneficiary and Family Centered Care Quality Improvement Organization ( BFCC -QIO), or both. For any grievance submitted to the BFCC -QIO, plans must cooperate with the BFCC -QIO in resolving the grievance, including directing providers to respond to BFCC -QIO requests for information , within 14 days. Plans should provide any records and requested information as quickly as possible and within 14 days . INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 24 30.3.1 - Procedures for Handling a Quality of Care Grievance Quality of care grievances submitted to the plan may be made verbally or in writing and must be submitted n o later than 60 days after the incident that precipitates the grievance. A plan may, but is not required to, accept and process a grievance that is filed after the 60 -day deadline. If the plan chooses not to accept untimely filing, they may dismiss the grievance. Plans may take a 14 - day extension and must notify the enrollee in writing if the extension is going to be taken and explain the reason for the delay. See: 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7422.564(e)(2) or 423.564(e)(2). Plans must investigate and respond to the quality of care grievance in writing within 30 days of receipt, or as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires. Written notice must: Include a description of the enrollee's right to file a written complaint with the BFCC -QIO and contact information for the BFCC -QIO; and Be written in a manner that is understandable to the enrollee. If the enrollee's representative submits a request, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans may send written notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. For grievances submitted to the BFCC -QIO, plans must cooperate with the BFCC -QIO and comply with requirements at 42 CFR Part 476 regarding timely submission of requested information to the BFCC -QIO if an enrollee files a grievance with the BFCC -QIO and the plan. 30.4 - Procedure for Handling Withdrawn Grievances An enrollee may submit a written withdrawal request for a grievance any time before the decision is mailed by the plan. The plan may accept verbal withdrawals for both written and verbal grievances received from an enrollee. The plan must clearly document in the system that the enrollee does not want to proceed with the grievance procedures. The plan should, but is not required to, send a written confirmation of that withdrawal to the enrollee within 3 calendar days of rec eiving the withdrawal request. If the enrollee submits a quality of care grievance verbally or in writing, but later decides to withdraw the grievance, the plan is still required to investigate the quality of care grievance; however, the plan is not required to notify the enrollee of the outcome of the grievance since they decided not to pursue the grievance.

An org anization determination is any determi nation (i.e., an approval or denial) made by an MA plan, or its delegated entity with respect to the following : Payment for temporarily out of the area renal dialysis services, emergency services, post - stabilization care, or urgently needed services; Payme nt for any other health services furnished by a provider (other than the MA plan), that the enrollee believes are covered under Medicare, or if not covered under Medicare, should have been furnished, arranged for, or reimbursed by the MA plan. Refusal to authorize, provide, or pay for services, in whole or in part, including the type or level of services, which the enrollee believes should be furnished or arranged by the MA plan; Reduction, or premature discontinuation, of a previously authorized ongoing course of treatment; or Failure of the MA plan to approve, furnish, arrange for, or provide payment for health care services in a timely manner, or to provide timely notice of an adverse determination, such that a delay would adversely affect the health of the enrollee. In circumstances where there is a question whether or not the plan will cover an item or service, the enrollee, enrollee's representative, or the provider on behalf of the enrollee, has the right to request a pre -service organization determin ation (prior authorization) from the plan. Such pre - service requests to the plan (even if to an agent or contractor of the plan, such as a network provider) are requests for an organization determination and must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements. Whenever an enrollee contacts an MA plan to request a service, the request itself indicates that the enrollee believes the MA plan should provide or pay for the service. However, when a provider declines to furnish a service requested by an enrollee, this is not an organization determination because the provider is making a treatment decision (which may be based on the provider's judgment about whether the item or service should be part of the enrollee's treatment plan or whether the provider is willing to furnish the item or service, INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 26 regardless of coverage by the plan) . If the enrollee wishes to request information about coverage of the benefit, the enrollee must contact the MA plan to make a coverage request for the service in question, or the provider may make the coverage request on the enrollee's behalf. The MA plan must educate enrollees and providers that when there is a disagreement with a provider's decision to decline to furnish a service or a course of trea tment, in whole or in part, the enrollee has a right to request and receive an organization determination from the MA plan about whether coverage of the benefit would be provided; such determination about coverage would likely address if the item or servic e is medically necessary . Further, enrollees have the right to seek treatment from other providers (such as from another provider in the network). 40.2 - Part D Coverage Determinations A coverage determination is any determination made by the Part D plan sponsor , or its delegated entity, with respect to the following : A decision about whether to provide or pay for a drug that an enrollee believes may be covered by the plan sponsor, including a decision related to a Part D drug that is: o not on the plan's formulary; o determined not to be m edically necessary; o furnished by an out -of-network pharmacy; or o otherwise excluded under \u00a71862(a) of the Act if applied to Medicare Part D . A decision on the amount of cost sharing for a drug; Failure to provide a coverage determination in a timely manner, when a delay would adversely affect the health of the enrollee (see 40.11 for more information ); Whether an enrollee has, or has not, satisfied a prior authorization or other utilization management requi rement; A decision about a tiering exception request under 42 CFR \u00a7423.578(a); or A decision about a formulary exception request under 42 CFR \u00a7423.578(b) . Note: A plan sponsor is not required to treat the presentation of a prescription at the pharmacy as a request for a coverage determination. Accordingly, the plan sponsor is not required to provide the enrollee with a written denial notice at the pharmacy as a result of the transaction. However, as required under 42 CFR \u00a7423.562(a)(3), plan sponsor s must arrange with their network pharmacies to distribute the standardized pharmacy notice developed by CMS to notify enrollees of their right to request a coverage determination. See \u00a740.12.3 for information about required notification at the point of sale . INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 27 40.3 - Part D At -Risk Determinat ions An at -risk determination is a decision made under a plan sponsor's drug management program under the rules at 42 CFR \u00a7423.153(f) that involves: Identification of an individual as an at- risk enrollee for prescription drug abuse; A limitation, or the continuation of a limitation, on access to coverage for f requently abused drugs (i.e., an enrollee specific point -of-sale (POS) edit or the selection of a prescriber and/or pharmacy for purposes of lock -in); or Information sharing for subsequent Part D plan enrollments. An at -risk determination is subject to the existing Part D benefit appeals process and timeframes as described in this section of the manual. If an enrollee disagrees with an at -risk determination made under a plan sponsor 's drug management program, the enrollee has the right to request a redetermination and potentially higher levels of appeal. Also, if on redetermination the plan sponsor affirms, in whole or in part, its decision related to an at -risk determination, the Part D plan sponsor must forward the case to the IRE contracted with CMS within 24 hours . See \u00a7 423.590(i). For additional information and requirements on the drug management programs that a plan sponsor may u tilize, see the Improving Drug Utilization Review Controls page on the Part D web site. 40.4 - Prior Authorization and Other Utilization Management Requirements When a plan processes a coverage request that involves a prior authorization (PA) or other utilization management (UM) requirement, such as step therapy for Part B drugs , the plan 's determination on whether to grant approval of a service or a drug for an enrollee constitutes a n initial determination and is subject to appeal. In addition, if a plan denies coverage of a service or a drug because the enrollee failed to seek PA or failed to comply with similar limits on coverage, the denial also constitutes a n initial determination and is subject to appeal .1 Partially adverse determinations include coverage decisions in which the MA plan approves a PA request at a reduced level (or approves an altogether different item or service) than the item or service requested. Thus, the adjudication timeframe, notice, and other requirements applicable to coverage determinations or organization determinations under Parts 422, subpart M & 423, subpart M apply to requests that involve a PA or other UM requirement in the same manner that they apply to all coverage requests. If an e nrollee requests coverage of a service, item , or drug that involve s PA, the plan must accept and process the request as a cove rage determination or organization determination and should contact the physician or prescriber for information needed 1 For Part D, this denial would occur after an enrollee has formally requested a coverage determination with a Part D plan sponsor because, as indicated in \u00a740.2 above, the presentation of a prescription at the pharmacy counter is not considered a request for a coverage determination unless a plan sponsor chooses to treat it as such. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 28 to satisfy the PA , in accordance with the outreach guidance at \u00a710.6 . Plans, however, should not use peer -to-peer discussions to solicit substantive modification to pending PA requests in order to improve likelihood for approval (e.g. a peer -to-peer discussion suggesting the physician or prescriber modify a pending PA reques t to a lower level of service in order to receive plan approval ). Coverage and medical necessity decisions are initial determinations subject to notification and appeal requirements. MA plans may not interfere with an enrollee's right to receive a request ed initial determination or obstruct the enrollee's access to the appeal process by any means. Part D Only The decision to place a medication on a PA list or subject it to a UM requirement is not a coverage determination and is not subject to appeal. Howe ver, an enrollee may request that the Part D plan sponsor waive the PA or UM requirement, which would be treated as an exception request. Plan sponsors must determine whether a request that involves PA or other UM requirement is either a coverage determination (or redetermination) request where an enrollee is attempting to satisfy a PA requirement, or an exception request where the enrollee is asking the plan sponsor to waive a PA requirement. If the plan sponsor does appropriate outreach and is still unab le to determine if the enrollee/prescriber is asking for an exception to the PA criteria (meaning the person was unresponsive to the request), the case should be treated as an attempt to satisfy the PA criteria. Attempting to Satisfy a PA or other UM Requ irement A case where an enrollee/physician/other prescriber is attempting to satisfy a PA requirement (i.e., the enrollee/physician/other prescriber is aware that a PA requirement for the prescription drug exists and, for example, submits a PA form to the plan sponsor in an attempt to satisfy the PA requirement) should be processed as a coverage determination. The plan sponsor must notify the enrollee (and the prescribing physician or other prescriber involved, as appropriate) of its decision no later tha n 24 hours after receiving the request for expedited cases, or no later than 72 hours after receiving the request for standard cases. Where an enrollee/physician/other prescriber is attempting to satisfy a PA requirement and the plan sponsor has a PA form available for seeking prior authorization for the requested drug, the plan sponsor should promptly provide the physician or other prescriber with the PA form. A n enrollee, physician, or other prescriber may use the model Medicare Part D Coverage Determination Request Form to request an override to a PA or other UM requirement. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 29 Asking a Plan Sponsor to Waive a PA or other UM Requirement Where an enrollee or an enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber is asking a plan sponsor to waive a PA or other UM requirement (e.g., a physician or other prescriber indicates that an enrollee would suffer adverse effects if he or she were required to satisfy the PA requirement), he or she is asking for an exception and the prescribing physician or other prescriber must submit a statement to support the request consistent with the requirements set forth in 42 CFR \u00a7423.578(b)(5) . A physician or other prescriber may use the model Medicare Part D Coverage Determination Request Form to request an exception and/or submit a supporting statement. If the request or supporting statement is made in writing, plan sponsors are prohibited from requiring a physician or other prescriber to submit the request or supporti ng statement on a specific form. If the exception request involves benefits not yet received , the plan sponsor must notify the enrollee (and the prescribing physician or other prescriber involved, as appropriate) of its decision no later than 24 hours aft er receiving the physician's or other prescriber's supporting statement for expedited cases, or no later than 72 hours after receiving the physician's or other prescriber's supporting statement for standard cases. Under \u00a7 423.568(b), (effective January 1, 2020), plans may toll (i.e., not begin) the timeframe by up to 14 calendar days after receipt of the request to receive the supporting statement (see \u00a740.5.4). If the exception request involves reimbursement for benefits already received, the plan sponsor must notify the enrollee (and the prescribing physician or other prescriber involved, as appropriate) of its decision (and make payment when appropriate) no later than 14 calendar days after receiving the request . 40.5 - Part D Exceptions Coverage determinatio ns include a plan sponsor 's decision on an enrollee's exception request, which can be a request for an exception to the plan sponsor 's tiered cost- sharing structure , or formulary or utilization management requirement. An exception request may include a request for benefits, a request for payment, or both. 40.5.1 - Tiering Exceptions If a plan sponsor uses a tiered cost -sharing structure to manage its drug benefits, it must establish and maintain reasonable and complete exceptions procedures that permit enrollees to obtain a non-preferred drug in a higher cost -sharing tier at the more favorable cost -sharing terms applicable to alternative drugs in a lower cost -sharing tier. Plans are permitted to limit the availability of tiering exceptions to applicable cost- sharing tiers containing the same type of alternative drug(s) for treating the enrollee's condition. Specifically, the following limitations may be applied by the plan: Brand name drugs are eligible for tiering exceptions to the lowest applicable cost -sharing associated with brand name alternatives. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 30 Biological products are eligible for tiering exceptions to the lowest applicable cost -sharing associated with biological alte rnatives. Non- preferred generic drugs are eligible for tiering exceptions to the lowest applicable cost sharing associated with alternatives that are either brand or generic drugs. Plans are not required to offer tiering exceptions for brand name drugs or biological products at the cost -sharing level of alternative drugs, where the alternatives include only generic or authorized generic drugs. If a plan maintains one or two specialty tiers, as defined in 42 CFR \u00a7 423.104, the plan may design its exception process so that Part D drugs on the specialty tier(s) are not eligible for tiering exception(s) to non- specialty tiers. However, plans with two specialty tiers must permit tiering exception requests for drugs on the higher cost -sharing specialty tier to the lower cost - sharing specialty tier . 40.5.2 - Formulary Exceptions Formulary exceptions include requests for non -formulary drugs, as well as requests to have a PA or other UM requirement waived for that enrollee. Drugs that otherwise would n ot be covered (for example, because they are obtained out of network or excluded under \u00a71862(a) of the Act), are not considered exceptions though these coverage determination types can be appealed through the appeals process. A coverage determination can be requested for Non -Part D and Excluded Drugs as described in \u00a730.1.1 of this chapter. Unlike under the tiering exceptions process, the regula tions do not specify what level of cost sharing applies when an exception is approved under the formulary exceptions process. Instead, a plan sponsor has the flexibility to determine what level of cost sharing will apply for non - formulary drugs approved u nder the exceptions process. However, a plan sponsor is limited to choosing a single cost -sharing level that applies to one of its existing formulary tiers. Plans may also elect to apply a second less expensive level of cost sharing for approved formular y exceptions for generic drugs, so long as the second level of cost sharing is associated with an existing formulary tier and is uniformly applied to all approved formulary exceptions fo r generic drugs. Note: Under 42 CFR \u00a7 423.578(c)(4)(iii), an enrolle e is prohibited from requesting a tiering exception for a non -formulary drug approved under the formulary exception process. If an enrollee requests a tiering exception for an approved non- formulary drug, the request is invalid and is dismissed by the plan. See the dismissal guidance at section 40.15. However, a drug that is subject to a UM requirement is a formulary drug (i.e., a UM requirement placed on a formulary drug does not make that drug a non- formulary drug). Therefore, an enrollee who requests a UM exception and receives an approval, may also request a tiering exception for the same formulary drug. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 31 40.5.3 - Supporting Statements for Exception Requests The physician's or other prescriber's supporting statement is any statement, verbal or written, that indicates the drug is medically necessary. The statement does not have to be complete with all required information for it to be considered received and for the timeframe to start. The adjudication timeframes for processing exception requests are the same timeframes for other coverage determinations under Part D (see \u00a740.10). However, when a benefit request must be resolved under the exceptions process, the adjudication timeframe may be tolled pending receipt of the prescriber's suppor ting statement (see 42 CFR \u00a7423.568(b), 423.570(d)(1) , and 423.572(a) ). CMS has developed a model Request for Additional Information form that plan sponsors may use to request a supporting sta tement and/or additional information. If upon receiving the supporting statement the plan sponsor still needs additional information, the plan sponsor must obtain the additional information, make its decision, and n otify the enrollee and/or physician or other prescriber, as appropriate, within the following timeframes after receiving the initial written supporting statement (i.e., the timeframe may not be tolled if the plan sponsor asks for additional information after it has received a written supporting statement ): 24 hours for expedited requests for benefits; 72 hours for standard requests for benefits; or 14 calendar days for reimbursement requests. If the physician or other prescriber provides a verbal supporting statement, and the plan sponsor determines that the verbal statement does not sufficiently demonstrate the medical necessity of the requested drug, the plan sponsor may require the physician or other prescriber to subsequently provide a written supporting statement. If the plan sponsor requires a written statement, it must immediately contact the enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber (or the enrollee and the enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber) and request the supporting st atement. The request must explicitly state that the physician or other prescriber is required to indicate factors (1) and/or (2) for tiering exceptions , or (1), (2), and/or (3) for formulary exceptions discussed below , as applicable, in the written supporting statement. The plan sponsor may also request additional supporting medical documentation as part of the written supporting statement. If the plan sponsor requires additional medical documentation, it must clearl y identify the type of information that must be submitted. Criteria for Tiering Exceptions The prescriber's supporting statement must indicate that the drug(s) in the applicable lower cost - sharing tier(s) for the treatment of the enrollee's condition wou ld: (1) Not be as effective as the requested drug; and/or (2) Have adverse effects. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 32 If the physician provides a supporting statement indicating factors (1) and/or (2), but the plan sponsor believes it needs additional information to support one of those fa ctors, the plan sponsor must obtain the additional information. Criteria for Formulary Exceptions The prescriber's supporting statement must indicate that the requested drug is medically necessary for one of the following reasons: (1) All covered Part D drugs on any tier of the plan's formulary would not be as effective for the enrollee as the requested non -formulary drug, and/or would have adverse effects; (2) The number of doses available under a dose restriction for the requested drug: a. Has been ineffective in the t reatment of the enrollee's disease or medical condition; or b. Based on both sound clinical evidence and medical and scientific evidence, the known relevant physical or mental characteristics of the enrollee, and known characteristics of the drug regimen, is likely to be ineffective or adversely affect the drug's effectiveness or patient compliance; or (3) The prescription drug alternative(s) listed on the formulary or required to be used in accordance with step therapy requirements: a. Has been ineffective in the tr eatment of the enrollee's disease or medical condition or, based on both sound clinical evidence and medical and scientific evidence, the known relevant physical or mental characteristics of the enrollee, and known characteristics of the drug regimen, is likely to be ineffective or adversely affect the drug's effectiveness or patient compliance; or b. Has caused or, based on sound clinical evidence and medical and scientific evidence, is likely to cause an adverse reaction or other harm to the enrollee. If the physician provides a supporting statement indicating factors (1), (2), and/or (3), but the plan sponsor believes it needs additional information to support one of those factors, the plan sponsor must obtain the additional information. 40.5.4 - Adjudication Timeframe s for Coverage Determinations Involving an Exception The adjudication timeframe s for exception request s are the same as the timeframes for other coverage determination requests. However, if the exception request involves benefits no t yet received , the start of the timeframe may be tolled (i.e., not begin) until the plan sponsor receives the prescriber's supporting statement , as described in more detail below. If the exception request is received without a supporting statement and th e plan sponsor does not have sufficient INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 33 information to approve, for example, through claims history or information contained in a previously adjudicated exception, the plan sponsor must conduct outreach to obtain it. See \u00a710.6 for additional information regarding outreach guidelines . Tolling the start of the adjudication timeframe is only permissible when ALL of the following are true: The request is at the coverage determination level; and The request involves an exception; and The prescriber has not provided a supporting statement; and It involves a request for benefits (not reimbursement). The plan must notify the enrollee (and the prescribing physician or other prescriber involved, as appropriate) of its decision no later than 72 hours (or 24 hours in the case of an expedited decision) after receipt of the prescriber's supporting statement or 14 calendar days after receipt of the request, whichever occurs first (see 42 CFR \u00a7423.568(b) and 423.570( d)(1) ). If the supporting statement is not received by the end of the 14 calendar days, then the plan sponsor must notify the enrollee (and prescriber, as appropriate) of its decision no later than 72 hours (24 for expedited cases) from the end of the 14 calendar days from receipt of the exception request. 40.5.5 - Approval of an Exception Request Type of Approval Plan Requirement Granting an Exception A plan sponsor must grant an exception when it determines that t he applicable criteria have been met. Once an exception is granted, the plan sponsor is prohibited from requiring the enrollee to request approval for a refill or new prescription to continue using the Part D prescription drug approved under the exceptions process for the remainder of the plan year, so long as: the enrollee remains enrolled in the plan; the physician or other prescriber continues to prescribe the drug; and the drug continues to be safe for treating the enrollee's condition. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 34 Type of Approval Plan Requirement Continuation of Coverage Under an Approved Exception A plan sponsor may choose not to require an enrollee to resubmit an exception request at the beginning of a new plan year. Whether or not a plan sponsor decides to allow coverage under an approved exception to continue into the subsequent plan year for a renewing enrollee the plan sponsor must send a written notice to the enrollee at least 60 days prior to the end of the plan year, unless : The plan sponsor sent an approval letter to the enrollee when it granted the exception at the coverage deter mination or redetermination level which clearly identified the date that coverage will end in the approval letter; or The plan sponsor sent written notice to the enrollee when it effectuated a reversal of its adverse coverage determination or redetermination decision by the IRE or other appeal entity, and clearly identified the date that coverage will end in the notice . Such notice is not the decision letter overturning the initial adverse determination, but is a notice explaining the terms of the approval as ordered by the IRE or other appeal adjudicator. Note: The regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7423.578(f) affirma tively state that nothing in \u00a7423.578 should be construed to mean that the prescriber's supporting statement will result in an automatic favorable determination. If a plan sponsor is required to send a written notice to the enrollee at least 60 days prior to the end of the plan year or the date coverage ends, the notice must: Explain that the exception will not be extended, Provide the date that coverage will end (e.g., on December 31, 2018), Explain the right to request a new exception once the current exception expires, and Provide instruct ions for making a new exceptions request. Plan sponsor s are prohibited from assigning drugs approved un der the exceptions process to a designated tier, co -payment, or other cost -sharing requirement that does not otherwise exist on the plan sponsor 's approved formulary . Additionally, drugs approved under the exceptions process must be authorized or effectuated without the plan sponsor placing additional edits on the request (e.g., the plan sponsor cannot place an unapproved quantity limit or duration limit on the approved drug). Note : For more information regarding formulary changes , such as removal of a drug from the formulary or changing its cost-sharing status , see Chapter 6 of the Prescription Drug INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 35 Benefit Manual . 40.5.6 - A pproval of a Tiering Exception Request A plan must grant a tiering exception when it determines that factors (1) and/or (2) discussed in \u00a740.5.3 have been met. The regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7 423.578(f) state that nothing in the regulations should be construed to mean that the physician's or other prescriber's supporting statement will result in an automatic favorable determination. When a tiering exception is approved, the plan sponsor must provide coverage for the drug in the higher cost -sharing tier at the cost -sharing level that applies to the drug in the lowest applicable tier when preferred alternatives sit on multiple lower tiers. The cost- sharing must be at the most favorable cost - sharing tier that contains applicable alternative drugs, unless such alternative drugs are not applicable pursuant to the limitations set forth at \u00a7 423.578(a)(6 ). 40.6 - Who May Request a n Initial Determination Enrollees or their representatives may make a request for all types of decisions about coverage under both Part C and Part D. Other parties that may request an initial determination include: Type of Request Who May Request Part C , Standard Pre-Service Request Contract or non -contract provider /physician that furnishes, or intends to furnish, services to the enrollee. Staff of said provider's/ physician's office acting on said physician's behalf (e.g., request is on said physician's letterhead or otherwise indicates staff is working under the direction of the provider ). Part C, Expedited Request A physician or staff of said physician's office acting on said physician's behalf (e.g., request is on said physician's letterhead) . Part C, Payment Request Contract or non -contract providers . Part D, Standard or Expedited Request An enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber . Staff of said prescriber's office acting on said prescriber's behalf (e.g., request is on said prescriber's letterhead or comes from the prescriber office fax machine). Part D , Payment Request For direct member reimbursemen t, only an enrollee or an enrollee's representative (which may be the prescribing physician or other prescriber) may request reimbursement under Part D .

It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 36 40.7 - Guidelines for Accepting Initial Determination Requests Plans must have processes in place for receipt and documentation of initial determination requests, as described below. Filing Method Plan Requirement Verbal Establish and maintain a process for categorizing and documenting verbal requests . Retain documentation of a verbal request in the case file. If the plan does not accept verbal requests for payment , the plan must explain the procedures the enrollee must fo llow for filing a written request. Written Must accept any written request. The plan is prohibited from requiring request s to be on a specific form. Retain documentation in the case file. The plan or other entity may develop a pre -service, benefit , and/or payment request form (for optional use) . Part D Only: Requests may be made on CMS' Model Cov erage Determination Request Form . Part D plan sponsors may encourage enrollees to include copies of their prescription s with their reimbursement requests, but cannot require it. Plan sponsor s must provide immediate access to the coverage determination process via their internet website. The mechanism used to accept coverage determination requests via a website is subject to the same privacy and security safeguards as the rest of the plan sponsor 's operations in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7423.136. If, upon r eceipt of a coverage request, a plan does not have enough information to make a coverage decision, it must make reasonable and diligent efforts to obtain the necessary information. For additional information see \u00a710.6. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 37 40.8 - How to Process Requests for Expedited Initial Determinations Who May Request an Expedited Determination Plan Requirements An enrollee Establish an efficient and convenient means for individuals to submit verbal or written requests; An enrollee's representative Establish procedures for accepting and processing verbal and written requests for an expedited decision; Develop a process for receiving the request, including designating an office and/or department to receive both verbal or written requests and Part C : Any a telephone and fax number to facilitate receipt of the requests; physician Document all verbal requests and maintain in the case file; Decide whether to expedite the request: Part D : Prescribing physician or other prescriber If a request is made by an enrollee, the plan must expedite the request if it determines that applying the standard timeframe could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function. If a request is made or supported by a physician, prescribing physician , or other prescriber who indicates applying the standard timeframe could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function (the physician does not have to use these exact words), the plan must process as expedited. If a request involves both a payment request and pre -service or pre-benefit request, the enrollee has a right to ask for an expedited initial determination for the pre -service or pre -benefit request. Plans may, but are not required to, ex pedite payment requests. Note: A plan must not take or threaten any punitive action against a physician who acts on behalf or in support of a request for expedited determination. Action Following Denial of a Request for an Expedited Initial Determinati on Following denial of a request for an expedited initial determination, plans must: Transfer the request to the standard initial determination process; Give the enrollee prompt verbal notice of the denial to expedite the request ; and Deliver a written notice within 3 calendar days of the verbal notice of the denial to INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 38 expedite the request. See \u00a740.12 for notification requirements . Action Following Acceptance of a Request for Expedited Initial D eterminations If a plan grants a request for expedited determination, the initial determination must be made in accordance with the following: Part C Only Decision Processing Requirements for Expedited Determinations Favorable Provide verbal or written notification * of favorable decision to the enrollee (and the physician involved, as appropriate) as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than : o 72 hours after receiving the request for items and services o 24 hours after receiving the request for Part B drugs. If the MA plan initially provides verbal notification of its decision, it may deliver written confirmation of its decision within 3 calendar days of the verbal notification. Partially Favorable or Adverse Provide written notification * to the enrollee of the decision (and the physician involved, as appropriate) as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than : o 72 hours after receiving the request for items and services . o 24 hours after receiving the request for Part B drugs. If the MA plan initially provides verbal notification of its decision, it must deliver written confirmation of its decision within 3 calendar days of the verbal notification. *See \u00a740.12.1 for notifi cation requirements. Extension of Timeframe for Items and Services The MA plan may only extend the 7 2-hour timeframe for items and services up to 14 additional days if: The enrollee requests the extension; or The extension is justified , in the enrollee's interest, and additional medical evidence from a non- contract provider is needed in order to make a decision favorable to the enrollee (i.e., the MA plan should not extend the timeframe to get evidence to deny the coverage request ); or INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 39 The extension is justified due to extraordinary, exigent or other non -routine circumstances and is in the enrollee's interest. When the MA plan extends the timeframe, it must notify the enrollee in writing of the reasons for the delay and inform the enrollee of the right to file an expedited grievance if they disagree with the MA plan's decision to grant an extension. Note: MA p lans are expected to have sufficient and appropriate contract terms to get information and records from con tract providers as necessary for expedited (and standard) organization determinations. MA p lans should not generally or regularly extend the timeframe for an expedited organization determination to seek information or records from a contract provider but may do so if it is justified in the enrollee's interest and due to extraordinary, exigent , or ot her non -routine circumstances. If the MA plan needs information from a non -contract provider, the MA plan must request the necessary information from the non -contract provider within 24 hours of the initial request for an expedited organization determination (See 42 CFR \u00a7422 .572 and \u00a710.6 regarding Outreach for Additional Information). Regardless of whether the MA plan needs information from non- contrac t providers, the MA plan is responsible for meeting the timeframe and notice requirements for expedited determinations. Part B drug timeframes cannot be extended. Part D Only Decision Processing Requirements for Expedited Determinations Favorable or Adverse (including requests that involve an exception) The Part D p lan sponsor must make the decision and deliver to the enrollee (and the prescribing physician or other prescriber involved, as appropriate) written notice* of its decision as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 24 hours after receiving the request or, for exceptions, receipt of the physician's or other prescriber's supporting statement. If the plan sponsor initially provides verbal notification of its decision, it must deliver written confirmation of its decision within 3 calendar days of the verbal notification. A plan sponsor may not extend the timeframe by dispensing a temporary supply of the requested medica tion. For example, if a plan sponsor receives a request outside of its normal business hours, it cannot approve a 72- hour supply of the requested medication and defer issuing a decision for 72 hours. *See \u00a740.12.3 for notification requirements. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 40 Parts C & D Change of Review Priority After a request is initiated as a standard or expedited review, a provider may contact the plan to change the review pri ority. If the provider indicates that the enrollee's health requires an expedited decision, the plan must begin the applicable expedited review period at the time they receive the physician's request to expedite the decision . Note: A change of priority does not allow for extra review time. If the remaining standard review period is less than the applicable expedited review period, the original standard deadline still applies. 40.9 - Who Must Review an Initial Determination If a plan initially reviews a request and expects to issue a partially or fully adverse decision based on medical necessity, the review must be completed by a physician , as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act, or other appropriate healthcare professional who has: Sufficie nt medical and other expertise; Knowledge of the Medicare coverage criteria; and A current and unrestricted license to practice within the scope of his or her profession in a State, Territory, Commonwealth of the United States (that is, Puerto Rico), or the District of Columbia. Part C Only The reviewer must apply the prudent layperson standard (as described in 42 CFR \u00a7422.113(b)(1)) when making determinations regarding emergency services. Part D Only A pharmacist would generally be considered an appropriate health care professional for purposes of meeting this requirement. In general, the application of a clear statutory or contract exclusion set forth in the plan sponsor 's Evidence of Coverage, does not constitute a decision based on the lack of medical necessity. Conversely, an adverse decision based on a determination that the clinical documentation supporting the coverage request is unavailable or insufficient (i.e., there is unmet criteria) is generally considered a denial based on the lack of medical necessity. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 41 40.10 - Processing Timeframes Plans must have processes in place to accept coverage requests 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (including holidays) and to notify enrollees of coverage decisions within the applicable timeframe. For information regarding when a request is consi dered received, please see \u00a710.5.2 . Part B & C Type Processing Timeframe With Extension * Part C Pre-Service 14 calendar days 28 days Part B Drug 72 hours N/A Part B & C Payment : Clean Claims 30 days ** N/A Part B & C Payment: Other Claims 60 days ** N/A Part C Pre-Service: Expedited 72 hours 17 days Part B Drug : Expedited 24 hours N/A *14-day extension if the enrollee requests the extension or if the MA plan justifies a need for additional information and documents how the delay is in the best interest of the enrollee . MA p lan must notify enrollee in writing if extension is going to be taken and explain the reason for the delay. Note: Part B drug and payment timeframes cannot be extended. See: 42 CFR \u00a7422.568(b)(1) and (2). **Non -contract providers and enrollees : The MA plan must pay 95 percent of clean claims within 30 calendar days of the request. All other claims submitted by non-contract providers or enrollees must be paid or denied within 60 calendar days from the date of the request. For additional guidance, see 42 CFR \u00a7422.520. Contract providers : The timeframe for processing payment requests is based on the contract terms between the MA plan and the provider. For additional guidance, see 42 CFR \u00a7422.520. Part D Type Processing Timeframe Standard 72 hours* Expedited 24 hours* Payment ** 14 calendar days *Or no later than 24/72 hours after receiving the physician's or other prescriber's supporting statement if the request involves an exception (see \u00a740.5.4 of this guidance for timeframes and additional information regarding exception INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 42 requests ). **Includes claims submitted by physicians, prescribers , and enrollees. A Part D plan sponsor may not extend the applicable adjudication timeframe by dispensing a temporary supply of the requested medication. For example, if a plan sponsor receives a request outside of its normal business hours, it cannot approve a 72- hour supply of the requested medication and defer issuing a decision for 72 hours; the plan sponsor must make its determination within the applicable timeframe. 40.11 - Effect of Failure to Meet the Timeframe for an Initial Determination Part C Only The MA plan must explain in its annual Evidence of Coverage (EOC) that enrollees have the right to a level 1 appeal if the MA plan fails to provide timely notice of a decision. If a plan fails to provide the enrollee with a timely notice of its decision, this failure constitutes an adverse decision. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 43 Part D Only If the Part D plan sponsor does not provide the enrollee notice of its coverage determination within the required timeframe, this constitutes an adverse decision and the plan sponsor must forward the complete case file to the IRE within 24 hours of the expiration of the adjudication timeframe. The case file must contain the enrollee's request and any verbal and/or written evidence obtained by the plan sponsor. Refer to \u00a750.12.3 to determine how to prepare the case file for the IRE and what documents/items to send with the case file . Although the plan sponsor failed to provide notice of a decision within the required timeframe, the plan sponsor is not required to send the adverse decision notice, but instead, must notify the enrollee that the decision was not made timely and is being f orwarded to the IRE for review. The plan sponsor should send the notification to the enrollee within 24 hours of the expiration of the adjudication timeframe. Please see \u00a740.12.2 for enrollee notification requirements . Note: Because the adjudication timeframe for an exception request involving a request for benefits does not begin until the plan sponsor receives the physician's or other prescriber's supporting statement as indicated in \u00a740.5.4, plan sponsors must not a utomatically forward case files to the IRE if a supporting statement is not received . When a plan sponsor makes a fully favorable decision on a coverage determination in less than 24 hours after the end of the adj udication timeframe, the plan sponsor should consider effectuating and notifying the enrollee of the favorable decision (within the 24-hour period the case must be forwarded to the IRE) in lieu of forwarding the case to the IRE. If CMS determines that the plan sponsor has a pattern of not issuing timely decisions or not forwarding the enrollee's request to the IRE for review within the required timeframe, the plan sponsor may be considered to be out of compliance with the terms of its Part D contract and/o r subject to intermediate sanctions in accordance with subpart O of 42 CFR Part 423 . Transition Period Note: Plan sponsors must ensure new enrollees receive a meaningful transition process when they have been, prior to enrollment, stabilized on a medication that is either not on the plan formulary or is subject to utilization management requirements. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 44 Two of the steps involve plan sponsors providing a temporary supply of the requested medication and sending the enrollee a written notice explaining when the supply will end and the procedures for requesting an exception. A transition process is not meaningful if an enrollee who is in the transition period files an exception request and the plan sponsor does not make a timely decision or does not forward the enrollee's request/case file to the IRE within the appropriate timeframe. Therefore, when an enrollee who is in the transi tion period files an exception request and the plan sponsor does not make its decision timely and/or fails to forward a request/case file to the IRE as required, the plan sponsor must provide the enrollee with a temporary supply of the requested prescription drug (when not medically contraindicated) until the case is resolved by the plan sponsor or the IRE issues a reconsideration decision. For more information about the Part D transition policy, see Chapter 6, \u00a730.4 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual . 40.12 - Notification Requirements for Initial Determinations Plans must provide notices for initial determinations using the most efficient manner of delivery to ensure the enrollee receives the notice in time to act. If the request was filed by the enrollee's representative, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee . Plans may provide notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. 40.12.1 - Part C Notification Requirements Pre-Service Approvals For favorable decisions o n a pre -service request, notice may be provided ve rbally or in writing to the requesting party. Verbal or written notice of a favorable decision should explain any conditions of the approval, such as the duration of the approval. As a best practice, MA plan s are encouraged to provide written notice of favorable decision s (again, including any applicable conditions/parameters of the approval) . If a provider submits the request on behalf of the enrollee, the MA plan must notify the enrollee as well as the provider of its determination. If the enrollee's representative submits a request, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans may provide notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. If the enrollee agrees, the MA plan may send the notice by fax or e- mail. Please see Medicare Marketing Guidelines regarding electronic communication with enrollees. Denials and Discontinuation/Reduction of Pr eviously Authorized Ongoing Course of Treatment A written denial notice is required to be sent to the enrollee (and physician involved, as appropriate) whenever an MA plan's determination is partially or fully adverse to the enrollee. For Part C organization determination denials, MA plans must use approved notice language INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 45 when issuing written denial notices to enrollees . The standardized denial notice is the Notice of Denial of Medical Coverage or Payment ( Form CMS -10003- NDMCP ), also known as the Integrated Denial Notice (IDN). MA plan s may use a separate written notice o f denial document, such as a plan -gene rated claims statement to the enrollee or provider, but must use the approved standard language. An example of a plan-generated statement is an Explanation of Benefits ( EOB ), detailing what the MA plan has paid on the enrollee's behalf, and/or the enrollee's liability for payment. If an MA plan uses its existing system -generated notification (i.e., EOB) regarding payment denials as its written notice of determination, the MA p lan must ensure that the EOB contains the OMB -approved language of the IDN verbatim in its entirety and meets the content requirements as described in the IDN form instructions and listed below. When issuing an EOB in place of the IDN, the MA plan must notify the enrollee via the EOB within the r equired timeframe. When providing the decision, the MA plan must also take into account the enrollee's presenting medical condition, disabilities, and special language requirements, if any (see Section 10.4.4 for additional information) . When using the s tandardized IDN, the MA plan must provide: A specific and detailed explanation of why the medical services , items or Part B drugs were denied, including a description of the applicable coverage rule or applicable plan policy (e.g., Evidence of Coverage provision) upon which the action was based , and a specific explanation about what information is needed to approve coverage must be included, if applicable; Information regarding the enrollee's right to appeal and the right to appoint a representative to file an appeal on the enrollee's behalf; For service denials, a description of both the standard and expedited appeal processes, including the specific department or address for reconsideration requests and a description of conditions for obtaining an expedited reconsideration, the timeframes for each, and the other elements of the appeals process; For payment denials, a description of the standard reconsideration process and timeframes, and the r est of the appeals process; The enrollee's right to submit additional evidence in writing or in person ; and An explanation of a provider's refusal to furnish an item, service, or Part B drug (if applicable) . MA plans are not required to issue an IDN if there is no enrollee liability beyond the applicable cost sharing . An EOB would be issued and indicate any applicable cost sharing. For provider notice requirements in hospital, SNF, HHA , and CO RF settings, please see \u00a7100. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 46 Enrollee and Non -contract Provider Payment Requests Requestor Payment Approval Payment Denial Enrollee or Representative Receives payment and EOB. The enrollee or representative receives an IDN or an EOB. * Document must include notice of appeal rights. Non- contract provider Provider receives payment and remittance notice (see \"Non - Contract Provider Payment Request section below). Enrollee receives EOB. Provider receives remittance notice (see \"Non -Contract Provider Payment Request section below). Enrollee receives EOB* with appeal rights. *When issuing an EOB in place of the IDN, the MA plan must notify the enrollee via the EOB within the required timeframe. An IDN is not required if there is no enrollee liability beyond the applicable cost sharing, however, an EOB would be issued and include any applicable cost sharing. Note: For approved and denied payment requests from a contracted provider, the enrollee receives an EOB. Terms of remittance for contract providers are determined by the contract between the MA plan and the provider. Non- Contract Provider Payment Requests If the MA plan approves a request for payment from a non -contract provider, the provi der receives payment and a remittance advice/notice. If the MA plan denies a request for payment from a non-contract provider, the MA plan must notify the non-contract provider of the specific reason for the denial and provide a description of the appeals process. MA p lans must deliver either a remittance advice/notice or other similar notification that states the non -contract provid er: Has the right to request a reconsideration of the MA plan's denial of payment , Must submit a Waiver of Liability form holding the enrollee harmless regardless of the outcome of the appeal. (MA p lans must include the form as an enclosure or attachment and/or provide a direct link to the form); Has 60 calendar days from the remittance notification date to request a reconsideration; Should include documentation, such as a copy of the original claim or remittance notification showing the denial, and must include any clinical records and other documentation that supports the provider's argument for reimbursement; and Return the request for reconsideration to the MA plan following the instructions provided INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 47 by the plan on where to send the request. MA p lans may not use the CMS standardized form, IDN, to notify non -contract providers of a claim denial. However, MA plans may use the IDN as a model template to develop a non - contract provider denial notice with appeal rights in accordance with the above requirements. Denial of a Request for an Expedited Organization Determination Notice of the denial of a request for an expedited organization determination must: Explain that the MA plan will automatically transfer and process the request using the required timeframe for standard requests; Inform the enrollee of the right to file an expedited grievance if he or she disagrees with the MA plan's decision not to expedite the determination (MA plans may use a Part C model notice, Notic e of Right to an Expedited Grievance ); Provide instructions about the expedited grievance process and its timeframes ; and Inform the enrollee of the right to resubmit a request for an expedited determination with a physician, prescribing physician, or other prescriber's support, including that if the enrollee gets the support indicating that applying the standard timeframe for making determinations could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function, the request will be expedited automatically. 40.12.2 - Part D Notification Requirements Approvals For favorable decisions, Part D plan sponsor s must adhere to the following notification requirements: Enrollee notification must be in writin g. If the enrollee's representative submits a request, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans may provide notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. Written notices must explain the conditions of the approval (the plan sponsor may develop its own written approval notice). The conditions of approval may include (but are not limited to): The duration of an approval; Limitations associated with an approval; and/or Any coverage rules applicable to subsequent refills. Verbal notice may initially be provided to the enrollee as long as written notice is mailed within INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 48 3 calendar days of verbal notification . If requested by an enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber on behalf of the enrollee, the plan sponsor must provide notice to the prescriber and written notice to the enrollee. If a plan sponsor successfully notifies the physician or prescriber verbal ly, the plan sponsor does not need to send a written follow -up. Denials For request s denied in whole or in part, plan sponsors must adhere to the following notification requirem ents: Enrollee notification must be in writing. If the enrollee's representative submits a request, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans ma y provide notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. If notice is delivered within required timeframe, enrollee receives Notice of Denial of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage, Form CMS -10146 (see \u00a740.12.3 for specific CMS - 10146 requirements ). Verbal notice may initially be provided to the enrollee as long as written notice is mailed within 3 calendar days of verbal notification. If the request was made by an enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescribe r on behalf of the enrollee, the plan sponsor must provide notice to the prescriber and written notice to the enrollee. If a plan sponsor successfully notifies the physician or prescriber verbal ly, the plan sponsor does not need to send a written follow -up to the physician or prescriber, but must still send written notice to the enrollee. Denial of a Request for an Expedited Review If the plan sponsor denies a request to expedite a coverage determination, it must transfer the request to the standard coverage determination process (as described in \u00a740.8), provide prompt verbal notice of the denial, and subsequently deliver (i.e. mail) written notice within 3 calendar days after provid ing verbal notice . If an enrollee has identified a representative, the plan sponsor must provide notice to the enrollee's representative instead of the enrollee. If an enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber files a request on behalf of an enrollee, the plan sponsor must notify both the prescriber and the enrollee. The enrollee must receive written notice of the decision. The verbal notice and written follow -up notice must: INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 49 Explain that the plan will automatically transfer and process the request using the 72-hour time frame for standard determinations; Inform the enrollee of the right to file an expedited grievance if he or she disagrees with the plan's decision not to expedite the determination; Inform the enrollee of the right to resubmit a request for an expedited determination and that, if the enrollee gets his or her prescribing physician's or other prescriber's support indicating that applying the standard time frame for making determinations could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function, the request will be expedited automatically; and Provide instructions about the expedited grievance process and its time frames. CMS has developed a model notice, Notice of Right to an Expedited Grievance , that Part D plan sponsors can use whenever a request to expedite is denied. Untimely Decisions If the plan sponsor fails to provide notice of a decision within the required timeframe, the plan sponsor is not required to send the adverse decision notice, but instead, the plan sponsor should notify the enrollee that the decision was not made timely and is being forwarded to the IRE for review. The notice must: Advise the enrollee of his/her right to submit additional evidence that may be pertinent to the enrollee's case, if the enrollee chooses; Direct the enrollee to submit such evidence to the independent review entity; and Include information on how to contact the independent review entity. CMS has developed a model Notice of Case Status that plan sponsors can use in lieu of the adverse decision notic e to notify enrollees whenever c ases are forwarded to the IRE. 40.12.3 - Part D Coverage Determination Notices Notification by Network Pharmacies: Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage and Your Rights When a pharmacist explains to an enrollee that a drug is not on a Part D plan's formulary, or is subject to prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitation, the transaction does not constitute a coverage determination, unless the plan sponsor treats the presentation of the prescription as a request for a coverage determination. Plan sponsor s must arrange with network or preferred pharmacies to provide enrollees with a written copy of the standardized pharmacy notice (Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage and INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 50 Your Rights , Form CMS -10147 ) when the enrollees' prescription cannot be filled under the Part D benefit and the issue cannot be resolved at the point of sale. Permissible exceptions to this requirement are detailed below. CMS expects plan sponsor s to have internal controls in place to reasonably ensure that network pharmacies are complying with this requirement and must arrange with their network pharmacies (including mail -order and specialty pharmacies) to distribute the notice to enrollees. The pharmacy notice must be delivered to the enrollee if the pharmacy receives a transaction response indicating the claim is not covered by Part D and the designated NCPDP response code is returned. The designated NCPDP response code is NOT retur ned in the following scenarios (this list is not all-inclusive) : The claim rejects only because it does not contain all necessary data elements for adjudication; The drug in question is an over the counter (OTC) drug that is not covered by the enrollee's plan ; The prescription is written by a sanctioned provider who has been excluded from participation in the Medicare program; The drug is not listed on the participating CMS Manufacturer Labeler Code List; The drug is not listed on the FDA Electronic List\u2014NDC Structured Product Labe ling Data Elements File (NSDE); The Part D plan sponsor rejects the claim for the drug in question only because of a \"refi ll too soon/early refill\" edit; The claim is rejected at POS due to a limitation on access to coverage for frequently abused drugs under a plan sponsor's drug management program (DMP), such as a POS edit that limits the quantity, dose, or specific drugs that will be covered for the patient or a prescriber or pharmacy lock -in edit. The drug in question is rejected by the Part D plan benefit, but is covered by a co - administered i nsured benefit managed by a single processor. In this scenario, the pharmacy submits a single claim transaction for the drug and the drug is covered by the co-administered insured benefit after being rejected by Part D and processed in accordance with the benefits offered by the supplemental payer. Note : If the drug is not covered by the Part D plan, but the enrollee pays for the cost of the drug pursuant to plan -sponsored negotiated pricing or a discount card program (which may provide a lower price but leaves t he enrollee responsible for 100 percent of the drug cost), a designated NCPDP response code will be returned notifying the pharmacy to deliver a copy of the pharmacy notice to the enr ollee. For Mail Order Pharmacies: INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 51 The notice should be delivered to the enrollee via the enrollee's preferred method of communication (fax, electronic, or first -class mail) as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 72 hours from the pharmacy's receipt of the original transaction response indicating the claim is not covered by Part D. For Home Infusion Pharmacies: Enrollees brough t on service by the home infusion pharmacy, the pharmacy can also choose to deliver the notice in person with delivery of home infusion drugs or through an infusion nurse, as long as the next scheduled visit is within 72 hours of the receipt of the transac tion code indicating the cla im cannot be covered by Part D. For Pharmacies Serving Long- Term Care Facilities: Given the uniqueness of the long -term care (LTC) setting, there is typically no point -of-sale encounter between the pharmacy and the enrollee (LTC resident) and, therefore, no practical means for the pharmacy to deliver the notice directly to the enrollee. In most instances where there is an issue with the prescription, CMS expects that the pharmacist will contact the prescriber or an appropriate staff person at the LTC facility to resolve the matter and ensure the resident receives the needed medication or an appropriate substitute, obviating the need to deliver the notice. If the matter cannot be resolved, the pharmacy must fax or otherwise deliver the notice to the enrollee, the enrollee's representative, prescriber , or an appropriate staff person at the LTC facility as expeditiously as the e nrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 72 hours from the pharmacy's receipt of the original transaction response indicating the claim is not covered by Part D. Note : If the enrollee is a self -pay resident and the pharmacy cannot fill the prescription under the Part D benefit, the pharmacy must, upon receipt of the transaction response, fax or otherwise deliver the notice to the enrollee, the enrollee's representative, prescriber , or an appropriate staff person at the LTC facility. After di stribution of the notice, the LTC pharmacy should continue to work with the prescriber or facility to resolve the matter and ensure the resident receives the needed medication or an appropriate substitute. For Indian Health Service, Tribe and Tribal Organ ization , and Urban Indian O rganization (I/T/U) Pharmacies: Because IHS enrollees' prescription drugs, when dispensed through I/T/U pharmacies, are filled and dispensed at no cost to the enrollee regardless of whether the drug is rejected at POS by the Part D plan, I/T/U pharmacies are exempt from the requirement to distribute the pharmacy notice. Note: This exemption applies only to I/T/U pharmacies that dispense prescriptions at no cost to the enrollee. Any network commercial pharmacy providing services to IHS -eligible Part D enrollees must distribute the notice in accordance with the requirements in th is section. Standardized Denial Notice: Notice of Denial of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 52 The Part D plan sponsor must use the approved standardized denial notice (Notice of Denial of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage, Form CMS -10146 ). The standardized denial not ice has been written in a manner that is understandable to the enrollee and provides: The specific reason for the denial that takes into account the enrollee's presenting medical condition, disabilities, and special language requirements, if any (see section 10.4.4 for additional information); A description of any applicable Medicare coverage rule or any other applicable Part D plan policy upon which the denial decision was based, including a ny specific formulary criteria that must be satisfied for approv al. If the drug could be approved under the exception rules, the denial notice must explicitly state the need for a prescriber's supporting statement and clearly identify the type of informa tion that should be submitted when seeking a formulary or tierin g exception; Information regarding the right to appoint a representative to file an appeal on the enrollee's behalf; For coverage denials, a description of both the standard and expedited redetermination processes and timeframes, including conditions for obtaining an expedited reconsideration, and the rest of the appeals process; and For payment denials, a description of the standard redetermination process and timeframes, and the rest of the appeals process. The denial rationale must be specific to each individual case and written in a manner calculated for an enrollee to understand. See the Notice of Denial of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage, along with the instructions and examples of the denial rationale for additional guidance. Plan sponsors mus t complete the applicable sections of the model Request for Redetermination of Me dicare Prescription Drug Denial form and send it to the enrollee (and physician or other prescriber when appropriate) with each adverse coverage determination notice. Enrollees are not required to use the model notice when submitting a redetermination req uest. Note: Plan sponsors that do not deliver notice within the required timeframe should not use the Notice of Denial of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage form, but should provide notice that the case has been forwarded to the IRE (plan sponsor s may use the model Notice of Case Status ). 40.13 - Procedures for Handling Misclassified Initial Deter minations If the plan misclassifies a coverage request as a grievance and later discovers the error, the plan must notify the enrollee in writing that the issue was misclassified and will be handled as a coverage request. The timeframe for processing the request begins on the date the request is INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 53 received by the plan, not the date the plan discovers its error (please see \u00a740.11 when a plan fails to meet the timeframe for processing an initial determination) . Plans are expected to audit their own coverage and grievance processes for the presence of errors and institute appropriate quality improvement projects as needed . 40.14 - Withdrawal of an Initial Determination Request A request for an initial determination be withdrawn at any time before the decision is issued. This request must come from the party who requested the initial determination. If a request to withdraw is filed with the plan, the plan will dismiss the initial determination request . The request to withdraw may be either written or verbal. See guidance related to dismissals at \u00a7 40.15. 40.15 - Dismissal of an Initial Determination Request Plans must dismiss requests for an initial determination under any of the following circumstances: The individual or entity making the request is not permitted to request an initial determination under the applicable regulation. The plan determines that the individual or entity making the request failed to make a valid request for an initial determinat ion that substantially complies with 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 422.568(a) or 423.568(a) . In addition, under Part D, an enrollee may not request a tiering exception for an approved formu lary prescription drug. See: 42 CFR \u00a7 423.578(c)(4)(iii). In this circumstance, a plan would dismiss the request and issue a dismissal notice in accordance with the notice requirements at \u00a7 40.15.1. The enrollee dies while the request is pending and the enrollee's spouse or estate has no remaining financial interest in the case and no other individual or entity with a financial interest in the case wishes to pursue the initial determination. Financial interest means having financial liability for the ite m(s) or service(s) underlying the coverage request. The individual or entity who requested the review submits a timely verbal or written request for withdrawal of their request for an initial determination with the plan. When the plan's dismissal is due to a timely withdrawal request, the plan is required to dismiss the initial determination request and issue a dismissal notice in accordance with the notice requirements at section 40.15.1 in order to preserve the rights of other proper parties to the decision who may wish to request review of the dismissal . The guidance in 40.15 does not alter reporting requirements. Withdrawn re quests and dismis sals should continue to be reported sep arately in their dis tinct categories, per existing reporting requirements. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 54 40.15.1 - Dismissal Notice If a plan dismisses an initial determination request, the plan must mail or otherwise transmit a written notice of the dismissal to the parties at their last known address by the conclusion of the applicable adjudication timeframe. The dismissal notice must state all of the following: (1) The reason for the dismissal; (2) The right to request that the plan vacate the dismissal action; and (3) The right to request review of the dismis sal. Consistent with the timeframe for requesting a timely appeal of an initial determination , a request for review of a dismissal must be filed within 60 calendar days from the date of the plan's dismissal notice. Plans may use, and modify as necessary, the model Coverage Dismissal Notice when notifying an enrollee of a dism issal. 40.15.2 - Dismissal Binding Unless Modified, Reversed or Vacated A plan's dismissal of an initial determination request is binding unless it is modified or reversed by the plan upon appeal or the dismissal is vacated for good cause . Upon receipt of a request to review a dismissal, the plan will conduct an appeal in accordance with \u00a750 of this guidance , including the applicable adjudication timeframes for redeterminations and reconsiderations . Requests for Review of a Dismissal of an Initial Determination Request If a party appeals a plan's dismissal of an initial determination request and the plan determines that its dismissal was in error, the plan reverses the dismissal and processes the request for coverage in accordance with applicable adjudication timeframes and notice requirements. See: Section 40.10. The timeframe for the initial determination begins on the date /time of the plan's decision to reverse its dismissal. If a party appeals a plan's dismissal of an initial determination request and the plan upholds its dismissal, there is no further right to appeal the dismissal to a higher -level adjudicator . However, in addition to the right to appeal a dismissal, an enrollee has the right to request that the plan vacate the dismissal action. Requests to Vacate Dismissal of an Initial Determination Request A plan may vacate its own dismissal if good cause is established within 6 months of the date of the notice of the dismissal. A plan may find good cause to vacate a dismissal if, for example, the plan determines the dismissal was issued in error because the documentation in the INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 55 administrative case file shows the reason for dismissing the request was incorrect . For examples of where good cause may exist, please see \u00a7 50.3. If a party submits a request to vacate a dismissal of a n initial determination request and the request contains sufficient evidence or other documentation that supports a finding of good cause for vacating, the plan makes a favorable good cause determination. Once the plan makes a favorable good cause determination, it vacates its prior dismissal action and performs a n initial determination consistent with the timeframes at \u00a7 40.10. Where a finding for good cause is made, the plan should document the reason for that finding in the case file. If the plan does not find good cause to vacate the dismissal, the dismissal remains in effect. The plan issues a letter (not a dismissal notice) explaining that good cause has not been established and the dismissal cannot be vacated. The plan should explain in clear language why the information submitted with the request to vacate the dismissal does not establish good cause to vacate the dismissal action. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 56 50 - Reconsiderations and Redeterminations ( Level 1 Appeals ) A party (as described below) to an adverse initial determination has a right to a reconsideration (Part C) or redetermination (Part D) by the plan. A reconsideration or redetermination (hereinafter referred to as a level 1 appeal) consists of a review of an adverse initial determination , the evidence and finding upon which it was based, and any other evidence that the parties submit or that is obtained by the plan. Part C Only The parties to an organization determination for purposes of an appeal include: The enrollee (including his or her representative); An assignee of the enrollee (i.e., a physician or other provider who has furnished a service to the enrollee and formally agrees to waive any right to payment from the enrollee for that service); The legal representative of a deceased enrollee's estate; or Any other provider or entity (other than the MA plan) determined to have an appealable interest in the proceeding. Part D Only The parties to a coverage determination include the enrollee and the enrollee's representative, if applicable. In some cases, as described in this section, the enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber is also a party. However, an enrollee's prescribing phy sician or other prescriber does not have all of the rights and responsibilities of the enrollee with respect to party status, unless the physician or other prescriber is the enrollee's representative. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 57 50.1 - Who May Request a Level 1 Appeal Part C Type of Request Who May Request An Appeal Standard Pre -Service Reconsideration An enrollee; An enrollee's representative; The enrollee's treating physician acting on behalf of the enrollee * or staff of physician's office acting on said physician's behalf (e.g., request is on said physician's letterhead or otherwise indicates staff is working under the direction of the provider ).; or Any other provider or entity (other than the MA plan) determin ed to have an appealable interest in the proceeding. Standard Payment Reconsideration An enrollee ; An enrollee's representative ; Non- contract provider (see \u00a750.1.1 for non-contract provider payment appeals) ; The legal representative of a deceased enrollee's estate; or Any other provider or entity (other than the MA plan) determined to have an appealable interest in the proceeding . Expedited Reconsideration An enrollee ; An enrollee's representative ; Any physician or staff of physician's office acting on said physician's behalf (e.g., request is on said physician's letterhead or otherwise indicates staff is working under the direction of the provider ) acting on behalf of the enrollee. *If the enrollee's records indicate that he or she has not previously visited the requesting physician, the MA plan should undertake reasonable efforts to confirm that the enrollee has received appropri ate notification of the appeal. Note : Contract providers (including subcontracted entities) do not have appeal rights under the provisions discussed in this guidance . Contract provider disputes involving plan payment denials are governed by the appeals/dispute resolution provisions in the contract between the provider and the plan. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 58 Part D Type of Request Who May Request An Appeal Standard or Expedited Redetermination An enrollee ; An enrollee's representative ; An enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber acting on behalf of the enrollee *; or Staff of a physician's office acting on a physician's behalf (e.g., request is on the office's letterhead) *If the enrollee's records indicate that he or she has not previously visited the requesting physician or prescriber, the plan sponsor should undertake reasonable efforts to confirm that the enrollee has received appropriate notification of the appeal. 50.1.1 - Requirements for Provider Claim Appeals (Part C Only) The appeal provisions set forth at 42 CFR Part 422 Subpart M and described in this guidance are designed to protect enrollee and non- contract provider rights related to gri evances, organization determinations , and appeals. A non-contract provider, on his or her own behalf, may request a reconsideration for a denied claim only if the non -contract provider completes a Waiver of Liability (WOL) statement, which provides that the non- contract provider will not bill the enrollee regardless of the outcome of the appeal ). If an appeal is submitted, the WOL must be filed with the appeal. The appeal should include other supporting documentation (e.g., copy of remittance advice/notice and clinical records claim). Non- contract p roviders who have executed a WOL are not required to complete the representative form because the provider is not representing the enrollee, and thus does not need a written representative form. Furthermore, because the enrollee no longer has an appealable interest under 42 CFR Part 422 Subpart M, plan notices/correspondence regardin g the non - contract provider's appeal would be delivered to the non -contract provider and not the enrollee. If the WOL isn't filed with the appeal, the plan should make and document reasonable efforts to obtain the WOL. The plan is not required to undertake a review of the appeal until or unless the form is obtained, but it may choose to begin the review while continuing efforts to obtain a WOL. The adjudication timeframe begins when the WOL is received by the plan. If the plan does not receive the WOL by the end of the adjudication timeframe the plan issues a dismissal notice per the dismissal procedures set forth in this guidance . See \u00a750.9. A non- contracted provider who has furnished a service to an enrollee can be a party to an organization determination, in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.574(b). Thus, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.578, a non- contracted provider may request that an organization determination be INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 59 reconsidered by the plan. Even reconsideration reques ts submitted by non- contracted providers that relate to the type or level of service furnished to the enrollee must be reviewed in accordance with the administrative appeal processes outlined in 42 C.F.R. Part 422, Subpart M. In the following examples a non- contracted provider who is the enrollee's assignee must be afforded full administrative appeals rights in accordance with 42 C.F.R. Part 422 Subpart M: Diagnosis code/DRG payment denials. A non- contracted provider submits a claim to a plan. The plan initially approves the claim, which is considered a favorable organization determination (see 42 C.F.R. 422.566(b)). The plan later reopens and revises the favorable organization determination and denies the DRG code on the basis that a different DRG code should have been submitted and recoups funds. Downcoding. A plan approves coverage for inpatient services from a non- contracted provider , which is considered a favorable organization determination (see 42 C.F.R. 422.566(b)). The plan later reopens and revises the favorable organization determination (e.g., retrospective review) and determines the enrollee should have received outpatient services. Bundling issues and disputed rate of payment. Pre -and post -pay bundling and global payment determin ations. For example, denial of procedure codes --as mutually exclusive to another paid procedure code, or due to inclusion in a previously paid global surgical package. Level of care or rate of payment denials. Payment of a reduced fee schedule amount for a course of treatment. For example, a provider bills a procedure code for a visit but the plan reimburses based on a lower level of care. Further, even if the plan partially pays for coverage (i.e., denies coverage as requested but approves or pays for part of the service), a non-contracted provider who according to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7422.574(b) is a party to the organization determination may request reconsideration under the Medicare administrative appeals process; a non- contracted provider does not need to receive zero payment to request a reconsideration or to otherwise access the Subpart M appeals process. Note : Providers can use electronic signatures on WOL documenta tion when it is submitted through the plan's secure portal, provided the portal meets all applicable regulatory and CMS website requirements. 50.2 - Level 1 Appeal Requests A party may request a level 1 appeal by filing a written request with the plan. Plans must accept verbal requests for expedited appeals and may accept verbal requests for standard appeals. 50.2.1 - Guidelines for Accepting Level 1 Appeal Requests INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 60 Metho d for Filing Request Standard Expedited Written Must Accept Must Accept Verbal May Accept Note: In the event that a plan does not accept a verbal request, the plan must explain to the party how to file a written request. Must Accept Note : If a verbal request to expedite a level 1 appeal is denied by the plan, the plan cannot require the party to re - file the request in writing. Instead, the plan must automatically transfer the request to the standard process. If a plan does accept verbal requests (standard or expedited) , the plan's policy should include repeating the summarized request back to the caller . Failure to take steps to ensure that verbal requests are properly and accurately handled may result in CMS determining that the MA plan has inadequate policies and procedures under \u00a7\u00a7422.562, 422.582, 423.562, and 423.582. For Part C plans, an acknowledgement letter should be sent to enrollee (in lieu of or in addition to repeating the request verbally) to confirm the facts and basis of the appeal and that the reconsideration request is properly and accurately noted and addressed by the MA plan. Notice should advise the enrollee to immediately contact the plan if the acknowledgement letter does not correctly capture the enrollee's request. Part C Only MA plans may, but are not required, to accept web/internet requests. Part D Only Part D plan sponsors must accept web/ internet -based requests and protect individual health information received via the web/internet. See requirements at \u00a7423.128(b)(7)(ii), and \u00a7423.136. For both standard and expedited level 1 appeal requests, the following guidelines apply: Must be filed within 60 cal endar days from the date of the notice of the initial determination. For requests received after the 60 -day filing timeframe, please see \u00a750.3 regarding good cause exceptions for late filing. Request should include: Name of the enrollee, information identifying which denial is being appealed, and contact information for the appellant. Unless the request is from a representative, for which proof of appointment is required (see \u00a720.2), plans cannot INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 61 require additional information in a request (e.g., appellant signature). The appellant is not required to use any specific language to indicate they are requesting an appeal (e.g., \"I am requesting an appeal\"). The appellant may say, f or example, \"I do not agree with your decision\" or \"Please review this decision\". Requests for appeals should not be classified as requests for a reopening (see \u00a780 for guidance regarding reopenings ). For verbal requests , plans should repeat the summarized verbal request back to the caller and/or send an acknowledgement letter to enrollee to confirm the facts and basis of the appeal to ensure the request is properly and accurately noted and addressed by the plan. Notice should advise the enrollee to immediately contact the plan if the acknowledgement letter does not correctly capture the enrollee's request. For standard requests, t he processing timeframe begins when the plan, any unit in the plan, or a delegated entity (i ncluding those not responsible for processing the request) receives a request. If an appeal request is received in the incorrect department, the plan must have polices for prompt transfer of the call or document(s) to the appropriate department that handle s appeals. For expedited requests, the processing timeframe begins when the appropriate department receives the request. 50.2.2 - How to Process Requests for Expedited Level 1 Appeals Who May Request an Expedited Level 1 Appeal Plan Requirements An enrollee An enrollee's representative Part C -A physician (regardless of whether affiliated with the plan) Part D - Prescribing physician or other prescriber acting on behalf of the enrollee Establish an efficient and convenient m eans for individuals to submit verbal or written requests; Establish procedure s for accepting and processing verbal and written requests for an expedited decision; Develop a process for receiving the request, including designating an office and/or department to receive both verbal or written requests and a telephone and fax number to facilitate receipt of the requests; Document all verbal requests in writing and maintain in the case file; Decide whether to expedite the request: o If a physician (Part C) /prescribing physician or other prescriber (Part D ) makes a request or supports a n enrollee's request for an expedited INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 62 Who May Request an Expedited Level 1 Appeal Plan Requirements appeal and indicates that applying the standard timeframe could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enr ollee's ability to regain maximum function (the physician does not have to use these exact words), the plan must process as expedited. o Plans may, but are not required to , expedite appeals for payment requests for drugs or services already furnished . Requests for an expedited level 1 appeal must be received within 60 days unless there is good cause (see \u00a750.3). Note: A plan must not take or threaten any punitive action against a physician who acts on behalf or in support of a request for an expedited level 1 appeal . Part C Only If an enrollee misses the deadline to file for immediate BFCC -QIO review of an inpatient hospital discharge or SNF, HHA, or CORF termination decision, then the enrollee may request an expedited reconsideration with the MA plan. MA plans should have a process in place to distinguish between misdirected requests that should go to the BFCC -QIO (see \u00a7\u00a7422.622(b) and 422.626(a)(1)) and valid requests to the MA plan (i.e., requests made because the timeframe for filing with the BFCC -QIO has expired). MA plans are encouraged to automatically expedite all valid requests for reconsideration of inpatient hospital discharges and SNF, HHA, or CORF termination decision s. If the MA plan expedites the request, it must be processed under rules at \u00a7422.590(d) and guidance described in this section. If a request for review of an inpatient hospital discharge or SNF, HHA, or CORF termination decision received by the MA plan is within the BFCC -QIO filing timeframe, MA plans should inform the enrollee they must contact the BFCC -QIO to request the reconsideration. MA plans should ensure that network hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, and CORFs are aware of and fulfill their own responsibilities in connection with reviews of a hos pital discharge or SNF, HHA, or CORF termination. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 63 MA plans are also encouraged to contact the BFCC -QIO to inform them the enrollee wants to file an immediate BFCC -QIO review of a hospital discharge or SNF, HHA, or CORF termination and forward a detailed notice and case file to the BFCC -QIO. See \u00a7100 of for additional information related to hospital discharge and SNF, HHA, or CORF termination decisions . Part D Only Plans may choose to expedite a redetermination request from an enrollee without requiring the enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber to submit a new statement indicating that applying the standard timeframe could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function. However, if a plan sponsor chooses to do so, it should, at a minimum, ensure the enrollee has not obtained the drug in dispute. Action Following Acceptance of a Request for Expedited Level 1 Appeal The plan must adhere to the following : Part C Reconsideration Decision Processing Requirements for Expedited Reconsiderations Favorable Ensure the person or persons conducting the reconsideration were not involved in the organization determination.* As expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than : 72 hours after the request, the MA plan must: o Make the decision; and o Give notice to the enrollee (and the physician involved, as appropriate) ; and o Authorize or provide the service. Note: The 72-hour timeframe for requests for items and services may be extended up to 14 additional days. Part B drug timeframes cannot be extended. Notification must be provided within the 7 2-hour timeframe The MA plan may notify the enrollee verbal ly or in writing **. If the MA plan initially provides verbal notification of its decision, it must deliver written confirmation of its decision within 3 calendar days of INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 64 Reconsideration Decision Processing Requirements for Expedited Reconsiderations the verbal notification . Verbal or written notification of the decision must explain conditions of the approval including (but not limited to): o The duration of the approval; and o Limitations associated with the approval. If the enrollee agrees, the MA plan may send the notice by fax or e - mail. Please see Medicare Marketing Guidelines regarding electronic communication with enrollees. Partially Favorable or Adverse Ensure the person or persons conducting the reconsideration were not involved in the organization determination.* As expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 72 hours after the request, the MA plan must: o Make the decisio n; and o Forward the case file to the IRE within 24 hours of its affirmation (see \u00a750.12 for guidance on forwarding case files to the IRE ). Note: The 72-hour timeframe for requests for items and services may be extended up to 14 additional days. Part B drug timeframes cannot be extended. MA plans are not required to notify beneficiaries upon forwarding cases to the Part C IRE. Enrollees will receive notification from the IRE. MA plans opting to inform parties when a c ase has been forwarded to the IRE may use the model Notice of Appeal Status . *When the issue is the denial of coverage based on a lack of medical necessity, the reconsideration must be made by a physician with expertise in the field of medicine that is appropriate for the services at issue. The physician need not be of the same specialty or subspecialty as the treating ph ysician. ** N otice requirements can be found in \u00a750.10.1. Extension of Timeframe for Items and Services The MA plan may only extend the 7 2-hour timeframe up to 14 additional days if: The enrollee requests the extension; or The extension is justified and in the enrollee's interest due to the need for additional medical evidence from a non -contract provider that may change an MA plan 's decision to uphold a denial ; or The extension is justified due to extraordinary, exigent or other non -routine circumstances INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 65 and is in the enrollee's interest. If the MA plan extends the timeframe, the MA plan must notify the enrollee in writing the reasons for the extension and inform the enrollee of the right to file an expedited grievance if the enrollee disagrees with the decision to extend the timeframe. If the MA plan needs information from a non -contract provider, the MA plan must request the necessary information from the non -contract provider within 24 hours of the initial request for an expedited reconsideration . Regardless of whether the MA plan needs information from non - contract providers, the MA plan is responsible for meeting the timeframe and notice requirements for expedi ted reconsiderations . (See \u00a710.6 for additional guidance regarding outreach for additional information .) MA p lans are expected to have sufficient and appropriate contract terms to get information and records from cont ract providers as necessary for expedited (and standard) reconsiderations . MA plans should not generally or regularly extend the timeframe for an expedited reconsideration to seek information or records from a contract provider but may do so if it is justified in the enrollee's interest and due to extraordinary, exigent , or other non- routine circumstances. Part B drug timeframes cannot be extended. Part D Level 1 Appeal Decision Processing Requirements for Expedited Redeterminations All Decisions ( Favorable or Adverse, including requests that involve an exception) Ensure the person or persons conducting the redetermination were not involved in the coverage determination.* Part D p lan sponsors must make the decision and deliver written notice ** to the enrollee (and the prescribing physician or other prescriber involved, as appropriate) of its decision as expeditiously as the enrollee's health conditio n requires, but no later than 72 hours after receiving the redetermination request (plan sponsor s may not extend the timeframe by dispensing a temporary supply of the medication) . If the plan sponsor initially provides verbal notification of its decision, it must deliver written confirmation of its decision within 3 calendar days of the verbal notific ation. If the plan sponsor fails to provide the enrollee or prescribing physician or other prescriber, as appropriate, with the decision for the expedited redetermination within the timeframes INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 66 Level 1 Appeal Decision Processing Requirements for Expedited Redeterminations described above, they must forward the enrollee's request to th e IRE within 24 hours of the expiration of the adjudication timeframe (see \u00a750.12 for information regarding forwarding cases to the IRE) . *When the issue is a denial of coverage based on a lack of medical necessity, the redetermination must be made by a physician with expertise in the field of medicine that is appropriate for the services at issue. The physician need not be of the same specialty or subspeci alty as the treating physician. **Notice requirements can be found in \u00a750.10.2. If the plan needs medical information, the plan must request the necessary information within 24 hours of the initial request for an expedited level 1 appeal. Regardless of whether the plan needs information , the plan is responsible for meeting the timeframe and notice requirements for expedited level 1 appeals (for Part D exceptions requests, see \u00a740.5.3 for tolling requirements). Action Following Denial of a Request for a n Expedited Level 1 Appeal Following denial of a request for an expedited level 1 appeal , plans must: Transfer the request to the standard level 1 appeal process (the timeframe begins the day the MA organization receives the request for expedited reconsideration) ; Give the enrollee prompt verbal notice of the denial including the enrollee's rights ; and Deliver a written notice of the enrollee's rights within 3 cal endar days of the verbal notice of the denial to expedite the request. Notice of the denial of a request for an expedited level 1 appeal must: Explain that the plan will automatically transfer and process the request using the required timeframe for stand ard requests; Inform the enrollee of the right to file an expedited grievance if he or she disagrees with the plan's decision not to expedite the level 1 appeal (Plans may use the Notice of Right to an Expedited Grievance for Part C and Notice of Right to an Expedited Grievance for Part D to notify enrollees about their expedited grievance rights.); Inform the enrollee of the right to resubmit a request for an expedited level 1 appeal with a physician, prescribing physician, or other prescriber's support, including that if the enrollee gets the physician/prescriber support indicating that applying the standard timeframe for making determinations could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function, the request will be expedited automatically; and INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 67 Provide instructions about the expedited grievance process and its timeframes. Parts C & D Change of Review Priority After a request is initiated as a standard or expedited review, a provider may contact the plan to change the review priority (standard or expedited) . If the provider indicates that the enrollee's health requires an expedited decision, the plan must begin the applicable expedited review period at the time they receive the physician's request to expedite the decision. Note: A change of priority does not allow for extra review time. If the remaining standard review period is less than the applicable expedited review period, the original standard deadline still applies. 50.3 - Good Cause Exception for Late Filing Plans may accept a request for a standard or expedited level 1 appeal after the 60 -day timeframe if a filing party shows good cause. A request to file a level 1 appeal after the timeframe must be in writing and state why the request for a level 1 appeal was not filed on time. If an untimely appeal request does not include an explanation as to why the request wasn't filed timely, the plan may make an attempt to obtain information supporting good cause for the late filing . The plan should consider the circumstance that kept the party from making the request on time and whether any organizational actions might have misled the party . Plan p olicies governing good cause justification when the request for a level 1 appeal is outside the 60-day timeframe should not be disc riminatory and should provide for equal and fair treatment of enrollees. Examples of circumstances where good cause may exist include (but are not limited to) the following situations: The party did not receive the notice for the adverse initial determina tion, or they received it late; The party was seriously ill, which prevented a timely appeal; There was a death or serious illness i n the party's immediate family; An accident (e.g., a natural or man -made disaster) caused important records to be destroyed; Documentation was difficult to locate within the time limits; INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 68 The party had incorrect or incomplete information concerning the level 1 appeal process; The party lacked capacity to understand the timeframe for filing a level 1 appeal; or The party sent the request to an incorrect address, in good faith, within the time limit and the request did not reach the plan until after the time period had expired. The delay is a result of the additional time required to produce enrollee documents in an accessible format ( for example, large print or Braille). The delay is the result of an individual having sought and received help from an auxiliary resource (such as a State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) or senior center), on account of his or her disabi lity, in order to be able to file the appeal. If the plan obtains information establishing good cause, the adjudication timeframe (i.e., the timeframe in which the plan must make its decision on the level 1 appeal) begins on the date the plan receives that information. If the plan denies a party's request for a good cause extension for late filing , the request for reconsideration is dismissed . See \u00a7 50.9 for information on dismissal procedures. 50.4 - Withdrawal of a Level 1 Appeal Request A level 1 appeal may be withdrawn at any time before the decision is issued by filing a request with the plan. The request to withdraw must be filed by the party who requested the level 1 appeal. If a request to withdraw is filed with the plan, the plan will dismiss the level 1 appeal request . The request to withdraw may be written or verbal. For verbal withdrawal requests, the plan should clearly document in their system the date and the reason why the party chose not to proceed with the appeal. A notice of dismissal must be issued to all parties to the appeal and include : (1) The reason for the dismissal. (2) The right to request that the MA organization vacate the dismissal action. (3) The right to request review of the dismissal by the independent entity. Part C Only: If the withdrawal request from the party that requested a recons iderat ion is received after the plan has forwarded the case file to the IRE, the plan must forward the withdrawal request to the IRE for processing. See the content related to dismissal of a level 1 appeal at section 50.9. 50.5 - Actions the Appealing Party Can Take During a Level 1 Appeal INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 69 50.5.1 - Opportunity to Submit Evidence The plan must provide the parties to the appeal a reasonable opportunity to present evidence related to the appeal, in person or in writing (e.g. by telephone, fax, or hand -delivered to a plan's physical location). A party is not required to submit additional evidence, but each party may exercise this right if t hey choose . The plan must take all of the evidence into account when making the decision. In the case of an expedited level 1 appeal, the opportunity to present evidence is limited by the short ti meframe for making a decision, therefore, the plan must inform the parties of the conditions for submitting the evidence. Part C Only An MA plan must inform the party of their right to request a 14- day extension if the party feels they will need additional time to submit evidence. 50.5.2 - Enrollee Request for Case File Content Enrollees may request a copy of the contents of the case file at any point during the appeals process. Upon an enrollee's request, the plan must: Provide the enrollee with a copy of the contents of the case file, including, but not limited to, a copy of supporting medical records and other pertinent information used to support the decision. Where an enrollee has an alternate format preference, the case file contents must be provided in that format. Make every reasonable effort to accommodate an enrollee's request for case file material (e.g., allowing the enrollee or authorized representative to obtain the material at a plan location or mailing the material to any address spec ified by the enrollee or authorized representative). Abide by all applicable federal and state laws regarding confidentiality and disclosure for mental health records, medical records, or other health information. (See 45 CFR 164 Subpart E regarding the privacy of individually identifiable health information.) The plan may charge the enrollee a reasonable amount for copying and mailing the case file. When the case file is requested, the plan must inform the enrollee of the per -page copying cost and provide an estimate of the total copying and mailing cost. The plan may not charge the enrollee an additional cost for courier delivery of the material to a plan location that would be over and above the cost of mailing the material to the enrollee. 50.6 - Who Must Conduct a Level 1 Appeal INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 70 The plan must designate someone other than the person involved in making the initial determinatio n to perform the level 1 appeal. If the initial denial was base d on a lack of medical necessity , then the level 1 appeal must be performed by a physician with expertise in the field of medicine that is appropriate for the item, service , or drug in questio n. If the physician is not of the same specialty or subspecialty as the treating physician, the physician must have the appropriate level of training and expertise to evaluate the necessity of the requested drug, item , or service. This does not require t he physician to always have the same specialty training as the treating physician. For example, where there are few practitioners in a highly specialized field of medicine, a plan may not be able to hire a physician of the same specialty or sub- specialty to review adverse initial determination s. Part C Only The physician performing the reconsideration must apply the prudent layperson standard (as described in 42 CFR \u00a7422.113(b)(1)(i)) in cases involving emergency and urgently needed services. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 71 50.7 - Conducting a Level 1 Appeal 50.7.1 - Processing Timeframes Parts C & D Level 1 Appeal Adjudication Timeframes Type Part C Part C with Extension Part D Standard Pre -Service or Benefit 30 days 44 days 7 days * Expedited Pre- Service, Benefit or Part B Drug 72 hours 17 days ** 72 hours * Part B Drug 7 days N/A** N/A Payment 60 days N/A 14 days *Note: Part D redetermination exception requests cannot be tolled for receipt of the prescribing physician's supporting statement. ** Part B drug timeframes cannot be extended. Plans must authorize or provide the service or benefit as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than the timeframes listed above (based on when the request was received). If the plan cannot obtain all relevant documentation, it must issue the decision no later than the applicable timeframes outlined above . Part D Only Part D redetermination exception requests cannot be tolled for receipt of the prescribing physician's supporting statement. The Part D plan sponsor must authorize payment for the benefit within 14 calendar days from the date it receives the request and make payment (i.e., mail the payment) no later than 30 calendar days after the date the plan sponsor receives the request. Extension of Timeframe INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 72 Part C Only For standard pre -service and expedited reconsiderations for items and services, the MA plan may extend the timeframe by up to 14 calendar days only if: The extension is requested by the enrollee; The extension is justified and in the enrollee's interest due to the need for additional medical evidence from a non -contract provider that may change an MA plan's decision to deny an item or service; or Is in the enrollee's best interest due to extraordinary, exigent, or other non-routine circumstances, such as a natural disaster. When the MA plan extends the timeframe, it must notify the enrollee in writing of the reasons for the delay, and inform the enrollee of the right to file an expedited grievance if he or she disag rees with the MA plan's decision to grant an extension. When extensions are used, the MA plan must issue and effectuate its determination as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than upon the expiration date of the exten sion. Part B drug timeframes cannot be extended. Part D Only Extensions of the adjudication timeframes are not permitted in Part D. A Part D plan sponsor may not extend the adjudication timeframe by dispensing a temporary supply of the requested medication. For example, if a plan sponsor receives a request outside of its normal business hours, it cannot approve a 72- hour supply of the requested medication in dispute and defer issuing a decision for 72- hours; the plan sponsor must make its determinatio n within the appropriate adjudication timeframe . 50.7.2 - Effect of Failure to Meet the Timeframe for Level 1 Appeals If a plan fails to provide the enrollee with a level 1 appeal decision within the timeframes specified for both standard and expedited appeals, this failure constitutes an adverse decision. In this case, the plan must forward the complete case file to the IRE (see \u00a750.12.1 regarding forwarding adverse level 1 appeals to the IRE). The plan's failure to provide notice of the level 1 appeal decision within the required timeframe constitutes an adverse decision, but the plan is not required to send the adverse decision notice to the enrollee . INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 73 Part C Only MA plans are not required to notify beneficiari es upon forwarding cases to the Part C IRE. Enrollees will receive notification from the IRE. MA plans opting to inform parties when a case has been forwarded to the IRE may use the model Notice of Appeal Status. Part D Only Plan sponsors should notify the enrollee that the appeal decision was not made timely and is being forwarded to the IRE for review. CMS has developed a model Notice of Case Status that plan sponsors can use in lieu of the adverse decision notice to not ify enrollees whenever cases are forwarded to the IRE. The plan sponsor must send the notification to the enrollee within 24 hours of the expiration of the adjudication timeframe. Note : When a plan makes a fully favorable determination on a level 1 appeal less than 24 hours after the end of the adjudication timeframe, the plan should consider effectuating and notifying the enrollee of the favorable appeal decision (within the 24-hour period the appeal must be forwarded to the IRE) in lie u of forwarding the appeal to the IRE. If CMS determines that the plan has a pattern of not processing level 1 appeals within the required timeframes, the plan may be considered to be out of compliance with the terms of its Medicare contract and/or subjec t to intermedia te sanctions in accordance with 42 CFR Part 422 or Part 423, subpart O . Part D Only The \"Transition Period Note\" in \u00a740.11 also applies to this section . 50.8 - Service or Benefit Received Prior to Notice of Decision INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 74 Part C Only If an enrollee request s a pre -service reconsideration but the MA plan becomes aware that the enrollee has received the requested item/service /Part B drug before the MA plan complete s its reconsideration, the MA plan must process the request as a request for payment or dismiss the request if it is unable to obtain the information necessary to process a payment request. The plan must process the reconsideration as a request for paymen t if the plan is able to obtain the necessary information (e.g., receipt from enrollee; provider claim) . If the MA plan denies payment, it must send the case to the IRE for reconsideration. If the plan can't process the reconsideration as a payment request, the request should be dismissed with an explanation of what is needed by the plan to process a request for payment. If the case is sent to the IRE and the IRE becomes aware that the enrollee has received the requested item/service/Part B drug, the IRE must process the reconsideration as a request for payment if it is able to obtain the necessary information (e.g., receipt ; claim); otherwise, the IRE should dismiss the request with an explanation of what is needed to process a request for payment. Part D Only If an enrollee request s a pre -benefit redetermination and the Part D plan sponsor becomes aware that the enrollee has received the prescription drug before it completes its redetermination, the plan sponsor must process the request as a request for payment or dismiss the request if it is unable to obtain the information necessary to process a payment request. The plan sponsor must process the redetermination as a request for payment if the plan sponsor is able to obtain the necessary information (e.g., receipt from enrollee). If the plan sponsor can't process the redetermination as a payment request, the request should be dismissed with an explanation of what is needed by the plan sponsor to process a request for direct member reimbursement. If the plan sponsor upholds its denial and the enrollee appeals to the IRE and, during the processing of the appeal, the IRE becomes aware that the enrollee has received the requested drug, the IRE must process the reconsideration as a request for payment if it is able to obtain the necessary information (e.g., receipt from enrollee); otherwise, the IRE should dismiss the request with an explanation of what is needed to proc ess a request for payment. 50.9 - Dismissal of a Level 1 Appeal Request Plans must dismiss appeal requests under any of the following circumstances: o The individual or entity making the request is not a proper party to the appeal under the applicable regulation. This includes the following situations: If an individual requests a reconsideration on behalf of an enrollee, but a properly executed INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 75 appointment of representative form has not been filed ( and there is no other documentation to show that the individual is legally authorized to act on the enrollee's behalf), the MA plan is obligated to make attempts to secure the missing documentation (see \u00a720.2.1 ). o If a non- contracted provider requests a reconsideration of a denied claim (i.e., post- service appeal) but fails to provide a waiver of liability statement indicating that it will not bill the enrollee regardless of the outcome of the appeal , the MA plan should make attempts to secure the missing documentation prior to dismissing the request. Please note: a pre -service reconsideration request by a physician who is providing treatment to an enrollee, upon providing notice to the enrollee, is considered a valid request. When the plan determines the party failed to make a valid request for an appeal that substantially complies with the applicable regulation for making a valid request for a level 1 appeal . o For example, w hen the party fails to file the level 1 appeal within the proper filing timeframe in accordance with the applicable regulation. When the enrollee dies while the appeal is pending and the enrollee's spouse or estate has no remaining financial interest in the case and no other individual or entity with a financ ial interest in the case wishes to pursue the level 1 appeal. Financial interest means having financial liability for the item(s) or service(s) underlying the coverage request. When the individual or entity that requested the reconsideration submits a timely written request to withdraw their request for a level 1 appeal. When the dismissal is the result of a timely withdrawal request , the plan is required to mail or otherwise transmit a dismissal notice in accordance with the notice requirements in section 50.9.1 in order to preserve the rights of other proper parties to the decision who may wish to request review of the dismissal. The dismissal notice will explain that the withdrawal request is the reason for dismissal . For reporting purposes, this scenario is categorized as a withdrawal in reporting to CMS. 50.9.1 - Dismissal Notice If a plan dismisses a level 1 appeal request, the plan must mail or otherwise transmit a written notice of the dismissal to the parties at their last known address by the conclusion of the applicable adjudication timeframe. The dismissal notice must state all of the following: (1) The reason for the dismissal ; (2) The right to request that the plan vacate the dismissal action; and (3) The right to request IRE review of the dismissal. Consistent with the timeframe for requesting a timely appeal, a request for review of a dismissal INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 76 must be filed with the IRE within 60 calendar days from the date of the plan's dismissal notice. Plans may use, and modify as necessary, the model Notice of Dismissal of Appeal Request when notifying an enrollee of a dismissal. Part C only The ru le requiring that a Part C case be automatically sent to the IRE if the plan upholds a denial on the merits of the request does not apply in the case of a dismissal of a request for a level 1 appeal ( reconsideration) because the MA organization is not making a substantive decision on the merits of the request. If the plan dismisses a level 1 appeal request, the enrollee or other party has the right to request IRE review of the plan's dismissal; Part C plans must forward the case file for a dismissal to the IRE when a proper party to the appeal requests IRE review of the dismissal under \u00a7 422.590(i) . The enrollee also has the right to request that the plan vacate the dismissal. 50.9.2 - Dismissal Binding Unless Modified, Reversed or Vacated The plan's decision regarding its dismissal of a level 1 appeal request is binding unless the enrollee or other party requests review by the Independent Review Entity or the dismissal action is vacated by the plan. A plan may vacate its own dismissal within 6 months of the date of the dismissal if good cause is established. Upon receipt of a request to review a plan's dismissal of a level 1 appeal r equest, the IRE will contact the appropriate plan to obtain the case file. Plans must assemble and forward the case file to the IRE (place in the mail or otherwise transmit the case file ). The case file should be forwarded within 24 hours of receiving the IRE's case file request. The plan should refer to the IRE website or the IRE Reconsideration Pr ocess Manual for information on case file content, organization, and the most appropriate method of transmitting the case file. If the IRE determines that the plan's dismissal of the level 1 appeal request was in error, the IRE vacates the dismissal and remands the case to the plan for reconsideration or redetermination (level 1 appeal). The level 1 appeal must be conducted by the plan consistent with applicable adjudication timeframes in \u00a7 50.7.1 . The adjudication timeframe begins when the plan receives the IRE's remand order vacating the plan's dismissal. The IRE's decision regarding a plan's dismissal of a level 1 appeal request is binding and not subject to further review. Requests to Vacate Dismissal of a Level 1 Appeal Request A plan may vacate its own dismissal if good cause is established within 6 months of the date of the notice of the dismissal. A plan may find good cause to vacate a dismissal if, for example, the plan determines the dismissal was issued in error because there was good cause for late filing of an appeal request. If a party submits a request to vacate a dismissal of a level 1 appeal request and the request contains sufficient evidence or other documentation that supports a finding of INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 77 good cause for vacating, the plan makes a favorable good cause determination. Once the plan makes a favorable good cause determination, it vacates its prior dismissal action, and performs a redetermination or reconsideration consistent with section 50.7, i ncluding applicable adjudication timeframes . For example, if a Part C plan dismisses a standard pre -service reconsideration request for an item or service and the plan later finds good cause to vacate the dismissal action, the plan must notify the enrolle e (or other party) of the level 1 appeal decision within 30 calendar days (assuming no extension is taken) of vacating the dismissal . Where a finding for good cause is made, the plan should document the reason for that finding in the case file. If the plan does not find good cause to vacate the dismissal (and the dismissal has not been appealed or overturned on appeal) , the dismissal remains in effect. The plan issues a letter (not a dismissal notice ) explaining that good cause has not been established and the dismissal cannot be vacated. The plan should explain in clear language why the information submitted with the request to vacate the dismissal does not establish good cause to vacate the dismissa l action . 50.10 - Notification Requirements for Level 1 Appeal Decisions 50.10.1 - Part C Notification Requirements Favorable Decisions For favorable decisions, the MA plan must: Notify the requesting party and the enrollee in writing of its favorable determination. If the enrollee's representative filed the appeal, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans may provide notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. Ensure written notification for appeals for service requests explain the conditions of the approval which in clude (but are not limited to): o The duration of the approval; and o Limitations associated with the approval. Partially Favorable, Adverse , or Untimely Decisions For partially favorable, adverse, or untimely decisions, the MA plan must s end a copy of the complete case file with a written explanation of the MA plan's decision to the IRE within the applicable timeframe (see \u00a750.12 for timefram es and case file requirements). MA plans are not required to notify beneficiaries upon forwarding cases to the Part C IRE . Enrollees will receive notification from the IRE. MA plans opting to inform parties when a case has been forwarded to the IRE may use the model Notice of Appeal Status . INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 78 Note: See \u00a750.7.2 if the MA plan makes a favorable determination for a reconsideration request in less than 24 hours after the adjudication timeframe . For notice requirements following denial of a request for an expedited reconsideration, see \u00a750.2.2. 50.10.2 - Part D Notification Requirements Favorable Decisions For favorable decisions, the Part D plan sponsor must: Notify the enrollee in writing in a readable and understandable form , in accordance with the regulatory requirements at \u00a7423.590(h). If the enrollee's representative filed the appeal, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans may send written notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. If an enrollee's prescribing physician or other p rescriber files a request on behalf of an enrollee, the plan sponsor must provide notice to the prescriber and written notice to the enrollee. If a plan sponsor provides verbal notification to a physician or other prescriber, the plan sponsor does not need to send a written follow -up. Written notices must explain the conditions of the approval. The conditions of approval may include (but are not limited to): o The duration of the approval; o Limitations associated with the approval; and/or o Any coverage rules applicable to subsequent refills. Adverse Decisions If the request is denied, in whole or in part, the Part D plan sponsor must: Notify the enrollee in writing. The plan sponsor may use the model Notice of Redetermination language, or it may develop its own notice. If the enrollee's representative filed the appeal, the representative must be notified in lieu of the enrollee. Plans may send written notice to both the representative and enrollee, but are not required. If an enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber files a request on behalf of an enrollee, the plan sponsor must provide notice to the prescriber and written notice to the enrollee. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 79 If a plan sponsor provides verbal notification to a physician or other prescriber, the plan sponsor does not need to send a written follow -up. In accordance with the regulatory requirements at \u00a7 423.590(g), t he notice must use approved notice language in a readable and understandable form , and must : o State the specific reason for denial that takes into account the enrollee's presenting medical condition, disabilities, and special language requirements, if any (see Section 10.4.4 for additional details); o Contain the enrollee's HICN or MBI, plan sponsor name, plan identification number, contract identification number, and formulary identification number; o Provide a description of any applicable Medicare coverage r ule or any other applicable plan policy upon which the denial was based, including any specific formulary criteria that must be satisfied for approval. If the drug could be approved under the exception rules, the notice must explicitly state the need for a supporting statement and clearly identify the type of information that should be submitted when seeking a formulary or tiering exception ; and o Inform the enrollee of his or her right to a r econsideration (level 2 appeal). Note: For adverse drug coverage redeterminations, describe both the standard and expedited reconsideration processes, including the enrollee's right to, and conditions for, obtaining an expedited reconsideration and t he rest of the appeals process. For adverse payment redeterminations, describe the standard reconsideration process and the rest of the appeals process . For notice requirements following denial of a request for an expedited redetermination, see \u00a750.2.2. Untimely Decisions If the plan sponsor fails to provide notice of a decision within the required timeframe, the plan sponsor is not required to send the adverse decision notice, but instead, the plan sponsor should notify the enrollee that the decision was not made timely and is being f orwarded to the IRE for review. The notice must: Advise the enrollee of his/her right to submit additional evidence that may be pertinent to the enrollee's case, if the enrollee chooses; Direct the enrollee to submit such evidence to the independent review entity; and Include information on how to contact the independent review entity. CMS has developed a model Notice of Case Status that plan sponsors can use in lieu of the INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 80 adverse decision notice to notify enrollees whenever cases are forwarded to the IRE. Note: See \u00a750.7.2 if the plan sponsor makes a favorable decision for a redetermination request in less than 24 hours after the adjudication timeframe . 50.11 - Procedure for Handling Misclassified Appeals If the plan misclassifies an appeal as a grievance and later discovers the error, the plan must immediately forw ard the request to the appropriate division for processing and notify the enrollee in writing that the request was misclassified and will be handled through the appeals process. The timeframe for processing the appeal begins on the date the appeal is received by the plan, as opposed to the date the plan discovers its error. Plans are expected to audit their own appeals and grievance for the presence of errors and institute appropriate quality improvement projects as needed. 50.12 - Timeframes and Respon sibilities for Forwarding Case Files to the Independent Review Entity 50.12.1 - Forwarding Case Files - Plan Responsibilities If an MA plan appeal decision affirms the adverse initial determination (in whole or in part) or a Part D plan sponsor does not provide notice of its standard or expedited redetermination within the required timeframe or an enrollee has filed a reconsideration request and the IRE has requested the enrollee's file from the plan, the plan must: Make reasonable and diligent efforts to gather and forward all pertinent documentation, including medical records. Submit a written explanation with the complete case file (the case file must satisfy the requirements in \u00a750.12.3) to the IRE contracted by CMS within the forwarding timef rames, as set forth in \u00a750.12.2. Submit the case file by mail or overnight delivery service , fax, or the IRE web portal for Part C or for Part D . Plans may access the web portal and the user's guide on the IRE's website . The plan should contact the IRE for additional information o n electronic submission of case files. Note: When a plan makes a fully favorable determination in less than 24 hours after the end of the applicable adjudication timeframe, the plan should consider effectuating and promptly notifying the enrollee of the favorable decision (within the 24-hour period that the case must be forwarded to the IRE) in lieu of forwarding the case to the IRE. See \u00a750.7.2 for additional information regarding untimely decisions made in less than 24 hours after the adjudication INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

For cases forwarded to the IRE, the plan must make reasonable and diligent efforts to gather and forward all pertinent information to the IRE. If CMS determines that the plan has a pattern of not making appropriate efforts to forward information to the IR E, the plan will be considered to be out of compliance with the terms of its Medicare contract and/or subject to intermediate sanctions in accordance with subpart O of 42 CFR Part 422 or Part 423 . For additional instructions, p lans may refer to t he Part C Reconsideration Process Manual and the Part D Reconsideration Procedures Manual . 50.12.2 - Forwarding Case Files -Timeframes Part C Timeframes Case Type for Adverse and Untimely Decisions Forward no later than Expedited 24 hours of the decision (or no later than expiration of ext ension) Standard Pre -Service 30 calendar days of receipt of request (or no later than expiration of ext ension) Standard Payment 60 calendar days of receipt of request Note : For purposes of calculating timely receipt of the appeal case file by the independent review entity, the MA plan should refer to the Part C Reconsideration Process Manual , Section 5.2. Part D Timeframes Case Type for Decisions Forward no later than Expedited 24 hours of receipt of IRE's request for case files Standard 48 hours of receipt of IRE's request for case files Untimely 24 hours of the expiration of the adjudication timeframe INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 82 50.12.3 - Preparing the Case File for the Independent Review Entity The following should be included in the case file forwarded to the IRE: What to Include in A Case File When Forwarding to the IRE Part C Part D Appeal Case File Transmittal Form/Cover Sheet Reconsideration Background Data Form (not required if submitting via IRE web portal ) N/A Case Narrative Copy of the Initial Determination Request and Notice Copy of the Level 1 Appeal Request and Notice Copy of information used to make the plan internal Level 1 decision, including supporting documentation such as medical records, or evidence submitted by the enrollee, provider, and/or prescriber. Expedited information regarding the Coverage Determination and Redetermination N/A Representation documentation for representative appeals If file is not submitted via IRE web portal for Part C or for Part D , a complete copy of the relevant Evidence of Coverage on a universal digital storage device (e.g. USB flash drive) The name and credentials of the prescribing physician or other prescriber and contact numbers for street address, telephone, fax , and e -mail. N/A Copy of the relevant plan formulary ( on a universal digital storage device if not submitted via IRE web portal ), including descriptions of any utilization management requirements N/A Exceptions process/criteria for determining medical necessity N/A Any internal plan medical reviews that were obtained during redetermination review N/A Description of medical documentation missing from the case file based on the failure of the prescribing physician or other prescriber N/A INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 83 What to Include in A Case File When Forwarding to the IRE Part C Part D to submit additional medical documentation requested by the plan. Dismissal Case File Data Form N/A Plans may su bmit case files using the IRE web portal for Part C or for Part D . Plans should refer to the most current version of the Part C Reconsideration Process Manual or the Part D Reconsideration Procedures Manual for info rmatio n concerning all required forms . Plans are expected to fully complete all appropriate sections of the required forms in support of CMS' appeals data collection activities. 50.12.4 - Including Evidence of Coverage and Formulary in Case Files CMS strongly recommends that the plan include complete copies of the relevant Evidence of Coverage (EOC) and their CMS approved formulary (Part D plans, if applicable) with any case files sent to the IRE for review. ALJs at the Office of Medicare Hearings & Appeals (OMHA) and the Medicare Appeals Council (Council) have indicated that t hese documents are needed in their entirety in order to properly adjudicate appeals. It is in a plan's best interest to ensure that each case file sent to the IRE includes complete versions of the EOC and/or formulary relevant to an enrollee's specific case. Failure to include this information could result in an unfavorable appeals decision and/or, in the case of Part D, CMS declining to refer an ALJ or attorney adjudicator decision to the Council for review. Plans may submit case files with the EOC and and/or formulary using the IRE web portal for Part C or for Part D . Plans may not mail or fax paper copies of the complete EOC and/or formulary to the IRE. If plans do not submit via the web portal, they should send information on a universal digital storage device (e.g. USB flash drive) . Include the device with the case file in the following manner : The universal digital storage device must be properly labeled with the plan name and contract number, formulary ID (Part D), enrollee name/HICN /MBI, and appeal number; The universal digital storage device must be securely affixed to the paper case file; All documents on the universal digital storage device must be in PDF or Word format and should not be encrypted; and The universal digital storage device should only include the EOC and/or formulary applicable to the specific case b eing adjudicated (a plan must not place copies of all of its EOCs and formularies on the universal digital storage device ). 60 - Reconsiderations by the Independent Review Entity (Level 2 Appeal) INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 84 60.1 - Who May Request a Level 2 Appeal Part C Only All partially favorable or adverse reconsideration decisions are forwarded to the IRE. A party does not have to make a request for a level 2 appeal. Part D Only An enrollee, An enrollee's representative, or An enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber (acting on behalf of an enrollee), upon providing notice to the enrollee in accordance with \u00a7423.600(a). All partially favorable or adverse at -risk redetermination decisions are automatically forwarded by the plan to the IRE within 24 hours . A party does not have to make a request for a level 2 appeal related to an at -risk determination. 60.2 - How to Request a Level 2 Appeal (Part D Only) Method of Filing Type of Request Timeframe for Filing Written Standard or Expedited Within 60 calendar days from the date of the notice of the redetermination , unless the IRE extends the timeframe for good cause. Requests may be made by an enrollee, enrollee's representative, or prescribing physician or other prescriber (acting on behalf of an enrollee), upon providing notice to the enrollee on the model Request for Reconsideration , or on any other written document. If the model notice is used, p lan sponsors should complete the applicable sections with each adverse redetermination notice. 60.3 - Processing Timeframes The IRE must conduct the reconsideration as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but not exceed the required timeframes outlined below .

See \u00a740.5.4 for additional information regarding tolling . 60.4 - Good Cause Extension (Part D Only) If a party misses the 60 -day timeframe for requesting an IRE reconsideration, he or she may request a good- cause extension. The extension request must be filed with the IRE, in writing, and include the reason why he or she did not request a reconsideration timely. If the party shows good cause, the IRE may extend the time frame for filing a request for reconsideration. The IRE should consider the circumstance that kept the party from making the request on time and whether any actions by the Part D plan sponsor may have misled the party. Examples of circumstances w here good cause may exist include (but are not limited to) the situations described in \u00a750.3. The decision by the IRE on whether to grant an extension for good cause is final and not subject to appeal. 60.5 - IRE Notification and Retention Requirements When the IRE completes its reconsideration, it is responsible for notifying the parties of its decision and providing a copy of the decision to the plan. Under Part C, the IRE is also responsible for sending a copy of the decision to the CMS Regional Office that oversees the MA plan. The reconsideration notice must: Be written in a manner that is understandable to the enrollee that takes into account the enrollee's presenting medical condition(s), disabilities, or special language requirements, if any, and: Include specific reasons for the decision. If the decision is adverse (i.e., does not completely reverse the plan's adverse determination) the notice must also : Inform the parties of the right to an ALJ hearing i f the amount in controversy meets the appropriate threshold requirement (see \u00a770.2 for threshold requirements; plans may not INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

The IRE is responsible for storing reconsideration case files in accordance with CM S' Records Management Program. For additional retention requirements, see the Part C Reconsideration Process Manual or the Part D Reconsideration Procedures Manual . 60.6 - Dismissal of a Level 2 Appeal The IRE must dismiss a level 2 appeal under any of the following circumstances: The individual or entity making the request is not a proper party to the appeal under the applicable regulation When the IRE determines the party failed to make a valid request for an appeal that substantially complies with the applicable regulation for making a valid request. Part D only : When the party fails to file the appeal within the proper filing timeframe in accordance with the applicable regulation and there is no good cause for the late filing . When the enrollee dies while the appeal is pending and the enrollee's spouse or estate has no remaining financial interest in the case and no other individual or entity with a financial interest in the case wishes to pursue the reconsideration or redetermination. Financial interest means having financial liability for the item(s) or service(s) underlying the coverage request. When the party that requested the appeal submits a timely request for withdrawal of the request for reconsideration. 60.6.1 - Dismissal Notice If the IRE dismisses a level 2 appeal, the IRE must mail or otherwise transmit a written notice of the dismissal to the parties at their last known address by the conclusion of the applicable adjudication timeframe. The dismissal notice must state all of the following: (1) The reason for the dismissal; (2) The right to request that the IRE vacate the dismissal action; and (3) The right to request ALJ review of the IRE's dismissal. Consistent with the timeframe for requesting a timely appeal, a request for review of a dismissal by the IRE must be filed with the ALJ within 60 calendar days from the date of the IRE's dismissal notice.

It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 87 When a dismissal is prompted by a timely withdrawal request , the IRE is required to mail or otherwise transmit a dismissal notice in accordance with the notice requirements in order to preserve the rights of other proper parties to the decision who may wish to request ALJ review of the dismissal 60.6.2 - Dismissal Binding Unless Modified, Reversed or Vacated The IRE's decision regarding its dismissal of a level 2 appeal is binding unless the enrollee or other party requests review by the ALJ or the decision is vacated by the IRE. In addition to the right to request ALJ review of an IRE dismissal, an enrollee (or other party) has the right to request that the IRE vacate the dismissal action. The IRE may vacate its own dismissal within 6 months of the date of the dismissal if good cause is established. 60.7 - Effect of a Level 2 Appeal Determination An IRE reconsideration determination is final and binding on the enrollee and the plan, unless a party files a request for a hearing before an ALJ or attorney adjudicator (level 3 appeal) . Part C Only Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7422.600, any party to the Part C reconsideration determination, except the MA plan, has a right to request a level 3 review if the amount in controversy thresholds are met (see \u00a770.2 for threshold requirements ). Part D Only Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7423.2000, an enrollee who is dissatisfied with the IRE reconsideration determination has a right to request a level 3 review if the amount in controversy thresholds are met (see \u00a770.2 for threshold requirements ). Note: The R emainder of \u00a760 A pplies to Part D Only 60.8 - Reconsideration of Late Enrollment Penalty Determinations Under \u00a71860D-13(b) of the Act and 42 C FR \u00a7\u00a7423.46 and 423.56(g), the Secretary or his or her designee imposes a late enrollment penalty (LEP) if there is a continuous period of 63 days or more at any time after the end of the individual's Part D initial enrollment period during wh ich the individual was eligible to enroll in a Part D plan, but was not enrolled in a Part D plan and INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

This may include but is not limited to: Employer- based prescription drug c overage, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits P rogram (FEHBP); State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAPs); Military -related coverage (for example, VA, TRICARE coverage); and Certain Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policies. See 42 C FR \u00a7423.56(b) for a complete list of types of prescription drug coverage that may be determined to be creditable. As outlined at 42 CFR \u00a7423 .56(c) and (d), with the exception of Prescription Drug Plan Sponsors, Medicare Advantage Organizations , Section 1876 Cost -Based Contractors, and PACE organizations offering prescription drug plans, entities that offer prescription drug coverage must make an annual determination of creditable coverage status and provide a disclosure notice to Medicare eligi ble individuals (see the appropriate plan enrollment guidance for information related to Part D enrollment eligibility). See Chapter 4 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual for additional guidance regarding creditable coverage period determinations and the calculation and assessment of the LEP.) Note : Prescription drug discount cards, free clinics, or drug discount websites do not constitute creditable prescription drug coverage. Also, the \"certificate of creditable coverage\" an enrollee may receive when his or her health coverage ends does not mean the prescription drug cove rage met Medicare's minimum standards - unless the notice specifically mentioned the enrollee had \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage that expected to pay as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug plan pays. Furthermore, workers compensation se t- aside arrangements do not constitute creditable prescription drug coverage, since this prescription coverage is only for medication related to a work injury. For additional guidance concerning creditable coverage- related requirements, see the materi al posted on the Creditable Coverage page on the CMS website. An enrollee, or his or her representative may request a review, or reconsideration, of a decision to impose an LEP. An enrollee may only obtain review under the circumstances listed on the LEP Reconsideration Request Form . Unless otherwise stated in \u00a720.1 of this guidance , the enrollee's representative has all of the rights and responsibilities of an enrollee under Part D LEP reconsideration procedures . The LEP reconsideration is conducted by the IRE under contract with Medicare.

It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 89 60.8.1 - Summary of the LEP Reconsideration Process The LEP Reconsideration Process is described below: When a Part D plan sponsor sends a letter notifying an enrollee of the imposition of or increase in the LEP (\"LEP letter\"), and the increase is due to reporting additional uncovered months, except in a case where the number of uncovered months increases as a result of an IRE decisi on, the plan sponsor shall include the Part D LEP Reconsideration Notice : \"Your Right to Ask Medicar e to Review Your Medicare Part D Late Enrollment Penalty\" and the LEP Reconsideratio n Request Form . The information provided by the plan advises the enrollee that he or she has 60 calendar days from the date on the LEP letter to request reconsideration of the LEP, or the request may not be considered. If the 60 -day timeframe for filing ha s expired, the enrollee may request a good- cause extension, subject to the requirements described in \u00a760.4 of this guidance . The enrollee must explain his or her reason for filing late on a separate sheet and send this explanation along with the LEP Recons ideration Request Form. The enrollee sends his or her signed, completed LEP Reconsideration Request Form to the IRE, in accordance with the filing ins tructions provided on the form . Enrollees also may write a letter requesting an LEP appeal, provided the letter contains the elements on the LEP Reconsideration Request Form. The IRE shall request a copy of the case file from the plan sponsor and make a decision based on the case file, the information supplied by the enrollee, and any other information the IRE deems relevant. The IRE will in form the enrollee and the plan sponsor of the final decision. The plan sponsor , if applicable, shall report a revised creditable coverage determination to CMS and notify the enrollee in writing of the new LEP amount and any refund due. (Refer to Chapter 4 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual for more information.) The final LEP reconsideration decision is not subject to appeal (that is, is not subject to further review by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) or attorney adjudicator, Council, or in a district court of the U.S.), although CMS can review and revise a decision upon request. 60.8.2 - Part D Plan Responsibilities under the LEP Reconsideration Process The Part D plan sponsor shall become familiar with LEP procedures so it is able to assist enrollees throughout the LEP reconsideration process. For example, the plan sponsor shall: Attempt to obtain a completed Declaration of Prior Prescription Dr ug Coverage form , (Exhibit 1D in Chapter 4 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual ) from the enrollee at the beginning of the creditable coverage determination process, where the enrollee appears to INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 90 have a qualifying break in creditable prescription drug coverage. Obtaining the Declaration may avoid the assessment of a LEP and the need for reconsideration. Send the enrollee the Part D LEP Reconsideration Notice , \"Your Right to Ask Medicare to Review Your Part D Late Enrollment Penalty\", and the LEP Reconsideration R equest Form at the same time the plan sponsor sends an enrollee his or her LEP letter. Assist the enrollee in completing the LEP Reconsideration Request Form upon request. For example, the plan sponsor shall help an enrollee determine which checkbox to ma rk as his or her reason for seeking reconsideration. The plan sponsor shall inform the enrollee tha t his or her request must include the following: o A completed, signed LEP Reconsideration Request Form or a signed, written request for reconsideration contai ning the elements on the LEP reconsideration request form; and o If the enrollee has named a representative, proof that the individual has authority to represent the enrollee. Note: In addition to the items above, the plan sponsor shall inform the enrollee that his or her request should include a ny additional information that may help the enrollee's case, including evidence that the IRE should consider (e.g., notice from an employer sponsored health plan indicating that prior drug coverage was creditable). See \u00a760.8.4. The p lan sponsor shall instruct enrollees to send this material to the IRE at the address or fax number shown on page 2 of the LEP Reconsideration Request Form , to include t heir HICN or M BI on any separate materials, and to only send photocopi es of their original documents. Retain a copy of the LE P letter sent to an enrollee. If the plan sponsor retains a copy of the LEP letter in the enrollee's file, that information will be readily and easily available if the enrollee requests review of the LEP and the IRE requests this information. Send the IRE a copy of the enrollee's case file, which includes copies of any information the plan sponsor used in making its creditable coverage determination for the enrollee, including, but not limited to: o the enrollee's Part D initial enrollment period ( IEP) or subsequent IEP end date (and how it was derived ); and o the enrollee's creditable coverage attestation materials (\"Declaration of Prior Prescription Drug Coverage\" form , Exhibit 1D in Chapter 4 of the Prescriptio n Drug Benefit Manual ), and any documentation from CMS of the enrollee's enrollment in a plan or in a plan whose sponsor received the retiree drug subsid y.

Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 91 sponsor shall comply with th e requirements described under Chapter 4 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual concerning adjustment or removal of an LEP . 60.8.3 - Requests for Information Upon reque st, the plan sponsor shall forward to the IRE any information necessary to make a reconsideration decision, including all creditable coverage and LEP -related information received in accordance with Chapter 4 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual , such as information from a current or previous enrollee. Information Availability Timeframe * Requirement The requested information is available Within 14 calendar days Deliver (by mail or fax) a hard copy of the requested information . The requested information is not available Within 14 calendar days Deliver (by mail or fax) a brief letter to the IRE acknowledging that the requested informa tion is unavailable and explain the reason . *after receiving the request for information 60.8.4 - Reasons for Requesting LEP Reconsideration and Presentation of Evidence An enrollee may request review of their LEP decision if he or she: Had prior creditable prescription drug coverage that the enrollee believes may have not been considered. Had prior prescription drug coverage but didn't get a notice that clearly explained whether the drug coverage was creditable. In this case, the enrollee should submit an y evidence, such as a copy of a plan sponsor 's letter or other material, for example, a Summary of Benefits that the enrollee found unclear or misleading. Believes the LEP is wrong because he or she was not eligible to enroll in a Medicare drug plan during the period stated by the Medicare drug plan. Believes the LEP is wrong because he or she was unable to enroll in a Medicare drug plan due to a serious medical emergency during the period the individual was eligible to enroll in a drug plan.

If an enrollee has identified a representative, the IRE will send any notice or other correspondence to the enrollee's representative instead of to the enrollee. Enrollee requests an extension or the IRE finds good cause to extend. 90 calendar days with a 14-day extension Good cause would include, for example, when the IRE finds a need for additional information and considers the delay to be in the interest of the enrollee, such as receipt of additional information that may reduce the number of uncovered months upon which the LEP was based. An individual other than the enrollee files for reconsideration. The timeframe will not begin until the IRE receives documentation verifying that t he individual is the enrollee's r epresentative or is authorized under state law to act on behalf of an enrollee . The IRE will attempt to cure any defect in an Appointment of Representative form (CMS - 1696) or other equivalent written notice by requesting information from the individu al who filed the request . If the IRE cannot verify an individual's status as the representative within a reasonable time period, not to exceed 30 calendar days after the date of the request, the IRE will determine that the reconsideration request be dismissed. Note : In all cases, the IRE strives to notify an enrollee of its final decision as quickly as possible. However, the IRE may take longer than the 90 -day timeframe to process an LEP reconsideration decision in certain cases depending, among other issues, on t he amount of research the IRE has to perform to verify whether an enrollee's prior prescription drug coverage was creditable 60.8.6 - Withdrawal of an LEP Reconsideration Request An enrollee may withdraw his or her LEP reconsideration request in writing at any time before the IRE mails the final decision. For purposes of a withdrawal, \"enrollee\" also includes a former enrollee or his or her represe ntative. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 94 60. 8. 7 - Dismissal of an LEP Reconsid eration Request The IRE should dismiss the reconsideration under any of, but not limited to, the following circumstances : When the enrollee fails to file the LEP reconsideration within the proper filing timeframe and does not have good cause for missing the filing deadline; When the enrollee dies while the reconsideration is pending and the enrollee's surviving spouse or estate has no remaining financial interest in the reconsideration. The word \"spouse\" , as used in 42 CFR \u00a7423.2052(a)(5), includes same -sex spouses as well as opposite- sex spouses. Because civil unions and domestic partnerships are not marriages, civil union and domestic partners are not regarded as spouses by CMS; When the individual requesting the reconsideration is not the enrollee, and the authority of the individual seeking a reconsideration cannot be verified within a reasonable time period, not to exceed 30 calendar days after the date of the reconsideration request; When a n enrollee requests a reconsideration of an issue that is ineligible for LEP reconsideration or is otherwise ineligible for review. For example, the IRE will not make actuarial determinations concerning whether an enrollee's prescription drug coverage was creditable; that is, an enrollee may not use the LEP reconsideration process to seek review of the decision that his or her coverage under an employer -sponsored prescription drug plan was not creditable coverage; or When the enrollee submits a timely written request to withdraw their request for an LEP reconside ration Vacating a Dismissal The dismissal is binding, unless the dismissal is vacated. If a Part D enrollee requests the dismissal be vacated and he or she shows good cause that the reconsideration request should not be dismissed, the dismissal of the rec onsideration request may be vacated. The enrollee must request that the dismissal be vacated within 60 days after the date of the dismissal notice. The IRE will no tify the enrollee and the Part D plan sponsor in writing if the dismissal is vacated.

The parties to a hearing are the parties to the reconsideration, the MA plan, and other person/entity whose rights with respect to the reconsideration may be affected by the h earing, as determined by the ALJ or attorney adjudicator . Enrollee Fourth Level: Council Any party to the ALJ or attorney adjudicator's decision or dismissal, including the MA plan . Enrollee Fifth Level: Federal Court Any party, including MA plan (must notify all other parties) . Enrollee *An enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber may request an initial determination, redetermination or level 2 appeal, but cannot request a higher level of appeal without being the enrollee's representative. See, for example, 423.2002 for information on the right to an ALJ hearing. 70.2 - Amount in Controversy In general, the amount in controversy ( AIC) is computed as the actual amount charged (or amount enrollee would have been charged) minus applicable deductible , coinsurance or copayments . For Part D, if the basis for the appeal is the refusal by the plan to provide drug benefits, AIC is determined by using the projected value of those benefits , reduced by any cost sharing amounts including deductible, coinsurance or copayments that may be collected from the enrollee . Projected value includes any costs the enrollee could incur based on the number of refills prescribed for the disputed drugs during the plan year. For Part C, if the basis for the appeal is the MA plan 's refusal to provide services, the AIC is computed using the projected value of those services. Per \u00a7 422.600 (b), in applying the provisions at \u00a7 405.1006(d) to the calculation of the AIC in Part C cases, the reference to coinsurance should be read to include coinsurance and copayment amounts. For Parts C and D, appeals may be aggregated to meet the AIC. See \u00a7423.1970(c); [\u00a7405.1006(e) and (f) ].

Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 96 Level of Review Amount in Controversy Requirement Third Level: ALJ/attorney adjudicator Part C If the request for ALJ hearing shows that the required AIC is not satisfied, the appeal is dismissed at the OMHA level. Fourth Level: Council No amount in controversy requirement. If a case is reviewed by the Council, whether it is a review of a dismissal or a decision at the OMHA level, there is no additional AIC to be met with the expectation that the claim has already met the AIC for the third level of appeal. No additional AIC is required for the fourth level of review. Fifth Level: Federal Court If a case is appealed to the fifth level, the claim must then meet the AIC established by the Secretary for Federal Court review. Part C federal court: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Appeals -and- Grievances/MMCAG/Fed.html Part D federal court: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Appeals -and- Grievances/MedPrescriptDrugApplGriev/FederalCourtReview.html 70.3 - Filing Requests for Review At the third, fourth, and fifth levels of review, the request must be filed within 60 calendar days of receipt of a decision or dismissal from the IRE, ALJ/attorney adjudicator , or the Council, respectively.

If a plan sponsor , CMS , or the IRE requests participation in an ALJ hearing, how and when the request to participate is made is as follows: Request to Participate Filing Timeframes Standard Expedited If no hearing is scheduled, the request must be sent within 30 calendar days after notification that a standard request for hearing was filed . If a hearing has been scheduled, the request must be sent within 5 calendar days after receiving the notice of hearing. If no hearing is scheduled, the request must be sent within 2 calendar days after notification that a request for expedited hearing was filed . If a hearing has been scheduled, the request must be sent within 1 calendar day after receiving the notice of hearing. Where to Send Request Standard Expedited If the plan sponsor , CMS , or the IRE requests participation a fter receiving the notice of hearing, written notice of a request to participate must be sent to the ALJ and the enrollee. If the plan sponsor , CMS , or the IRE requests participation before the notice of a hearing is received or if no notice is required, written notice of a request to participate must be sent to the assigned ALJ or attorney adjudicator, or a designee of the Chief ALJ (if the request is not yet assigned) and the enrollee. If the plan sponsor , CMS , or the IRE requests participation, the request may be made verbal ly for an expedited hearing and OMHA will notify the enrollee of the request to participate. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 101 Note: The assigned ALJ or attorney adjudicator has discretion n ot to allow CMS, the IRE , and/or plan sponsor to participate. 70.4.3 - Submitting Evidence at the Third Level of Review An enrollee or other party must submit written or other evidence that he or she wishes to have considered at the hearing as follows: Part C Only Parties must submit all written or other evidence with the hearing request, or by the date specified in the hearing request, or, if a hearing is scheduled, within 10 calendar days of receiving the notice of hearing. This requirement does not apply to an unrepresented enrollee. Part D Only Submit all written or other evidence with the hearing request, or by the date specified in the hearing request, or, if a hearing is scheduled, within: 10 calendar days of receiving the notice of hearing for standard hearings (these submission requirements do not apply to unrepresented enrollees in standard Part D appeals (see \u00a7423.2018(b)(3))). 2 calendar days of receiving the notice for expedited hearings. If an enrollee wishes evidence on a change in medical condition (after the coverage determination was made) to be considered, the ALJ/attorney adjudicator will remand the case to the Part D IRE. 80 - Reopening and Revising Determinations and Decisions A reopening is a remedial action taken to change a binding determination or decision even though the binding determination or decision (i.e., initial determination or level 1 appeal) may have been correct at the time it was made based on the evidence of record. Given the remedial nature of a reopening, CMS e xpects the reopening process to be used sparingly by plans . If a plan routinely or excessively uses the reopening process , this may indicate that the plan does not have sufficient procedures in place for properly processing initial determinations and level 1 appeals . For example, frequent use of the reopening process may indicate that the plan is not thoroughly reviewing requests or is no t conduct ing reasonable outreach for missing information (see \u00a710.6 for outreach requirements ). Plans and other adjudicators shall not use the reopening process in a manner that interferes with enrollee access to the appeals process . Plan s may be subject to compliance action if found to be routinely using INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 102 the reopening process in a manner that interferes with enrollee access to the appeals process . When adjudicators reopen initial determinations or appeals, they must comply with the reopening regulations listed below: 42 CFR \u00a7422.616; and 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7423.1978 - 423.1986. Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7422.616(a), the reopening regulations in Part 405 (i.e., \u00a7\u00a7405.980 - 405.986) are applicable to Part C, unless otherwise specified. 80.1 - Guidelines for Reopening A decision to reopen is at the discretion of the adjudicator who has authority to conduct a reopening. Adjudicators with authority to conduct a reopening include: A plan to revise the initial determination or level 1 appeal decision; An IRE to revise its reconsideration determination; An ALJ or attorney adjudicator to revise his or her decision; or The Council to revise the ALJ or attorney adjudicator decision or it s review decision. The filing of a request for a reopening with the IRE, ALJ, or the Council does not relieve the plan of its obligation to make payment for, authorize, or provide benefits or services as specified in 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7422.618 , CFR \u00a7422.616(c) and information provided in this guidance. Part C Only 42 CFR \u00a7422.618(c)(2) does not apply to an ALJ decision following Federal District Court remand. Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7405.1140(a), a decision by the Office of Medicare Hearings & Appeals is the final decision of the Secretary, unless the Council assumes jurisdiction. Part 405 provisions (i.e., \u00a7\u00a7405.980 - 405.986) apply to Medicare Advantage Organizations, unless the subpart provides otherwise per 42 CFR \u00a7422.562(d). A reopening request: May be initiated by a plan, the IRE, ALJ or attorney adjudicator, the Council, or requested by an enrollee or any other party to the determination or decision ; May be made verbal ly or in writing; Should include the s pecific reason for requesting the reopening (a statement of dissatisfaction is not grounds for a reopening); and INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 103 Must be made within the timeframes permitted for reopening (as set forth in \u00a780.3). If the request for re opening is denied , the enrollee or other party must be notified that the determination or decision will not be reopened. If the request was received in writing, the adjudicator must notify the requestor in writing of the decision not to reopen. The decis ion on whether to reopen is binding and not subject to appeal. When a determination or decision is reopened and revised (including revision of the rationale for a decision that is not revised), the plan, IRE, ALJ or attorney adjudicator, or the Council that reopened the decision must deliver written notification to the parties to that determination or decision, as described in \u00a780.6. After reopening, a revised determination or decision is binding unless it is appealed or otherwise subsequently reopened. Only the portion of the determination or decision revised by the reopening may be appealed. The timeframe to request an appeal of the revised determination or decision begins on the date of the revised determination or decision. 80.2 - Reopenings Separate and Distinct from Appeals The reopening process is separate and distinct from the appeals process. When a party has filed a valid request for a level 1 appeal, level 2 appeal , ALJ or attorney adjudicator decision, or Council review, no adjudicator has jurisdiction to reopen a case that is under appeal unti l all appeal rights for that case are exhausted or a subsequent request by the appellant to withdraw the appeal has been granted. For example, if a party requests a level 2 appeal and a reopening of an initial determination simultaneously, the level 2 app eal would be the only action processed. As a result, a party cannot have an appeal and a reopening occurring simultaneously with respect to the same case. Part C Only An MA plan cannot reopen and modify its pre -service reconsideration decision after the case file for the adverse decision has been forwarded to the IRE, as CMS considers this an issue still under appeal. Part D Only A Part D plan sponsor cannot reopen and modify its decision if additional information is received after an appellant files a request for an IRE reconsideration or the plan sponsor is required to forward the case to the IRE, unless a subsequent request by the appellant to withdraw the IRE reconsideration request has been granted. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 104 Comparison of Reopenings and Appeals Characteristic Reopening Appeal Request by Adjudicator N/A Subject to Appeal Rights* N/A* Binding on all Parties Clerical Errors N/A *Although the decision whether or not to reopen a determination or decision is not appealable, an adverse revised determination or decision is subject to appeal. An adverse revised determination or decision as a result of a reopening must state the rationale and basis for the reopening and revision and any right to appeal the adve rse determination or decision . 80.3 - Timeframes for Reopening 80.3.1 - Timeframes for Initiating a Reopening The timeframe s for initiating a reopening are as follows: Reopening Entity 180 Calendar Days* Within 1 Year* Within 4 years* Any Time Plan N/A For any reason (if the case is not under appeal, see \u00a780.2) For good cause as defined in \u00a780.5 If reliable evidence exists (i.e., relevant, credible, and material) that the initial determination or level 1 appeal was procured by fraud or similar fault. Part C Only If the determination is unfavorable, in whole or in part, but only for the purpose of correcting a clerical error on whic h that determination was based. To effectuate a decision issued under the coverage (National Coverage Determination (NCD)) appeals process** INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 105 Reopening Entity 180 Calendar Days* Within 1 Year* Within 4 years* Any Time Part D Only Part D p lan sponsors may, but are not required to, classify and process clerical errors as reopenings. IRE, ALJ or attorney adjudicator, Council For good cause as defined in \u00a780.5 N/A N/A If the reconsideration or decision was procured by fraud or similar fault. *From the date of the decision . **When reopening is initiated by the plan . Plans must afford enrollees appropriate access to the appeals process by not repeatedly reopening initial determinations and level 1 appeals after denial notices have been sent. If the enrollee, provider or prescriber has submitted evidence after the initial determination or level 1 appeal request has been denied, the plan must ascertain whether the enrollee, provider or prescriber is seeking an appeal or a reopening (generally, thes e should be treated as appeals). 80.3.2 - Timeframes for Processing a Reopening A party to an initial determination has a reasonable expectation to the administrative finality of a determination issued by the plan . For reopenings requested by a party t hat the plan agrees to reopen, the reopening action should be completed within 60 days from the date of receipt of the party's reopening request. For reopenings requested by a party at the IRE level, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request for reopening, the IRE will notify the party in writing as to whether or not it shall reopen the case. If the IRE agrees to reopen the request, it will issue a revised determination within 120 days of receipt of the request. 80.4 - Reopening Based on Clerical Error For purposes of this section, clerical error includes human and mechanical errors on the part of the MA plan such as: INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 106 Mathematical or computational mistakes; Inaccurate data entry or coding; Computer errors ; or Denials of claims as duplicates. Part C Only An MA plan must remedy a clerical error (which include minor errors and omissions) using the reopening process instead of the appeal process. If the MA plan receives a request for reopenin g and does not agree that the issue is a clerical error, the MA plan must dismiss the reopening request . Although a party cannot appeal an MA plan 's decision not to reopen, the MA plan must notify the party of their rights to appeal the initial adverse decision, provided timeframes to appeal the denial has not expired (see \u00a780.6 for notice requirements). Part D Only Part D plan sponsors may, but are not required to, classify and process clerical errors as reopenings. 80.5 - Good Cause for Reopening Constitutes Good Cause for Reopening Does Not Constitute Good Cause for Reopening There is new and material evidence that was not available or known at the time of the determination or decision and may result in a different conclusion . The evidence that was considered in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an obvious error was made at the time of the determination or decision. In other words, the decision was clearly incorrect based on all the evidence presented in the appeal file. A change of legal interpretation or policy by CMS in a regulation, CMS ruling, or CMS general instruction, whether made in response to judicial precedent or otherwise. o Part C Only: This provision does not preclude MA plan s from conducting reopenings to effectuate coverage decisions issued under the authority granted by section 1869(f) of the Act . See \u00a7405.986(b). o Part D Only: Adjudicators may reopen to apply the current law or CMS or Part D plan sponsor policy rather than the law or CMS or plan sponsor policy a t the time the coverage determination is made in situations where the enrollee has not yet received the drug and the current law or CMS or plan sponsor policy INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 107 Constitutes Good Cause for Reopening Does Not Constitute Good Cause for Reopening may affect whether the drug should be received. A request to reopen a claim based upon a third - party payer's error in making a primary payment determination when Medicare processed the claim in accordance with the information in its system of records or on the claim form. 80.5.1 - New and Material Evidence In order for evidence to be considered new and material for a plan or IRE reopening, it must meet the following requirements: Was not readily available or known to the person or entity requesting/initiating the reopening at the time of the initial determination or level 1 appeal decision ; Does not include evidence that was or reasonably could have been, available to the decision -maker at the time the decision was made; and May result in a conclusion different from that reached in the initial determination or redetermination. In determining whet her the evidence is new and material, adjudicators must consider whether evidence is new and material from the perspective of the person or entity requestin g or initiating the reopening. 80.6 - Notification Requirements for Reopenings When any determination or decision is reopened and revised, (including revision of the rationale for a decision) , the plan, IRE, ALJ, or the Appeals Council must deliver written notification to the parties to that determination or decision, including to the plan, at their last known address. Plans should provide notification within timeframes outlined in \u00a780.3.2. Written notification must: State the rationale and basis for the reopening and revision; State the specific reason for the revision or change in rationale , written in a manner that is understandable to the enrollee; and Provide information on any appeal rights. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 108 If a reopening results in issuance of payment to a provider, a revised remittance advice notice must be issu ed. 90 - Effectuation When a plan's decision is reversed in whole or in part by any other appeal entity, the plan must authorize or provide the service or benefits as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, however, no later than the timeframes listed below (based on when notice was received). Part C Type of Request IRE Reconsiderations Other Entity Reconsiderations Standard Pre -Service Provide as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 14 calendar days . If it is not appropriate to provide within 14 calendar days, authorize within 72 hours. Authorize or provide no later than 60 calendar days Expedited Pre -Service Authorize or provide no later than 72 hours Authorize or provide no later than 60 calendar days Payment No later than 30 calendar days No later than 60 calendar days* * Special rule for when the MA plan seeks review from the Council. If the MA plan requests review of the ALJ's decision by the Council during the appeal (i.e. not on remand) , the MA plan may await the outcome of the review before it pays for, authorizes, or provides the service under dispute. An MA plan that files an appeal with the Council must concurrently send a copy of its appeal request and any accom panying documents to the enrollee and must notify the independent outside entity that it has requested an appeal. This delay is not available when the request for review by the Council follows a remand to the ALJ by the Council or a federal court. Part D Type of Request Other Entity Reconsiderations Standard Benefit No later than 72 hours Expedited Benefit No later than 24 hours INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 109 Type of Request Other Entity Reconsiderations Payment * Authorize payment with 72 hours, make payment (i.e. mail the payment) no later than 30 calendar days. *In addition to reimbursing the enrollee, when the plan sponsor or another appeal entity issues a favorable decision on a reimbursement exception request, the plan sponsor must also authorize the benefit going forward. Likewise, if a reimbursement request is approved for an enrollee who satisfied a UM requirement, the plan sponsor should reimburse the enrollee for the amount owed, and effectuate the drug going forward in accordance with their CMS formulary. In general, when the plan sponsor or other appeal entity issues a favorable coverage determination or appeal decision , the decision is retroactive to the date of the earliest request or prescription purchase approved in a coverage determination or appeal decision . Appeal entity means the IRE, an ALJ, the Medicare Appeals Council or a federal court with jurisdiction over the matter. Approved exceptions are valid for the remainder of the plan year ; therefore , all prescriptions purchased between the dates of the earliest prescription approved as an exception request and the end of the plan year are reimbursable. Note: A Part D plan sponsor may choose not to require enrollees to submit subsequent requests once a coverage determine involving a UM is approved. 90.1 - Independent Review Entity Monitoring of Effectuation Requirements CMS requires the IRE to monitor a plan's compliance with effectuating decisions that fully or partially reverse an original plan determination (denial). The process is as follows: The IRE issues a copy of the recon sidered determination to the plan. Included with this copy is a Notice of Requirement to Comply; Pursuant to the compliance notice and \u00a7\u00a7422.618, 422.619, 423.636(b) , and 423.638(b), the plan is required to submit to the IRE a statement attesting the plan has effectuated the decision in compliance with the IRE's decision. This documentation is to confirm when and how compliance occurred (e.g., service authorization, payment made, etc.). Notification to the IRE that the plan \"intends to pay for\" or \"inten ds to provide\" the service is not sufficient. The plan must provide the IRE with affirmative notice that the IRE's decision has been effectuated by payment or provision of the service. The plan's notice of compliance should be forwarded to the IRE concur rent with the plan's effectuation; If the IRE does not obtain the compliance notice within 2 weeks, it will mail the plan a reminder notice; and if the IRE does not receive the plan's compliance report within 30 days of the reminder notice, the IRE reports the plan's failure to comply with CMS. The plan is not copied on the notice to CMS. INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 110 90.2 - Effectuation Requirements for Former Plans A plan is legally responsible under its contract and the regulations to authorize, provide, or pay for all Medicare covered services or prescription drugs that are denied and upon appeal are found to be services the plan should have authorized, provided, or paid for its enrollees. CMS policy is that a n enrollee is entitled to receive a service and/or payment of a servi ce or prescription drug from a plan from which the enrollee either voluntarily or involuntarily disenrolled prior to a final decision on appeal. The plan must follow the requirements found at 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7422.100 , 423.104 422.504, and 423.505 as they relate to individual disenrollment or contract termination/service area reduction. 100 - Provider Notices in Hospital, SNF, HHA, and CORF Settings (Part C Only) Note: HCPPs are not regulated by the rules in this section. Instead, HCPP enrollees follow the Original Medicare immediate review process (42 CFR 405 Subpart J and Chapter 30 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual). 100.1 - Hospital Settings - Important Message from Medicare and Detailed Notice An enrollee has the right to request an immediate review by the Beneficiary and Family Centered Care Quality Improvement Organization (BFCC -QIO) of a decision that inpatient hospital care is no longer necessary . For all MA enrollees, h ospitals must deliver valid, written notice of an enrollee's rights as a hospital inpatient, including discharge appeal rights , using the standardized form, CMS Form R -193, An Importan t Message from Medicare (IM). To request a BFCC -QIO review (immediate review), the enrollee must follow the steps listed on the IM. If the enrollee does not make a timely request to the BFCC -QIO, the enrollee may contact his or her MA plan to request an expedited reconsideration (see \u00a750.2.2 for processing requests for expedited reconsiderations ), as indicated on the IM . Delivery and form instructions for the standardized notice (Important Message from Medicare) can be found in \u00a720 0 of Chapter 30 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual . For additional guidance, including a copy of the IM, see the Hospital Discharge Appeal Notices webpage. 100.1.1 MA Plan Responsibilities Following BFCC -QIO Notification of Appeal When a BFCC -QIO notifies the MA plan that an enrollee has requested an immediate review, the INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential. It is for internal government use only and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. 111 plan must : Properly execute and deliver (directly or by delegation ) a Detailed Notice of Discharge (DND), Form CMS -10066 , to the enrollee as soon as possible, but no later than noon of the day after the BFCC -QIO's notification . (Instructions for the DND can be found in \u00a7200.4.2 of Chapter 30 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual .) Ensure delivery of the DND, regardless of whethe r it has delegated th at responsibilit y to its providers . At an enrollee's request, the MA plan must deliver to the enrollee a copy of any documentation that it sends to the BFCC -QIO, including written records of any information provided by telephone. This documentation must be delivered to the enrollee no later than close of business of the first day after the material is requested. Provide, directly or by delegation, all information that the BFCC -QIO needs to make its determination , including copies of the IM and the DND (if applicable) . This information must be delivered as soon as possible , but no later than noon of the day after the BFCC - QIO notifies the MA plan of the enrollee's request . Note: The delegation of notice delivery or other functions is determined by the contract between the MA plan and its providers. The BFCC -QIO determines whether the MA plan and the hospital should make the information available by telephone or in writing. Pursuant to \u00a7422.622(f), t he MA plan is financially responsible for continued coverage of services during the BFCC -QIO review, regardless of whether it has delegated responsibility for authorizing coverage or discharge determinations to its providers. For information regardi ng responsibilities of the BFCC -QIO, please see \u00a7422.622(d). Skilled Nursing Facilit y (SNF), Home Health (HH) , and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Services (CORF) Settings An enrollee has the right to request an immediate review by the Beneficiary and Family Centered Care Quality Improvement Organization (BFCC -QIO) when a SNF, HHA, or CORF decides to terminate previously approved coverage (which includes an MA plan or contract provider directing an enrollee to seek care from a non -contra ct provider/facility). All enrollees receiving covered services in these settings must receive a Notice of Medicare Non -Coverage (NOMNC) , delivered by the facility or provider, before their services end.
