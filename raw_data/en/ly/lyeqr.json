Are they free really of adverse effec ts? Notes from the www.alternative-doctor.com website . by Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby \"All great truths begin as blasphemies.\" George Bernard Shaw. And my favourite, so witty and elegant: \"Let no one who has the slightest desire to live in peace and quietness be tempted, under any circumstances, to enter upon the chivalrous task of trying to correct a popular error .\"--- (William Thoms, deputy librarian for the House of Lords, c. 1873) Historical perspective Contagious diseases have been with Man since the da wn of time. There is even a theory that evolution is all about adapting and gaining new methods of resistance to predatory organisms, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites ( The Red Queen , Matt Ridley). What is really obvious, even to the non-sc ientific enquirer, is that not everyone falls foul of these pests. There seems to be a type of individual who can resist suc h host invasions, even when all others around them are ill . Doctors think only of the \"Germ Theory of Disease\", after Louis P asteur. But later thinkers have gone back to the idea that the microbe isn't the whole story - maybe not even that important. It's really an issue of susceptibility. When a dise ase spreads in the community, not everyone will get it. Doctors ar e glad of this fact. Those physicians who attended the Black Death or cholera did not die automatically. In fact they were surpri singly immune; probably something to do with a positive state of m ind \"I can conquer this disease\" is a fundamental belief of a physician - otherwise, why attend the sick? But those who are s usceptible will fall to acute illnesses, which are circulating in the community. Many factors influence immunity in a negative way, the two more important are chronic disease buried deep in the bo dy and nutritional deficiency. THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 2 The question of chronic disease genetically imprint ed on the body is something I will address later, on the topi c of miasms . The role of nutrition is seen in the fact that tube rculosis is rampant when malnutrition is common (the so-called AIDS of \"slim\" disease which affects Africans is largely TB and not AIDS at all). Up until the early part of the twentieth cent ury, the Western world was stricken with TB but it began to decline when the population became better nourished. The graph here shows that TB was steadily on the decline for many decades bef ore the advent of antibiotics or BCG vaccination. The truth is these vaunted scientific \"cures\" have nothing whatever to do with conquering TB and the myth that drugs and vaccines have been the reason for its decline is a false belief and da ngerous. We can even observe that during the War years, when foods were scarce, there was a temporary cessation of the fall. Low Doses The question for the modern \"holistic\" doctor (a mu ch overused term) is to seek for diverse ways in which we can i nfluence susceptibility and increase resistance to pathologi cal strains. Here there is a historic curiosity: William Hahnemann pu blished his homeopathic specialty (Leipzig, 1810) shortly befor e Edward Jenner began his famous unfolding of the technique of vaccination. Vaccination, by the way, comes from th e Latin for cow: vacca. Jenner worked first with milkmaids and noticed the y never seemed to get smallpox. He reasoned (correctl y) that they had usually been already infected with similar cow pox (Vaccinia) and that had conferred immunity against smallpox. D eliberate inoculation with cowpox, \" vaccination \", was the first method of inducing immunity in humans. THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 3 A medical triumph, there is no doubt. Vaccination c ould protect an individual from smallpox, then a deadly ravaging disease that killed or seriously scarred or blinded enormous num bers individuals. John Loudon McAdam, the Scot who gave us tarmacadam (now Tarmac) was blinded by smallpox fro m infancy, yet led a decent successful life. Smallpox has come under full control in my lifetime; my first mother- in-law caught it as a child (but did not go blind) yet the last reco rded natural patient with smallpox was in Somalia in 1977, an ev ent which heralded the actual disappearance of one of mankind 's greatest scourges. But was vaccination really the reason? Dr Viera Schreibner says not: \"Smallpox was on the way out, indeed epidemics disappeared decades before the WHO decided to condu ct the final \"eradication\" campaign. It is also well-documente d that the largest epidemics occurred in the most highly vacci nated populations, while whose who were unvaccinated, did not have the same epidemics.\" Couldn't improved hygiene and better nutrition have been the real reason this disease waned? Misinformation can actually be dangerous, since it by definition, obscures the real truth. In the words of Dr. M. Bed dow Bayly: \"Perhaps the greatest evil of immunization lies in its diversion of public attention from true methods of disease preve ntion. It encourages public authorities to permit all kinds o f sanitary defects and social problems to remain unaddressed, particularly in schools. It ignores the part played by food and sunlight and many other factors in the maintenance of health. It exaggerates the risk of diphtheria and works upon the fear of p arents. The more it is supported by public authorities, the mor e will its dangers and disadvantages be concealed or denied.\" What about polio? Wasn't that controlled by better hygiene standards? Or was it the \"miracle\" of the anti-poli o vaccine? \"That the polio virus is the sole cause of polio is accepted by most people as gospel, and that the Salk and Sabin vaccines eradicated polio in the western world is etched int o our collective consciousness as the major medical miracle of our t ime. But the history of polio and its vaccines is shrouded in a murky mist of politico/scientific manipulation, altered statistic s, redefinition and reclassification of the disease, increased cases of vaccine induced THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 4 paralytic polio, and monkey viruses transmitted by contaminated vaccines to millions of people worldwide.\" (Edda We st). What we are not generally told is that polio vaccin e is banned in several Scandinavian countries. They say it's no t safe. Our government says it's effective and harmless. Who is right? The Safety of the Low Dose Meanwhile William Hahnemann had showed that using small doses of a pathogenic substance ( pathogenic = \"disease producing\") could prevent a disease or even cure it , once established. He called his subject \"homeopathy\" fro m the Latin homo , meaning \"the same as\". He used very small doses o f the pathogen to gain control over the disease itself, a principle which we call a nosode. Very few doctors today would reco gnize this was the exact same process that Jenner later stumbl ed upon ! The question is: can the homeopathy super-low dose approach work in preventing major epidemic disease and was i t safe? We will now address these issues. An animal perspective Consider Dr. R Horace B F Jervis's account of the u se of a nosode to treat canine distemper ( Distemperinum ). In 1929, he published a monograph entitled Treatment of Canine Distemper with the Potentized Virus in which he describes the tremendous success he had. Quote: \"After a period of about twe nty-five years of fruitless struggling with distemper, having to c ontend with it day after day in an (extensive) small-animal practi ce ever and always having the same disappointing results, losin g the same large percentage of my patients all the time, I was led to earnestly seek some way out of this most trying pre dicament so of late years I have turned absolutely from the old and dominant school of medicine, and have taken up the study in earnest of homeopathy. And right here I wish to say that my on e regret is that I did not take it up years before... I became in tensely interested in the subject and bent all my energies to the study of it. My results were, and are, so much beyond my exp ectations that I am sorry not to be able to interest more vet erinarians to take it up and give it a trial. Anyone doing so, I venture to say, will never go back to the old school again...\" Distemper in dogs, of course, is almost uniformly f atal: \"This condition of affairs to one who besides being a vet erinarian, is a great lover of the dog is most disconcerting. To ha ve case after THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 5 case brought to one and see so many, despite ones e arnest efforts, die, whilst one stands by without any way of stopping this terrible arch-fiend, is simply heartbreaking to say the least How often has the earnest practitioner asked himself: C annot some means be devised to put a stop to this feeling of h elplessness? Cannot the ravages of this enemy be stopped by some means? Where is one to turn? The thought naturally came to me that as I had taken up the practice of homeopathy, why not tu rn to her in my dilemma?... I took the matter up in real earnest , feeling convinced that the fruit of the great Hahnemann sho uld throw light on the subject. I accordingly bent every effo rt and spare moment from a busy practice, and I herewith append the results of my labours: truly a labour of love, at that, as it meant the possible saving of many a sweet little dog who othe rwise would be swept away by this ruthless disease.\" Jervis had some distemper virus potentized by Ehrha rt and Karl, of Chicago, in the 30th, 200th, and 1,000th p otencies. \"Since commencing the use of this product the death rate in my distemper ward has been very materially decreased, and I have really for the first time in my years of practice f elt a sort of load being lifted from my shoulders.\" Can we apply this principle to humans? Well, of course, the argument is that what applies to animals doesn't necessarily apply to humans. Can you believ e that, with all the animal laboratory testing that goes on and the torrent of scientific papers using animal studies that purport to be relevant to human medicine? Understandably, some doctors will be extremely wary in taking the anti-vaccination line, because, as practising p hysicians, they face severe censure by colleagues and may be disbar red, for daring to suggest that vaccination is risky (which is bad enough) and that the dreaded homeopathy may offer a possibl e workable alternative (which is even worse). As a non-practising doctor, I can take that positio n and state plainly that in my view homeopathic nosodes offer a very viable alternative in vaccination in the treatment and pre vention of common contagious diseases. If you dare not accept this radical view but are unhappy with the dangers of vaccinatio n, which no right-minded person can deny exist, there is still good news: the combination of homeopathic treatment with conventional vaccination does very well at damping down or elimi nating the unpleasant after effects of a vaccination shot . That's not THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 6 saying you get the best of both worlds, but it is a valid stance for the caring parent, who faces extremely difficult de cisions, in the light of present knowledge and the mafia-like bully ing and know- best of medical authorities. The concern is that vaccination can make patients, especially young children, seriously ill, sometimes just as si ck as the disease itself. Modern vaccines are rather prone to do this; side effects and complications are not rare. They may al so have given rise to an \"allergy epidemic\", through damaging the immune system, as I wrote in the 80s. It is beginning to e merge that Gulf War syndrome, although undoubtedly characterized by chemical sensitivity and fatigue, is really a complication o f the many vaccines forced on the soldiers all at once and in a misguided overwhelm of the immune system. Furthermore, not al l vaccines work effectively. It now appears that the measles v accine only displaces the natural virus and instead gives rise to a new rogue variant, which itself is pathogenic. More to the po int, MMR doesn't seem to actually block measles, only to pervert its course into a new disease. The trouble, as so often, begins with official fudg ing and denials. Even the average doctor is kept in the dar k about possible complications and it must be appreciated t hat the vast majority of physicians give vaccines in good faith; having been reassured they are safe on problems \"only mild\". Th at's why it is vital that the voice for reason and caution remain calm, objective and non-accusatory. Otherwise it will not be seen a s a credible voice, just emotional overreaction. Official distortion of the facts goes back a long t ime. One strategy has been the entrenched refusal to classif y cases as diphtheria among the immunized, on the ground that they only present mild symptoms. According to the Medical Off icer of Health for Ipswich (see East Anglian Times, February 22nd, 1934), it has become the practice not to regard as diphtheria persons who, after immunisation, develop sore throa ts even though the presence of the Klebs-Loeffler bacilli ( hitherto considered to be diagnostic of the disease) can be demonstrated in them. Such a manoeuvre is not only bound to falsify all s ubsequent vital statistics [ to make immunisation look good. KSM ], but can be shown to be unjustifiable on grounds of medical pathology, for the assumption that mild cases are not likely to be diphtheria is not borne out by historical records. This is a clas sic case of \"It THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 7 can't happen, so it didn't\" and just to maintain th e status quo, evidence that shows it DID happen is \"edited\" and s uppressed. Commenting upon the advocacy of compulsory immunisa tion by Dr. H. E. Marsden in the Medical Officer on January 29th, 1938 and the Medical Times, March, 1938, declared: \"With the above recommendation we entirely disagree. We now know th at diphtheria, like smallpox vaccination is not altoge ther free from risks. Dr. Marsden's suggestion is, therefore, a mo st unwise one, and ought to receive no support from at least the m ore far-seeing members of the medical profession.\" Unfortunately, the more far-seeing members of the m edical profession were not listened to and mass vaccinatio n went ahead in 1940. Diphtheria. A Truly Horrible Way to Die If you wonder about the risks of vaccination, somet imes, consider Diphtheria. A child who develops full-blow n diphtheria is in a very sorry condition: a thick sticky membrane forms on the back of the throat and larynx and blocks the air pa ssages. The child cannot swallow or breathe and slowly over sev eral days dies of choking asphyxia, unable to speak and hardly abl e to cry out in misery. The stench of rotting membrane from the mou th makes the poor victim's plight seem even more repellent. There may be extensive heart damage and nerve toxins may produce permanent paralysis, even if the patient survives. Inexplicable collapse and sudden death often occurred during an apparent recovery phase. If you have ever seen this conditio n, you will bless the advent of mass vaccination. You need to u nderstand the mentality of the average doctor here. Whatever the problems with such a programme, there is no going back to th e old days of watching children die needlessly and horribly, when an apparently effective means to prevent it is available, even if the risks are high. Yes, the risks are high. Children have died in larg e numbers from vaccination \"accidents\". I am talking now of o fficial figures, not the vociferous contentions of the angry public. Not really surprising, since vaccines may contain animal brain s (BSE), animal faecal tissue (polio) and poisonous metals ( mercury as thimerosal ) But an ordinary doctor, no better informed, migh t think that the risks were \"acceptable\" because they were few and the potential benefits great. Now there new politic ally correct pressure, which is that it is unethical and irrespo nsible to not be THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 8 vaccinated because you will be putting others at ri sk, by allowing a population to develop without immunity. The issue is not really one of risks. There is a ri sk in every medical treatment; this does not make the doctor or surgeon guilty of evil. It is really a matter of informed consent . Parents should be told everything about immunization and then allowed to choose. The bullying of the medical fasc ists and their government lackeys is what the concerned and dissen ting doctor finds most exasperating. If everyone is forced to endure vaccination, then those who suffer are technically violated and assaulted. Only if parents may choose and then ther e are unfortunate complications, it's just bad luck and a tragedy. But not a reason for litigation. In neither case is the conscientious doctor the target. In this connection the unusually frank words of C. C. Okell, and member of the prestigious Royal College of Physicia ns and late bacteriologist to University College Hospital, are particularly significant. Writing under the caption \"Grains and Scruples\" in the Lancet, January 1st, 1988, he said \"On the whole diphtheria immunisation has proved a fairly safe affair, but s uppose we included in our propaganda a candid account of the various untoward accidents which have accompanied the proce dure . . . If we baldly told the whole truth it is doubtful wheth er the public would submit to immunisation.... Accidents and mistak es must inevitably happen and when they take place what mig ht have been a highly instructive lesson is usually suppres sed or distorted out of recognition. Those who have had to take noti ce of the immunisation accidents of the past few years know t hat to get the truth of what really went wrong generally calls for the resources of something like a secret service. And i f the technical experts have often been furtive and disingenuous in their methods, the public in its turn is unfair and vindictive .\" (p. 48.) [my italics, KSM ]. Please don't let the description \"unfair and vindic tive\" apply to you. What can homeopathy offer? We come then to the big question addressed in this article. If you are concerned about the efficacy and safety of immunization what can you do to protect your child? Does homeopa thy have anything to offer, other than just an avoidance str ategy? There is no need to address here the question that homeopath y is effective; that has been proven over and over (see Lancet , 1994; 344 ; 1601- 06). Diphtherinum , the diphtheria nosode, is an THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 9 excellent preventive and was used by homeopathic ph ysicians at the Homeopathic Hospital in Glasgow during a post-w ar epidemic, in which there were many fatalities, yet not one si ngle case died in the homeopathic hospital! But what about as an immunisation? Records have bee n published by Dr. Paterson of Glasgow of the results obtained at the Mount Vernon Hospital for Children (Homeopathic ). Diphtherinum in the 20Oth potency produced definite immunity, as shown by the Schick test turning negative within nine weeks, and some as early as three weeks. [ The Schick test is the injection (intracutaneous) of a quantity of diphthe ria toxin equal to one fiftieth of the minimal lethal dose diluted in salt solution. If the patient is not immune to diphtheria, then the i njection site becomes inflamed. A \"negative\" Schick test is there fore a good thing; it means the patient is immune by scientific standards. KSM ]. Moreover, Dr. Mitchell reports three children who w ere found to be Schick positive; two doses of Diphtherinum in po tency were given; two weeks later two of the children were Sch ick negative, the third became Schick negative a few weeks later, before orthodox immunization, so is does seem that homeopa thic nosodes will gently stimulate the immune system to respond and produce defences. This is so alien to conventional doctors, they cannot accept it. Of course major trials are needed to convince the profession and these are not likely to happen i n the present climate of medical fascism. Two words of caution: Dr. Paterson was most emphati c in urging that serum should not be given after a homeo pathic remedy. Very bad results had followed this method; other doctors stated that when the serum was given first, and the homeopathic remedy second, no adverse effects had followed. Sec ondly, the Schick test itself is considered by many to be unre liable in diagnosis [KSM]. Let us read together some words from a wise old lad y, one of the leading figures of homeopathy, who learned her trade before the rise of industrialized, chemical medicine, and was practising at the time immunization was introduced: Dr Dorothy Shepherd (Homeopathy in Epidemic Diseases.1967, pp .14-16) On Prophylaxis \"Epidemic diseases treated and nursed at home raise the problem of prophylaxis or prevention. Here again ho meopathy offers the best solution. Believe me, it has been s hown again and THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 10 again that our medicines given intelligently and ac cording to our law that 'like cures like' do not only cure infecti ous diseases speedily and easily without the development of any complications, but they also prevent these same dis eases. This is of great importance, particularly in the ca se of infants who have not enough stamina to stand up to an onsla ught of whooping cough or measles or diphtheria, or infanti le paralysis \"If one can prevent these diseases until the childr en are over five years of age, the disease is usually not so fa tal, and the children stand a better chance of survival. \"Of course, the modern methods of prevention of dis ease occupy much space in our medical literature, and ap parently they are successful to a degree. The agents used in prop hylaxis resemble crudely the medicines used in homeopathy, and some homeopathic physicians have been somewhat led astra y by this similarity to the homeopathic principle, and recomm end the present orthodox methods. \"Are the inoculations aga inst the various infectious diseases 100 per cent foolproof? Do they not in some cases lead to serum or vaccine disease? Is it not a fact that they often produce severe reactions ? Indeed, they have been known to lead to fatal consequences. Have I been mo re unfortunate than the average homeopathic physician in seeing the negative or disease-producing effects of orthod ox prophylaxis? Indeed I was not biased either in the beginning. I was extremely interested in prevention of such diseases as diphtheria and measles and the rest. It was a great disappoint ment to me to observe the frequent severe reactions in the wake o f immunization against diphtheria, and later on the u ncertain effects of inoculations against measles, whooping c ough, and scarlet fever. \"Now some of my fears of the dangers inherent in the modem methods of inoculations have been proved to be well rounded and correct. Some impartial medical observe rs in Australia have found that the incidence of poliomye litis, the modern infantile paralysis, has vastly increased si nce whooping cough and diphtheria inoculations have become more popular, and that the incubation period of infantile paralys is corresponds closely to, and follows exactly on the correct day after the inoculation has been made. It might have been coinc idence, if it had only happened in one or two cases, but unfortun ately it has happened in more than 5 per cent of the cases. (Not e: I have seen the same relationship between Feline Leukemia vaccine and the occurrence of Feline Infectious Peritonitis whi ch seems to follow the vaccine at a much higher incidence than one would expect) THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 11 \"At the moment doctors are advised not to immunize at the danger periods of the year, when infantile paralysi s is most prevalent. Whether this is the first step in giving up the dangerous method of immunization, one does not know . \"My own personal opinion is, that inoculation with any type of serum in any of these infectious diseases is harmfu l and can easily and safely be replaced by a remedy or remedi es, proved according to our Law of Similars that 'like cures l ike' on healthy individuals. Nosodes or disease products of the act ual disease are often most active preventives. This will sound revo lutionary to many doctors, but for years I have been in the posi tion to watch the results and after-effects, early as well as lat e, of immunization against diphtheria, and I have not bee n impressed. \"For years I worked in closest contact with an immu nization clinic and had to convince the mothers of the great advantage that would ensue. It was somewhat difficult to deal with irate parents later on, when they had been told that the operation was painless, and they saw the swollen, congested arms which occasionally cropped up. And it was even more diffi cult when a child developed diphtheria after it had finished it s course of inoculation! And as for that mother who lost her ch ild of a fulminating attack of diphtheria within eight hours after the disease started when a certificate of safety had be en issued from the clinic; I do not know how the immunizing doctor got over that (obstacle)! \"I was very unpopular, I remember, when the Medical officer of Health was told about this fatality from diphtheria , and he remarked 11 This would not have happened, if the mo ther had the child immunized\", and I retorted that she had b een well and truly (vaccinated) six months previously. I used to receive all the official publications on diphtheria immunization fr om the said doctor after this little contretemps, as if he was trying to shelter himself behind the official acts. \"I therefore have no hesitation in stating that from my own experience and observation , the homeopathic preventives are much safer in use, and absolutely certain in their effects. Even should the infectiou s, disease develop, it will be in a much milder form.\" On Whooping Cough \"(For a time) in my professional life I had no oppo rtunity to treat whooping cough. Parents accepted as a fact th at whooping cough lasted at least six weeks, or until well on i n May, and as it THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 12 could not be cured it just had to be endured. A doc tor was rarely called in. One day I procured a copy of Dr. Clarke' s monograph on Pertussin, the nosode of whooping cough (the potentized serum of this disease). My eyes were opened to the possibilities of cutting short an epidemic of this dread disease. \"At that time there was a small outbreak in the nei ghborhood of the clinic, so with the help of the visitors and nurses, we coaxed the mothers to bring the little sufferers to the clinic for treatment before the commencement of the session to avoid infecting others. The results with Pertussin in potency were so striking that I soon used it in all the clinics and nurseries I attended, both as a prophylactic and as the curativ e remedy after the disease had started. \"During the four years before the second world war, 950 cases were treated with the following results. One baby f ive months old died. Two mothers, having four children between the m, did not carry on with the treatment after twenty-four hours , preferring their children to be sent to an (allopathic) hospit al. These four youngsters were away from their homes for well over four months and came back a mere shadow of their former selves, requiring several months' convalescence at the seas ide, while the children in the same street who had been dosed with the small pillules of Pertussin were fully recovered after only a fortnight. \"It created quite a stir in that neighborhood at th e time, I believe. The severity of the attacks was mitigated at once. They diminished in frequency as well. Vomiting became le ss violent, and the duration was considerably shortened. It dep ended largely on the stage of the disease at which the treatment commenced. It was aborted under a week if seen within the firs t day or two. If seen at its height, it would take another ten to fo urteen days at the most, with greatly diminished severity. All the children escaped the usual complications. No broncho-pneumon ia followed, and we saw no wasting and no marasmus. It was indeed surprising how well they looked at the end o f the attack - they were often better after the whooping cough tha n they had been before. \"On another occasion 364 cases were given daily dos es of Pertussin for two weeks after contact Many of these cases we re seen in the day nurseries under my care - not one o f these children developed the disease. As two of the nurse ries took in children from two weeks old, it was most essential that they should not be exposed to the infection, and it was gratifying to find that Pertussin was a means of preventing the spread of the THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 13 disease. To quote an early experience - when I was not sure yet of the power of Pertussin in preventing the disease, a girl of five years old attended a private school. Of the twenty- one children in her class, eighteen were infected with a severe typ e of whooping cough. Only three escaped - two had whooping cough a year before, and the third was my little friend. How anx ious I was whether my little doses would work, and great was t he triumph when we were successful. \"The school doctor, whose own two children were att acked with a particularly severe variety of whooping cough aft er doses of prophylactic serum administered by himself, was wra th with the little girl's mother, because he would have it that the little one must have had whooping cough the year before withou t the mother knowing! He accused her of not being exactly truthful as it was impossible to prevent whooping cough. \"In another private school, a child came back after the holidays with a fully developed whooping cough, in spite of carrying a doctor's certificate as being free from any infecti ous disease. All the twelve children in her class were infected. The headmistress, on my advice, gave Pertussin 30 four-hourly, and the children had the mildest attack of whooping cough she had ev er seen. They enjoyed being ill, playing all the time in the orchard and in the big old barn instead of having lessons. Ten yea rs previously, she told me, whooping cough was inadvertently taken to her school. Weeks of great anxiety and hard work follow ed. Several night and day nurses had to be called in - it was a nightmare time for her. She was grateful to homeopathy, and to the nosode Pertussin for turning so serious a disease into a mild one. On Diphtheria \"I must say a few words on Diphtherinum - the diphtheria nosode - and its use as a prophylactic instead of t he popular immunization of the orthodox school. Our homeopathi c prophylactics are far safer and are not complicated by any early or late after-effects. Diphtherinum, the diphtheria nosode, is an excellent preventive and has been used by other hom eopathic physicians as well as by myself in hundreds of case s, with success. \"I have given Diphtherinum CM in unit doses and occ asionally Diphtherinum 30 in weekly doses for four to six wee ks, and I have not heard of any failures. Of course, it may b e argued that these children might not have developed it in any c ase - which may be true. THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 14 \"I am chary of advising diphtheria inoculations as a method of prevention of the disease. I was medical officer at a children's clinic, which served a crowded area in South London within the reach of eight big schools, with a population of se veral hundred scholars in each. We had a daily attendance of over a hundred children for treatment. We always knew when there h ad been an immunization session at any of the schools nearby, for they flocked in their dozens to us, having their swollen aims, the septic sores, and the dermatitis dressed within a few days . We used to give them - as a matter of routine - Diphtherinum 30 in daily doses, and got rapid healing and disappearance of t he lesions. Later results in many of the children who bore the brunt of the inoculations well in the early days, were crops of multiple warts on hands, arms, and in their hundreds on the cheeks and face, peculiar dark brown, almost black, minute warts, wh ich went on for months, but cleared up, almost overnight, at an y rate in a week or two, with repeated doses of Diphtherinum 30 .\" Suggested Dosage Regimes There are several approaches in using homeopathy as an aspect of managing serious and potentially fatal ch ildhood illness: As a stand-alone alternative to immunization As an adjunct, to quieten the side effects of immun ization As a disease treatment, once established As a means of altering the body's susceptibility to infectious disease (fortifying the immune system) Using it to effect changes if your child has already been damaged by vaccination Let us take each of these in turn. First this table lists the commonly available nosodes. IMPORTANT: a nosode is the potentized homeopathic form of a disease tissue. It is a remedy made from the products of a disease, e.g., a secretion, discharge, or lesion. It is not made directly from a culture of t he disease agent or from a vaccine. This is an importa nt point as there is a great difference in efficacy between a proper nosode and a remedy made from a culture or vaccine (which is generally ineffective in prophylaxis). A nosode in turn must be carefully distinguished fr om a potentized version of a vaccine. In the latter ca se it is the actual vaccine (with thimerosal, other adjuvants, culture medium and all included) which i s THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 15 prepared medicinally. These are used to mitigate ba d reactions to the vaccination . Beware: there is a great deal of ignorance about these details, especially among inadequately trained people professing to be homeopaths. The homeopathic nosodes that correspond with the di fferent vaccines and their diseases are tabulated below. Vaccine or disease Corresponding nosode Diphtheria Diphtherinum Pertussis Pertussis Tetanus Tetanus Tuberculosis Bacterinum about homeopathic potenc y scales, a helpful box follows: THE HOMEOPATHIC POTENCY SCALES There are two main sequences of dilutions used in h omeopathy. The first is decimal scale. The active substance is dil uted 10 times; the result is diluted a further 10 times (2X), the next step a further 10 times (3X) and so on. Thus 10X is a dilution of 1x 10 -10 or one thousand million in words. In Europe this sequence is labelled D for decimal (D4, D200 and so on). The second scale is centesimal (C). Thus 6C, a comm only used potency, has been diluted 100 x 100 x 100 x 100 x 1 00 x 100 times. 30C and 200C are also recognized as highly w orkable. Very high dilutions come at 1M (1,000C), 2M, 10M an d even LM (500 x 1000C) and beyond. There are several vaccinations childrens' polio, measles, rub ella and mumps. Personally I would not recommend to even bot her with polio Europe. The natural disease is extinct. Only the weird variant caused by polio vaccines is encountered, producing chronic fatigue states and post-viral syndrome. In general, higher potencies are used to treat the disease; only moderate doses are used as a prophylactic. If you w ant to substitute homeopathy nosodes for any vaccination, not under THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 16 the guidance of a skilled homeopathic doctor , you are advised to use 30C of the nosode, taken as a pill or a few pil lules, or droplets in water, taken twice on day one and twice on day two. Thereafter, administer it one day each month, two d oses on that day. Alternatively, and I use this along with most Germa n homeopaths, a chord or mixture of potencies of the nosode, typically D12, D30 and D200 together, taken every d ay for a week, then weekly for a month, then every month for as many years as you care to use it. Important: don't touch the remedy with your fingers and do not give it close to food. Avoid any contamination with coffee, peppermint and strong herbs or spices. SIDE EFFECTS: Yes, there can be side effects from homeopathy! We see this is the disease process bein g forced on the run in the body. But tissue reactions sometimes result from the fight, which goes on inside our bodies. This is natural and healthy and has nothing to do with drug side effect s, which are essentially matters of poisoning. Homeopathic effects are usually mild but can be qui te striking. From TB or Medorrhinum (see later section), the chi ld may become fractious or in a very bad temper, typically on day 4, day 10 and day 14 after the initial dose. Day 10 is usu ally the worst. Don't worry, don't stop the treatment and don't do anything to treat this reaction or you will block the process ( a common mistake that doctors make). Taken in conjunction with immunization injections Prepare the patient with Thuja 30C for 2 days befor ehand plus the potentized vaccine (not higher than 30C), dose= twice a day. DO NOT ADMINISTER THE NOSODE BEFORE THE INJECTION O R SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES MAY OCCUR. After the injection (same evening or starting next morning) give the potentiz ed vaccine (eg. DPT 30C or chord of D12, D30 and D200). Use a once a day dose unless symptoms of a reaction develop. If ther e is a reaction, it's a disease mimic, the so-called \"heal ing reaction\" and it needs treating with a mild form of the actual no sode, say 30C. Generally, reactions can be prevented by using \"dra inage remedies\" both before and after administering nosod es, which comes into homotoxicology (see later) THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 17 With or without immunization, your child may develo p one of these diseases. Don't panic! Nature is on your side . The disease is almost invariable mild if the child is well-nourish ed and not already chronically sick. The recovery process can be aided by the use of mid -range potency, about 200C, of the proper nosode ( not the potentized vaccine). Remember potentized vaccines do not confe r immunity or treat disease. They are used only to calm the possible after effects of an immunization shot, if you have chosen to go that route. But there are also specific compound and highly eff ective formulations for treating the diseases. Since this domain also is about altering susceptibility or treating the terra in (treatment approach 4 above). It is called homotoxicology. OK. What's Homotoxi- thingummy? Despite a clumsy name, homotoxicology is a wonderfu l natural healing science. It is a therapeutic branch, which enables deep cleansing of the body tissues, removing old toxins; disease processes and degenerative debris, leaving the flui ds clean, fresh and able to function as intended. Based on homeopathy, but not quite the same thing, homotoxicology is the brainchild of German doctor Hans- Heinrich Reckeweg (1905-1985). Knowing homeopathy a nd drawing on a vast knowledge of herbal lore and medi cines, he compounded a store of remedies, which trod a line b etween folk medicine and basic plant pharmacology. In the cours e of time it has proved itself so well that tens of thousands of German doctors use it in daily practice, although less wel l known in the rest of the world. It has been also called the Germ an system of homeopathy, though this is slightly comical, since a German, William Hahnemann, also invented the original syste m of homeopathy. Whereas so much molecular medicine is aimed at the cell, as if it were the sole seat of disease, Dr. Alfred Pischi nger, then professor of Histology and Embryology in Vienna, sa w with great insight that the extracellular fluids were the key to health. These fluids, which Pischinger called the \"matrix\", or gr ound regulation system, because it supports everything else, brings nutrition, oxygen, hormone messengers and other vital substanc es to the tissues and removes excretion products, toxins and the residue of old diseases. Cells may be important but not a sepa rate entity, THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 18 because they cannot exist without being nurtured in this matrix. Reckeweg pursued Pischinger's matrix model and devi zed ways to use natural substances to support, clean and revita lize the extracellular matrix. Most of the classic homeopath ic remedies are still there, though used slightly differently. I have reproduced a diagram of the matrix here. It' s the best I could find. I hope it sheds some light. It shows the matrix being fed by blood from the hea rt and drained away by venous blood and lymphatic drainage (doctors tend to forget this aspect of tissue hygiene). The connective tissue cells are floating in the extracellular flui d. The whole is supplied by the nervous system, which helps regulat e it. But many chemical messengers also control this matrix: hormones, of course. Also cytokines (literally means cell motivators ). Mixtures The characteristic difference is the use of mixture s, which classic homeopaths frown upon. But Reckeweg ignored the dogma and carried out decades of practical research , demonstrating conclusively that the formulations wo rked and worked well. He made compounds which would support the liver and kidneys, which would work for 'flu, diabetes, w omen's problems, stimulate metabolism, tone up the immune system, retard tumors, repair inflammation, act as pain-kil lers and so on. In other words these are function-based medicines. The mixtures give rise to yet another name you may encounter \"co mplex homeopathy\". Not all remedies are mixtures of subst ances however; some are single remedies in a mixtures of potencies (called a \"chord\", after the musical term for sever al notes sounding at once). THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 19 There are key advantages to using potency chords: Deeper action Fewer initial aggravations than classical dosing Doses can be repeated Broader spectrum of effect No problems selecting the appropriate potency No problems in assessing the duration or spectrum o f action Mixing high and low potencies produces an effect th at lies somewhere in between: rapid onset (low potency) and long- lasting action (high potency) Faster action Potency stages retain their own effects Six Steps to Death Six Steps to Death Six Steps to Death Six Steps to Death Reckeweg devised and ingenious model of disease he called progressive vicariation (progressive, in this sense , means getting worse ). The first three are excretion, reaction and depo sition. The poisons cause the body to first start to reject the toxin - excretion. In this model we look on a runny nose or diarrhoea as healthy ways to get rid of the toxin and these processes should not be blocked, but aided to conclusion . Let them happen! If excretion is not effective, the body will start to react to the toxin and symptoms will result. If the process continues, then there is accumulation of the toxin or the deposition phase. From here on things start to become serious. In the next phase, impregnation, the toxin becomes more permanently embedded in the matrix. Next comes the degeneration phase, where cells, tissues and organs become damaged and start to die and decay. Finally, we ent er the de- differentiation stage where malignant tumours are t he norm! Death can be expected to follow. We can summarize all this in a simple table like this: Locality of Tissue Changes Descriptive Term Excretion phase Humoral phases In the fluids of the body Reaction phase Deposition phase Matrix phases In the connective tissues Impregnation phase Degeneration phase Cellular phases In the cells and organs De-differentiation THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO HOMEOPATHIC ALTERNATIVES TO VACCINATION From www.alternative-doctor.com Page 20 NOW you understand the term homotoxicology. It is the investigation and removal of auto-toxins, that is s elf-generated toxins which accumulate within the body and cause d amage. NOT homeopathy, as such, you will readily see. But a ke enly related discipline. Unlike orthodox medicine (sometimes called allo-pathic, in contrast), we take the view that it is possible to reverse some of this degeneration process. Wherever you start, you can always improve it, sometimes quite a lot. WARNING: common sense says that the further down this series of phases you go, the harder it is to revers e the process. I've seen homotoxicology remedies work miracles. Bu t you cannot expect to cure everything if there has been a lifetime of abuse and overload. What Has All This to Do With Immunization? Simple. Immunization is all about rendering the bod y's defenses hostile to any potential intruder. So is h omotoxicology. Without taking on a specific disease treatment, hom otoxicology can ADMINISTRATION: All complex homeopathic remedies are easy to take. You simply place a few drops in water and swallow. They can be mixed together. Some formulations require you dissolve th e remedy in a litre or so of water and drink that throughout the day, then skip 2 days and repeat (one day on, two days off, if that' s easier) NOTE: I have used throughout the product names of major German manufacturers Miasms and susceptibility Homotox and Traumeel and Engystol A Word About Miasms Dpt potentized, easier than giving the parts, thoug h I would recommend MMR is given separately.
