The bill also specifies that CBOs are limited to specific health care services, that the bill may not be construed to waive or modify any duty a provider or payor may have for other health care services that do not violate a provider's or payor's conscience, and that nothing in the bill allows a health care provider or payor to opt-out of providing health care services to any patient or potential patient because of that patient's or potential patient's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The bill prohibits health care providers from being discriminated against or suffering adverse action for declining to participate in a health care service based on a CBO.

The bill allows health care providers or payors to file complaints of violations to the Attorney General (AG) and authorizes the AG to bring a civil action for appropriate relief. The bill also provides civil immunity for health care providers and payors solely for declining to participate in a health care service on the basis of a conscience-based objection, with some exceptions. Additionally, the bill prohibits a board, or the Florida Department of Health (DOH) if there is no board, from taking disciplinary action against a health care practitioner solely because he or she has spoken or written publicly about a health care service or public policy, including on a social media platform, as long as the speech or written communication does not provide advice or treatment to a specific patient or patients and does not separately violate any other applicable law or rule.

The list includes, but is not limited to, the right to civil and religious liberties, the right to participate in social and other activities that do not impact other residents' rights, and the right to refuse medication and treatment.

The bill amends the statute regulating distribution of hearing aids by hearing aid specialists and audiologists to limit its application exclusively to prescription hearing aids. The bill exempts individuals exclusively dispensing OTC hearing aids from regulation. This aligns Florida law with the federal rule which specifies that states may not establish regulatory measures or require licensure for individuals who dispense OTC hearing aids.

The bill removes the direct supervision requirement and the requirement that the physician be present in the office suite, allowing general supervision of such services from locations outside of the office where the services are provided. The bill allows self-referring health care providers to avoid the cost of having a physician present while health care services are provided.
