These treatment techniques are used mainly to treat injuries, various types of headache, muscular pain and tendon pain, and acute andchronic inflammatory processes [4]. The main reason for injecting homeopathic solutions into trigger points or into particularacupuncture points is that injecting the homeopathic remedy at that point markedlyintensifies the healing effect. In the case ofadministration at an acupuncture point, the penetration of the injection cannula produces a stimulus similar to that of anacupuncture needle. I) Method of administration for homeopathic injectables As already indicated above, subcutaneous and intravenous administrations were the first parenteral forms of administrations used inhomeopathy. They have been joined in the past50 years by others such as intramuscular, intracutaneous, intraarticular and periarticular forms of administration.These were among other things a result of theintroduction of new treatment techniques suchas homeosiniatry [3], neural therapy and biopuncture by J. Kersschot [4]. All these invasive techniques exploit the advantagegained by administering the homeopathic > INTRODUCTION Homeopathic injectables must be manufactured in accordance with the rules of the official European pharmacopoeia if they claim to be homeopathic. They are used therapeutically invarious \"special\" forms of treatment such as anthroposophic medicine, antihomotoxic medicine,combination homeopathy and classic homeopathy. More than 120 million ampoules of homeopathic or anthroposophic medicinal products are now manufactured and distributed in the EU every year. Over 90% of these products are produced byGerman homeopathic and anthroposophic manufacturers. The parenteral dosage form was first described in the specialist homeopathic literature in the 19th century [1]. Since then, homeopathic therapists have studied and made practical use of what wasat that time, a method of administration completely new to homeopathy [2]. Bergmann [l.c., 2] expressly states that it is advantageous for the homeopathic remedy if it does not have to pass through the gastrointestinal tract where it is severely altered by the gastric andintestinal juices. In this author's view, potentized homeopathic remedies work best when appliedunchanged to the mucosa or - even better - injected under the skin or into the bloodstream. However, the same author mentions that not all cases of disease can be treated using parenteral administration, and that it is up to the doctor to make the appropriate choice. He also recommendsusing the \"injection method\" only when the symptoms of the disease leave no doubt as to thechoice of the right \"similar\" and treatment via the internal (oral) route has failed to have any effect.The new method of administration does not in any way alter the homeopathic character of theremedy in question, the author continues. It also does not alter the validity of the Law of Similars,as is impressively demonstrated by specimen cases. In the same study the author also describes \"injections\" of high potencies (D 30 and D 300). The mother tincture was prepared by succussion with water instead of alcohol [l.c. 2, p. 67].The number of injections given depended on the course of the healing process.Homeopathic InjectablesHomeopathic Injectables3 Homeopathic Injectablesregion of tissue, and this stimulant effect is also supported by the pharmacological actionof the injected homoeopathic substance. The homeopathic substance may be a single-constituent preparation or a combinationpreparation containing several potentizedconstituents. This double stimulus - mechanical puncture and the stimulant effectof the homoeopathic solution - markedlyimproves any stimulating effect and speeds up healing. In a survey of 327 doctors conducted by HEEL, Baden-Baden, in 1999/2000 on thepractical use of homeopathic injectables, cited advantages of theparenteral form of homeopathic medicinescompared to the oral dosage form wereas follows: faster onset of action (77.1%), better tolerability (38.5%), better control of treatment (57.2%) and the ability to administer the substance at the site of the disease (72.8%). It is interesting in this connection that 61.2%of the doctors surveyed said that the homeo-pathic injection can readily be combined withother types of treatment (e.g. physiotherapyand/or allopathic medication). 5) Different forms of parenteral administration 5.1)Subcutaneous administration S.c. injection is the type of parenteral administration first described for homeopathicremedies in the literature [l.c., 1,2]. This type of administration is still today the most important for therapeutic practice, as itis the one most frequently used in bothhomeopathy and anthroposophical medicine. Asurvey of medical prescribers was conducted in 1999/2000 by HEEL, Baden-Baden, on thefrequency with which parenteral administrationwas used. A total of 327 doctors in privatepractice participated: 227 doctors of generalmedicine and 8 ENT specialists, 17 internists,51 orthopaedists and 32 doctors in otherspecialties (more than one answer possible).The survey showed that 72.2% were givinghomeopathic injections s.c., followed by i.m.,i.v. and i.c. administration. The overwhelmingmajority (87.8%) had been using homeopathicinjectables for more than 5 years. Almost aquarter (24.8%) of the doctors surveyed hadbeen using homeopathic injectables for morethan 15 years. Of the 327 doctors who tookII) The advantages of homeopathic injectables 1) No change in the homeopathic substances Avoiding the gastrointestinal tract by means of injection avoids any change in the homeopathic medicine through the action ofeither enzymes or the gastric juice. For thesame reason, it is well known that solid oralforms (tablets, globules or triturations) orliquid homeopathic remedies (dilutions) shouldbe held in the mouth for at least 30 seconds sothat the potentized active substances can bequickly absorbed through the oral mucosa andthe direct contact to the enzymes containingsaliva is as short as possible. The parenteralform of administration also adheres to thehomeopathic principles of the Law of Similars,since any falsification of symptoms isinvariably due to the incorrect use of ahomeopathic remedy, it is not a consequence of the method of administration used(written communication from the Germanvice president of the LIGA MEDICORUMHOMEOPATHICA INTERNATIONALISdated 8.12.1990, Dr. med. H. P\u00f6tters) [10]. 2) No viral or microbial risks Since every substance for injection in the EU has to meet the sterility requirements of theofficial pharmacopoeia as stated in theParenterals monograph of Pharm. Eur. 1997 , a risk of infection from this dosage form canlargely be excluded [5, 6]. In accordancewith Method 11, HAB - 2001 , the same requirements also apply to homeopathic liquiddilutions for injection. 3) Better patient compliance An injection is generally given only by the doctor or therapist. It is relatively unusual for patients to inject themselves with homeopathic injectables,although there are exceptions such as diabeticsand in anthroposophical medicine, wherepatients inject themselves with s.c. injections. 4) Improved action through injection When giving injections into acupuncture points or into Head's zones (segmental therapy) thetherapist is exploiting the fact that eachsegment or each acupuncture point isconnected to a particular organ or a region oftissue via the appropriate meridian. Injectionhere, targets exactly the connected organ or4 Homeopathic InjectablesImportance of the parenteral administration of homeopathic and anthroposophic remedies > RISKS AND BENEFITS Intraarticular administration in particular necessitates prior aseptic treatment of theaffected area of the joint into which thesubstance is to be administered. That is whythis type of administration is used mostly byspecialists such as orthopaedists, surgeons,rheumatologists, sports physicians and doctorsof general medicine [18]. With the intraarticular form of administration, however, account mustbe taken of the residual risk arising solelyfrom manipulation; according to a recent study,this can lead to microtrauma and nonspecificinflammation of the synovial fluid [11] in thejoint cartilage, particularly if the injection isrepeated within a few weeks, although there isnot necessarily a direct connection with a sideeffect of the homeopathic remedy. For thisreason, the authors stipulate that strictdiagnosis is needed, plus impeccable asepticpreparation of the site of administration.On the other hand, they [l.c. 11] consider asingle intraarticular injection of a small volumeto be relatively risk-free, provided asepticconditions are maintained during manipulation. By contrast with intraarticular injection, periarticular injection given s.c. is virtually risk-free, since the substance solution does notinfiltrate the sterile joint cavity but isadministered in the form of a wheal created atthe painful pressure points around the joint inquestion [12]. In this study 350 patients weretreated with the indicated homeopathiccombination product twice a week for12 weeks. Depending on the type of conditiondiagnosed, 2-8 ml of the injection solutionwas administered per treatment. No patientdeveloped side effects of any kind during thetreatment. III) Ri sks associated with parenteral administration III.1) Risk reporting It is undoubtedly right that any invasive use of a drug, such as parenteral administration, willcarry some degree of risk. This is equally trueof homeopathic and non-homeopathic orallopathic medicines. So as to formally establish whether and to what extent a risk exists in the use of a drug,the legislators introduced a legal requirementfor pharmaceutical manufacturers to documentdrug risks. Today, thanks to the statutoryprovisions and the principles of GOODMANUFACTURING PRACTICE, it ispart in the survey, 62 had an additional quali fication in homeopathy ,and 179 in naturopathy . Other results of this representative survey show, as regards injection sites, thatmost doses were administered at acupuncturepoints, trigger points and muscular pain spots.Administration is mostly subcutaneous, muchless frequently i.m. or i.c. The injectionvolumes commonly used are between 0.5 mland 1 ml and the frequency of injectiondepends on the type of disease and the courseof healing. 5.2)I.v., i.m., i.c., intraarticular and periarticular administration I.v. administration is used mainly in acute illnesses such as infections, feverish, septicstates, collapse [8] and for the excretion oftoxins such as heavy metals [9]. Amazingimprovements are not infrequently seen inpatients shortly ofthe indicated homeopathic remedy [l.c. 8]. I.m. administration is used mainly for rheumatic diseases and conditions which tendto be chronic. Since striated muscle tissue hasa good blood supply, it can be assumed thatabsorption of the remedy is good. Comparedto s.c. administration, however, i.m.administration carries a much greater dangerof vascular injury, which is why manytherapists prefer the less risky s.c. form ofadministration. In addition, infections andabscesses may occur after intramuscularinjection and tissue lesions may be caused byseparation of the muscle fibres, resulting inhardening and nodulation in the muscle tissue.This form of administration is extremely rarein anthroposophical medicine. In intracutaneous administration a wheal is created in the corium of the skin; this isproduced by injecting 0.1 to 0.2 ml of the drugsolution for each wheal. The wheal should notbleed and is usually completely absorbed bythe tissue within an hour. This technique isused with homeopathic solutions forhyposensitization and in combination withneural therapy applications. This type ofadministration plays the smallest role in termsof its frequency of use in practice. Moreover, it is painful and is often rejected by patientssensitive to pain. We would also mention at this point the intraarticular and periarticular administration of homeopathic solutions.5 5-year data, the period 1995-1999.The number of adverse reactions recorded forthe three manufacturers shown above is verylow if the number of adverse reactions iscompared with the number of ampoules used. The percentage proportion of adverse reactions for the homeopathic manufacturer is0.000036%. It should also be borne in mindthat the adverse reactions included in the tablerelate only to 21 homeopathic combinationproducts, which account for 61.5 millionampoules. However, this manufacturerproduced about 350 million ampoules in5years; the full ampoule range of this manufacturer covers more than 800 differentparenteral homeopathic combination products.It is also noteworthy that there is not a singleside effect report for the remaining 290 millionor so ampoules produced in the above-mentioned 5-year period. Similarly low numbers of side effect reports can also be found for the two anthroposophicmanufacturers. III.4) Comparison of risks on the parenteral and oral administration of a homeopathic combination product In a multicentre post-marketing surveillance study in 3512 patients [13] who received acomplex lymphatic remedy in the drops and ampoules containing 14 homeo-pathically potentized active ingredients,evaluation of the adverse reactions afterparenteral administration of the productrevealed just one side effect in 785 patients,corresponding to an incidence of 0.127%,whereas after oral administration of the sameremedy (as drops) 6 adverse reactions werefound in 3016 patients (0.198%). The adverse reactions observed after parenteral administration consisted of local redness, thosestandard international practice to document all suspected cases of adverse events associatedwith a drug and to make a medical assessmentof every suspected case which comes to light.Each instance must be reported to thecompetent authority. Specialist committees atthe competent authority evaluate all reportedcases and take the appropriate action,according to the degree of risk involved, whichmay in some cases result in the product inquestion being withdrawn from the market. The data given below are taken from the databases, logging suspected adverse events,of one homeopathic and two anthroposophicmanufacturers in Germany. It should bementioned that German homeopathicmanufacturers alone account for more than80% of the homeopathic parenteralsmanufactured in the EU. The figure forthe anthroposophic manufacturers issimilarly high. III.2) Type of adverse reactions reported The reports on adverse reactions, recorded in connection with the injection of homeopathicand anthroposophic injection solutionsconcerned: Local swelling and/or redness (> 90% of reports) Local pain (about 8% of reports) Allergic reactions (about 2% of reports) Severe, life-threatening side effects (e.g. anaphylactic shock) (< 0.1% of reports) Nausea (< 0.1% of reports) Abdominal pain/colic (< 0.1% of reports). III.3 ) Adverse reactions recorded in manufacturers' databases The following table shows the adverse reactions recorded in the side effect databasesof two German anthroposophic manufacturersand the largest German homeopathicmanufacturer of parenteral dosage forms. Manufacturer Number of Ampoule volume Mode of Number of ampoules sold administration adverse reactions 1st anthropos. 105 million in 1 ml and s.c. (98%), 13 manufacturer 10 years 10 ml i.m. and i.v. (2%) 2nd anthropos. 80 million in 1 ml s.c. 23 manufacturer 10 years i.c., i.v., i.m. (2%) Homeopathic 350 million in 1 ml and s.c. (ca. 60%), 22, of which manufacturer 5 years 2 ml i.v., i.c., i.m., s.c. 6 the parenteral administration of homeopathic and anthroposophic remedies > RISKS AND BENEFITS 0.034% after a retrospective study of more than 650,000 doses given in 99 outpatientorthopaedic indications. Bernau and K\u00f6pcke[18] report an incidence of three infections in105,000 intraarticular injections (about1:35,000). In another publication by Weiser in [15], a prospective post-marketing surveillancestudy theperiarticular drug with a complexcomposition. 48 orthopaedists in privatepractice took part in the study; they treated atotal of 643 gonarthrosis patients with theproduct. Overall, 5 patients (0.8%) showedadverse reactions. Referred to the total numberof injections given (n = 5531), this correspondsto a side effect rate of 0.09%. The adverse reactions recorded were exclusively attributed to local signs ofinflammation in the knee region, with 5 caseseach of heat and pain, 2 cases of redness, andone case with joint exudate. In 4 of the 5 casesof side effects, antiinflammatories andanalgesics plus a cooling treatment using icewere used to treat the symptoms. All sideeffects were completely reversible. III.5) Summary The data currently available demonstrate that both homeopathic and anthroposophicparenteral products have a very low riskof causing side effects. The parenteraladministration of homoeopathically potentizeddrugs thus has an extraordinarily low riskpotential when administered properly, as isshown by the literature [13-15] and by riskreporting data on adverse events from majorhomeopathic/anthroposophic manufacturers(see III.1 to III.3). In contrast, the risk of side effects for allopathic parenterals is much greater [16] andby comparison, practically risk assessments,particularly in subcutaneous administration. The parenteral form of administration has clear therapeutic advantages over the oral form, suchas the fact that the drug is not altered by theinfluence of the gastric acid and enzymes inthe gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, theparenteral form carries virtually no risk ofinfection due to the sterility requirementsafter oral administration of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Referred to the individual dosesadministered per patient, this gives a side effectrate for parenteral administration of < 0.012% and for oral administration of < 0.002%. Comparison of the results of treatment with the different types of administration (oral andparenteral i.m., i.v., s.c.) revealed the followingresults for the patients study(n = The three parenteral types of administration i.m., i.v. and s.c. do not differ to a statisticallysignificant extent as regards the therapeuticsuccess 3% not successful. In a further prospective post-marketing surveillance exercise with a homeopathicinjection product for the treatment ofgonarthrosis [14], a side effect rate of 3,7 %was found after intraarticular administration in1845 patients with knee disorders and a sideeffect rate of 0,45 % calculated on the basis ofthe total number of injections given(n = 14460). The side effects were all mild andreversible; thus, no treatment of the side effectwas required in 24 cases, and in 15 casesconservative or limited treatment wassufficient, e.g. in the form of ice packs; in afurther 29 patients allopathic drugs such asdiclofenac, ibuprofen and dexamethasone werealso used. The medical literature describes the intra- articular method of administration in particularas being relatively risky, as has been reportedby various authors. The risk of infection afterintraarticular administration is, according toBienvenido et al. [16], 1:7000. Other a complication rate of7 Homeopathic Injectablesthis type of dosage form has to meet. Since parenteral administration is generally performed by the therapist, patient complianceis high. In addition, the action of the homeo-pathic parenteral medicine in question can beimproved by administration to trigger points,acupuncture points or the \"loco dolenti\". In the author's view, the parenteral method of administering homeopathic / anthroposophicmedicines does not carry significant increasein risk of side effects, compared to oraladministration when administeredappropriately by a therapist, as demonstratedin the outcome study by Riley et al.
