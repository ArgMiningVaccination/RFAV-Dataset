Section 2 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7601) is amended by adding at the end the following: ''(29) On May 27, 2003, the President signed this Act into law, launching the largest international public health program of its kind ever created. ''(30) Between 2003 and 2008, the United States, through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and in conjunction with other bilateral programs and the multi-lateral Global Fund has helped to\u2014 ''(A) provide antiretroviral therapy for over 1,900,000 people; ''(B) ensure that over 150,000 infants, most of whom would have likely been infected with HIV during pregnancy or childbirth, were not infected; and ''(C) provide palliative care and HIV prevention assist- ance to millions of other people. ''(31) While United States leadership in the battles against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria has had an enormous impact, these diseases continue to take a terrible toll on the human race. ''(32) According to the 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\u2014 ''(A) an estimated 2,100,000 people died of AIDS- related causes in 2007; and ''(B) an estimated 2,500,000 people were newly infected with HIV during that year. ''(33) According to the World Health Organization, malaria kills more than 1,000,000 people per year, 70 percent of whom are children under 5 years of age. ''(34) According to the World Health Organization, 13of the world's population is infected with the tuberculosis bac-terium, and tuberculosis is 1 of the greatest infectious causes of death of adults worldwide, killing 1,600,000 people per year. ''(35) Efforts to promote abstinence, fidelity, the correct and consistent use of condoms, the delay of sexual debut, and the reduction of concurrent sexual partners represent important elements of strategies to prevent the transmission of HIV/ AIDS. ''(36) According to UNAIDS\u2014 ''(A) women and girls make up nearly 60 percent of persons in sub-Saharan Africa who are HIV positive; ''(B) women and girls are more biologically, economi- cally, and socially vulnerable to HIV infection; and ''(C) gender issues are critical components in the effort to prevent HIV/AIDS and to care for those affected by the disease. ''(37) Children who have lost a parent to HIV/AIDS, who are otherwise directly affected by the disease, or who live VerDate Aug 31 2005 12:51 Dec 2920 PUBLIC LAW 110-293\u2014JULY 30, 2008 in areas of high HIV prevalence may be vulnerable to the disease or its socioeconomic effects. ''(38) Lack of health capacity, including insufficient per- sonnel and inadequate infrastructure, in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions of the world is a critical barrier that limits the effectiveness of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and to achieve other global health goals. ''(39) On March 30, 2007, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released a report entitled 'PEPFAR Implementation: Progress and Promise', which found that budget allocations setting percentage levels for spending on prevention, care, and treatment and for certain subsets of activi-ties within the prevention category\u2014 ''(A) have 'adversely affected implementation of the U.S. Global AIDS Initiative'; ''(B) have inhibited comprehensive, integrated, evidence based approaches; ''(C) 'have been counterproductive'; ''(D) 'may have been helpful initially in ensuring a balance of attention to activities within the 4 categories of prevention, treatment, care, and orphans and vulnerable children'; ''(E) 'have also limited PEPFAR's ability to tailor its activities in each country to the local epidemic and to coordinate with the level of activities in the countries' national plans'; and ''(F) should be removed by Congress and replaced with more appropriate mechanisms that\u2014 ''(i) 'ensure accountability for results from Country Teams to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and to Congress'; and ''(ii) 'ensure that spending is directly linked to and commensurate with necessary efforts to achieve both country and overall performance targets for prevention, treatment, care, and orphans and vulner-able children'. ''(40) The United States Government has endorsed the prin- ciples of harmonization in coordinating efforts to combat HIV/ AIDS commonly referred to as the 'Three Ones', which includes\u2014 ''(A) 1 agreed HIV/AIDS action framework that pro- vides the basis for coordination of the work of all partners; ''(B) 1 national HIV/AIDS coordinating authority, with mandate; and ''(C) 1 agreed HIV/AIDS country-level monitoring and evaluating system. ''(41) In the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases, of April 26-27, 2001 (referred to in this Act as the 'Abuja Declaration'), the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\u2014 ''(A) declared that they would 'place the fight against HIV/AIDS at the forefront and as the highest priority issue in our respective national development plans'; ''(B) committed 'TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSI- BILITY AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP for the activities of the National AIDS Commissions/Councils'; VerDate Aug 31 2005 12:51 LAW 110-293\u2014JULY 30, 2008 ''(C) resolved 'to lead from the front the battle against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Dis-eases by personally ensuring that such bodies were properly convened in mobilizing our societies as a whole and pro-viding focus for unified national policymaking and pro-gramme implementation, ensuring coordination of all sec-tors at all levels with a gender perspective and respect for human rights, particularly to ensure equal rights for people living with HIV/AIDS'; and ''(D) pledged 'to set a target of allocating at least 15% of our annual budget to the improvement of the health sector'.''.
