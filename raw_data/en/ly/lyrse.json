These are possible early signs of [meningitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350508). [Bacterial meningitis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/bacterial-meningitis) can become very serious very quickly\u2014and even be deadly\u2014,so it is important to be aware of meningitis symptoms. Acupuncture and TCM can provide adjunct treatment for meningitis in addition to conventional medicine. [Meningitis](https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/index.html) is a general term for any kind of swelling or [inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) in the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. These membranes are called the meninges. Sometimes called \"spinal meningitis,\" this type of inflammation is most often caused by either a bacterial infection or viral infection, but other things can cause meningitis, too. The bacteria and viruses that can cause meningitis can be spread from person to person in the same ways as most colds, flus, and other infections. If you suspect you may have bacterial meningitis, it is important to seek treatment right away. Similar to [encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-encephalitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), this illness can progress quickly, sometimes causing seizures and even death. Even after meningitis moves past an acute phase, many people will suffer from after effects and complications of meningitis, like headaches, vision or hearing problems, or cognitive issues. TCM and acupuncture can help people recover more fully from the effects of brain swelling due to meningitis. Top 5 Types of Meningitis: Swelling in brain can be caused by meningitis bacteria, or can manifest due to a virus or some other condition. [Causes of meningitis](https://www.healthline.com/health/meningitis#types) can include: - Bacterial meningitis - meningitis can be triggered by various bacteria, such as the kinds that cause [strep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-sore-throat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)throat, [pneumonia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pneumonia-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), tuberculosis, and [colds](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)and flu. This type of meningitis can become serious, even causing death if left untreated. Symptoms usually appear quite suddenly, and can worsen in a matter of hours. - Viral meningitis - Viruses that can cause caused by these types of viral infection is milder than bacterial meningitis. Certain types of meningitis are also associated with [HIV/AIDS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Certain types of cancer - if a cancer tumor, such as a brain tumor, or a breast cancer tumor, begin to break apart and move through the body, they can get into the meninges and cause carcinomatous [meningitis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/carcinomatous-meningitis). - Lupus - sometimes meningitis can be part of an autoimmune response that affects the central nervous system, such as occurs with [Lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Injury to the head or spine, brain surgery - swelling around the brain can be caused by some kind of external physical trauma Meningitis can also be caused by a fungus or parasite that gets into the body. The effects of meningitis, especially [bacterial meningitis,](https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/bacterial.html) can be very serious, so if you see a combination of symptoms from those listed below, you should seek urgent medical attention. Top 10 Meningitis Symptoms: Brain swelling symptoms or symptoms for meningitis can include: - Fever - Nausea and/or vomiting - Stiff neck, [neck stiffness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Severe [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Meningitis rash on any part of the body: small red spots, red blotches, blood blisters - Aversion to bright light - Fatigue, sleepy, hard to stay awake - Confusion, delirious, foggy head, difficulty concentrating [Seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - No appetite or thirst In infants and young children, [signs of meningitis](https://www.meningitis.org/meningitis/check-symptoms) might include: crying, not wanting to eat, hard to wake up, high fever, stiffness in the body, swelling or bulging on the top of the head (fontanel). There are a few types of meningitis vaccine, or meningococcal vaccine, which can help to prevent bacterial meningitis. Diagnosis and Treatment for Meningitis When a patient presents with these types of symptoms, a doctor will probably want to err on the side of caution and test for bacterial meningitis, since time is of the essence when treating what could be a very [serious condition](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis). Blood tests, CT scan, or MRI may all be used to check for signs, but a spinal tap to collect cerebrospinal fluid is considered the definitive way to confirm a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics and corticosteroid medications to get rid of the bacterial infection and reduce swelling. Viral meningitis will not respond to antibiotics. Some doctors may prescribe steroid medications to reduce swelling. It can take longer to figure out what is causing swelling in the brain if it is caused by some other factor, such as a fungal infection, or in relation to an autoimmune disorder. In some cases, a doctor may choose to start treating with antibiotics and/or antivirals until the root cause is determined. Even after meningitis treatment, some people will continue to have [after effects](https://www.meningitis.org/meningitis/after-effects), some of which can even lead to disability. Cognitive problems with [memory](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and concentration, vision problems, headaches, [tinnitus (ringing in the ears)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), problems with balance and coordination, and even seizures, can be some of the long-term effects of meningitis. Acupuncture and TCM can be very helpful for treating these lingering symptoms of meningitis. Can Acupuncture Help Meningitis? In Traditional Chinese medicine, we classify many infectious diseases\u2014including cold and flu, strep throat, chicken pox, SARS, tuberculosis, and meningitis\u2014as \"warm\" diseases. When these types of external pathogens get into the body, they cause fever, which depletes the Yin (cool, liquid) energy of the body. The TCM approach, then, is primarily to clear the heat. TCM has its own way of looking at symptoms occurring in a pattern, from which we deduce what kind of pathogenic forces are creating disharmony. The TCM view of meningitis is that it relates to an invasion of Heat that leads to a deficiency of Yin energy. A pattern of symptoms that includes: fever, red skin rash, irritability, confusion, and trouble sleeping would indicate that pathogenic heat is depleting the body of fluids and affecting the pericardium, which in TCM means \"protector of the heart.\" When these symptoms are present, we know that there is inflammation causing swelling of tissues and preventing the smooth flow of nutrition and Qi to the vital organs. Chinese herbs and acupuncture can help [reduce inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003708/) that causes symptoms of meningitis. [Chinese herbal](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32393) formulations that go back centuries can also have antibacterial and antiviral effects. Acupuncture [treatment](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN102000257A/en) can not only help, then, the root cause of meningitis, but can also deal with the symptoms many people experience as a result of swelling in the brain, such as [headaches](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31953043/), dizziness, and spasms. Acupuncture Near Me for Meningitis - Los Angeles Area Meningitis is a condition that needs urgent care because it can be a very serious illness in the short-term. Meningitis can also lead to long-term effects that are debilitating. Acupuncture and TCM can provide relief and recovery from meningitis symptoms. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Trigeminal Neuralgia With Acupuncture and TCM & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Sudden, sharp, shooting pain in the cheek or jaw that feels like an electric shock? Intense facial pain that lasts for a few seconds or a few minutes, and then goes away? This could be a sign of [Trigeminal Neuralgia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/trigeminal-neuralgia), a type of nerve pain or [neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) that affects the nerves in the face. [TCM and acupuncture provide](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Fulltext/2019/01250/Acupuncture_treatment_on_idiopathic_trigeminal.59.aspx) a safe, effective trigeminal neuralgia treatment to relieve pain. [Trigeminal neuralgia](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Trigeminal-Neuralgia-Fact-Sheet) is a chronic pain disorder associated with the [trigeminal nerve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848459/), which branches out across the face along each eye, cheek, and the upper and lower jaws. It communicates signals from the face to the brain related to pressure and temperature, and is also involved with the motor action of chewing. Neuropathy is a general term that refers to any kind of nerve damage or dysfunction that leads to sensations of pain, tingling, or numbness. When there is something wrong with the trigeminal nerve-maybe compression, a lesion on the nerve, or some other problem-then even a light touch, or eating something hot or cold, can cause a very intense pain signal. Trigeminal neuralgia is sometimes called tic douloureux, meaning \"painful tic,\" because the jolt of pain causes people to wince or grimace. Sometimes people think the pain they're feeling is [dental pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). The pain of trigeminal neuralgia is often described in terms like: stabbing, burning, and excruciating pain. Sometimes people say it feels like a sudden electric shock. This pain may last only a few seconds, or a few minutes, or it can come and go over the course of hours or days. [Occipital neuralgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-occipital-neuralgia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) is a similar condition, in which the pain is in the back of the head and upper part of the neck. This occurs when the occipital nerves are irritated. [Trigeminal neuralgia](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/trigeminal-neuralgia-tic-douloureux-a-to-z) pain often flares up on just one side of the face, sometimes isolated to one area. Pain may be around or behind the eye, across the cheek, along the jaw, or inside the mouth. Doctors categorize [trigeminal neuralgia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15671-trigeminal-neuralgia-tn) into 2 types: - Type 1 - Typical - facial pain occurs in sporadic, sudden bursts which may last seconds or minutes, or come and go over the course of a few hours. There are periods of times between episodes when there is no pain. - Types 2 - Atypical - pain in face is constant, with aching, burning sensations present over a widespread area. Trigeminal neuropathy is similar in some ways to other cranial neuropathy conditions like [Bell's Palsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). In the case of Bell's palsy, lack of blood flow to the 7th cranial nerve causes a temporary paralysis of the facial muscles and one side of the face to droop. Bell's Palsy usually goes away after a while, but Trigeminal neuropathy tends to become a chronic condition that gets worse as time goes on. Acupuncture and TCM are an excellent way to help relieve pain and dysfunction due to all types of neuropathies, including Bell's Palsy, peripheral neuropathy, [sciatica/sciatic nerve pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), can help not only to relieve pain caused by nerve disorders, but can actually help to repair damaged nerves, regenerate nerve tissues, and facilitate better communication throughout the nervous system. Top 10 Trigeminal Neuralgia Triggers Trigeminal neuralgia pain can occur spontaneously for no apparent reason, but it is often triggered by some sort of touch, movement, or other stimulus. Some common [triggers of trigeminal neuralgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/trigeminal-neuralgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353344) pain include: - Brushing your teeth - Eating or drinking something hot, cold, or spicy - Touching your face, leaning your face on your hand - Shaving facial hair - Putting on makeup - Washing your face - Talking - Smiling, laughing - A breeze blowing in your face, wind in your face - Vibrations from being in a car or airplane, etc. While the nerve pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is not life-threatening, and doesn't really affect your ability to move your face, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have an impact on your life. Never knowing when you might suddenly experience severe pain is debilitating. Many people with this type of neuropathy pain can fall into a [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and even begin to experience suicidal thoughts because the thought of having to live with this kind of pain forever is scary. What Causes Trigeminal Neuralgia? [Trigeminal neuralgia](https://medlineplus.gov/trigeminalneuralgia.html) tends to occur more frequently in women, and in people who are over 50. While the exact cause is not always apparent, it usually has to do with a blood vessel creating extra pressure somewhere along the nerve. Sometimes it can be due to a head injury or a tumor in the brain. [Multiple sclerosis (MS)](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-ms-how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can sometimes contribute to trigeminal neuralgia. Sometimes people develop trigeminal neuralgia after a dental procedure. Trigeminal Neuralgia Treatment Medications The [medications](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/in-depth/pain-medications/art-20045004) most commonly prescribed for people suffering from trigeminal neuralgia are a class of drugs called anticonvulsants. These medications were originally intended to be used to treat [seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and epilepsy, but they have been found to help some people with neuropathy pain, too. Medicines like Neurontin and Topamax can help disrupt the nerve signals that are causing the pain. The side effects of these medications can include a patient has not found relief from trigeminal neuralgia nerve pain with medication, then [ surgery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28298026/) may be attempted. Doctors may drill into the skull to expose the trigeminal nerve and try to remove blood vessels that may be pressing against the nerve. This is called microvascular decompression (MVD), and is an invasive operation that carries risks and requires a few weeks of recovery time. Not everyone gets pain relief from this procedure, in which case, other options may be tried. [Gamma knife radiosurgery](https://thejns.org/view/journals/j-neurosurg/119/5/article-p1166.xml) and Radiofrequency lesioning are less invasive procedures that involve applying radiation or heat from an electrode to the trigeminal nerve. The idea is to purposely damage the nerve in order to stop the pain signals. In some cases, this can lead to numbness, or loss of sensation in the face. For some patients, the pain comes back in a matter of years, in which case the surgery can be repeated. Acupuncture offers an alternative treatment that can relieve pain from trigeminal neuralgia without side effects or risk of permanent nerve damage. Can Acupuncture Help Trigeminal Neuralgia? According to the TCM view, different people can suffer from the same type of pain condition or disease but have different underlying problems that are the root cause of the pain. When treating individual patients, an acupuncture practitioner first listens carefully and observes all of a person's symptoms to determine what kind of internal pathogens or imbalances may be contributing to the pain disorder. In the case of [trigeminal neuralgia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315493972_Two_Case_Reports_Acupuncture_Treatment_for_Trigeminal_Neuralgia), the cause may be related to a blockage in the stomach meridian, which extends into the same facial areas as the trigeminal nerve does. As with other neurological conditions (like Bell's Palsy and [Parkinson's disease)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), this blockage may be related to an invasion of wind, either hot or cold, that affects the flow of Qi through the face and head. In addition to acupuncture treatment, Chinese herbs can help strengthen Qi and help with the rejuvenation of nerve cells. It is also important for a person struggling with trigeminal neuralgia to be cautious of eating or drinking anything that is too hot or too cold. It is also advised that you avoid spicy foods, caffeine, sugar, and processed foods. [Acupuncture works](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2018/03160/acupuncture_for_the_treatment_of_trigeminal.9.aspx) as a natural analgesic to relieve pain, affecting the way that nerve cells transmit pain signals and activating the opioid receptors in the brain. A [case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797593/) of a woman who had suffered from trigeminal neuralgia pain for 25 years found that after six weeks of acupuncture treatment, she was free of pain, and was still free of pain six months later. A [review of studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0964528420924042?journalCode=aima) related to trigeminal neuralgia treatments concluded that acupuncture was more effective for pain management of trigeminal neuralgia than medication or surgery, and had fewer adverse effects than either of the other solutions. Over a five year period, acupuncture treatment also cost significantly less money than other treatments. A [study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1505-acupuncture-reduces-trigeminal-neuralgia-pain) that compared patients who had had trigeminal neuralgia symptoms for an average of 10 years. Half were treated with acupuncture and the other half treated with the anticonvulsant medication Carbamazepine. The acupuncture group reported a higher percentage of effective pain reduction; 95% of the patients found relief, with 30 out of 40 people reporting that their pain was totally resolved. [One study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acu.2008.0640) of a dozen patients treated with acupuncture found that all of the participants had reduced pain, to the point that they no longer needed to take medications for trigeminal neuralgia. Acupuncture Near Me for Trigeminal Neuralgia in the Los Angeles Area Trigeminal neuralgia can have a serious impact on a person's quality of life. The pain of this nerve condition can be so extreme that it inspires fear and depression. The standard medical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia don't work for everyone, and they can come with significant negative side effects.

[ How to Treat ALS With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-als-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Muscle fatigue, muscle twitching, muscle cramps, slurred speech? These are some of the early signs of [ALS](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is also commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease (or Lou Gherig's disease). ALS is a rare progressive neurological disorder. [Acupuncture and TCM](https://alstreatment.com/acupuncture-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/) can help to manage the symptoms of ALS and slow the progress of this degenerative motor neuron disease. [ALS](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Fact-Sheet) is a neurological disease that affects the motor neurons (or nerve cells) in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary movements. Over time, people with ALS develop muscular problems that make it hard for them to walk, talk, eat, drive, and perform all kinds of daily activities. As more neurons break down, the muscles can begin to waste away. ALS can also lead to speech problems and changes in personality. Some patients with ALS will develop respiratory problems that make it very difficult to breathe. In the early [stage of ALS](https://www.mda.org/disease/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/signs-and-symptoms/stages-of-als), people may have muscle spasms, fatigue, and only some of the body is affected. As the disease progresses to the middle stage, they may begin to have more muscle twitches (fasciculations) or contractures, which is when the joints become painfully stiff and rigid. This can eventually lead to paralysis, and a person having to use a wheelchair. Eventually, ALS can affect breathing and eating to the point that a person is not getting sufficient oxygen or nutrition, which can cause [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and an [inability to concentrate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Unfortunately, ALS often leads to other serious illnesses that are fatal. People with ALS may develop severe respiratory problems or [pneumonia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pneumonia-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Some patients may have [cardiac arrhythmias](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or pulmonary embolism. Medical treatments for ALS can, in some cases, help slow down the degeneration of the nerve cells and prolong life. [Acupuncture](https://alsnewstoday.com/non-drug-therapies/acupuncture/) and TCM offer an effective adjunct to standard treatment for ALS that may help to improve motor ability, speech, and breathing. Acupuncture has been used successfully to manage ALS and many other Causes ALS? While only 5-10% of people with ALS seem to have inherited it, [genetics](https://www.als.org/research/research-we-fund/scientific-focus-areas/genetics) are considered likely to be a factor. As with other conditions, like CF, one parent may not show any signs of the disease, but may have the genetic mutation that causes ALS in their DNA. Having a genetic mutation that affects the way a protein functions or doesn't function may be what causes cell degeneration like that of ALS. Medical science has not determined the exact cause of ALS, but it may also have to do with some environmental or behavioral factors. For example, because rates of ALS are higher amongst athletes and members of the military, it has been posited that there may be some correlation to high levels of exertion and the breakdown of motor neurons. Top 10 Symptoms of ALS [Signs of ALS](https://www.mda.org/disease/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/signs-and-symptoms) may be slow to develop, and are sometimes misinterpreted as symptoms of other neurological disorders, like MS. [Both ALS and MS](https://www.verywellhealth.com/als-and-ms-symptoms-2440783) can start off with seemingly minor symptoms like muscle twitching, or weakness in the legs. But over time, ALS will begin affect speech and swallowing, while MS is more likely to cause numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, and [vision problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). MS symptoms may come and go, while ALS is usually marked by a steady decline as the disease progresses. [Muscular dystrophy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-muscular-dystrophy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also have similar symptoms. The most common symptoms of Lou Gehrig's disease/ALS include: - Having trouble grasping items or lifting things - Muscle weakness, muscle cramps, muscle twitches, charley horse - Arms and legs become fatigued easily, trouble walking, trip easily - Voice sounds higher, more nasal when speaking - Slurred speech - Difficulty chewing and swallowing, choking on liquids - Eyes or mouth don't close all the way - Bouts of uncontrolled laughing, crying, or yawning - Easily frustrated or confused - Feelings of anxiety or suspicion As ALS progresses, secondary problems like malnutrition due to difficulty eating, trouble breathing, or emotional symptoms may become more prominent. ALS may also lead to problems with incontinence and control of the bowels. Diagnosis and Treatment for ALS ALS is not considered an autoimmune disease, although recent [research](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/autoimmune-diseases-in-als-patients-linked-to-genetic-mutation/) suggests that some people with ALS are more prone to developing autoimmune disorders because they have a particular genetic mutation that affects the production of virus-sensing immune cells. As with autoimmune disorders like [lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), Addison's disease, [fibromyalgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome, [Myasthenia Gravis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-myasthenia-gravis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [rheumatoid arthritis (RA)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), it can be difficult to get a [diagnosis for ALS](https://www.mda.org/disease/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/diagnosis). If ALS is suspected, a doctor will first do an [examination](https://www.als.org/understanding-als/symptoms-diagnosis) looking at motor and nerve function. Next, they will do an EMG, a test to check the electrical signals between the nervous system and the muscles. An MRI may show whether there is damage to the spinal cord. Blood tests can rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms, such as muscular dystrophy, or myasthenia gravis. The drug most often used to [treat ALS](https://alsnewstoday.com/als-treatment/) is riluzole, which acts on the brain chemicals that affect nervous system signals. Specifically, riluzole prevents excess production of [glutamate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245510/), which seems to occur in some people with ALS, and is believed to contribute to dysfunction in the brain and spinal cord. Riluzole seems to have some protective capabilities, staving off the progression of ALS symptoms and further degeneration of nerve cells. Riluzole is not very effective for everyone with ALS, though, and it can cause side effects like [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [gastrointestinal problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-manage-ibs-diet-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Acupuncture and TCM offer a safe alternative or [integrative treatment](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/613596/) plan for ALS which can help to reduce symptoms like muscle twitches, muscle weakness, and trouble swallowing. TCM treatments can also reduce the side effects of medications for ALS like riluzole, alleviating digestive symptoms and dizziness. Acupuncture works holistically to address the stress and emotional impact of having a chronic illness, helping to relieve [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). Acupuncture for ALS One of the foundational concepts of TCM is the idea that both blood and Qi (life force energy) flow through the body along channels. In Western medicine, these channels are recognized as the nerves of the nervous system, and the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. In the TCM system of medicine, blood flow and energy flow can be stimulated, and fine-tuned, by acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture has been shown to help get the electrical impulses that carry messages from the brain to the spinal cord, the nerves, and the muscles working again when they are dysfunctioning. In this way, TCM and acupuncture are understood to be helpful for the treatment of many neurological disorders and progressive degenerative diseases. Neurological problems can be caused by blockage due to varying factors, but the framework of TCM allows us to treat all kinds of blockages with acupuncture. With acupuncture and herbs, we can also work against muscle atrophy by nourishing the spleen. TCM works to help patients with ALS on many levels. One [case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5653341/) reported a reduction in ALS symptoms like spasms and muscle cramps, [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [low back pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lower-back-pain-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and [dry eyes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Another case study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33613818/) of a patient with ALS showed distinct improvements in speech, mobility, and breathing ability. A [case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4998825/) of a patient who, after being treated with riluzole for a period of time, began taking Chinese herbs, showed that she was able to manage her ALS, with less muscle twitching and better ability to tolerate swallowing without choking, over a 12 year period. [Studies](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/506317/) have also shown that acupuncture treatment for ALS can help reduce inflammation in the respiratory tract and help improve breathing capability. Acupuncture Near Me for ALS/Lou Gehrig's Disease, Los Angeles Area ALS is a serious chronic illness that can quickly rob people of their mobility, self-reliance, and quality of life. While there is no cure for ALS, it is possible to slow down the progression of the disease and manage symptoms. The doctors at Art of Wellness have over 35 years of experience helping patients manage degenerative neurological conditions so they can live their best possible life. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Essential Tremor With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac, Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Shaking hands, body shaking for no reason, head shaking, feel wobbly when you're walking, maybe your voice quivers when you speak? These could be signs of Essential Tremor (ET). [Essential tremor](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/essential-tremor-disorder) is a neurological condition, often mistaken for [Parkinson's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), which causes rhythmic shaking of parts of the body, especially the hands. Acupuncture and TCM are an effective way to treat symptoms of essential tremor. Essential Tremor (ET), also called \"kinetic tremor\" or \"benign essential tremor,\" is a chronic nervous system disorder that [causes hand tremors](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/essential-tremor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350534), trembling hands, head shaking, body tremors in the arms or legs, and can also affect the voice. The hand shaking most often happens when you try to perform some simple, yet specific task that requires coordinated movements or using tools, such as shaving, writing, or pouring liquid into a glass. [Essential tremor](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/essential-tremor/) is the most common type of movement disorder, affecting about 4% of older adults, although it can happen at any age. The causes and progression of ET are not fully understood by medical science. Tremors are categorized into two main types of tremors: resting or active. A resting tremor is when the body shakes even at rest. Active tremors are when there is shaking when a person is attempting to make voluntary movements. Essential tremor is a type of active tremor. \"Postural tremor\" refers to an active tremor that occurs when a person is trying to maintain a position, like standing with the arms outstretched, and cannot do it without shaking. An \"internal tremor\" is a person's feeling that a quivering or shaking sensation is taking place inside their body, that cannot be seen by others. Essential tremor is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, but, in fact, essential tremor is much more common than Parkinson's (20 times more common). Like Parkinson's, [essential tremor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12839351/) causes hand shaking, but ET is different in that symptoms usually occur when you're actively trying to do something, whereas Parkinson's tremor occurs even when your limbs are at rest. Parkinson's also typically involves non-motor symptoms as well as motor symptoms. Other conditions can also cause hand tremors. Vascular parkinsonism, a neurological disorder that is the result of small strokes, causes blockage of blood flow in the brain. Both Parkinson's and vascular parkinsonism can cause a distinct type of tremor that involves the thumb and fingers brushing together slowly, sometimes called a \"pill-rolling tremor.\" [Asterixis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944342/) is another kind of motor control disorder that causes muscles to jerk, resulting in a characteristic hand-flapping gesture, sometimes referred to as \"liver flap.\" There are many other conditions that can also cause tremors, including: [hyperthyroidism](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hyperthyroidism-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [multiple sclerosis (MS)](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-ms-how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), addiction.](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also cause a temporary tremor or shakiness. Essential tremor seems to run in families sometimes, but many people begin to experience tremors for no apparent reason. It is theorized that ET may be caused by something genetic, or it may be caused by neurodegeneration-the gradual degradation and death of cells in the brain. [Acupuncture,](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture) combined with other TCM modalities such as moxibustion and herbs, is a good method for reducing hand tremors and other symptoms of essential tremor, as it has been demonstrated to have positive effects on the generation of cells in the brain and nervous system, as well as reducing stress and anxiety. Top 5 Essential Tremor Symptoms Very mild symptoms of essential tremor, such as having trouble threading a needle, often begin to show up when a person is in their 40s. Then, as time goes on, the symptoms of ET become more obvious: - Tremor, especially in hands, that is most noticeable when you're trying to do something - Head nodding that you can't control - Shaking on one side of the body more than the other - Voice quivers or voice is shaky when you speak - Tremor gets worse over the years Some medications (amphetamines, corticosteroids, or asthma medications) or stimulants like caffeine may make the tremors more noticeable. Some people find that the tremor lessens when they drink a moderate amount of wine or other alcohol. [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), strong emotions, too much exertion, low blood sugar, or being dehydrated can make the tremor more pronounced. Essential Tremor Treatment There is no specific test that shows whether a person has essential tremor. Diagnosis is based on observation of symptoms, and the use of testing to rule out other disorders, such as thyroid disease or Parkinson's. Medications are used to treat tremors with varying levels of success. Propranolol and Atenolol are beta-blockers that can be helpful for some people with ET. Primidone or Topamax are [anti-seizure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (anti-epileptic) drugs that can also be prescribed to help relieve shaking. In many cases, these medications are not very helpful for relieving the tremors. Doctors may try anti-anxiety medications like Valium, Ativan, or Klonopin. Botox injections have also been tried as a medical [treatment for essential tremor](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/essential-tremor-and-how-to-manage-it). In some cases surgery to remove parts of the thalamus has helped stop severe tremors, but there is a high risk with this type of brain surgery. Nowadays, when drugs do not seem to provide relief from tremors, people may be referred for a thalamic deep brain stimulation [therapy](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/essential-tremor/), in which electrodes send an electrical impulse to the brain to interrupt the faulty signals leading to involuntary shaking. Acupuncture treatment is another way to stimulate brain activity, having a positive effect on neurotransmitters in the brain and reestablishing connections throughout the nervous system. Can Acupuncture Help Essential Tremor? According to TCM theory, the symptom of hand tremors generally originates from the liver and kidney systems. Liver blood deficiency and kidney deficiency are closely related, and can lead to rising Liver Yang, and Liver Wind. It is the pathogenic factor of wind that causes the hand shaking. We use [acupuncture treatment](https://www.nyctcm.edu/Portals/0/assets/hand%20tremors_Fan.pdf) and herbs to nourish the liver and kidney so that wind is subdued and yin and yang energies are balanced. [One study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20214065/) compared groups of people with ET who were treated with medication (Propranolol) versus patients treated with both acupuncture and medication. The results showed better results for the patients who received the combined therapies. A [hospital study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1825-acupuncture-soothes-essential-tremor) in China showed that a combination of acupuncture treatment and herbal formulation had an over 80% efficacy rate for patients with benign essential tremor. A recorded case [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25831432/) of a woman treated with acupuncture for tremor showed that she was better able to write and hold objects, and that the improvements were maintained even a year after she had completed acupuncture treatment. Best Exercise for Hand Tremors Regular exercise is important for everyone, especially as we age, in order to keep our physical and mental faculties strong and agile. Exercises that can be beneficial for people with essential tremor include: - Regular cardiovascular exercise and light strength training - Tai Qi - Yoga - Meditation - Puzzles, math games, brain teasers, word searches, etc. Acupuncture Near Me for Essential Tremor in West Los Angeles, Brentwood area If you've started to notice your hands shaking, voice trembling, or that you're feeling unsteady on your feet, don't wait until the situation gets worse. Acupuncture treatment can help reduce the frequency and severity of hand tremors, and prevent essential tremor from progressing. The TCM doctors at Art of Wellness have over 35 years of experience treating all kinds of neurological disorders and helping people maintain their quality of life as they get older. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Alzheimer's Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-alzheimers-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D & Xiaomei Problems thinking clearly or remembering things? Feeling disoriented and confused? These may be signs of Alzheimer's disease or early onset dementia. Alzeimers is a progressive brain disorder that can cause memory loss and cognitive problems. TCM treatment with herbs and acupuncture for Alzheimer's disease can have a positive effect on brain activity and [help relieve symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728254/) of vascular dementia. [Dementia](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia) is a general term that refers to changes in the brain that impact a person's ability to focus, think in an organized way, learn new things, and keep track of their normal routine. Over 5 million adults are affected with dementia, 60-80% of them due to Alzeimer's. Most people who develop Alzheimer's do so when they are over 65, but 5-6% of all Alzheimer's patients develop [young-onset Alzheimer's](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048356) or early onset Alzheimer's between the ages of 30 and 60. Alzheimer's disease is one of the primary causes of dementia; the other common types of dementia are Lewy Body dementia (LBD) and vascular dementia. Increased forgetfulness and changes in cognitive function are not just normal parts of aging. The first signs of dementia occur due to changes in brain cell function and initially affect the part of the brain that learns new information and remembers it. While medical science has not conclusively discovered what exactly causes [Alzheimer's](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers) dementia, it is believed to be related to protein deposits called \"plaques\" and \"tangles\" developing in the brain, disrupting the communication between the brain cells and damaging nerves. Lewy bodies, are also a type of protein that can build up in the brain. Typical treatment for Alzheimer's involves the use of medications that affect brain chemistry, slowing down the effects of cell damage in the brain. Acupuncture treatment and the use of specific Chinese herb formulae can work as an effective and safe [adjunctive treatment](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1935-acupuncture-beats-drug-for-alzheimer-s-disease-treatment), helping to stimulate brain activity, improve blood circulation, and reduce inflammation in the brain to help improve the cognitive function that can be lost to Alzheimer's and dementia. Top 10 Early Signs of Dementia It can be difficult for a person who is beginning to show [signs of Alzheimer's](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/alzheimers-disease/earlyonset-alzheimer-disease) disease to recognize it themselves; often, their loved ones will begin to notice changes in their behavior first. In addition to the more obvious [forgetfulness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and disorientation of dementia, people may notice more subtle changes in a person's personality and behavior. Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include: - Forgetting important things, like dates or appointments (more than just occasionally) - Having to ask the same question repeatedly because you can't retain information - Trouble completing basic tasks that require following instructions - Losing track of where you are or what day or time it is, getting lost - Losing items, forgetting where you put something - Having trouble finding the right words or carrying on a conversation - [Changes in vision](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or spatial perception - Changes in mood, emotions: anger, aggression, feeling suspicious towards others - Avoiding social situations - Progressively more difficult to walk, speak, or swallow Signs of dementia in women can look different from signs of dementia in men. While it is often noted that people with dementia may become more irritable and take an attitude of blaming others for their forgetfulness, sometimes it may be the opposite. A person may seem more docile and easy-going. You might notice that a person is driving either more slowly and cautiously than they used to, or perhaps making more erratic decisions and moves. Having difficulty hearing when there is a lot of ambient noise, and losing one's sense of smell can also be signs of Alzheimer's and dementia. The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease tend to progress over time, while [signs of Lewy Body dementia (LBD)](https://www.verywellhealth.com/difference-between-alzheimers-and-lewy-body-dementia-98749) can change more dramatically from day to day. A person with LBD may, for example, recognize their relatives sometimes, and be confused and unresponsive on other days. Having trouble walking, risk of falling, acting out dreams while sleeping, and having a blank facial expression can also be signs of LBD, although they can also be signs of another neurological disorder, such as [Parkinson's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Medical Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease Drug [treatment for Alzheimer's](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/how-alzheimers-disease-treated) disease may help a person maintain their cognitive abilities and memory longer, although it can be difficult to determine just how much a particular medication for dementia is helping, as the effects are limited and can be hard to quantify. Cholinesterase inhibitors slow the breakdown of brain chemicals involved in memory and thinking, which can help some people with Alzheimer's manage these symptoms for a while. For other people, these medications (such as Donepezil and Galantamine) may not help much, and they can also cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, and [diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Cholinesterase inhibitors cannot be taken by people who also suffer from arrhythmia, or [irregular heartbeat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) conditions. No [medications available](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048103) currently actually work to repair or reverse the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease. Some studies, as noted below, have actually seen better results in patients receiving TCM treatments over conventional medication therapies for dementia and Alzheimer's. How Can Acupuncture Help Alzheimer's Disease? In TCM, we consider that many diseases are caused by a buildup of what we call \"phlegm\" in the organ systems of the body. The protein deposits in the brain referred to as \"plaques\" and \"tangles\" that seem to be the cause of dementia in older adults may be roughly analogous to the TCM concept of phlegm. Phlegm causes obstructions that block the free flow of Qi and blood through the body, causing breakdown in proper communication and cooperation between systems. There are records going back for hundreds of years of TCM herbal formulations being used to treat dementia by helping to get rid of pathogenic phlegm that blocks the meridians, or energy channels of the body. According to [TCM theory](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2014/642128/), the brain and the kidneys are closely related; the kidneys nourish the brain. If there is weakness or deficiency of Qi in the kidneys, it can lead to symptoms like [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), confusion, [amnesia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and memory problems. TCM treatment for dementia related to Alzheimer's disease and Lewy Body dementia, will focus on strengthening the kidneys and clearing phlegm from the body. Acupuncture treatment can have a positive effect on neurotransmitters and neurochemical activity, helping to alleviate a variety of neurological and mental health disorders. Current [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1533317514536600) is helping to show that stimulating specific pressure points can activate parts of the brain in a way that may reduce the cognitive and memory-related symptoms of dementia. [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6076908/) was done to determine if using the traditional \"Four Gates\" acupuncture points increased brain activity and improved cognitive function. The testing showed that patients who received acupuncture treatment in these points experienced significant changes in the cognitive-related parts of the brain versus patients who were given \"sham\" acupuncture. A [recent review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31209824/) of several studies showed that acupuncture treatment for Alzheimer's can improve memory and cognitive function. A [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28922926/) of 12 studies involving the use of acupuncture and TCM herbs to treat Alzheimer's showed improvement in symptoms that was more effective than conventional drug treatment. Acupuncture Near Me for Alzheimer's in Santa Monica, West Los Angeles It can be painful to watch a loved one struggling with dementia caused by Alzheimer's or some other progressive neurological disease. It is best to initiate treatment for dementia as soon as it becomes apparent, so that we can help to limit the progress of cognitive decline. TCM provides a holistic way to treat each individual so that they can continue to live a full, active life. At Art of Wellness, we have over 30 years of experience helping patients with neurological conditions of all kinds. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.
