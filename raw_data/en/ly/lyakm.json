Dr. Shenkman is a health outcomes researcher with a research focus on: 1) determining which combinations of health care delivery, community, and patient factors influence quality and outcomes of care; and 2) developing and testing corresponding evidence-based strategies to reduce disparities in health outcomes among underserved populations. In her role as CTSI Co-Director and Co-Principle Investigator, Dr. Shenkman leads the Learning Health System initiative, including interfacing with clinicians, health system leaders, researchers, and patients to align research and clinical operations to systematically improve health outcomes and advance health equity using real world data combined with implementation and improvement science methodologies. In addition, Dr. Shenkman leads the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium, which was developed through the CTSI. The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded OneFlorida Clinical Research Network is comprised of 10 different health system partners caring for over 15 M Floridians or approximately 60% of the population in the 3rd largest state in the US. The Floridians in this network include vulnerable populations who are rarely or minimally included in traditional clinical trials (e.g., those of lower socioeconomic status, racial and ethnic minorities, children, and older adults). A hallmark of OneFlorida is its centralized Data Trust, which contains linked health care claims, electronic health record, tumor registry, vital statistics, and census data from its health system partners for cohort discovery, study feasibility determination, and to augment primary data collection activities. Dr. Shenkman facilitates investigators' access to OneFlorida clinical settings and the Data Trust for a wide range of studies including cancer-focused interventional trials. Dr. Shenkman is an MPI for the NIH Office of the Director-funded All of Us Precision Medicine cohort initiative in collaboration with the University of Miami, Emory University and Morehouse School of Medicine. In that capacity, she is responsible for overseeing community engagement and recruitment and retention efforts focused on rural and underserved populations in North Florida. Dr. Shenkman also is the PI of an R01 funded by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality examining the effects of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with chronic conditions. The project uses electronic health record data to better measure health care use and clinical outcomes for adults with T2 diabetes and/or hypertension and who have intersecting identities (e.g., women who are black and residing in rural areas). Dr. Shenkman's research is funded by PCORI, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, NIH, and the National Cancer Institute. Her work is published in such journals as Pediatrics, Health Services Research, Clinical Epidemiology, Pediatric Blood and Cancer, and the American Journal of Public Health. Dr. Shenkman is an elected member of the Society for Pediatric Research and the American Pediatric Society. [Ricky Whitney](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/whitney-ricky) Ph.D., is an associate professor in the Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics and director of the department's Division of Health Outcomes and Implementation Science. She is also the Director of Precision Public Health for the CTSI and Associate Director of the Institute for Child Health Policy. Dr. Staras is an expert in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine implementation research. She has served as principal investigator on nine implementation research grants, including two R01-level pragmatic implementation trials for improving HPV vaccination among Florida teens and preteens. Dr. Staras' work highlights the strong association between HPV vaccine initiation and parents' beliefs about the HPV vaccine's ability to prevent cancer safely. Additionally, she led one of a handful of studies to assess a direct link between provider recommendations and parent beliefs. By simultaneously targeting parents with reminders and providers with an in-clinic, parent-tailored decision aid, Dr. Staras' real-world, multi-level implementation trial demonstrated a synergistic increase on HPV vaccine initiation among girls. To target interventions at geographic areas of the greatest need, Dr. Staras characterized HPV-related disease burden in Florida by triangulating data with an environmental scan that includes vaccination records, stakeholder interviews, and a provider discrete choice experiment. Dr Staras is an expert in implementation science. She was a fellow of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)- sponsored training program entitled Mentored Training in Dissemination and Implementation Research in Cancer program (2016 to 2018), has served as a faculty lead in the NCI-sponsored Training Institute for Dissemination and Implementation Research in Cancer (2020), and co-leads an Implementation Science Learning Group that annually introduces 5-10 UF postdoctoral candidates and junior faculty members to implementation science (2021-2023).

I have a wealth of experience conducting both observational studies and clinical trials involving frail and low functioning older adults (minority and non-minority) that will support the organization, administration, planning, compliance, standardization, documentation, monitoring and reporting activities in the current study. As an added asset, I am or have been a key part of several consortia that involve behavioral modifications (UO1 AG022376, AG15013) studies that overlap operational and scientific elements of the current work. I am also actively leading or have led numerous government-sponsored studies that have strong connections to feel well qualified and I'm excited to undertake the responsibilities of being a co-investigator on this important study. I currently serve as the Co-Director of the University of Florida's Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center (OAIC) and the Director of the T32 Translational Research on Aging and Mobility (TRAM - T32 AG062728) program. I serve as a Professor and Division Chief of Clinical and Population Health Integration in The Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics. Lastly, I am the Co-Leader of the Data Science and Applied Technology Core of the UF OAIC. In these roles, I lead an interdisciplinary team of investigators, staff and trainees. I currently lead both clinical trials and observational studies involving cognitive and physical impairments in older adults. In these studies, besides conducting rigorous science, I manage staff, oversee the finances, ensure regulatory compliance, monitor measurement standardization, and report data and safety information for these programs. I involve trainees at all levels for them to gain an appreciation of not just the science methods, but the overall operations of managing a complex primary data collection research program. I also preach rigorous data collection procedures and transparency throughout the scientific process. As an added asset, I am or was a key part of several consortia that involve behavioral modifications (UO1 studies that encompass both operational and scientific elements that are matched to career development goals. My collaborative nature and diverse experiences have prepared me well to closely integrate with the team while being conscience of timely deliverables. I've mentored or coached 42 men and women at various stages of their careers (post-doctoral fellows, pre-doctoral students and faculty). I also currently serve as a co-primary mentor and co-mentor of post-doctoral fellows in the T32 TRAM program in which I am Principal Investigator. In the past 5 years, I've served as the primary mentor of six post-doctoral fellows, one of which remain an active part of our research team. I've served as the primary or co-primary mentor for six doctoral students, five of which have subsequently gone on to either tenure-track faculty positions or post-doctoral positions. Of note, one of my recent doctoral students was accepted at John's Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was recently promoted to a faculty position in the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Another formal doctoral student, who worked as part of our core, is currently employed at Google's research and development team. My goal for these advanced scientists is to train and instill the Gerontological philosophies\u2014 preservation of function in conjunction with chronic disease management\u2014 to a variety of researchers and practitioners in health-related disciplines. As such, I mentor them on how to incorporate gerontology and geriatrics measures into their domain. - Associate Editor2021-current \u00b7 Journals of Gerontology: Medical Sciences - Division Chief of Epidemiology and Data Science in Gerontology2019-2021 \u00b7 University of Florida, Department of Aging & Geriatric Research - Fellow of the Gerontological Society of America (FGSA)2017 \u00b7 Gerontological Society of America - Chair of the American College of Sports Medicine Strategic Health Initiative on Aging2016-2021 \u00b7 American College of Sports Medicine - NIH Standing Study Section member2014-2018 \u00b7 Standing member: Neurological, Aging & Musculoskeletal Epidemiology (NAME) - Adjunct Professor2011-current \u00b7 Department of Rehabilitation Sciences - Exemplary Teachers Award2011 \u00b7 University of Florida - Assistant Professor Excellence Award2010 \u00b7 University of Florida - Adjunct Professor2009-current \u00b7 Department of Epidemiology - Fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine (FACSM)2009 \u00b7 American College of Sports Medicine - Adjunct Professor2008-current \u00b7 Department of Applied Physiology & Kinesiology - 2023 [Associations of Total Body Fat Mass and Skeletal Muscle Index with All-Cause and Cancer-Specific Mortality in Cancer Survivors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36831420) - 2023 [Uneven terrain versus dual-task walking: differential challenges imposed on walking behavior in older adults are predicted by cognitive and sensorimotor function.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36993462) - 2023 Journal of the American Medical Directors Association - 2023 [Media Consumption and COVID-19-Related Precautionary Behaviors During the Early Pandemic: Survey Study of Older Adults](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37213166) - 2023 [Feasibility of a Smartwatch Platform to Assess Ecological Mobility: Real-Time Online Assessment and Mobility Monitor.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36744611) - 2023 [Comparing D3-Creatine Dilution and Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Muscle Mass Responses to Strength Training in Low-Functioning Older Adults.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36752568) - 2023 [Effect of change of interleukin-6 over time on gait speed response: Results from the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36526102) - 2023 [Defining and Measuring Preclinical Mobility Limitation: An Expert Consensus Exercise Informed by a Scoping Review.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37300461) - 2023 [Comparison of EEG Source Localization Using Simplified and Anatomically Accurate Head Models in Younger and Older Adults.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37252873) - 2023 [Effect of Physical Activity Intervention on Gait Speed by Frailty Condition: A Randomized Clinical Trial.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36878264) - 2022 Journal of the American Geriatrics Society - 2022 Journal of biomechanics - 2022 [Frailty and risk of mortality in older cancer survivors and adults without a cancer history: Evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2014.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35608563) - 2022 PLOS ONE - 2022 [Effects of Walking Exercise at a Pace With Versus Without Ischemic Leg Symptoms on Functional Performance Measures in People With Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease: The LITE Randomized AMIA Symposium - 2022 [Are Machine Learning Models on Wrist Accelerometry Robust against Differences in Physical Performance among Older Adults?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35459045) - 2022 [Evaluation of the key prescription sequence symmetry analysis assumption using the calcium channel blocker: Loop diuretic prescribing cascade.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34553438) - 2021 [Satisfaction, Usability, and Compliance With the Use of Smartwatches for Ecological Momentary Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Symptoms in Older Adults: Usability Study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34259638) - 2021 [What Cut-Point in Gait Speed Best Discriminates Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Mobility Complaints From Those Without?

Fisher, Ph.D. is a Professor in Health Outcomes and Implementation Science and affiliate of the UF Health Cancer Center and Center for Arts in Medicine. She is a behavioral scientist and expert in family-centered psychosocial oncology care, qualitative designs in implementation science, and building lifespan/developmentally targeted, narrative-focused interventions. Dr. Fisher's work aims to contribute to a \"psychosocial map\" that helps patients, caregivers, family members, and clinicians learn communication skills central to promoting healthier outcomes when coping with acute or chronic illnesses, family caregiving, and disease risk. While her primary focus has been on promoting family-centered psychosocial oncology care, her research has spanned numerous healthcare contexts (e.g., diabetes, acupuncture, mental health, geriatric medicine, genomic medicine, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk). She also prioritizes reducing health disparities for women, racial/ethnic minorities, veterans, the aging, adolescents and young adults, and individuals living with hereditary disease risk. Collectively, her work brings to the forefront the importance of family communication in healthcare practice and public health interventions. Dr. Fisher is also an expert in multi-method qualitative designs in implementation science. She is regularly invited to serve as the lead qualitative expert on grant-funded research supported by funders like NIH, PCORI, DOD, and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. She's been an invited qualitative expert for the government including the National United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office on Women's Health (OWH), and for five years, served as the lead qualitative methodologist on multiple funded projects for the Military Primary Care Research Network. She currently directs a team of qualitative scientists who lead the qualitative arms of multiple funded studies and regularly teaches advanced graduate courses in narrative-focused qualitative design and thematic analysis. Her research collaborations have resulted in more than $15 million in federal and private funding and she's authored >100 publications. Dr. Fisher wrote the only nationally recognized, evidence-informed book (Coping together, side by side) addressing the central role of mother-daughter communication to breast cancer coping and caregiving, that offers narrative-driven guidance targeting women's distinct developmental needs. Across her career she has had the privilege of mentoring 65 graduate students, in addition to early career MDs and PhDs. - 2023 [A Mixed-Method Examination of Emerging and Young Adult Cancer Caregivers' Experiences during the COVID-19 Pandemic](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37107819) -
