(1) All rules relating to long -term care facilities licensed by the Division of Aging, other than those rules which are informational in character, shall be followed by a notation at the end of each rule, section, subsection or pertinent part. This notation shall consist of a Roman numeral(s). T hese Roman numerals refer to the class (either class I, class II or class III) of standard as designated in section 198.085.1, RSMo and will be used when that rule, section, subsection or portion of a rule carrying the notation is violated by the facility. (2) In those instances where a particular rule, section, subsection or portion of a rule is followed by a notation consisting of more than one (1) Roman numeral, the lower classification shall be applied unless the division can show that the higher classi fication is merited because of the extent of the violation, the violations effect on residents or the impact when combined with other deficiencies. The division, on the Statement of Deficiency, shall indicate for the operator which classification has been applied and if the higher one is used, for what reason. (3) A violation of a class I standard is one which would present either an imminent danger to the health, safety or welfare of any resident or a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm would result. If a violation of a class I standard is not immediately corrected, or corrective action instituted, the division shall proceed as required under section 198.029, RSMo. The division shall also take all other necessary steps to protect th e health, safety or welfare of a resident which may include: initiation of license revocation action under section 198.036, RSMo; initiation of an action under section 198.067, RSMo; injunctive relief or assessment of a civil penalty, initiation of an acti on under section 198.070.6, RSMo; protection of residents from further abuse or neglect; initiation of an action under section 198.105 or 198.108, RSMo for appointment of a receiver; and appointment of a monitor under section 198.103, RSMo.

When a violation is noted, the operator shall either correct the violation immediat ely or prior to the time of the reinspection or shall be correcting it in accordance with the time schedules set out in the operator 's approved plan of correction, as provided for under section 198.026.2, RSMo. If not, or the plan of correction is not approved and the violation not corrected, the violation will constitute substantial noncompliance under the Omnibus Nursing Home Act. After review by the division director or his/her designee, the division may initiate any action authorized by law, including t hose provided for in sections 198.026, 198.036, 198.067, 198.070.6, 198.103, 198.105 and 198.108, set out in sections 198.003 -198.186, RSMo and are not otherwise classified, those standards will be treated as class II standards. (5) A violation of a class III standard is one which has an indirect or a potential impact on the health, safety or welfare of any resident. When a violation is noted, the operator shall either correct the violation immediately or prior to the time of the reinspection, or shall be correcting it in accordance with the time schedules set out in the operator's approved plan of correction as provided for under section 198.026, RSMo. If not, if the plan of correction is not approved and the violation not corrected, a point value of one (1) point each will be noted for violations of each distinct class III standard not corrected; however, the points will not be assessed if there are five (5) or fewer class III standards violated. (A) If the points total tw enty (20) or more points, the facility will be deemed to be in substantial noncompliance under the Omnibus Nursing Home Act and the division may initiate any action as authorized by law, including issuance of a notice of noncompliance, as provided under section 198.026, RSMo. (B) If the points total less than twenty (20) points, the points will remain on the facility 's record until the time the violations are corrected and are noted as corrected during a reinspection. If during the reinspection a class III standard violated in the prior inspection continues to be violated, the previously assessed points will be doubled unless the operator immediately corrects the violation. If after the reinspection the points for all previously noted and left uncorrected vi olations of distinct class III standards total twenty (20) of more, the facility will be deemed to be in substantial noncompliance under the Omni -bus Nursing Home Act and the division may take action as provided under section 198.026, RSMo. (C) The divisio n shall not revoke an operator 's license to operate a long -term care facility for violations of class III standards unless \u2014 1. The uncorrected violations taken all together present either an imminent danger to the health, safety or welfare of any resident or a substantial probability of death or serious physical harm; or Chapter 82 -General Lic ensure Requirements 19 CSR 30 -82 Effective Date: 8/28/01 82.020 -2 2. The operator or his/her agent knowingly acted or knowingly omitted any duty which would materially and adversely affect the health, safety, welfare or property of a resident. (D) Points will not be assessed for class III violations if the operator can show that the violation had been corrected since it was initially noted, that the operator made a good faith effort, as judged by the division, to stay in compliance and that the violation a gain occurred for reasons beyond the operator's control. (6) The division shall not initiate any action against an operator as authorized by law, including issuance of a notice of noncompliance for uncorrected violations of class II or III standards, unles s the facility 's record, the cited violations and the circumstances are reviewed by the director of the division or his/her designee.
