On the other hand, in pathologies not associated with barrier dysfunction, drug delivery to the brain is negligible due to the tight BBB. The BBB is formed by brain endothelial cells (EC) and is regulated by several cell-types including pericytes (PC), astrocytes (AC), microglia (MG) that together form the neurovascular unit (NVU). Isolation and analysis of the NVU cells is therefore critical for understanding the disease site and the therapeutic strategy in CNS diseases associated with BBB dysfunction and for effective drug delivery across healthy BBB in diseases that affect the CNS parenchyma. We have previously isolated brain microvessels as a representative of the BBB tissue in neurological diseases including AD, stroke, glioma, and meningitis. However, brain microvessels comprise predominantly EC, hence the contribution of a particular NVU cell type and their interaction at the NVU in neuropathology cannot be assessed. Thus, methods for isolation of pure single cell-types of the NVU are needed. We therefore developed a FACS based method called EPAM-ia method that allows simultaneous isolation of 4 major NVU cell-types - EC, AC, PC, and MG. We successfully applied our method to healthy mice and to mice post ischemic stroke, and to brain biopsies from tumor, epilepsy patients demonstrating its translational value. As several CNS diseases are associated with BBB dysfunction, targeting BBB repair is therefore a crucial therapeutic approach. However, BBB has never been targeted considering the whole NVU although it is well accepted that BBB is co-regulated by multiple NVU cell-types. Based on the success of the above approach, we propose co-targeting of multiple NVU cell types in CNS disease in order to identify robust and effective therapies, leading to improved BBB function and neurological outcome in CNS diseases. | | The Kumar lab works on the genetic and neural circuitry of complex behaviors, particularly reward related behaviors. We apply computational, genetics, and genomic methods to understand mechanisms underlying complex behaviors. The field of behavior quantification is undergoing a technology based revolution with broad impacts on neurogenetics. I will speak about the applications of computer vision and machine learning to complex behavior analysis and discuss its potential applications. Dr. Kumar obtained his Phd at UCSD in the laboratory of M. Geoff Rosenfeld working on transcriptional repression mechanisms. He carried out postdoctoral work with Dr. Joseph Takahashi at Northwestern University and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, where he used forward genetic methods to dissect reward pathways in mice.

We have been able to infer the history of expansion of cancer in individual patients by reconstructing the lineage tree of the cancer cells from the pattern of naturally-occurring somatic mutations in each cell's genome. I will also talk about how we can use synthetic biology to record each cell's lineage history in its own DNA, circumventing the need for naturally-occurring somatic mutations. | | Recent studies have shown that early embryonic development can be recapitulated in-vitro by three-dimensional stem cell aggregates, which lack initial asymmetries and inputs from extra-embryonic tissues. These data suggest that early embryonic development is a self-organizing process where embryonic stem cells can generate spatial differentiation patterns autonomously. The main goal of my lab is to identify the gene regulatory networks that drive early embryonic self-organization. In this talk, I will present two different projects that focus on the patterning of the main axis of all bilateral animals: the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo that extends from head to tail. In part one, I will show that three-dimensional aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells, known as embryoid bodies, can reproduce the symmetry breaking of the mouse epiblsat. Indeed, they can spontaneously form an organizer similar to the primitive streak of the mouse embryo that propagates from one side of the aggregate. This organizer defines the posterior side of the embryo and is crucial for gastrulation and germ layer specification. Combining mathematical modeling and experiments, I will propose that this symmetry-breaking event is controlled by a novel bi-stable Turing network that can generate a size-independent wavefront of Nodal signaling. Finally, I will show how we are characterizing this process using single-cell transcriptomics. In the second part of my talk, I will discuss a new theoretical model of somitogenesis that explains anterior-posterior axis segmentation both in-vivo and in-vitro. The model is implemented by a minimal gene regulatory network between Wnt and Notch that generates a variety of self-organizing patterns by synchronized oscillations. When this network is modulated by anterior-posterior axis gradients, such as Fgf and RA, it can reproduce the most important aspects of somitogenesis along the developing tail of the embryo. Using complex systems theory, we analyzed the contribution of the self-organizing network and external gradients in pattern formation. In particular, we found that global gradients promote bifurcations of the Wnt/Notch network that lead to different diffusion-driven behaviors. | | Bacterial conjugation is a fundamental process of unidirectional transfer of plasmid DNA from a donor cell to a recipient cell through a large dual membrane spanning multi-megaDalton transport apparatus termed as the Type IV Secretion System (T4SS). Conjugative T4SSs can function in two very different modes namely the pilus biogenesis mode and the DNA transfer mode. Structural studies on one of the main components of this secretion system, namely the AAA+ TrwK/VirB4 ATPase solved in its Apo- form using single particle cryo-EM resulted in the determination of the first near-atomic resolution structure of any known T4SS. Building on this previous work, here we present the high resolution structure of the T4SS complex from E. coli R388 plasmid elucidating how the various proteins of the T4SS come together but also an entirely novel mechanism for pilus biogenesis by bacteria in general, and more specifically for conjugative pili. Determining the architecture of these systems is an essential first step in curtaining AMR and in the development of engineering new devices that can deliver genes into higher eukaryotic organisms for DNA vaccination and gene therapy. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Blending formal and informal science is necessary to leverage people's knowledge for developing viable solutions to many societal problems. Often, a question is asked, as to why did knowledge-rich communities remain economically poor if their knowledge system was so effective in several cases. The answer is the institutional culture which made the knowledge holders share their knowledge generally openly and freely, without insisting on any reciprocity and even bearing the cost themselves. The Honey Bee Network, 35 years ago asked a question; should grassroots innovators and traditional knowledge holders remain poor because they are generous and we become rich because we are stingy? Unfortunately, scholars continue to publish even unique knowledge without prior informed consent and protecting the IPRs of the communities/TK holders. How do we correct the asymmetry in rights and responsibilities among institutional scientists towards the knowledge holders and grassroots innovators? In this talk, I take examples from the Honey Bee Network database of over three decades and illustrate the potential for making responsible and reciprocal bridges between formal and informal knowledge systems. In some cases, the scientific and technological edge may get pushed further through community knowledge. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Serotonin (5-HT) is implicated in several disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, OCD, and sleep apnea, and studies on this neurotransmitter and neuromodulator and its receptors has had a big impact on therapeutic interventions. Many drugs prescribed to patients for the disorders mentioned above, target the serotonin receptor family and bring about their effect through signalling mechanisms via these receptors. Among these receptors, the 5-HT2AR is of importance due to several studies that have highlighted the involvement of this receptor in many neuropsychiatric diseases. It is also of interest to note that a number of hallucinogenic drugs (DOI, psilocybin, and LSD) target the 5-HT2AR, thereby emphasizing its role in modifying behaviour. Most studies have focused on known and established ligands of the receptor as well as on the second messenger systems involved in the signalling via this receptor. Previous work from our laboratory has highlighted the promiscuity shown by the 5-HT2AR and its rat isoform, especially with respect to the action of dopamine (DA) on this receptor. Our laboratory has also shown that there are significant differences between signalling via the rat and human isoforms of the 5-HT2AR. I used these results as a starting point for my investigations into signalling via this receptor. I developed a number of HEK293 based cell-lines that can be induced to express our receptor of interest under the tetracycline-ON expression system to investigate signalling via the 5- HT2AR that is optimally expressed and avoids potential artifacts sometimes associated with overexpression. My results show that there are specific residues which are involved in signalling of the human isoform of the 5-HT2AR for 5-HT vs DA. I have investigated three established properties of 5-HT2AR viz., receptor internalization, intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, and formation of actin stress fibres to examine the differences in the proximal as well as distal effects of different ligands. I have also investigated the downstream signalling that is set up by the rat isoform of the 5-HT2AR which highlights the differences in signalling by 5-HT vs DA beyond the second messenger systems. Further, investigated the action of various endogenous amines on the human 5-HT2AR and have shown that many of these endogenous amines are able to activate the receptor and bring about intracellular Ca2+ flux, further highlighting the promiscuous nature of the 5-HT2A receptor in terms of ligand binding. Many of the drugs targeting 5-HT2AR cause adverse side effects in patients. Therefore, the search for newer, better drugs to treat these disorders is essential. Advancements in protein biology and computer-based simulation programs has made the 5-HT2AR a subject for a number of simulation studies. A collaboration with Prof. Sowdhamini's laboratory had identified a few compounds via docking and modelling studies performed by Dr Gandhimathi A., as potential ligands of the human 5-HT2AR. In continuation of this project, I tested some of these molecules using the intracellular Ca2+ release assay and have identified one of them to be a weak antagonist that could serve as an initial scaffold to design better antagonists. Lastly, I made preliminary efforts to explore a system that would allow the generation of specific human neural cell types, specifically those known to express the 5-HT2AR. A recently described powerful system are neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells (HPSCs). My results show that NSCs do not show intracellular Ca2+ release on being subjected to 5-HT or DOI application, indicating the absence of serotonin subtype 2 receptors in these cells. Since it is now well established that NSCs can be directed to specific developmental fates in vitro, these cells could prove useful to explore the developmental trajectory for 5-HT2 receptor subtype expression as the CNS develops. Further, this system can also be used to study the how this receptor can impact CNS development through exogenous expression.

The local and non-specific interactions between monosaccharides implies that even a single cell with a limited set of GTase enzymes can theoretically synthesize an astronomical array of oligomeric combinations. And indeed, across eukaryotes there is tremendous diversity of glycan molecules built with the same simple building blocks. However, eukaryotes appear to exert a significant level of control\u00e2with a given glycosylated protein type associated with only a few glycan oligomers. Some of these glycans are important identity markers for organisms and cell-types. What are the drivers of glycan variability? How do eukaryotic cells generate narrow, specific protein glycan profiles despite the variability caused by promiscuous enzymes? I use simple but revealing models of glycosylation in the Golgi to develop a better understanding of the role and function of compartmentalization in eukaryotic glycosylation. | | Recent advances in using systems biology to probe humanity's diverse immune systems reveal novel mechanistic insights into the fundamentals of immunology. Such \"systems immunology\" studies take advantage of the various ways by which the human immune system can be manipulated. I will present data from two of our studies using systems approaches to understand human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. In the first part of the talk, I will show how the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine stimulates \"innate immune memory\" and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. In the second part of the talk, I will describe the immune signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection and features of lasting immune perturbations induced by COVID-19. Finally, I will explain the fundamental immunological principles we are learning from these studies. | | Hierarchical organization of membrane proteins and lipids at the cell membrane is essential for regulating myriad downstream signaling networks. A quantitative understanding of these processes requires both detections of oligomeric organization of membrane proteins and lipids directly from intact lipid bilayers and determination of key membrane properties and components that regulate these organizations. Addressing this need, I have developed an in vitro platform that enables native mass spectrometry (nMS) analysis of membrane protein-lipid complexes directly from intact and customizable lipid bilayers. Both the lipid composition, as well as specific membrane properties (such as curvature, tension, fluidity) of these bilayers can be precisely customized to mimic a target physiological membrane. Subsequent direct nativeMS (nMS) and MS/MS analysis of these intact lipid membranes can yield the oligomeric states of the embedded membrane proteins, identify bound lipids, and determine the binding stoichiometry of such lipids. The customizability of the platform further enables us to change a specific constituent lipid or a biophysical property of the membrane and determine its role in maintaining the observed organization of proteins and lipids in the bilayer. Application of this approach on synaptic vesicle (SV) protein VAMP2 shows that VAMP2 exist as monomer in SV and specific binding of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol to VAMP2 in SV regulates the speed of neurotransmitter release. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Membrane glycoproteins undergo conformational changes as part of their functional program. Yet, the mechanisms by which the resulting rearrangement of glycans contributes to functional outputs have remained poorly explored. Here, we demonstrate that the cell adhesion protein alpha5beta1 integrin scaffolds the formation galectin-3 (Gal3) only in bent-closed inactive conformational state, and not in the extended-open active one. These Gal3 oligomers then drive the uptake and retrograde transport of inactive alpha5beta1 integrin for its dynamic localization to the leading edge of migratory cells. Using cryo-EM, crosslinking proteomics and mutagenesis, we pioneer a structural model on how this cargo glycan arrangement-dependent Gal3 oligomerization is achieved. Our study elevates glycosylation, which at the cell surface is often perceived as static, to the level of a dynamic regulatory process. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Cardiomyopathies are complex heart muscle diseases with significant prevalence worldwide. Sarcomere-associated proteins mutations, metabolic impairment and modifier genes influence penetrance and expressivity of cardiomyopathy phenotype. In this context, it is crucial to understand the role of the above players in cardiomyopathy progression. No study has explored the effect of mutation on structural stability, metabolic perturbations across cardiomyopathies and disease-disease association of cardiomyopathies, consequently requiring in-depth analysis. As a part of my thesis work, we performed large-scale data analysis of cardiomyopathy to explore the above questions. In the first part of my thesis, we employ network biology to investigate cardiomyopathy's genetic interplay with other diseases and uncover the molecular players underlying these associations. We predict a set of candidate genes in cardiomyopathy by exploring the DIAMOnD algorithm on the human interactome. Utilizing heart-specific mouse knockout data and disease tissue-specific transcriptomic data, we screen prominent candidates that show abnormal heart phenotype, including NOS3, MMP2 and SIRT1. We next report how these candidate genes form associations across different diseases and highlight the predominant association with brain, cancer and metabolic disorders. In the second part, we present the analysis of transcriptome data to understand metabolic perturbations across primary cardiomyopathies. As a high-energy demanding engine, the heart utilizes fatty acids, glucose, amino acid, lactate and ketone bodies for energy to meet its requirement. However, continuous myocardial stress and cardiomyopathies drive towards metabolic impairment that advances heart failure (HF) pathogenesis. In this study, we utilized RNA-seq datasets to profile global changes in the above diseases and performed Gene set analysis (GSA). Our analysis demonstrates that arachidonic acid metabolism (AA) genes are significantly perturbed across cardiomyopathy. In particular, the arachidonic acid metabolism gene PLA2G2A interacts with fibroblast marker genes and can potentially influence fibrosis during cardiomyopathy. The third part of the thesis focuses on Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), a dual-role mechanosensor that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in cardiac myocytes. It reportedly interacts with proteins within the Z-disc, including -actinin, titin-binding protein telethonin and transcription factors like MyoD. Mutations in the human CSRP3 gene exhibit dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) phenotypes. Previous studies have shown that disease-causing mutations were predominantly localized to LIM domains. In this study, we devise a rapid in silico screening protocol that creates a mutational landscape map for all possible allowed and disallowed substitutions in CSRP3 LIM domains. This map provides structural and functional insights into the stability of LIM domains of CSRP3. To assess the map's prediction, we performed MD simulations of WT, L44P (disease-mutant) and L44M (neutral). Our study suggests that the hydrophobic core region is significantly altered to the wild type. In summary, our integrated computational analysis broadens the understanding of the genetic associations of cardiomyopathies. References | | The cell consists of millions of biomacromolecules, such as proteins, RNAs, DNAs, and numerous small molecules. In such a highly crowded environment, biomacromolecules robustly come together and form assemblies to facilitate all physicochemical processes at the right time in the right space! For example, protein, RNA, and DNA come together via noncovalent interactions to form mesoscale clusters, and when demixes in two or more coexisting phases is called phase separation (PS). Several biological processes, like transcription and gene regulation, DNA damage repair, cell division, autophagy, skin barrier formations, immune signalling, and the formation of membrane-less organelles, are linked to the PS process. Aberrant phase separations are also associated with devastating human diseases, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and infectious diseases. Despite the importance, the molecular mechanism remains elusive of how a biomacromolecule (~10 nm) assembled to form various sizes from nm to \u00c2\u00b5m entities. Importantly, it is unknown how the physicochemical emergent properties of these assemblies change with increasing size, and what are the correlations of their functions with assemblies\u00e2 size? I want to understand the molecular mechanism of how these assemblies form reversibly and regulate biological functions robustly. I believe this knowledge will help us to understand various physiological and pathological processes and develop the therapy. | | Biology is undergoing a data revolution exhibited by high-resolution measurements of spatiotemporal dynamics in complex biological systems. Of particular interest are simultaneous neural and behavioral recordings now possible in several important model systems. We can now hope to tackle a fundamental question in biology: how do animals control and adapt their behavior? However, due to their complexity, spatiotemporal datasets stretch the limits of existing analysis methods. Bringing with them unique challenges in how to analyze and extract meaning from them. In this talk, I will demonstrate my thesis that the theory of dynamical systems combined with modern machine learning and topological data analysis methods provide a powerful avenue to build interpretable, data-driven models of complex biological phenomena. I will show examples from my past and current research on building a purely data-driven theory of C. elegans locomotor behavior and preliminary analysis of large-scale neuro-behavioral recordings.
