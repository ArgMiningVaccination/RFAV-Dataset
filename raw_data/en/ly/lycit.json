The device, a product of the hospital's Assistive Technology team (AT), could revolution - ize peoples' everyday lives. When masks became a requirement at all federal health care facilities, AT realized how much current surgical masks hindered communication. \"I noticed after wearing a mask all day that I would come home and my eyes were tired,\" said Melissa Oliver, occupa - tional therapist and program coordinator of the AT team. \"I had to rely on just my eyes to physically express my greeting.\" John Miller, Brian Burkhardt and Seth Hills are rehabilitation engineers who work with Oliver. Their expertise, including vacuum forming, injection molding, laser cutting, electronics, 3D printing and a whole range of other valuable skills, helps V eterans return to a sense of normalcy. \"[The Clear Talker mask] may not make the cover of a fashion magazine,\" said Hills, who has developed several adaptive sports tools, custom mounting solutions and a novel wheelchair inter - face, while with AT. \"The fact that you can see each other's faces and catch those social cues is invaluable.\" TOP PHOTO: Wearing ClearTalker Mask STORY CONTINUED ON PAGE 5Inside This Issue By Megan Kon 2 Whole Health Is Integrative Medicine: Aromatheraphy 3 Salisbury VA Increases its Critical Care Capability with Virtual Technology 4 VISN 6 Opens New CBOC In Tidewater 6 Joins Local Hospitals in COVID Outreach Campaign 7 CGVAMC Social Workern Deploys to Lake Charles 8 A Time for Innovation 10 VEText Mobile Check-in is Convenient, Easy 11 Diabetes Awareness Month \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ OCTOBER 2020 | Excellent Care - Earned by Veterans - Delivered Here2 - DeAnne M. Seekins VISN 6 Network DirectorThe month of November is upon us, and we will soon honor those who defended our nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic, on V eterans Day. Many of you, like me, remember the sacrifices of our family members who fought before us. But November 11 we will salute everyone who took part in uniformed defense of our nation. They deserve it. We have much to thank them for. So, it only makes sense that we honor them every day with the best care, with the greatest expedience. Our experience this year, pro - viding V eterans the care they need and deserve while keeping them safe from the Coronavirus disease, has been challenging, but we met the need. From the start, we asked ourselves how we can expeditiously provide care without compromise. We have been trying to answer the question since January, and because we addressed the question quickly, we were able to swiftly implement changes as the nation shut down by early March. Many of our staff collaborated to invent new practices that helped ease the burden of restrictive care. It's impossible to visit one of our facilities without noticing many of the changes we've made to protect each other, staff and V eterans alike. Moving forward, for the foreseeable future, as our facilities cautiously transition back to full service, we are offering V eterans Virtual Care First. That means we are advocating video and telephone appointments whenever and wherever we can, based on the medical need, condition and practicality. As we expanded our capability and availability this year, V eterans discovered that they like the service, and appreciate the opportunity for personal contact without compromising their personal safety, or taking unnecessary health risks. As V eterans engage us to make appointments, we will triage according to urgency and their need for personal contact. I think what I am most proud of this year is that we have been able to accommodate the need in numbers approaching those before the pandemic hit. We were able to do it only because our virtual capability and V eterans' acceptance of it enabled us to pivot rapidly. It is our honor for every V eteran that drove our pre - paredness, and continues to drive our commitment to be there for them in the weeks, months and years to come. MESSAGE FROM THE NETWORK DIRECTOR 2 2 During a recent email conversa - tion, Joy Fealy-Kalar, Field Based Im - plementation Team Consultant with the Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation declared, \"Whole Health isn't just CIH [com - plementary and integrative health] approaches, and it isn't a service line where we send all patients who are interested in these approaches, so collaboration with Nursing, Mental Health, Primary and Specialty Care is going to be key in transforming our V A healthcare system.\" It seems that the concept of Whole Health tends to be a little mis - understood by both patients and cli - nicians when they are first introduced to it, but in reality, this approach to care isn't new. It is often referred to as holistic care or integrative health. But Christine Anne, Nurse Practitioner at the Fayetteville V A gets it, and agreed with Fealy-Kalar, stating, \"Y es, Whole Health has programs and services, but it is NOT a program or service line.\" In fact, she went on, offering that Whole Health is a health care model to address the needs of the Whole Person. She's right \u2014 Whole Health provides varied clinical and comple - mentary services to meet the multi-lev - el needs of body, mind, spirit, and social support for each individual. To illustrate, Anne laid out a recent scenario involving aromather - apy. According to Emily Cronkelton, writing in Healthline, an online blog, \"Aromatherapy is a holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant ex - tracts to promote health and well-be - ing.\" Anne related, \"Aromatherapy was provided last week for a V eteran with multiple mental/ health issues.\" She said that on the next day during the follow up call by the RN Aroma - therapist, the V eteran stated, \"After using this aromatherapy inhaler, I felt strange, like peaceful, not a care in the world.\" Anne is convinced that Aroma - therapy helped the V eteran achieve a state of relaxation that they hadn't felt in a long time, and that many other V eterans have sought unsuccessful - ly for years, adding, \"Mental peace of mind (not common in V eterans) is good for the health of the whole body ... all this with an aromatherapy inhaler, priced at $1.25 that will last 3-6 months.\" Aromatherapy is thought of as an art and a science. Humans have used it for a very long time. Ancient cultures have incorporated aromatics in resins, balms, and oils. Aromather - apy works through the sense of smell and skin absorption with products like spritzers, diffusers, inhalers and candles. Practitioners say that its use can help with pain management, stress and anxiety reduction, soothing joints, and can even alleviate some effects of chemotherapy. So, this serves as a great example of incorporation of Whole Health into a patient-centered plan of care. It is not a stand-alone regimen. But Fealy-Kalar wants to remind us that inclusion of these practices can have significant im - pact on V eteran health and wellbeing, not to mention the reduction in the overall cost of providing care in this model. She says that, \"We also know from the 18 (V A Whole Health) Flag - ship sites that V eterans have a three - fold reduction in opioids with this approach of developing shared goals, connecting the V eteran with what really matters to them, and teaching them self-care techniques and pro - viding CIH services.\" With that, Anne concluded, \"This creates and supports Optimal Health and WELLBEING at every level of care.\"Whole Health Is Integrative Medicine: AROMATHERAPY By Steve Wilkins | VISN 6 PUBLIC AFFAIRS Aromatherapy has been integrated as part of the Whole Health regimen of pa - tient-centered care at Fayetteville VA, with demonstrably positive results. Excellent Care - Earned by Veterans - Delivered Here | OCTOBER 2020 ///////////////////////////////////////// 3 Intensive Care medicine at the Salisbury V A Health Care System (HCS) took a big leap forward Oct. 26 when Executive Director Joe V aughn pressed a button connecting the medical center's Intensive Care Unit to a video connection at the Cincinnati V A Medical Center. Known as Tele-Critical Care, the program responsible for the connection is designed to enhance quality of intensive care situations by adding an additional layer of monitoring and increasing access to intensive care expertise and consultation around the clock. Tele Critical Care services mean V eterans receiving ICU care are being watched, even when local providers are out of the room. According to Salisbury V AHCS Chief of Medicine Dr. Charles De Comarmond, \"The launch of our new Tele-ICU operations in Salisbury is a significant milestone in our road to High-Reliable Organization.\" De Comar - mond contends, Tele-ICU not only provides the highest level of care for our V eterans, it serves as a means of collaboration and backup to our bedside staff. He related a situation two years ago when the facility found itself com - promised by a staffing shortage and worked hard to find a permanent solution. De Comarmond says hospitals like the Salisbury V AMC cannot cost-effectively support an ICU with 24/7, 365 days/year in- house critical care specialists, thus we rely on hospitalist cross-coverage to support essential coverage during night tours and weekends. He indicated that participation in V A's national Tele-Critical Care program will optimize their staffing structure. \"Now critical care support and consultation is available for our hospital - ists and ICU nurses at the push of a button, which means that rapid decision making can start without delays when help is needed immediately. Critical Care Nurse Manager Daryl At - kinson agrees with De Comarmond, adding, \"Tele-ICU not only provides the highest level of care for our V eterans, it serves as a means of collaboration and backup to our bedside staff. This allows our team to remain present with our V eterans during these critical moments, supplementing communication, coordination, and closing the loop with patient care needs extending beyond the bedside.\" After months of preparation to adapt and install equipment, and to train staff on procedures, ensuring proper communica - tion protocols and operational practices, everything was in place Oct. 26 for Salisbury leadership to officially establish the connec - tion. V aughn pressed the button that put him in direct video contact with Michelle Bonham, at the Cincinnati V A Medical Center, home of the Tele Critical Care East monitoring center. Currently, the monitoring center partners with satellite hubs in Cleveland, Ann Arbor, Baltimore, Orlando and Atlanta connecting to a total 22 medical facilities. Soon, coordinators hope to add the Central Virginia Health Care System in Richmond as an additional hub. Being a part of V A's Tele-ICU program also means being a partner in developing, implementing, and sharing evidence-based best practice examples within our Tele-ICU network. Through collaboration with our Tele-ICU partners, we can now share, adopt, and implement evidence-based protocols \u2014 directly affecting patient outcomes. De Comarmond claims the launch of the Tele-ICU operations in Salisbury is a significant milestone on the road to becoming a High-Reliable Organization, an organiza - tional aspiration shared at the facility, VISN and VHA levels. He is proud to add that as the solution, the Tele-Critical Care program lever - ages virtual care technology to provide back - ground and on-demand critical care support 24/7, 365 days/year without the concern for unplanned staff attrition. \"Being an organiza - tion that is sensitive to operations, we listened to our ICU staff. From there, we started the process to bring on Tele-Critical Care to Salis - bury so that our team could always have the confidence that someone, somewhere, is there to support them.\" Now, being part of a national network of V As connected virtually, provides immediate resources to our healthcare team \u2014 all at the push of a button.By VISN 6 Public AffairsSALISBURY VA INCREASES ITS CRITICAL CARE CAPABILITY WITH VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY From left, Salisbury VA HCS Chief of Medicine Dr. Charles de Comarmond is joined by TeleCritical Care Team members, including Salisbury VA Nurse Manager for Critical Care Daryl Atkinson, Philips eICU Sr. Clinical Transformation Manager Paula Keally, APRN TeleCritical Care Lynn Fitzwater, Salisbury VA Executive Director Joseph Vaughn, Salisbury VA HCS Associate Medical Director for TeleCritical Care Dr. Jeneen Gifford, Salisbury VA HCS Acting Chief of Staff Dr. Randall Gehle, and Dr. Rubin Cohen, Medical Director for Salisbury Critical Care during the rollout of the Tele-Critical Care program in the Salisbury VA HCS ICU.

V A's Career Development Program was established to provide mentoring for ju - nior researchers so that they can learn from renowned, experienced V A researchers. Awardees from this program have become national and international leaders in their research fields. Awards are provided in all areas of V A's research enterprise, and support researchers at three levels. The distinctions separate entry-level work in Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, project stages lasting from 3-5 years, and a senior skill enhancement opportunity that could include a year-long sabbatical. Candidates must be nominated by a V A facility and must identify an appropriate V A mentor. A new Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) opened in Portsmouth, V a., on Thursday, Oct. 15th. This represents the fourth community clinic in the Hampton Roads V A Healthcare System, joining existing clinics in Virginia Beach and Chesapeake, V a., as well as a clinic in Albemarle, N.C. The 14,000-SF facility will begin operations at 600 Crawford Street, Suites 300 and 400, in Portsmouth, V a. The clinic will open with two Patient-Aligned Care Teams (PACT) to service approximately 2,400 V eterans, although it contains capacity to accommodate another 6,000 for a total of 8,400 V eterans receiving their care in the clin -ic. About 40 people will staff the clinic when it is fully operational. Most significantly, this will represent the 3rd CBOC in the Tidewater region, an area that has been, and projects to remain, one of the fastest-growing areas of V eteran demand for care in the United States. In fact, this area has grown so significantly that V A has scheduled to open a health care center (HCC), a much larger facility, in FY23/24, to satisfy the growing demand for services; with another HCC in the early planning stages. V eterans should enjoy shorter drive times to the clinic than previous trips to the Hampton V A medical center. It will enable them to avoid crossing the Hampton Roads bridge tunnel, a significant barrier to timely care, while also allowing the medical center to repurpose some space for more specialized services on the hospital campus. The new clinic is scheduled to open initially with two PACT Teams as well as 2 Behavioral health teams.By VISN 6 Public Affairs VISN 6 OPENS NEW CBOC IN TIDEWATER VISN 6 Director DeAnne Seekins (2nd from left) stands to cut the ceremonial ribbon on the new Tidewater Community Based Outpatient Clinic with (from right) Hampton VA Acting Director Dr. Shawn Alexaander, Associate Directors Crystal Lindaman and Dr. Taquisa Simmons, and Dr. Dennis Walker (left), Hampton VAMC acting Chief of Staff.

Blalock, PhD (LEFT PHOTO) The Clear Talker mask is composed of a thermoplastic polyester commonly known as PETG, that provides significant chemical resistance, durability and excellent formability for manufactur - ing. The mask sizes are universal, based on The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The Clear Talker meets FDA requirements for surgical masks under the emergency use authorization for single-use surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, says Burkhardt. When the pandemic is over, the Clear Talker will be submitted for approval to become the new surgical mask standard. THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THE MASK Born with progressive hearing loss in both ears, AT member John Miller was the inspiration behind the Clear Talker mask. \"As a person with hearing loss, I do have hearing aids that allow me to hear sound,\" Miller said. \"But I also rely on lip reading to fill in the blanks that I miss with my hearing. After the pandemic started, I was grateful everyone was wear - ing masks, but it made my day-to-day life harder.\" Miller's personal experience inspired him to pursue an engineering degree that would allow him to directly help people with disabilities THE DESIGN \"The first time the three of us had these masks on, I almost felt like a weight came off of my shoulders,\" said Bur - khardt. \"I felt lighter knowing the burden of understanding was diminished with the ease of seeing the whole face.\" The clear masks on the market today have filters located directly in front of the mouth, which obstruct visibility of the mouth. \"The idea behind the Clear Talker was to create a product with the fewest manufactured parts, while still being able to read lips,\" Burkhardt added. AT held focus groups to test the de - sign to ensure it helped people read body language, facial expressions and improve the overall connection Oliver said she hopes to have all testing completed within a few weeks to begin distributing the masks to staff at the hospital.

It can be hereditary or result from surgery, physical trauma, infection or radiation. Because the disease is often underdi - agnosed by health care professionals, all women and men who undergo surgery and/or radiation for breast cancer may benefit from at least one screening appointment. Besides timely identification and intervention, the visit can offer education to decrease risks for developing lymphedema. Without treatment, patients can suffer declines in function, inde - pendence, health and quality of life. In a recent study, 42 out of 100 women developed mild to moderate lymphedema within 5 years of their breast cancer treatment. Many women self-reporting early symptoms, like jewelry and clothing feeling tight, arm swelling after exercise, puffiness or tired, heavy skin, showed a higher occurrence of the disease. Some experts suggest that early and timely intervention reduces further develop - ment, which could include infection as well as the swelling. With greater awareness of the risks for lymphedema, V eterans should access screen - ing and treatment more often, and sooner after cancer treatments. Specially trained V A occupational and physical therapists con - duct lymphedema interventions, or V eterans can opt for community referrals to Certified Lymphedema Therapists. The V A also covers items associated with lymphedema treatment. Breast cancer survivors should discuss any questions or concerns about lymphedema with their Primary Care Physicians, Oncolo - gists, Plastic Surgeons, Breast Clinics and/or Women's Health Clinic staff. \"As a breast cancer survivor, a Certified Lymphedema Ther - apist, a Veteran, and as VA employee, I can attest to the benefits of the care provided by the VA for breast-cancer-treat - ment-related lymphedema.\" \u2014 Naomi Moran Certified Lymphedema Therapist CGVAMC Social Worker Deploys to Lake Charles By Amber Brown | CGV AMC SYSTEMS REDESIGN ASHEVILLE, NC \u2014 A little more than a month ago, Hurricane Laura hit the Gulf Coast. That hurricane tied with an 1856 hurricane as the strongest on record to make landfall in Louisiana. Our Disaster Emergency Medical Person - nel Services (DEMPS) put out a request for volunteers to come to the hardest-hit areas and offer support. Living in a makeshift tent in the parking lot next to a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), she and other DEMPS staff assisted with wellness checks. For the first time this year, we sent a Social Worker \u2014 Danielle \"Dani\" Bartley. Bartley arrived in Lake Charles, La., where she remained for several weeks. Living in a makeshift tent in the parking lot next to a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), she and other DEMPS staff assisted with well - ness checks, distribution of food, water and other essential items, and supported those who were seeking shelter. Bartley also worked to link V eterans and community members with free services such as tree removal and roofing repairs. \"The pandemic, [along with the] natural disasters, have created a crisis and turned people's lives upside down,\" she said. \"These individuals are going through some of the most difficult times of their lives, and I hope to be able to do what I can to ease that burden even if it's to make them smile or laugh in the face of a crisis.\" Bartley said she wanted to provide sup - port and hope to those she is serving during her deployment. She also hoped to learn from those she met along with way and said that their resiliency taught her as well.

This year, V eterans Health Administra - tion (VHA) leadership reviewed more than 400 submissions and selected the top 15 practices that address key priorities, including increased access to care, suicide prevention and health care after COVID-19. According to Dr. Anne Bailey, Pharmacist Provider and Emerging Tech Clinical Special - ist, Western North Carolina V A Health Care System submitted five of the 400 Shark Tank applications this year, and though they were not selected among the final top 15, two did stand out as emerging strong practices. Those two practices were both led by Pharmacist Providers \u2014 Dr. Eric Gibbs and Dr. Erica Asaro. \"Dr. Asaro's best practice increases access to care for V eterans with rheumatoid arthritis while also improving patient safety, decreas - ing medication-related risks, and allowing for increased direct communication between V eterans and their provider,\" Bailey said. \"Dr. Gibb's best practice focused on helping V eterans with Substance Use Disor - ders access care when, where, and how they are ready,\" she added. \"Through a pharma - cist-managed, in-home alcohol detoxification protocol, Gibbs uses virtual care models to help V eterans safely navigate the detox process.\" Each of those practices continues to grow locally with the potential of spreading broadly to other V As across the country. \"We also submitted 12 Spark-Seed- Spread applications, six of which were select - ed for the fiscal year 2021 Spark-Seed-Spread Innovation Investment program,\" Bailey said. \"Spark-Seed-Spread is the V A's way of building that innovation muscle by investing directly into the creativity of frontline staff.\" One project \u2014 texting for pharmacy re - fills and tracking \u2014 is in response to a multi- site, human-centered design project led by the Health Care System and is in collaboration with the Innovators Network and the V eterans Experience Office. \"This project is a direct response to chal - lenges that we've heard V eterans themselves express nationwide,\" Bailey said. The Health Care system also adopted the VEText Patient Tracking Tool that allows V eterans to check in for appointments while on campus without requiring their physical presence in a waiting area. That has been especially helpful, given the physical distancing requirements in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHAT IS SHARK TANK? According to the VHA Innovation Ecosystem website, the V eterans Health Administration's Shark Tank Competition provides medical centers across the country an opportunity to recognize top performers who are solving some of the toughest clinical and operational challenges across VHA. To be eligible, applicants must have successfully implemented their practice in at least one facility, and the practice must address one of the VHA Priority Categories defined each year. Those submitted processes are evaluated by VHA subject matter experts. Applicants compete for the opportunity to be one of 15 Finalists who pitch their prac - tices at the live competition to Medical Center and V eterans Integrated Service Network Director \"Sharks.\" During the competition, Sharks bid resources \u2014 such as funding, staff, or time \u2014 to implement the practices they want in their facilities. VHA senior leaders select approximately 10 Finalists and 10 Sharks as winners of the competition. The winning practices proceed with facilitated replication in the winning Sharks' facilities. If the implementation is suc - cessful, VHA leaders may select the practice for national rollout. To date, the competition has identified 59 clinical and operational practices, eight of which are being implemented nationally. The practices have impacted more than 100,000 V eterans across the health care sys - tem and are helping position VHA as a leader in health care innovation and progress. RESPONSIBLE FOR CHANGE The V A has a long history of innovation while providing health care to generations of V eterans. Many of those innovations have been adopted throughout the health care industry to better treat patients. V A medical professionals pioneered breakthrough inno - vations like: Barcode software for administering medications safely; The implantable cardiac pacemaker; The first successful liver transplants; The nicotine patch to help smokers quit; and Artificial limbs that move naturally when stimulated by electrical brain impulses. Ms. Stephanie Y oung, Western North Carolina V A Health Care System Director, al - ways says, \"Improving our work is our work.\" And this year's Shark Tank submissions are living up to Y oung's mantra. After all, the team at the Western North Carolina V A Health Care System are all about innovation. The VHA Shark Tank Competition encourages medical centers to utilize their top performers to help develop solutions to clinical and operational challenges nationwide.

Excellent Care - Earned by Veterans - Delivered Here | OCTOBER 2020 ///////////////////////////////////////// 9 rTMS Services at Hampton VAMC Continue to Grow By Hampton VAMC Public Affairs Hampton V A Medical Center is celebrat - ing the progress of a program in its Neuro Modulation Clinic that has helped V eterans cope with and heal from treatment resistant depression. Since the Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) ribbon cutting ceremony in March 2018, Hampton's rTMS services at Hampton have flourished and expanded. Deemed an essential treatment for those who have had significant depression and, in many cases, suicidal ideations, the rTMS Clinic has remained open throughout the COVID-19 period. Dr. Kenneth Miller, Director of the rTMS Clinic, also reports, \"VISN 6's support for the growth and expansion of psychiatric noninvasive interventions neuromodulation interventions here at Hampton is incredible.\" Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stim -ulation uses a small handheld device or hel - met called a \"treatment coil\" to deliver energy to the brain using pulsed \"magnetic fields.\" Similar to magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, the de - vice applies a series of pulses called \"rTMS\" to stimulate the brain, without surgery. The treatment does not require anesthesia or sedation. Patients remain awake and alert. rTMS is a noninvasive treatment with minimal procedural side effects. V eterans can return to daily activities after their 20-minute treatment session. V eterans have reported a positive effect on their mood, clarity of thought, sleep, and energy. There is also a significant reduction or absence of suicidal thoughts. Hampton's Neuro Modulation clinic has provided approximately 1900 treat - ment sessions since 2018, for V eterans with complex treatment resistant depression. The success response rate is up to 70 percent for the extended treatment, but lower for the shorter acute course. Remission of their depressive condition is seen in approx - imately 30 percent of those who have com - pleted the six-to-eight-week treatment course. The clinic currently has two deep rTMS devices: BrainsWay H1 Coils that treat major depression, and new coil, H7, that treats Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and potentially other addiction disorders. Team Hampton looks forward to the expansion of Somatic/Neuromodulation services at Hampton V AMC main campus and South Hampton Roads Clinics to include Chesapeake, Virginia Beach and Portsmouth. Hampton's clinic director, Dr. Kenneth J. Miller M.D. DLFAPA, DANPA, is a board-cer - tified psychiatrist. Dr. Miller is also boarded in neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology and he directs his professional team, which includes certified nurses and technicians.

The V A is following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, and that means reducing unnecessary foot traffic and congestion in its facilities. The new process which is based on the VEText platform that has been used to send V eterans updates and reminders for a while, so the program is not something radically new for V eterans. What is new is using it to check in for doctors' appointments.Due to restrictions associated with the pandemic, the capacity for waiting areas in all V A facilities has been reduced. VEText Mobile Check-in provides an option for V eterans to check in using their cell phones and then wait in their vehicles until their providers are ready to see them. How It Works V eterans must have a text-capable cell phone number on file with the V A. V eter - ans unsure of whether their number is on file should contact their care team or verify the information when they're contacted to schedule an appointment. The number used for texting must be the same number in a V eteran's file. Once V eterans arrive to the facility for their scheduled appointment and park, they will text the word \"here\" to 53079. That will alert the care team that the V eteran is at the facility and is waiting to be called to his or her appointment. The V eteran will receive a text response verifying that the care team is aware that he or she is on site. Once the care team is ready, the V eteran will receive a text instructing him or her to enter the building and proceed to their appointment. When the V eteran enters the facility, he or she will report to the clinic as scheduled. This program provides a way for the health care system to see more V eterans while complying with the CDC guidelines regarding physical distancing. It increases the safety for the V eterans and staff, and it reduces the wait time inside the facility. By Vance Janes | WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA V A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER Annette Melton, Charles George VA Medical Center Eye Clinic supervisor (left), and Amber Brown, Systems Redesign Coordinator, talk with a Veteran in the parking lot about our new service VEText Mobile Check-in. The app, which has been used to push notifications to Veterans can now be used to let doctors know when Veterans have arrived for an appointment.Note: If a Veteran does not have a text-capable cell phone or a vehicle to wait in, he or she can proceed to the entrance to receive assistance from our screeners. Veterans should allow enough time for COVID-19 screening and report to the clinic of their scheduled appointment no more than 15 minutes before the appointment time.VEText Mobile Check-in is Convenient, EasyDiabetes Awareness Month By Vance Janes | WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA V A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER November is Diabetes Awareness Month, and we want to increase your awareness of this serious disease.
