So, how do you meditate? You can do this by listening to music that allows you to mind wander rather than sing along, or through breathing exercises. I often find that the best way for me is to get away from my normal surrounds and leave all technology behind so I can truly disconnect from the noise of everyday life. For a long time, I found it difficult to meditate. I found that I would get distracted really easily and I had no idea what I was doing. I knew that many celebrities and wealthy entrepreneurs use meditation on a regular basis, but I often found myself wondering 'why?' What is the point? Why should you meditate? How do you meditate? And what are the benefits? There must be something to it... In this article, I'm going to explore these questions. What are the benefits of meditation? Russell Brand, Tony Robbins, Oprah, Steve Jobs and many successful people have openly spoken about the benefits of meditating. Meditation helps to: - naturally heal our bodies both mentally and physically. - keep us young and it is really helpful for brain health. - reduce blood pressure and improves your heart health. - reduce pain, headaches, stress, and anxiety by allowing your mind and body to reboot. We wash our bodies every day and we reboot our computers on a regular basis but how often do you reboot your mind? There are very strong connections between he energetic balancing that is achieved through giving yourself time to practice meditation, and maintaining good physical and emotional health. You may have heard us talking about [alkalizing your thoughts](https://www.detoxandcure.com/what-is-a-sensory-deprivation-tank/) in other articles here, but if you haven't, here's a quick snippet. Imagine you have had an argument with your nearest and dearest. There's been a lot of tension and the situation is quite heated. Now imagine sitting down to a meal right after that. It's highly unlikely that your body will accept the food you have in front of you. You may even lose your appetite for a while. This is because your energy is not congruent with the energy in the food. Yes, there is energy in your food (providing it has not been cooked out of it). [Raw foods](https://www.detoxandcure.com/articles/irish-moss-seaweed/) and vegetables are alive, they have an energy source. To take that energy into your body when your body's energetic flow is not congruent with your natural state of wellness is to feed the tension and angst. Stop, breathe out, release the tension and anger. Thank it for what you have learned, and let it go. Alkalize your thoughts. You are an being of light and energy at a cellular level. Work in harmony with the energy and light within you. Use meditation as a tool to help you find the center so you can be balanced and healthy mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Why should I meditate? It took a bit of trial and error before I found something that works for me. I like to start my day with meditation because I feel fresh and feel that meditation gives me clarity and helps me focus. Using meditation is really quite simple. Start by allocating some time each day, between 5 and 30 minutes. You may need to schedule it into your calendar or wake up 15 - 30 minutes earlier every morning. I know this sounds challenging, but it's a really nice way to start your day. You're not diving out of bed in a rush, you're just gently easing your way into the day and you'll be amazed how much energy you have. Tips on improving your meditation I recommend wearing comfortable clothes, sit or lie down in a comfortable position. You could play some calming music, light a candle and burn incense or aromatherapy oils to help engage your senses. Sometimes, I like to use my Tibetan singing bowl to heighten the vibrational energy in the room. The noise vibrations are rather pleasant and calming. When using a Tibetan singing bowl, the vibrations produced improves the energy in the room and resonates with the vibration in your body. Try adding a little water to the bowl, it sounds like dolphins singing. Start by focusing on your breathing and observe your thoughts. When your mind starts racing, concentrate on your breathing and bring your focus back to your breath. Start with an intention which adds structure to your meditation practice.
