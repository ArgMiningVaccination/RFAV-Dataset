Berk, VMD, MRCVS Although the situation is not unique to the equine veterinary profession, it seems like we as equine vets struggle with finding the right equilib- rium between serving our clients in a way that is best for them and their horses versus being used as vendors to accomplish the purposes that our clients have determined for us. Sometimes those things are one and the same, and sometimes they are not. When they are not, we are forced to ask ourselves some hard questions. As we look at this conflict that has been ingrained in equine veterinary practice, some of the answers may be found in examining the difference between a profession and a trade. In scouring all the resources I could find on what distinguishes a profession from a trade, I came across a few points that resonated with me and many AAEP members that I've spoken with over the last year. We are all aware of some of the features that the individual professions share\u2014training, accreditation, licensing, etc.\u2014but some other features jumped out at me. One was autonomy: professionals have control over and, correspondingly, ultimate responsibility for their own work. Professionals tend to define the terms, processes and conditions of the work to be performed for clients. Another feature that defines a profession is that members of a profession can exercise discrimination in choosing clients rather than simply accepting any interested party as a customer. In veterinary medicine, this is the basis for the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. Professionals are bound to a code of conduct or ethics in their relation- ships with clients, colleagues and the public. In one resource, I found the following: \"A profession is charged with a substantial degree of public obligation by virtue of its specialized knowledge.\" Regarding the many disciplines that make up equine per- formance activity, the public grants these sports a \"social license to operate,\" which is the public's way of saying that they think we're doing an adequate job of guardian- ship of the equine participants of the sport. The public is not necessarily singling out the equine veterinary profession\u2014we would be lumped in with trainers, riders, judges and stewards, racetrack operators and owners\u2014 but because we are professionals, we are held to a higher standard by the public who expects us to lead in addressing any issues that have been identified as detri- mental to the health and welfare of horses. Currently, horse racing is being highlighted by many media outlets as requiring leadership to address perceived inadequacies in the management of horses. It is likely that other equine sports and disciplines will attract the same level of scrutiny at some point, so in addition to occupying a leadership role, the AAEP will also need to communicate on a regular basis to both the AAEP membership and the public our ongoing efforts as well as an honest assessment of progress toward the goals with a targeted timeline. Here are some examples: Regarding bisphosphonates, the AAEP assembled a working group of AAEP-member veterinarians (racetrack and sport horse practitioners, equine surgeons, equine researchers, regulatory vets and laboratory analytic specialists) in March 2018 to study the use of bisphosphonates and collate the information in order to make a recommendation to the board of directors. This resulted in the board- approved statement which was the basis for the Thoroughbred sales companies in America banning the use of bisphosphonates in sales horses and several racetracks instituting \"house rules\" banning the use of bisphosphonates in horses racing there. (Please note that this addresses off-label use of bisphospho- nates in horses under four years of age and does not impugn its use in older horses as labeled.) The AAEP Horseracing Integrity Act Task Force was charged with studying HR 1754, evaluating the AAEP position on the bill (the board approved a shift from \"oppose\" to \"monitor\"), and identifying weaknesses in the bill that, if amended, could lead to AAEP support of a national bill. It was unanimously agreed by this group that national uniformity of racing medication is of paramount importance, and we are in the process of finalizing our recommenda- tions for amendments to the bill. We are in regular conversation with both the crafters of the bill at The Jockey Club as well as the legislators (Rep. Andy Dr. Jeff Berk continued on page IV The AAEP is finalizing recommendations for amendments to the Horseracing Integrity Act.

Dr. House joined the faculty in 2007 and is the director of the Practice- Based Equine Clerkship program, which enables veterinary students to have an ambulatory practice clinical rotation with private practitioners. She also served as an AAEP Student Chapter faculty advisor from 2008-2015. Dr. House received her veterinary degree from Tufts University and completed an internship and large animal internal medicine residency at the University of Georgia's Veterinary Teaching Hospital prior to joining the University of Florida. A past president of the Florida Association of Equine Practitioners, Dr. House serves on the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee, as moderator of the Infectious Disease Round and on the Mentorship subcommittee. She previously served on the Horse Owner Education, Member Engagement, and Professional Conduct and Ethics committees. Sarah Reuss, VMD, DACVIM Dr. Reuss, of Philadelphia, Penn., is a professional services veterinarian with Boehringer Ingelheim. She transi- tioned from academia to industry in 2016 with Merial, which was subse- quently acquired by Boehringer Ingelheim. For six years prior, Dr. Reuss had been a clinical assistant professor and chief of the Large Animal Medicine Service at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, where she served on the Admissions and the Internship and Residency Evaluation committees and as a faculty advisor to the AAEP and AVMA Student Chapters. Upon earning her veterinary degree from University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Reuss completed an internship at Equine Medical Center of Ocala and a large animal internal medicine residency at Texas A&M University. She joined University of Florida following a stint in general practice at McKinlay and Peters Equine Hospital. Dr. Reuss is a member of the AAEP's Member Engagement Committee and previously served on the Educational Programs Committee.Following a month-long vote by the membership that concluded Oct. 9, Drs. Amanda House and Sarah Reuss were elected to three-year terms on the AAEP board of directors. Each was installed during the Dec. 10 President's Luncheon at the 65th Annual Convention in Denver, Colo.

Ted Yoho [R-FL]) on Capitol Hill, the latter two of whom are veterinarians with constituents who have impressed upon them the importance of this issue. The Medication Task Force has been charged with reviewing and updating our medication guidelines with regard to racehorses, sport horses and sales horses. After that is accomplished by the three subgroups, the revised document will be presented to the board of directors for approval. That is Phase One. Phase Two is then to take these guidelines to industry stakeholders who have the power of imple- mentation and enforcement and work with them to institutionalize our recommendations. Unfortunately, the AAEP as an association can only make recom- mendations\u2014we are not a regulatory body\u2014so we need to partner with the industry to attempt to make the changes that we seek. The AAEP Foundation (now known as The Foundation for the Horse), working in conjunction with Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation and the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, has solicited research proposals relative to the study of and testing for bisphosphonates. Currently, there are 10 proposals being considered for potential funding by this trio of organizations, and the selection process that will determine which projects receive funding will be completed by the end of December. The AAEP is not a trade union. It is an association of professionals who are trying every day to make a positive difference in the lives of their equine patients and clients.

Remarkably, the ice cream churn was powered by an enormous draft gelding on a treadmill. The horse stood quietly until the farmer chirped at him, whereby he began to plod uphill in a rhythmic and determined manner, the treadmill turning the linkage attached to a churn. Out came the iPhones and we all snapped away at this innovative partnership that resulted in\u2014voila\u2014ice cream. Anything that results in ice cream is a good thing, right? Several weeks later, a friend alerted me to a post on Facebook that appeared to be of that same horse in that same location, but the Facebook post decried the exploita - tion of the horse, his enslavement and forced servitude, and the cruelty inflicted in his loss of liberty and free will. How is it possible that two people who observed exactly the same thing reached conclusions so profoundly different? I saw a well-fed horse, for all appearances sound and in good health. He was not fearful of his handler nor did he demon- strate reluctance to perform his task. So, what did the Facebook poster see that I didn't? And what did I see that she didn't? The horse's inherent needs\u2014safety, food and social interac- tion\u2014have not changed, but the lens through which a non- agrarian public sees and interprets them has. An evolving societal ethos imposes additional expectations with respect to the stewardship of the horses we care for. In some cases, the expectation is beneficial to the horse; in other cases, benign with no discernable effect; but in some cases, a well- intentioned but ill-informed public can put horses at risk, and that can represent a substantial challenge to the equine practitioner. Some years ago, a dog trainer opined to me that the biggest contributing factor to pet abandonment was the miscom- munication that arises when \"people treat dogs like other people, while failing to recognize that dogs treat people like other dogs.\" A similar conclusion could be drawn with respect to our relationship with the horse\u2014failed under- standing results in unmet or unreasonable expectations. There is a role for the equine veterinarian in recognizing and resolving that conflict\u2014to better meet the needs of the horse. All aspects of equine ownership and management benefit from ongoing self-examination, but external evaluation is also critical to avoid \"because we've always done it that way\" as the sole defense of the status quo. As equine veteri-narians, we should be able to defend our practices\u2014or consider changing them. So, the question is not what we as veterinarians can do, but rather what we should do. Ethics is the contemplation of the \"should,\" not the \"can\"; and the \"should\" includes context that requires consider- ation. Keeping the arthritic 30-year-old mare comfortable enough to ramble around the pasture may engender a different \"should\" than the lame performance horse that the owner wants to finish out the show season rather than give an early layoff\u2014and the \"should\" is impacted by societal expectations that the veterinarian needs to be aware of. Which is not to say that the veterinarian is required to accede to the societal ethos if, as the advocate for the horse, they believe to acquiesce will result in a failure to meet the horse's inherent needs. The veterinarian has a role as educator in fulfilling their duty as advocate for the horse. It's worth noting that evolution of public sensibility about the role of animals is neither new nor static. In the 1930s, Seabiscuit, generally acknowledged to have been chronically continued on page IXAAEP News December 2019 IXFoUnDAtion The AAEP Foundation, which for 25 years has served as the charitable arm of the AAEP to improve the welfare of horses, has been renamed The Foundation for the Horse. The announcement was made during the Dec. 8 Opening Session at the AAEP's 65th Annual Convention. \"Our new name more clearly defines who we are and who we serve,\" said Dr. Richard Mitchell, chair of The Foundation Advisory Council. \"As we embark on our next quarter-century under a new name, our mission remains steadfast and as relevant today as at inception. It is a mission that resonates with all who love and care about these noble animals.\" Established in 1994 by a gift from the estate of the late Mrs. Halina Leonard of Chino, Calif., The Foundation has distributed more than $6 million in support of its mission. This total includes a cumulative disbursement of $1.4 million in 2018-2019, which is reflective of The Foundation's growing influence and impact on horse welfare nationally and internationally. The Foundation's priorities are to support education through much-needed veterinary student scholarships and educational programs that improve the care of horses; equine research in pursuit of new treatments and cures that improve patient management and prognosis through exceptional science; and benevolence programs such as working equid welfare administered by \"Equitarian\" veterinarians, disaster preparedness training and relief efforts for horses in need, and initiatives aimed at improving the lives of horses at risk or in transition.

Today, there would be nothing heart- warming about the prospect of a lame horse being sent out to race. A May 15, 1968, Associated Press article reported, \"Dancer's Image was feeling frisky today, just three days before the 93rd running of the Preakness, following the tapping of his bothersome right front ankle last night.\" Again, it's not hard to say that within the current ethos that practice would be insupportable. But both events, each in the context of the time, were acceptable. The passage of a few decades affords clarity that can be difficult to achieve in the moment. All of which makes me wonder if, in 30 years, someone sees that same photo of the horse on the treadmill, what will be their response?Two sides of the same scoop, continuedEtHicsX AAEP News December 2019 Although semi-retired after selling her ownership stake in Genesee Valley Equine Clinic in Scottsville, N.Y., in December 2017, Dr. Ann Dwyer continues to influence the welfare of horses through her part-time practice and her commitment to various educational programs as a lecturer on ophthalmology and practice management topics and as vice chair of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine Advisory Council. Dr. Dwyer's lifetime of compassion for the horse and concern for its well-being began as a child in pony club and will continue in perpetuity as a member of The Foundation's Halina Leonard Legacy Society. Dr. Dwyer recently discussed her bequest, which she said was one way of giving back for all that the horse has provided. Is there an important moment, person or special reason connected with AAEP that influenced your decision to include The Foundation in your estate plans? My decision to include The Foundation in my estate plan grew from my service on the AAEP board of directors (2006-2008) and executive committee (2010-2014). I experienced firsthand the influence that AAEP and its Foundation have on the welfare of the horse and the industry in general during my year as AAEP president (2013). When you think of The Foundation, what key words or phrases come to mind? Equine welfare. Cultivating future generations of caregivers. Growth in care delivery. Raising awareness of horse health concerns within the entire horse industry. What legacy do you hope to leave through your estate gift? Horses and the horse industry have provided me with a fascinating and rewarding career. I have enjoyed giving back through service as an educator and AAEP volunteer. My estate gift will be a way to keep on giving in the future. From your perspective, how has the work of The Foundation influenced the welfare of the horse? Many, many ways. Through scholarship support for future veterinarians. Through disaster relief for all kinds of situations that jeopardize equine lives and welfare. In recent years, The Foundation has escalated their support of research that is improving the ability of veterinarians to optimize equine health. The establishment of the Equine Disease Communication Center was a keystone effort. The EDCC has become a central resource for accurate communication of evolving disease situations; the entire industry relies on the information it transmits on a daily basis. What advice would you like to share with other members about this? Think hard about what horses have done for you in your life. Consider a donation to The Foundation every year as a way to give back, and also keep The Foundation in mind when you make an estate plan. You can also consider making a donation to The Foundation in memory of patients you have cared for, to honor clients or friends in the industry, or to celebrate a milestone in your career or in the career of someone you have mentored. How would you describe The Foundation to someone who isn't familiar with the it? The mission of The Foundation is to improve the welfare of horses. This non-profit organization does so in a variety of ways: benevolence, research, education and disaster relief. You have the option to designate the area you would like to support. If you make a contribution of any amount to The Foundation, 100% of the funds you give will work for The Foundation mission as administrative costs are not taken out of donor funds. Could you talk about the considerations that went into your estate gift to The Foundation and the importance of estate planning in general for equine practitioners? No matter your age, you should have a will! Even if you are very young, you should have some kind of plan for what will happen after you are gone. Setting up a will does not have to be expensive or complex. As your life changes, any designations that you have chosen can be modified. As life evolves, our situations become more complex. If you serve clients, own a business, have a role in a governmental or educational institution, and/or have a family, other people depend on you. An estate plan is essential to provide continuity for any of these roles, as well as delivering any philanthropic intent you have for your personal legacy. A carefully constructed estate plan will optimize the impact your life will have on the people, animals, institutions and the causes that are important to you.Legacy pledge to reward the horse for 'fascinating' career Dr. Dwyer on Capitol Hill to speak with legislators on important horse industry issues.

Abnormal neurological exam Evidence of muscle myopathy Lack of energy or sour attitude Poorly developed topline Sti before and sore after exercise Weak immune response Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Contrast radiography of the DFTS This multicentre retrospective study by Abigail Kent and colleagues in the UK aimed to evaluate contrast radiography of the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) in diagnosing intrathecal tendon pathology. Medical records from three equine hospitals were reviewed. Horses were included in the study if they were diagnosed with lameness localised to the DFTS and had both contrast radiography and subsequent tenoscopy under general anaesthesia performed to con rm a diagnosis of a manica flexoria (MF) tear, deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) annular ligament (PAL) 5 -7 mL of sodium meglumine diatrizoate or iohexol was injected with 10 mL mepivacaine hydrochloride into the DFTS. Horses were then walked for 4 -5 strides before a lateromedial radiograph of the distal limb was taken. Radiographs were reviewed by four operators blinded to case details. Sensitivity, speci city and inter- observer variability were calculated for each pathology. A total of 206 horses met the inclusion criteria. Contrast tenography was a sensitive test for MF tears and speci c for DDFT tears, but there was a poor agreement between evaluators when diagnosing PAL constriction from contrast radiographs. Ponies and cobs were signi cantly more likely to be affected with MF tears, whereas Thoroughbreds, Warmbloods and draught breeds were more likely to have DDFT tears. These results indicate that contrast radiography of the DFTS may offer an accurate diagnosis of certain DFTS pathologies. Equine infectious keratitis In this study, Minna Mustikka and colleagues retrospectively described laboratory ndings, treatment and outcome associated with equine infectious keratitis in Finland. Medical records of horses diagnosed with infectious keratitis at the University of Helsinki Equine Hospital over a 11.5-year period were reviewed. Of the 47 cases included in this study, keratomycosis was diagnosed in 27 eyes and bacterial keratitis in 20 eyes. Aspergillus flavus was the most frequent isolate Aspergillus sp. isolates; all were susceptible to voriconazole while only two were susceptible to amphotericin B.Cylindrocarpon sp. isolates were resistant to both agents. Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus was the most frequent followed by other streptococci (4/19, 21%). All 13 Streptococcus sp. isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and all tested isolates (n =11) were also susceptible to chloramphenicol. Mean duration of medical treatment was longer in fungal keratitis (38 days) than in bacterial keratitis (25 days). Globe-sparing surgery in addition to medical therapy was performed in 26 eyes. Recovery was achieved in 66% (31/47) of all cases and in 59% (16/27) of cases with keratomycosis and 75% (15/20) of cases with bacterial keratitis. Although Aspergillus sp. and S. zooepidemicus were the most frequently encountered isolates, cytology, culture andsusceptibility testing are essential to differentiate bacterial and fungal keratitis and guide the clinician to (miRNA) ngerprints have been proposed as a new class of noninvasive human cancer biomarkers. In this study, Lucia Unger and colleagues in Switzerland compared equine sarcoid (ES) disease-speci c serum and whole blood and correlated expression in sarcoid tissue. After high-throughput sequencing, miRNA differential expression analysis between six ES-affected and ve control horses was carried out in serum and whole blood using a DESeq algorithm, accounting for the in fluence of haemolysis and the white blood cell count. Target gene, pathway prediction and enrichment analyses were conducted using TarBase, mirPath and GeneCodis. Four of 11 serum samples were haemolysed and were excluded; in the remaining serum samples, 9 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in serum of ES vs. control horses. In whole blood, all 11 samples showed normal white blood cell counts and 19 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed. A total of 2/9 serum and 7/ 19 whole blood differentially expressed miRNAs were also highly expressed at the tissue level, and their predicted target genes were associated with cancer pathways. Serum and whole blood miRNA expression allowed discrimination between ES and control horses and merits further validation in a larger study cohort. The use of whole blood might be superior because it has higher miRNA content and is less in fluenced by pre-analytical variables compared with serum. Concurrent dysregulation of single miRNAs in tissue and blood suggests a possible biological function of circulating miRNAs. Inflammatory bowel disease In this retrospective study, Constanze Fintl and colleagues in Norway and Sweden evaluated the immunohistological changes to the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), enteric neurons and glial cells in the small intestine of horses with in flammatory bowel disease (IBD). Immunohistochemistry was performed on ileal samples collected at post-mortem from eight normal control horses and from 14 horses with clinical signs of IBD. The duration of illness ranged from 3 weeks to 6 months, with two horses having received corticosteroid therapy prior to euthanasia. Tissue sections were labelled with anti-CD117 (c-Kit), Images were then to quantify the presence of ICC, neuronal and enteroglial networks. ICC networks were signi cantly reduced in the myenteric plexus region in horses with IBD compared with the controls for both markers. All IBD cases had villous atrophy and lymphoid and submucosa, but the myenteric ganglia typically appeared normal and free from in flammatory cell in ltrate. The authors concluded that disruption to ICC networks may contribute to the clinical signs of IBD. \u00a92019 EVJ equine in fluenza vaccination This knowledge summary by Emma Shipman considers the PICO question 'In three day event horses, does biannual routine in fluenza vaccination compared to annual routine influenza vaccination reduce performance levels? ' There is no evidence that biannual equine in fluenza vaccination compared with annual booster vaccination in 3-day event horses is associated with reduced performance. A group of ve studies published over an 11-year period from one veterinary hospital were evaluated. In adult Warmblood horses, there is weak evidence that exercise in the 28-day period post-booster vaccination for equine influenza and equine herpes viruses 1 and 4 (EHV1 and 4) is associated with changes in physical and clinical pathophysiological parameters including total red blood cell (RBC) count, neutrophil and lymphocyte count, brinogen concentration and serum proteins. These changes occurred at variable time points in the 14 days post-exercise, and values were not outside the published reference ranges for the reporting laboratories where published. Athletic performance of the horses was not evaluated. No recommendations for equine in fluenza vaccination protocols in 3-day event horses can be made from the evidence. Post-operative re flux after small intestinal surgery In this retrospective study, Carrie Jacobs and colleagues in the United States aimed to determine whether perioperative variables can be used to differentiate a medical vs. a surgical reason for post-operative re flux (POR) after small intestinal (SI) surgery in horses. Medical records of horses >1 year of age that underwent SI surgery and developed POR over an 8-year period were reviewed. Surgical reasons for POR were de ned as an anastomosis complication, mechanical obstruction or nonviable intestine identi ed at repeat celiotomy/necropsy. A medical reason for POR was presumed when the POR improved with medical treatment or when no surgical reasons were identi ed at repeat celiotomy/necropsy. Perioperative variables were analysed and used to develop a logistic regression model. Post-operative re flux after SI surgery was reported in 51 horses. After initial SI surgery, 14 horses had surgical reasons for POR diagnosed at repeat celiotomy or necropsy. Thirty- seven horses were considered to have medical reasons for POR because their POR resolved with medical management or functional ileus was diagnosed at repeat celiotomy/necropsy. A greater volume and a greater duration of POR were not associated with a surgical reason for POR. Rather, a post-operative (PO) fever and the timing of colic in the PO period were associated with a surgical reason for POR. Horses that developed a fever and colic in the PO period after SI surgery were more likely to have a surgical reason for POR. These ndings may provide guidance for clinicians when they are making decisions about repeat celiotomy in horses with POR after SI surgery.Long-term outcome after sti fle arthroscopy In this retrospective study, Annette McCoy and colleagues in the United States reported the outcome of horses engaged in Western performance disciplines after sti fle arthroscopy and identi ed prognostic factors for return to performance. Medical records were reviewed for 82 horses involved in athletic performance/training for various Western performance disciplines and undergoing arthroscopy for lameness localised to the sti fle. Telephone interviews with the owners were conducted 2 years post-operatively. Preoperative and intraoperative ndings as well as post-operative treatment were analysed for their association with return to athletic performance as the primary outcome of interest. The most common disciplines represented were cutting (n=38), Western pleasure (n =13) and reining (n =13). Approximately 40% (32/82) of horses returned to intended use after surgery. Increased age, higher degree of lameness, longer duration of lameness and the presence of partial thickness cartilage lesions decreased the odds of returning to athletic performance. Post-operative therapies (intra-articular: stem cells, oral joint supplements) did not affect the odds of returning to intended use. The prognosis of Western performance horses undergoing stifle arthroscopy is as guarded as that previously reported in horses of other disciplines. S.

VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2019Editorial How to write a clinical case report Summary A case report should communicate a novel occurrence, manifestation or management of a case. The goal is to add to the body of knowledge of an existing or newly recognised condition, whether as documentation of a single clinical episode, or as part of a series of clinically similar events. Introduction The publication of case reports has decreased somewhat in the recent literature. They have received criticism for being anecdotal, or for emphasising bizarre or spurious occurrences. Therefore, they have been considered to have potential to mislead their readership. Instead, it could be argued they should be considered to be at the forefront of recognising the unexpected. Evidence-based medicine reports have somewhat supplanted case reports in the relaying of information: they focus on determining the best evidence to guide clinical decision-making, whether this be a particular therapy or diagnostic test. Ultimately, the randomised clinical trial is considered the best way to determine whether a particular intervention is of clinical bene t. In their defence, case reports remain an excellent complement to evidence-based medicine. Through the development of medicine both veterinary and medicine, case reports have provided a way of relaying clinical experience and disseminating knowledge, and in some cases, have provided pivotal observations changing medical understanding and practice. They are essentially a written 'case rounds ', using history and presentation of actual cases to teach management in a primary role as clinician, using realistic scenarios with medical evidence of disease, and detailed decision-making based upon available clinical information. They are, in practice, a dress rehearsal for the reader when faced with a similar presentation. Case reports allow recognition of unexpected or rare clinical occurrences, or new observations not found in standardised textbooks. They challenge the reader 's conventional focus on recall of rote-learned manifestations and management of diseases. What is a case report? Case reports tend to fall into three categories: an unusual or novel condition that has not been reported in the literature that is, recognition and description of a new disease; a rare complication of a previously known or routinely managed disease condition; or a new management approach to a common and important clinical syndrome. What makes a good case report? Case reports demand a clear focus and explicit documentation as to why they are deserving of publication, and justify the time taken to read and understand them. The most important single message the author wishes to conveyshould be clearly spelled out. If the case report supports current thinking, this should be stated. If the case report runs counter to current dogma, it should detail how it challenges established thinking. Where a new recommendation arises from the case relating to diagnosis or treatment, this can be highlighted using aspects of the case progression as supporting evidence. If a rarity that could have otherwise been missed is the subject of the report, how this presentation could have been missed and how to avoid missing it in the future should be explained. Should I attempt to write and publish a case report? The process of collating case information, searching the relevant medical literature, and writing in an organised scienti c manner is a time-consuming endeavour. The process will greatly aid the author in developing deeper medical understanding. The skills developed during this process are then useful during research of other topics of interest or provide a skill set enabling further clinical reporting. Contribution to the body of knowledge may also provide the author both personal and professional bene ts. Getting started Search the veterinary literature Of utmost importance is determining whether a similar case observation has previously been reported. The author should search PubMed, Medline, Ovid, Agricola, CAB abstracts and Google Scholar for related case material. Existing case reports and case series may provide supporting information for the case in question, or may negate the necessity of reporting the current episode if suf ciently similar case documentation has already occurred. The author must remember to survey journals in the equine veterinary space that may not be listed in the above databases. Collect all relevant documentation related to the case While case documentation and clinical information is current and accessible, this material should be stored in a permanent fashion so as complete information is available later. This will minimise interruption during the write-up phase of the case report. The lack of critical information may prevent complete reporting of case progression or reduce the quality of the report for the reader. Choose a target journal for the nal report While this may seem to be a decision to be made once the report is near completion, it is important to make this decision early in the case report process. Journals vary greatly in requirements for structure and content of the case report, have different formats for references that make up the bibliography, and differ in how references are indicated within the text of the manuscript. The use of a reference managing program integrated into a word processing \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd620 doi: 10.1111/eve.13026program is extremely allowing not only an orderly insertion and modi cation of reference citation into the text, but easy changing of formatting should this be required. The requirements for publication of each potential target journal must be carefully read as there may be fees for publication once the manuscript is accepted. What are the steps to writing a good case report? It is important to be succinct and only relate those points which are germane to the reporting of the clinical progression of the case. Case reports should not be expansive, and report only the facts of the case with an appropriate supportive literature review accompanying its procedural aspects. Journals may set a word limit that is important to adhere to as this will promote concise reporting and reduce the time taken to complete the editorial process. The structure of case reports and case series will differ from that of clinical research reports. The format of introduction, materials and methods, results and discussion widely used for scienti c reporting is not readily applicable to relaying of clinical case material. A suitable case report format would include the following broad categories: 1 Preamble A summary paragraph, designated summary, should open the case report. This is in essence an abstract of the article to follow. As detailed later in this section, this is best written after the completion of the case report proper. This is then followed by an opening section, designated introduction. A brief summary of the relevant literature and initial justi cation for production of the case report can be made in this section. As closure to the introduction, the author can summarise in one sentence the essence of the case report, where the importance and perhaps the unique nature of the case should be clearly stated to the reader. 2 Body of the case report The following sections do not necessarily require their own heading or separation unless this improves reader understanding. Instead, they should be systematically included in the body of the text of the report and flow logically in order from start to nish. If a case series is being produced, for each patient the following information should be provided and separated into individual 'case presentations '. Signalment and history A brief description of the signalment of the cases should open the case report. Immediately following this, a chronological report of relevant case history should be provided. Next, the history of the presenting condition should be detailed. If the case was examined over multiple visits with previous treatment episodes before the beginning of the reported occurrence, these can be separated as 'presentation episodes 'within the history. Examination ndings Physical examination ndings should be presented in a systematic fashion compatible with the initial work-up of the case. Vital signs, auscultation ndings, palpation ndings and visual assessment (mentation, body condition, cutaneous or other grossly visible organ system lesions) can be detailed in this section.Diagnostic work-up and ndings Following the initial assessment, more advanced tests to narrow the differential diagnosis will be performed. Findings of clinical pathology, microbiology, ultrasonography, radio- graphy, advanced imaging (computed tomography, c serological, patho- logical, immunological and endocrinological testing can be reported in this section. With this information, a working diagnosis or de nitive diagnoses as a basis for the ensuing treatment plan can be stated. Treatment plan A complete listing of all treatments (both generic and proprietary name where applicable), dose rates administered (in units of the International System, SI), route of administration and treatment intervals should be given. The author should ensure all medications are referenced in the footnotes as per journal instructions. Outcome Progression of the case should be relayed in chronological format. At treatment termination, degree of clinical resolution and any follow-up, or the results of any necropsy evaluation, should be detailed as the nal part of the body of the case report. Images It is important to only include images of high quality and high relevance. Captioning should be succinct and directly relate to the passage of text within the case report where the image will elaborate on details to improve understanding. Highlighted areas and regions of interest within the images should be clearly indicated and match the associated captioning. 3 Discussion This is in some way the most impactful section of the case report. Rationale for reporting the case can be explained. The case is compared with similar or supporting articles in the literature, with both case reports and primary research articles being referenced. This allows the pathophysiology, outcome and relevance of the case to the general population to be put into context for the reader. This section is also a primer for further reading and a resource for future authors during their literature search in any case presentation related to the report which may also reference it. If limitations exist in the case report they can be stated and placed in context within the case progression and existing literature. The closing paragraph should brie fly detail any conclusions arising from the case report which add to the reader 's knowledge base. 4 Acknowledgements It is important to acknowledge individuals with an impactful role on the progression of the case or those essential in preparation of the manuscript, if not listed as authors (see author criteria mentioned below). This includes individuals who have provided technical or writing assistance. Any funding sources must also be included in this section. 5 References Wherever possible, original literature should be cited to support statements made in the introduction and discussion. Excessive referencing is to be avoided, with only the most relevant \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd621 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2019supporting literature being quoted. It is vitally important for the author to ensure the integrity of the references quoted within their manuscript. Continuing errors can occur throughout the scienti c literature when references are sourced in the bibliography of other publications without checking the accuracy of these citations. 6 Summary/abstract It is easiest and most appropriate to write the summary/ abstract that will precede the case report last, once all details of the case are logically relayed and the discussion of relevant literature is written. This enables the author to make a succinct overview of the case and its relevance in a few sentences to both attract and inform potential readers. The abstract should condense the case report while maintaining the important information. As this may be the only part of the report that potential readers access from an electronic database during a literature search, it should seek to inform and stimulate interest in accessing the entire case report. Information pertaining to search engine optimisation can be found at Wiley Author Services https://authorservices.wiley.com/ author-resources/index.html 7 Abbreviations and keywords The rst use of an abbreviation should be spelled out in the case report. Subsequent entries should consistently use the abbreviation. Depending on the target publication, a table of all abbreviations used may be required in the early part of the manuscript. A list of keywords may be requested for submission alongside the case report. These will be used as search criteria for any resulting publication. 8 Title and title page The title of the case report is the initial contact with the reader. It should be concise, inform the reader of the content, and maintain relevance to the subject. The title page should be placed at the front of the report. It contains names, quali cations and contact information (institution, postal address, email address) for all authors. The corresponding author should be clearly identi ed. The author list should only include those individuals who have contributed signi cantly to the production of the case report. An author is quali ed by his/her contribution to the conception and design of the case report, gathering and interpretation of case information, and drafting and/or revision of the resulting manuscript. Their approval should be sought prior to submission of the nal draft. 9 Declarations page All authors must declare their contributions to the production of the manuscript. Ensure that complete author information (name, quali cations, af liations, contact information) is included in this section if required. Any con flicts of interest should be noted here. 10 Covering letter This should be written once the case report is complete. Accompanying the submission of the case report manuscript, this letter should be addressed to the chief editor and clearly detail why the case report is worthy of publication. Whether due to the introduction of new or novel information on existing or unreported case occurrences, or untoward caseoutcomes or medication-related events during case management, it is important to capture the attention of the chief editor at this initial point of contact. Submitting for publication Once the case report is completed in a style matching the requirements of the target journal, a checklist of requirements for the target journal should be compared with the case report submission package. Only when requirements are complete should the submission process begin. The review process Once submitted, the target journal will seek to assess the manuscript. This is most often by a peer review process, where individuals deemed knowledgeable in an area relevant to the disease or techniques within the case report will assess the case report for content, grammar, adherence to journal requirements and ultimately suitability for publication. There may be several iterations of this process, with revisions recommended and requested of the author before each review cycle begins anew. Considerable time may elapse during this process prior to nal acceptance. Should the manuscript be rejected for publication in the target journal, close attention should be paid to the reasons for this, as these may indicate the case is not suitable for publication. Alternatively, knowledge gained during this process may enable further revision of the case report and submission to another journal in the desired eld. Under no circumstances should the manuscript be simultaneously submitted to more than one journal. Common errors in submitted manuscripts While considerable effort is expended by the authors in the creation of a manuscript, attention to the requirement of the target journal is sometimes lacking. This may substantially delay the peer review process and reduce the timeliness of acceptance for publication should the subject matter ultimately be deemed worthy of print. Commonly occurring errors fall into the following categories Language and grammar The publication language of Equine Veterinary Education is English, particularly British English. The journal requires spelling that is correct for this language. This includes the use of digraphs ae and oe, also -our, -ce, of - or, -se, -ze and -er respectively) in contrast to American English where these are not standard spellings. As Equine Veterinary Education is an international journal, many manuscripts are submitted by authors where English is not their native language, rather, English is a second language, or a common language between peoples who share no other common language communication. This often greatly increases the work of the primary reviewers and editors to assess manuscripts. The consultation by authors of a native English speaker during compilation of the manuscript is encouraged. Advice and assistance with English language writing can be obtained from Wiley Editing Services http:// wileyeditingservices.com/en/ \u00a92018 / AE / DECEMBER 2019Formatting The requirements of the journal must be strictly observed but are often an oversight. Page size, margins, type font, font size, indenting and line spacing must be correct. If requested, line numbering must be included to aid the review process. Word or character count must be observed. Structure Case presentation should generally adhere to a layout compatible with that detailed previously in this article. There should be an introduction; a broadly inclusive body of the case report detailing clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatments and outcomes; a concise discussion reviewing and relating literature relevant to the case; and a list of relevant references. Regardless of author writing style, it is important to have a logical flow of information and conclusions, and to have case details and supporting references consistently in the correct location. Referencing Within text citations and the format of the bibliography varies between journals. The correct format as detailed in the journal requirements must be consistently used during manuscript preparation. Should resubmission to a journal other than the initial target be required, ensure that reference format is changed to meet the new requirements. References should be accurate and complete, however, depending on the source either online or from print, information can be missing: incorrect author name(s), incorrect journal name, absent year of publication, or missing page numbers (start, nish). Anecdotal information should always be stated to be such in the text (e.g. personal communication) and sparingly used. Footnotes All proprietary equipment and consumables should be referenced in the text and listed as footnotes at the end of the case report prior to the reference section. Omissions and incomplete information for manufacturers is a common deciency. Units of measure The International System of Units, abbreviated SI, should be used for all reported numerical values of the patient. These are derived from, and are an extension of, the metric system.Clinical pathological values that are in US conventional units must also be converted to SI. Supporting material Images should be of high quality and of suf cient quantity to illustrate key points of the case. Image parameters (e.g. pixel count/density, dimensions) will be detailed in the author instructions to ensure adequate quality post publication. Excessive numbers of images are discouraged. Captions should be succinct and areas of interest clearly indicated. Included images should match their description in the body of the text, be numerically complete, and be in the correct order. Summary Publication of case reports and case series provides a means of disseminating clinical information of novel presentations, deviations from expected presentations and outcomes, and adverse reactions to established treatment modalities and therapeutics. While they may be criticised as the lowest form of clinical evidence, they are often referenced as foundation reports on newly recognised conditions and therapies. Production of a good case report requires considerable effort and time. Language and grammar must be correct for the journal and its audience. Comprehensive case information must be concisely relayed and put in context with the existing literature which is reviewed as part of the discussion. Journal requirements for format and structure must be adhered to exactly. P. R. MORRESEY Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital, Lexington, Kentucky, USA References Florek, A.G. and Dellavalle, R.P.

Cases inwhich perisuspensory abscesses were diagnosed were included, and different data were retrieved from the medical records. Racing data were obtained from two databases, and horses were considered able toreturn totheir intended useifthey had entered arace atleast once after their hospitalisation. Eight horses met the inclusion criteria. Seven were thoroughbred (six racehorses and one yearling) and one standardbred racehorse. Inallcases, the cellulitis had been ongoing forseveral days prior toreferral. All horses were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs, and some were also administered corticosteroids. Horses were referred because ofa lack ofresponse totherapy, with marked worsening oflameness and/or limb toreferral. Asingle hindlimb was affected inallcases (velefthind and three right hind). All horses presented with moderate tomarked pitting oedema around themetatarsus, extending from immediately distal tothe hock tothe fetlock, that was warm and painful onpalpation. Careful visual examination revealed that, inaddition to generalised swelling three within 3-5days ofhospitalisation, once the generalised swelling had partially subsided. This corresponded upon ultrasonographic examination toeither ahypoechoic or heteroechoic fluidpocket between thesuspensory around one orboth branches ofthe suspensory ligament. Allhorses were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anti-in flammatories, topical therapies and regional limb perfusions; however, only partial improvement ofclinical signs was observed with medical therapy alone. Full resolution of clinical signs was obtained inallcases once the abscess was surgically lanced and drained. The procedure was performed standing under sedation and local anaesthesia inseven horses and under brief general anaesthesia inone horse, due tothe uncooperative nature ofthat thearea and performing routine skinpreparation, a1-2cmvertical skinincision was made under ultrasonographic guidance. The subcutaneous tissues were bluntly separated with haemostatic forceps until the abscess cavity was penetrated (approximatively 0.5-1.5cm deep). Purulent material was removed, and thepocket lavaged with diluted povidone -iodine. The affected limb was kept bandaged and the abscess cavity was flushed with diluted povidone -iodine solution once daily forthe remainder ofthe hospitalisation. material was obtained inalleight cases and submitted formicrobial culture and sensitivity testing. Inallcases, Staphylococcus aureus was cultured. Sixout ofeight isolates showed atleast some level ofantimicrobial resistance, with penicillin and trimethoprim sulfonamides being most commonly involved. None oftheisolates showed resistance togentamicin orenro floxacin. The antibiotic therapy foreach case was adjusted according tothesensitivity pattern, once the results were available. Short-term complications included skin necrosis intwo cases and mild impaction colic intwo cases and were successfully treated. Allhorses were discharged from the hospital within 4-13days and were sound upon discharge. All thoroughbreds (n=7)were able toreturn totheir intended use, and the standardbred was unraced prior tothe cellulitis event and remained unraced afterwards. Key points Abscess formation should be included inthe differential diagnosis while dealing with acase of cellulitis that isnot responsive tothe usual medical therapy within afew days, especially inaracehorse. Allabscesses were diagnosed by ultrasonographic examination and were located between the cannon bone and suspensory ligament, and extended around one or both suspensory branches. Full resolution of clinical signs was only achieved once surgically lanced and drained. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured inallcases and was commonly resistant topenicillin and trimethoprim 10.1111/eve.12996Spring/Summer 2020 www.vetpd.com email o ce@vetpd.com \u00ae TMVetPD Global Industry Partners VetPD North American Industry PartnerExclusive 5% discount for EVE readers!

E. N. Adam Department of Veterinary Science, Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center, Lexington, Kentucky, USA Corresponding 'entity encountered in equine practice. It is therefore, quite surprising that we grapple with a paucity of data on the prevalence of this disease, which can range from mild to life- threatening. There are a few clinical reports that exist in the literature giving us insight into those cases that present to clinics and teaching hospitals (Markel et al. 1986; Adam and Southwood 2006, 2007; Fjordbakk et al. 2008; Putnam et al. 2014). Looking for common threads across these reports can provide valuable clinical information, provided we guard against over-interpretation and wandering from the path of evidence-based medicine. However, with that said and given the dearth of data, we must derive what insight we can from the published data. In this edition of EVE, Vyetrogon and Dubois (2019) present a case series from which we can learn much. These authors describe a group of eight horses that developed hindlimb cellulitis and abscess formation at the bifurcation of the suspensory ligament. All cases were treated aggressively medically but ultimately needed surgical drainage and went on to do well post-operatively. While this might seem like a very speci c presentation, when considered against the backdrop of previous reports, this report has much to offer and remind us of. This cohort of horses composed of Thoroughbreds (n =7) and a Standardbred (n =1), all presented with one limb affected, and all cases were hindlimbs. In much of the previously reported equine limb cellulitis literature these same features are also found: Thoroughbreds are over-represented, one limb was affected, and hindlimbs more commonly involved than forelimbs. Intuitively, we might hypothesise that highly strung bloodstock may be more apt to cause themselves damage by kicking and be more challenging to bath and dry their limbs appropriately but we have little data to test that hypothesis. In the human literature, a landmark study found that risk factors identi ed with limb cellulitis included the presence of interdigital Staphylococcus aureus /C19ottir et al. 2005). Prospectively, developing cellulitis if the patient had a previous episode carried an odds ratio of 31.04. In another human study, again looking at risk factors, the authors concluded that 'increased emphasis on weight loss, smoking cessation, and improved foot hygiene in the homeless might decrease recurrences of lower extremity cellulitis '(Lewis et al. 2006). Thankfully, in our equine populations, we do not have quite the same considerations but the caution on skin hygiene is noteworthy, as is the high risk of developing subsequent episodes of the syndrome. In the veterinary literature, there is a report relating bathing practices to Staphylococcal skin scald-like syndrome ingreyhounds (Love and Davis 1980). In that paper, skin maceration and chapping from imperfect bathing and drying practices were highlighted, as well as the use of communal equipment. The case series presented here obtained cultures from each horse, all of which yielded Staphylococcus aureus . This has been a consistent nding in the cellulitis literature of both horses and humans, although polymicrobial infections are also noted. Whatever the inciting organism(s) is (are) what is notable is that all of the horses described in this report had already been treated with systemic antimicrobial drugs prior to presentation and sample collection. The authors ' comments on the patterns of antimicrobial resistance make for thoughtful reading. Previous treatment with antimicrobial agents raises an important fundamental issue. That being that the choice of an appropriate antimicrobial drug, although clearly important, is dependent on the basic premise that to be effective the drug must be delivered to the infection site successfully. Vyetrogon and Dubois 's group of cases were aggressively treated with antimicrobial drugs delivered both systemically and via regional limb perfusion. Regional limb perfusion is considered a gold standard for the delivery of high levels of antimicrobial agent to tissues in the distal limb. However, in spite of these techniques, the infection continued and abscessation developed. This serves to remind us that local tissue damage caused by the elaboration of bacterial exotoxins and in flammation, can confound treatment even with an appropriate antimicrobial drug choice. Coagulase positive Staphylococcus spp, namely S. aureus, S. intermedius and S. hyicus , are all adept at synthesising a range of devastating exotoxins (Spaulding et al. 2013). One such group of toxins, the exfoliatins, causes severe exudative dermatitis giving rise to the disease 's colloquial name when affecting swine: Greasy Pig Disease. In humans, they can cause horri cS c a l d e dS k i n Syndrome. In addition to exfoliatins, leucocidins and superantigens are produced. Leucocidins are pore-forming toxins, cytotoxic to leucocytes and greatly contribute to the invasive nature of infection. Superantigens are the stuff of nightmares and have been studied as agents of biological warfare. They are produced by Staphylococcus spp. and Group A Streptococcus spp. among others. Superantigens cause widespread pro-in flammatory cytokine release, often leading to toxic shock syndrome and necrotising lesions. Indeed, in terms of the care of cellulitis cases, in the light of cryotherapy research in laminitis studies (Godman et al. 2016; Dern et al. 2018), cryotherapy becomes a logical choice for the possibility of reducing in flammation and \u00a92018 EVJ doi: 10.1111/eve.13014enzymatic activity, which may reduce bacterial protein synthesis. The elaboration of highly pathogenic exotoxins from both Staphylococcal and Streptococcal organisms is well entrenched in our collective veterinary psyche. However, the sole reliance on antimicrobial drugs to combat such infections may also be well entrenched. In horses, beyond antimicrobial-related colitis, we rarely consider antimicrobial therapy as having a negative effect. However, in the canine literature, an investigation into isolates of Streptococcus canis causing cellulitis and necrotising fasciitis was performed some years ago (Ingrey et al. 2003). This study revealed that enro floxacin, even at low concentrations, was able to induce superantigen expression from the encoding bacteriophage in virulent strains of S. canis . Enro floxacin, even with EU usage restrictions, may be a product that warrants further study in this regard. The overarching and most refreshing features of this case study are the repeated ultrasound examination of these horses and the deployment of surgical drainage, instead of changing antimicrobial drugs when the case was not progressing satisfactorily. The diligent re-examination of these horses with ultrasound imaging is an imperative component of the management of cellulitis and nowhere more evident is that than in this paper. It is not easy to patiently ultrasound the exquisitely painful hindlimb of a potentially fractious horse. Without evaluating a control group, it is dif cult to speculate as to the outcome of these horses had they received only medical treatment. However, the timely surgical intervention in these cases resulted in resolution of the infection and a return to intended use. Surgical drainage of lesions on horses with cellulitis is not altogether new. Fjordbakk et al. (2008) mentioned it in a previous publication where it was performed in 14 of the 63 cases reported. In an older report, clinicians interviewed informally were reluctant to pierce the skin of a cellulitis limb for a culture sample, let alone perform surgical drainage (Adam and Southwood 2007). As such, it is refreshing in these more recent reports that surgical intervention was employed and in this series was successful. From the study published in 2007 (Adam and Southwood 2007) and subsequent observations by the primary author clinically, a critical factor in the management of cellulitis cases is to get the horse weight bearing and comfortable as quickly as possible. This and older reports bear witness that contra-lateral limb laminitis is a signi cant factor in survival. With the improved awareness of pain control measures, the employment of transdermal opioid patches, and use of continuous intravenous infusions and, with hindlimb pain, the use of epidural catheters getting the horse comfortable is a realistic goal. Given the many factors that relate to a disease that is all too common but for which there is a de cit of data, this report empowers us. It implores the reader to diligently re- evaluate the horse with ultrasound and to critically monitor comfort level and the progress of medical therapy. It empowers us, with ever-greater access to better quality imaging tools, to carefully employ image-guided surgicaltechniques to bring about a swifter resolution to a problem that might otherwise readily defeat us.

Case Report Surgical resection of a squamous cell carcinoma in the perianal region of a 25-year-old crossbred American Paint gelding using sharp surgical excision, laser excision and chemotherapy L. Poore*, Y. Smit, N. Duncanand J. Williams The Department of Companion Animal Clinical Studies, andSection of Pathology, Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, Onderstepoort, A 25 year-old American Paint gelding was referred to the Onderstepoort Academic Veterinary Hospital with an ulcerated lesion of nonpigmented skin at the right lateral aspect of the perianal region. An in ltrating squamous cell carcinoma was suspected. Surgical excision and ablation with sharp surgical excision and a diode laser was performed although complete excision was not possible due to the tumour location. Intralesional chemotherapy was performed at the completion of the surgical excision and continued in the post-operative period. Histological examination of the excised lesion con rmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and revealed incomplete resection margins at the medial, dorsal and ventral aspects of the surgical site. The surgical site healed uneventfully and a re-examination at 6 months post-surgery revealed the gelding to have normal clinical parameters with no perianal lesions. Introduction Tumours of the equine skin represent up to 65% of skin lesions in the horse (Schaffer et al. 2013) and account for 50% of all equine neoplastic lesions in general (Baker and Leyland 1975). Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are malignant neoplasms of epithelial origin and are one of the most commonly diagnosed skin tumours in the horse (Valentine 2006; Schaffer et al. 2013; Knowles et al. 2016). Squamous cell carcinomas occur in various areas of the equine body and are especially common at mucocutaneous junctions (Sundberg et al. 1977; Newkirk et al. 2014). Reported locations in the horse have included the eye, skin, external genitalia, urogenital tract, oesophagus, stomach and nasal cavity (Sundberg et al. 1977; Valentine 2006; Van Den Top et al. 2010; Newkirk et al. 2014). Squamous cell carcinoma in the perianal region of horses has been rarely reported (Wilson 1994; Arnold et al. 2018). In humans, certain papillomaviruses have been identi ed as the causative agents of SCCs of genital and other 2 has recently been associated with most genital squamous cell carcinomas in horses (Sykora and Brandt 2017). A single anal SCC was tested and found to be EcPV2 positive (Bogaert et al. 2012), however, the association of EcPV2 in perianal SCCs is as yet unreported. Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma in horses usually depends on thesize and locality of the lesion (Arnold et al. 2018). At easily accessible locations, a sole surgical therapy may allow the entire tumour to be removed (Dietz 2006). If the anatomical site is dif cult to access, surgery infrequently provides satisfactory results (Hewes and Sullins 2006; Arnold et al. 2018). Chemotherapy has been described as a suitable treatment for neoplasms of the skin and external genitalia in horses (Fortier and Mac Harg 1994; Paterson 1997; Hewes and Sullins 2006). Successful outcomes have been reported with small lesions or in addition to surgical reduction (Hewes and Sullins 2006; Arnold et al. 2018). There are few previous reports of perianal squamous cell carcinoma in the horse, with no previous reports of combination therapy using sharp surgical excision, laser excision and intralesional chemotherapy. This paper reports the successful treatment of a perianal squamous cell carcinoma in a horse with surgical and laser excision and intralesional chemotherapy under standing sedation. Case details A 25-year-old American Paint gelding weighing 375 kg was presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Teaching Hospital (OVAH), University of Pretoria, for evaluation of an ulcerated mass of non-pigmented skin of the right perianal region. The owner had reported that the mass had increased in size gradually over 12 months ( Figs 1 and 2) with ulceration shown in the last 4 weeks of this period, prompting referral. The pony had shown no dyschezia, weight loss or change in demeanour during the previous 12-month period. General physical examination at presentation revealed normal clinical parameters and mentation with no evidence of right hindlimb regional lymphadenopathy or obvious lymph node metastasis. Palpation of the perianal region revealed a nonpainful, irregular, ulcerated cutaneous mass of 4 cm in diameter in the hairless, nonpigmented skin of the right mid- perianal region. The adjacent skin lateral to the lesion was thickened and the subcutaneous tissue exposed below the ulcer had a granular appearance. A squamous cell carcinoma was suspected and surgical excision was discussed with the owner. In view of the proximity of the medial aspect of the lesion to the right anal wall, a combination of sharp surgical excision, laser excision and \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd627 venous abnormalities. The gelding was admitted tothehospital feed withheld 6hprior tosurgery, butwith water allowed adlibitum. Prior and the placed into the to suite were locked and laser warning signs placed ondoors leading tothesurgical suite. Personnel inthesurgery room wore dedicated laser safety glasses. The lateral, ventral and dorsal borders ofthelesion were resected using sharp surgical incision with borders of2cm achieved. The medial border was resected using adiode laser (980 nm Diode Laser System, Diodevet8)due tothe proximity totheanal wall. Laser incision was performed with thelaser inacontinuous mode and 30Wofpower. Aninitial skin incision was completed and traction was placed onthe lesion with towel clamps. After removal ofthe mass, subcutaneous tissue and skin margins, theentire surgical site was ablated intwo directions with the diode laser at90 degrees toeach other (Fig3).Ablation was considered complete when the tissue was dark yellow tobrown and appeared ventral and dorsal borders ofthe incision site. These injections were conducted according tooccupational safety and health administration guidelines. Protective eyewear was worn by allpersonnel inthe surgery room and additional gloves were worn by the clinician administering the agent through apoorly attached syringe and needle. Sterile swabs were held over each injection site to absorb any excess cisplatin. After administration, allsyringes, capped needles, remaining drug, swabs and protective clothing were immediately placed inachemotherapeutic disposal bag. The excised mass was submitted forhistopathological analysis and margin evaluation. Post-operative treatment with twice was removed (Fig3). Further intralesional chemotherapy treatment (1mgof5- toprovide uniform distribution of5-fluorouracil atthetumour siteand fora1cm zone incircumference around the entire surgical site. Five- fluorouracil was administered at50mg/cm3with proper handling and disposal according tooccupational safety and health administration guidelines. Two pairs of gloves, protective eyewear and agown was worn bythe clinician toavoid overlapping needle tracts and tominimise leakage from the injection sites. Sterile swabs were placed over the injection sites to absorb any excess external 5-fluorouracil. After administration, allsyringes, capped needles, swabs, protective clothing and remaining 5-fluoruracil were sitewas assessed 4-6). Atre-examination 26weeks post-surgery the pony was clinically lesions ofthe anus and perianal region (Fig6).The owner reported that the horse had nothad difculty defecating, had appeared normal in thepost-operative period and had notshown weight loss. Histopathological examination Histological examination was performed on routinely prepared, labelled sections ofsurgical edges and thecentre ofthe excised mass, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, using light microscopy. Central and some margin sections revealed invading cords of neoplastic epithelial cells with large nuclei and nely granular chromatin. Abnormal keratinisation and keratin pearl formation were present within theinvading cords (Fig7).There was anassociated perivascular reaction consisting mainly oflymphocytes and plasma cells with a scattering ofeosinophils. Overlying necrosis and ulcerationwere evident insome sections and had elicited an inflammatory reaction zone ofdegenerated leucocytes (neutrophils and macrophages) atthenecrotic edge where there were scattered bacterial colonies. Adjacent skin showed carcinoma insitufeaturing epidermal hyperplasia, ventral and dorsal margins. Discussion Squamous cell malignant neoplasms of most common tumour type found inthehorse (Scott and Miller 2003) and the most common malignant skin tumour ofhorses (Sykora and genitalia with only rare reports as primary tumours inother locations (Perrier etal.2010). The location ofSCC in thiscase intheperianal region isextremely unusual etal.2018). Thedifculty intreating squamous cell carcinomas oftheperianal region with proximity to the anus and dif culties in performing complete excision emphasised (Arnold etal.2018). Alternative treatment with immunotherapy and permanent colostomy have been advocated instead of as19years (Valentine 2006). The aetiology ofsquamous cell carcinoma has been shown tobemulti-factorial with genetics ofskinpigmentation, ultraviolet light exposure, trauma, chronic irritation, smegma, Equus caballus papilloma virus 2(EcPV-2) Reid Sykora several possible aetiological factors inthe current case, with ultraviolet light exposure ofthe unpigmented skin atthe site being the main suspected causative factor although the age and the American Paint breed ofthe gelding may also have been contributing factors (Valentine inanother (Bogaert etal.2012). The time before referral bythe owner, 12months, was that inthe majority ofcase reports (Scheck 2005; Tornago etal.2017). Interestingly, however, the two other reports ofperianal squamous cell carcinoma had been identi ed for 12months and 3years, respectively, before referral (Wilson 1994; Arnold etal.2018). The time Fig7:Inltrating SCC with EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2019delay in the current case was due to lack of ownerrecognition of the lesion as being possibly neoplastic,despite the age of the pony. The under-recognition byowners of neoplastic disease in older horses, has beenpreviously identi ed and reported (Ireland et al. 2012). Despite the delay between tumour occurrence andrecognition, there was no evidence of metastasis and SCCshave been reported to show slowly progressive development(Howarth et al. 1991; Head et al. 2002). The histopathological diagnosis in this case was consistent with the clinical presentation and surgical ndings. However, whilst the lack of a clean resection margin at the medialaspect of the surgical site was anticipated, the lack ofresection margins at the ventral and dorsal aspects of theincision site did not correlate with the surgical ndings. Various treatments of cutaneous SCC have been described, with surgical excision, cryotherapy with 2002; Arnold et al. 2018; Spugnini al. 2017). In future, preventative immunisation against PV-related SCCs may become feasiblein horses, as is practiced in humans (Sykora and Brandt 2017). Surgical excision of squamous cell carcinoma has been recommended at easily accessible sites (Johnson 1998; Dietz2006). However, in cutaneous locations that are dif cult to access, surgical excision alone often does not providesatisfactory results (Hewes and Sullins 2006; Arnold et al. 2018). Tumour recurrence after incomplete tumour removal is acommon complication (Th /C19eon et al. 1994). Treatment failure has also been shown to alter the biological behaviour ofsome tumours resulting in more aggressive growth and anincreased potential for local extension or metastasis followingrecurrence (Gunduz et al. 1979; Th /C19eon et al. 1994). In view of the location of the tumour in this case, surgical excision alonewas not felt to be justi ed. Laser excision has been widely reported in the treatment of cutaneous neoplasia in horses (Carstanjen et al. 1997; Martens 2001; McCauley et al. 2002; Mair and Fews 2016). Advantages of this therapeutic modality includereduced damage to the surrounding tissue as laser light isassociated with minimal transmission of heat, and thereforelittle latent thermal necrosis (Palmer 1989, 1990, 1996; Leffelland Thompson 1992; Carstanjen et al. 1997; McCauley et al. 2002). Additionally, coagulation of small blood vessels,lymphatic vessels and nerves by the laser results in reducedintra-operative haemorrhage, post-operative oedema andpain (Palmer 1989, 1990, Thompson 1992;McCauley et al. 2002). These speci c advantages were clearly evident in this case. A further advantage of laser excision is the reduced spread of malignant cells to surrounding tissue whencompared with conventional surgery (Carstanjen et al. 1997; McCauley et al. 2002). It was felt that this property of laser excision was particularly important for excision of the medialborder of the tumour in this case as obtaining a tumour-freeresection margin was not possible. Chemotherapeutic treatment has been described as a suitable method to treat neoplasms in horses (Th /C19eon et al. 1993, 1994; Fortier and Mac Harg 1994; Paterson 1997).Intralesional administration of various chemotherapeuticagents has been reported as an adjunct or alternative toexcision of cutaneous neoplasia in horses (Th /C19eon et al. 1993, 1994) and was used in this case in conjunction with laserapplication on the medial margin where a tumour-freeresection margin was not possible. Electrochemotherapy hasbeen reported to have been used successfully in a squamouscell carcinoma of an equine foot that was dif cult to access and has been recommended when incomplete excision oftumours in horses is not possible (Spugnini et al. 2017). Electrochemotherapy was considered in this case but wasnot utilised due to lack of availability of a clinicalelectroporator. The bene ts of intralesional administration of chemother- apeutic include minimising adverse systemic effectswhile providing exposure of tumour cells to high concentrationsof the agent (Hewes and Sullins 2006). Intralesional administration of cisplatin and 5- flurouracil has been commonly used for treatment of cutaneoustumours in horses and found to be effective against a varietyof solid tumours (Loehrer and Einhorn 1984; Th /C19eon et al. 1993, 1994, 1997, 1999; Stewart et al. 2006). Reported protocols include multiple treatments, for instance, four treatmentsadministered at 2 week intervals (Th /C19eon et al. 1993), which was adopted in this case. Difculties associated with intralesional injection of cisplatin include leakage of the cisplatin solution followinginjection, unpredictability in the stability and consistency ofthe solution and risk of accidental injection of the veterinarianperforming the injection (Hewes and Sullins 2006). None ofthese dif culties were encountered in this case. The concerns regarding stability of the cisplatin solution were raised byauthors using cisplatin in an oil emulsion whilst we usedundiluted cisplatin (P&U Cisplatin 9). The risks of self-injection were judged to be low in this case as the pony had anexcellent temperament and was restrained both physicallyand chemically during each administration. The rst injection was performed under epidural anaesthesia and subsequentinjections were performed using standing sedation. Epiduralanaesthesia widely Climent et al. 2009). The placement and use of an epidural catheter in this case was an important componentof both the anaesthetic and analgesic components in theintra- and post-operative periods, respectively. Complications associated with intralesional cisplatin have included tissue oedema, erythema and crusting (Th /C19eon et al. 2007). None of these complications occurred in this case. To avoid the potential complications with intralesional injection of cisplatin, various slow release delivery systemshave been implanted at tumour sites (Ike et al. 1992; Suzuki et al. 1995; Ehrhart et al. 1999; Lana et al. 2004; Marr al. 2004; Withrow et al. 2004). Biodegradable cisplatin-containing beads have been shown to be an effective treatment with orwithout tumour debulking for cutaneous neoplasms in horses(Hewes and Such a slow release system couldhave been utilised in this case if the temperament of thehorse had been challenging or dif culties in administration had been encountered. The decision to use 5- flurouracil in the post-operative period was made as it is inexpensive, has relatively few adverse effectsand can provide bene cial macroscopic cytoreduction (Pucket and Gilmour 2014). It is an alternative to otherintralesional chemotherapy drugs and does not requirespecialised preparation or equipment to deliver (Pucket and \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd631 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE DECEMBER 2019Gilmour 2014). The use of intralesional 5- flurouracil has been described for treatment of dermatological neoplasia in human patients (Kraus et al. 1998; Longley et al. 2003; Good et al. 2010; Kirby and Miller 2010). Other potential therapeutic treatment options for this case were radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiotherapy as a treatment for equine tumours, (Frauenfelder 1983; Byam-Cook Montgomery 2014; Hollis 2019) but is infrequently used due to the necessity for special equipment and concerns regarding management of patients receiving radiotherapy (Van Den Top et al. 2010; Hollis 2019). This technique was not available for the current case and would have been cost-prohibitive. Immunotherapy has successfully treated cutaneous neoplasms in horses (Lavach al. 1985; Vanselow et al. 1988) with autologous dendritic cells reportedly used for perianal SCC (Arnold et al. 2018). Immunotherapeutic techniques would be of bene t to cases similar to the current horse with advantages of safe administration and reduced side effects compared with chemotherapeutic agents (Arnold et al. 2018). Clinical relevance To our knowledge, there are no previous reports of a combined treatment approach to perianal squamous cell carcinoma in the horse. Squamous cell carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of perianal lesions in horses. A combined treatment approach with surgical excision using conventional surgical technique and laser excision with intralesional chemotherapy enabled a full resolution of the squamous cell carcinoma in this case report and is recommended in the treatment of perianal carcinomas in horses where complete excision is dif cult or not possible.

Up your game for 2020. Clinical Commentary Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): \"What 's the C. Knottenbelt*and J. Croft Weipers Equine Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow; andEquine Medical tumour of squamous epithelial cells and therefore, in theory at least, can affect any tissue with a squamous epithelium; these are of course found in the skin but also line the upper respiratory tract, the lower urinary tract and parts of the alimentary tract including the mouth, oesophagus and squamous portion of the stomach. Much has been written about this relatively common tumour type in horses with many single reports, as in the case described in this edition by Poore et al. (2019), and a modest number of case series. The variety of organs involved and the challenges of diagnosis and management as well as the unpredictability of de nitive prognosis continue to perplex and concern practitioners and specialists alike. A broad summary of the detailed nature of this tumour is well- described and fully referenced from a pathological and clinical perspective by Knottenbelt et al. (2015). Overall results from several tumour surveys both in post- mortem studies and in referrals to pathology services as well as those to specialist centres con rm that squamous cell carcinoma remains one of the most common equine cancers. It is estimated to comprise 7 -31% of total neoplasms. Horses of any age can be affected by SCC, with reports in animals as young as one year. However, it is most often reported in mature horses. The transformation of normal cells to an overt carcinoma is usually a gradual process involving a series of cellular mutations that allow the tumour to pass through a series of developmental stages; these can be easily misinterpreted until late in the progression of the condition. Common carcinogens that have been identi ed in horses include sunlight and other radiations, chemical exposure and viruses. It is well known that nonpigmented skin is far more likely to be affected by carcinoma and oftentimes the protection afforded from pigmented skin is very clear in horses ( Fig 1 ). This is not always the case, however, and pigmented skin can be affected ( Fig 2 ). The paper in this edition of Equine Veterinary Education (Poore et al. 2019) describes an unusual carcinoma location in an older horse. Although perianal carcinoma is very rare there are still some features that make the clinical diagnosis easier. The fact that the skin described in this case was nonpigmented and the area ulcerated and destructive is typical ( Fig 3 ) although cannot be said to be pathognomonic; pigmented skin can be affected and some carcinomas are proliferative ( Fig 4 ). Notwithstanding the relationship between SCC and sunlight (UV) exposure of nonpigmented skin and/or squamous cell mucous membranes (such as the conjunctiva), SCC does occur on pigmented skin and in areas where the sun \"doesn 't shine \"!In these areas where sunlight exposure is unlikely toplay a part in its pathogenesis ( Figs 2 and 4), alternative carcinogens have to be considered. In the case described by Poore et al. in this edition (2019), a carcinoma developed in nonpigmented skin around the anus -it is impossible again to believe that sunshine played a part in its development. Other potential factors suggested to be involved include chronic irritation or infection, cutaneous burns, poor wound healing and parasitic diseases (e.g. habronemiasis, onchocerciasis). In ocular sites, chronic and congenital or acquired eyelid deformities are all possible risk factors (Rebhun 1998). Seven horses diagnosed with ocular SCC had a documented previous eye injury (Runnells and Benbrook 1942). Cases of SCC of a deeply invasive nature with a high propensity for local destruction and potential malignancy have been identi ed at burn wound sites (Schumacher et al. 1986) ( Fig 5 ) and burn sites are probably heavily predisposed to carcinoma development. The reasons for this are not clear but local immune processes and genetic instability of the affected cells may be involved. Exposure of burn sites to strong sunlight can also be contributory ( Fig 5a,b ). Squamous cell carcinoma has also been identi ed in wound sites with some regularity. If this wound healing complication is overlooked it can lead to disastrous consequences ( Fig 6 ). A carcinoma is reported to have occurred in exuberant granulation tissue at the site of a previous injection site abscess over the gluteal region, approximately 2 years following the initial incident (Baird and Frelier 1990). An aggressive SCC was also reported to develop in a chronic wound at the site of a neck laceration that had been treated topically with various chemicals; it is thought that the latter may be important in carcinoma pathogenesis (Fessler et al. 1993). Since the number of cases reported in the literature is very small, it is almost impossible to identify speci c carcinogens. It is important to remember that any wound that fails to heal should be investigated and there is therefore always clinical justi cation in submitting excised \"granulation tissue \"from even the earliest stages of wound management. Early detection gives realistic changes of treatment but any tumour developing at the site of a wound is extremely dif cult to manage. Possibly the commonest site for carcinoma development in horses is the penile skin and to a slightly lesser degree the external and internal laminae of the prepuce. Here, again pigment plays a prominent but not exclusive role in susceptibility to SCC ( Fig 4 ). It has been suggested that viral infection with Equus caballus papilloma virus-2 (EcPV2) or bovine papilloma virus might be in some way responsible since both can often be found associated with SCC in this site. For SCC of the male genitalia smegma is also ofthe cancer. Acomprehensive on pathogenesis and treatment ofpenile SCC byVan den Top etal.(2010) con rms that the condition usually starts out with asquamous dysplasia and epidermal hypertrophy. This gradually loses differentiation loses its proliferative nature (squamous papilloma) infavour ofamore destructive carcinoma. This latter stage results insigni cant welfare compromise and brings surgical and medical challenges. The pathogenesis ofcarcinoma follows analmost classic course inallspecies and the horse isnoexception. The diagram shown here illustrates the development of carcinoma from anearly dysplastic information ofmildly abnormal cells toahighly malignant and metastatic form. Fortunately, metastasis isnot common inthe horse. Itis, however, an important aspect ofthe management of Fig3:Anulcerated and destructive carcinoma occurring ona skin. bybiopsy with invasive butproliferative carcinoma. Note the seeded carcinoma sites intheadjacent skin (arrow) and thelack ofpigment. (Picture that sunlight played any role intheaetiopathogenesis ofthis aggressive and rapidly progressive tumour complex. Itis also hard toimagine what carcinogen might beinvolved here although theshape and extent ofthelesion might suggest some chronic irritation arising from rectal fluids. \u00a92018 EVJLtd636 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2019carcinoma inallsites. The lack ofastrong tendency to metastatic transformation has given rise toaconsiderable tolerance ofthecondition and that isprobably something of amistake since there isnodoubt that ifthetumour isleftlong enough, malignancy atleast, metastatically. The pathogenesis orprogression/ ofacarcinoma requires several The \"carcinogen \"causes aminor genetic mutation resulting inhyperplasia. Under normal conditions such achange would bearrested bycell cycle restriction points allowing thecell tocomplete repair, control mechanisms. Here lies one ofthe weakest points inthe process of carcinoma development. The p53 gene isseemingly susceptible toUVlight-induced mutation and indeed many other carcinogens, with consequent loss offunction or aberrant function. Many studies have indicated that thesemutations are critical inthe development ofalarge proportion both alack ofcontrol onthecell cycle and aninherent genetic instability. The cell becomes increasingly liable togenetic insult and further mutation with relatively less insult. Sequential mutations lead the tumour clone towards malignancy. From a clinical perspective the mutational changes can be correlated with the genetic changes ( Fig7). The manifest asasquamous papilloma orasquamous cell dysplasia (Fig7).These stages are easily overlooked or misdiagnosed. The sequential mutations within the transformed cell gradually shifts the cell behaviour from adysplastic, proliferative intraepithelial (insitucarcinoma) state toastate where the tumour basement membrane of theepithelium and thethreat oflocal invasion, angiogenesis and potential metastatic tumours develops. Fortunately, almost all SCC cases encountered in the skin of horses are of a lessaggressive type atleast intheearly stages. There islittle tendency to metastasis even after aggressive local forms have been allowed todevelop. The one exception tothisrule is carcinoma oftheconjunctiva inthemedial canthus whether associated with the nictitans ornot. Recurrence atthissite following removal ofeven relatively small, benign and innocuous looking tumours is extremely often some vascular orlymphatic (orboth) invasion isreported from histology even when a margin is considered to be safe. There is potential formetastatic spread tolocal way toclassify thisdisease inauniform and accepted manner and sothe literature remains confused and confusing. Itis actually fortunate therefore that themore common forms of squamous cell carcinoma occurring inthe skin and inthe conjunctiva inparticular are only rarely metastatic. Itis important, however, always toexamine the possibility of extension into alocal lymph-node dyskeratotic cells and keratin pearls, with obvious intercellular bridges Grade IISCC -moderately differentiated with frequent dyskeratosis butonly poorly dened intercellular bridges Grade IIISCC -poorly cells some atypical mitotic gures and ahigh mitotic rate These grades have been clinically and pathologically associated with the depth ofinvasion inpenile, cutaneous and conjunctival carcinoma (P/C19erez etal.1999).

Grading does give some indication ofprognosis forpenile/preputial SCC at least; higher grades are associated with reduced prognosis and increased riskofmetastatic spread through lymphatic and haematological routes (Van den Top etal. 2010). Inthe most malignant form micro-metastasis probably occurs very early and isnot always associated with anapparently clinically aggressive primary tumour. a) b)c) d) Fig6:This horse sustained arelatively minor wound over thefetlock region some months previously.

Carcinoma developing in the alimentary orthe respiratory tracts can also become extremely aggressive but most cutaneous forms are fortunately far less liable to metastatic spread. Involvement ofthe rst lymphoid \"lter\"ishowever relatively common. out that local lympadenopathy can also beofaninflammatory origin; usually, but not always, the node isthen more painful than inneoplastic lymphadenopathy. The gross appearance ofSCC masses varies signi cantly between horses and different anatomical sites; some authors classify them as productive/proliferative orerosive/de- structive. The neoplasms are usually pale and cant amounts ofsupporting brous tissue. Early well- differentiated tumours often produce keratin and these are identi able both clinically and histologically. The keratinimparts avery characteristic grey orcream appearance to ofthe vulvar (Fig11).Many internal carcinoma lesions (such asthe pharyngeal, gastric and upper airway carcinoma) take ona very aggressive local invasive and destructive behaviour; this may be associated with avascular necrosis (the tumour 'outgrows 'itsown blood supply) but also local tissue destructive mediators produced byboth tumour and its induced inflammatory responses. Carcinoma tends tooccur inolder horses but there are equally important predisposing and triggering factors than age alone. Geldings are reported tobe vetimes more likely than stallions, and two times more likely than mares todevelop SCC. carcinoma israre inentire more liable toSCC ofthe penis and preputial skin than entire horses. Nevertheless, penile carcinoma tends tobemuch more dangerous when itoccurs inthe younger adult horse. Mares may be affected byvulvar carcinoma and this can be extremely aggressive inboth progression and malignancy (Fig11). Early diagnosis and intervention results inacure in many cases especially with the increasingly effective chemotherapy systems now available. Although the clinical diagnosis ofcarcinoma isusually relatively easy inmost cases ofmoderate oradvanced carcinoma early lesions often require further con rmatory tests. Early diagnosis isa fundamental requirement for an improved prognosis - usually the longer the tumour has been present, the poorer the prognosis and the greater the therapeutic challenge. Biopsy provides the most denitive diagnosis; pathologists can invariably make adiagnosis even invery early cases and the addition ofimmunohistochemistry creates a signi cant certainty ofdiagnosis. Cytological diagnosis from impression smears, neneedle aspirations orfluid samples the peritoneal and pleural cavities may beuseful but sufcient numbers ofexfoliated cells may not always be present (Brazil 2008). For conjunctival and corneal carcinoma lesions inparticular, staining with Rose Bengal is auseful way toidentify and location ofthe tumours to theconjunctiva (Fig13). The histological appearance provides excellent information regarding the degree ofdifferentiation ofthe cells and this isofsigni cant clinical bene tboth from a prognostic and therapeutic perspective. The histological report should always contain information about theextent of differentiation ofthe tumour cells and the integrity ofthe basement membrane. The number ofmitotic gures and the degree atypia are key features.

Inthe case described byPoore etal.(2019) anaqueous solution of5- fluorouracil was used at2-week intervals. Although the surgical pathology revealed an unsafe margin, the concurrent use ofachemotherapy program resulted in anapparent complete cure. The major point about this was that the pathology was performed and acted upon ! The value ofcombined treatment methods cannot be overstated (Plummer etal.2007). The challenge inthis case isthe possibility ofmetastatic development that may only become apparent after some years (Mair etal.2015) orlocal recurrence which may also bevery delayed; it good enough formonths oreven years togive adegree ofoptimism but the prognosis should always remain guarded. Surgical tumour reduction isanimportant principle of cancer treatment and (Mair etal.2000; Payne etal.2009). Ineffect, more tumour that can be removed, the less adjunctive measures including topical orlocal intralesional chemotherapy has todoand therefore the less the doses ofchemotherapy required. Ifthe whole tumour isremov- ed with aclear margin there should be no forconcurrent oradjunctive chemotherapy orradiation.

Reported case series using intra- orperi-lesional chemotherapy inslow release emulsions have been uniformly impressive. Additionally, topical aqueous mitomycin Chas been used also togood effect beeffective (Patterson 1997; Malalana etal.2010) provided that cases are suitably chosen but surgical tumour reduction isan effective way ofhastening theresolution and enhancing the overall prognosis. Rayner and van Zyl(2006) described the Malalana etal.(2010) compared the topical mitomycin C chemotherapy with and without concurrent surgery and concluded that thesurgical/chemotherapy option was more likely toresult inacure. Electrochemotherapy using cisplatin has been used to manage avariety ofcutaneous tumours without concurrent surgery and high success rates (Cemazar etal. 2008).

Additionally, it suppresses cellular proliferation andinhibits angiogenesis. It is probably a worthwhile addition tothe management of all SCC cases no matter what othertreatment is employed although it would be helpful toestablish the COX-2 expression rst. It may be a signi cant aid to long-term survival. Other treatments that have been reported include photodynamic therapy, cryosurgery and immunotherapy(Arnold et al. 2018). New methods including immunotherapy using dendritic cells and other mediator driven approachesare being explored and may have some future (Arnold et al. 2018). It is clear that SCC is an eminently treatable tumour in most cutaneous sites provided that the condition isdiagnosed early and pursued relentlessly to elimination.There are many different approaches that can be madeand it is time that extensive multicentre studies werecarried out to compare the various treatment optionsrather than reliance upon small case series or individualcases. The long-term prognosis for all forms of carcinoma depends on both local recurrence and distant metastasis.Local recurrence usually re flects a failure of clinical management or, in surgical cases a failure to explore thepossibility of an unsafe margin of excision. The lack of asafe margin and the extent of both lymphatic andvascular involvement have to be considered in everycase. However, since an exhaustive absolutely certain safemargin can seldom be guaranteed by a pathologist, it iswise to be careful when advising owners of the prognosis.In addition, carcinoma can seed into an operative sitefrom the surface of an exposed ulcerated carcinomaduring surgery; this cannot of course be identi ed by a pathologist examining the surgical specimens. The biggestmistake that can be made during treatment is to ignorethe surgical pathology !The safety of excisional margins is so important that every excised tumour no matter how\"certain \"the excision might seem, should be submitted for examination; this should not be regarded as an 'optional extra '! The case described by Poore et al. had a 6-month local disease free follow-up and it is important toremember that carcinoma at any site including thoseaffecting the conjunctiva and the skin can sometimesrecur after a much longer period (Elce et al. 2011). Additionally, and importantly from a prognostic per-spective, distant spread in the absence of any localevidence of tumour recurrence can be recognised muchlater (Mair et al. 2015). Regular, careful and detailed monitoring of all patients is essential and especiallywhen vascular and lymphatic invasion and an unsafemargin are reported from the surgical pathology. Thepathology, whether from biopsy or from surgical (excisional)pathology is very important and should never beoverlooked and especially not on economic grounds; it iscounterproductive, unwise and unprofessional. The challenges of chemotherapy were also raised by Poore et al. (2019); they noted the need to protect the operators and the handlers of the horse from inadvertentcontact with drugs at the site of the procedure and in theurine and droppings. It is important to remember that everychemotherapy agent will have some pro-mutational effects;exposure of humans to the drugs could be considered anunacceptable hazard. The principle of ALARA (as low asreasonably achievable) for exposure to chemotherapeuticagents is no longer acceptable. There should in fact be noexposure at all if proper protection is afforded. Operator andhandler safety is paramount and anyone using thesechemicals must take special care to ensure humanand environmental safety as well as safe disposal ofall contaminated materials. Special disposal systems forchemotherapeutic and hazardous waste are obligatory. Perianal carcinoma is very rare in horses but it clearly does occur and although no particular carcinogen can besuggested, any proliferative or ulcerated lesions in this regionshould be carefully examined. Since SCC is commoner inolder horse (Valentine 2006), the advanced age of the horsein the case described by Poore et al. (2019) may have played some part in its aetiopathogenesis. The correctchoice of treatment is imperative and the best availablecombination method should always be employed.Concurrent chemotherapy following any surgical tumourreduction is a sensible option ( Fig 16 ). Fortunately, metastatic spread from cutaneous SCC (apart from some preputial andpenile forms) is uncommon although the rst lymph node inTABLE 1: The prevalence, suspected carcinogenesis, type and pathological behaviour of SCC at various cutaneous Prevalence Eyelids/conjunctiva +++ Depigmentation Sunlight (UV)+ ++++ + Cornea (in situ carcinoma) + Sunlight (UV) /C0 + /C0 Lips and facial skin + Sunlight c) Fig15: SCC isvery sensitive toborcradiation.

Recurrences and metastasis can become clinically evident months or even years after apparent local resolution and monitoring is essential.

Electronic brachytherapy isatechnique rate brachytherapy, but itsuse forthe treatment ofperiocular tumours has not been reported, and the requirement for general anaesthesia isasigni cant disadvantage. Introduction Why are arelatively common problem inthe horse and present some unique challenges. The most common tumour types inthis location are sarcoids and squamous cell carcinomas, although other tumours such as melanomas, mast cell tumours and lymphomas are occasionally reported (Gilger Their location frequently makes them difcult orimpossible toremove vialaser surgical excision, and totheglobe and thepotential forthecreams tocause collateral damage. BCG has been widely accepted as agood option for nodular and some broblastic sarcoid lesions, with the largest case series reporting success rates as69% inthese lesions, but itis unsuccessful inthe treatment ofverrucose oroccult lesions (Knottenbelt and Kelly 2000), and iscurrently difcult to access due to manufacturing issues. Intralesional chemotherapy can sometimes besuccessful, buthas health and safety implications and there arefew published data on the success ofthis approach forperiocular tumours. One report found only a33% success rate following cisplatin injection into periocular sarcoids, and stated that accurate injection was extremely difcult (Knottenbelt and Kelly 2000) raising further health and safety concerns should this approach be chosen. Radiotherapy has long been considered the 'gold standard 'fortreatment ofperiocular especially periocular sarcoids, although cost and limited availability ofthetreatment. Low-dose rate brachytherapy has been used for radiotherapy ofperiocular sarcoids for over 40years; however, the availability has become increasingly limited due tothe high cost ofthe sources, practicalities and the health and safety concerns associated with their use. Recently, atechnique ofhigh-dose rate brachytherapy has been described which eliminates any operator exposure and therefore many ofthehealth and safety concerns, although this technique remains expensive and very limited in availability (Hollis and Berlato 2018). Principles ofradiotherapy How does radiotherapy damage Exposure toionising radiation kills cells byproducing secondary charged particles and free radicals inthe nucleus. These cause direct and indirect damage to cellular DNA, preventing successful mitosis. Radiation damages normal and tumour cells, but normal cells are able torepair radiation damage toamuch greater extent, and can therefore usually repair and function Radiation Direct effects Indirect effects Free radical Immune effects? formation DNA damage Repair Apoptosis Other mechanisms ofcelldeath following radiotherapy Damage toDNA isnot the only mechanism bywhich radiotherapy can lead tocell but other structures may also beinvolved intheresponse oftissue toradiation, including proteins and lipids within thecell membrane. In addition, radiation may lead toexposure ofthe immune system toabnormal epitopes and contribute totumour regression (Schaue and McBride 2015). However, aclinically relevant antitumour immune response isnotconsistently seen, even inmouse models of disease, there ismuch tobelearnt about thisaspect ofthe response toradiotherapy (Schaue and Individual responses toradiotherapy may also bedictated by thetumour type, volume and location, with theprobability of local tumour control following radiotherapy being inversely proportional toitsvolume (Theon 1998). Reducing thesizeof alarge tumour may therefore improve efcacy and reduce morbidity where large periocular lesions are present, with fewer functional and cosmetic effects. Inthese cases, radiotherapy aims toeradicate any tumour cells leftbehind after 1998). low-dose (Byam-Cook etal.2006) and high- brachytherapy (Hollis and Berlato 2018). What happens following radiotherapy? Following exposure toionising radiation, cells may undergo apoptosis, autophagy, senescence and/or necrosis. Different tissues have different sensitivity toradiation, which ismainly due todifferences intherate ofcell division. willnolonger toundergo successful mitosis following exposure tomuch lower doses ofradiation than the dose required todestroy awell-differentiated cell. This means that actively dividing tumour cells may bemore likely tobedamaged byradiation than lessactively dividing tumour cells ornormal cells. Inaddition, most normal cells can repair damage toDNA, although the damage from radiotherapy causes side effects which areusually temporary, butmay bepermanent (Burcombe Thetiming of radiation side effects relates tothe speed ofcell turnover, with rapidly dividing cells (such asskin) showing damage quickly, and cells with alow rate ofturnover (such asbone) showing damage long such as corneal cells, are farmore radiosensitive than those with a lowrate ofturnover, such asbone cells. Radiation side effects Early effects ofradiation can beseen within afew weeks of the completion ofacourse ofradiotherapy. These include skin erythema, desquamation ofthe skin depigmentation ofthehair and/or skin Late effects ofradiation may beseen many months oreven years after treatment and can include brosis and cataract formation. Bone necrosis can beseen many years radiotherapy and exposure toradiation. These side appear tousually be mild and self-limiting inequine cases atpublished dose rates using various forms of brachytherapy inthe horse. Interestingly, different human patients willhave different levels oftissue reaction and therefore side effects when exposed to thesame radiation treatment (Bentzen 2006; Burcombe etal. 2013). isthe study ofgenetic toradiation (Andreassen This some ofthe individual differences inthe response toradiotherapy inhorses, although there are very few published data ontheside effects and long-term effects seen after any form ofradiotherapy inthe horse.

The treatments aredelivered viamachines, usually alinear accelerator, although can Fig2:Ahorse epilation and 2019also beused. High-energy x-rays orc-rays are produced by the machines and directed towards the tumour. The longer distance allows delivery ofradiation todeep-seated and large tumours, but similar doses will inevitably also be delivered totissues inthepath oftheradiation beam (Theon 1998). Careful imaging, planning and placement ofthecases isessential toachieve asafe and effective treatment, in horses (Fig3).Modern linear accelerators arebecoming ever more sophisticated, allowing targeting ofthe tumour from several different directions tominimise theexposure ofnormal tissues between themachine and thetumour, side effects. forperiocular lesions because there isnot aneffective way toshield the eye from such high and willtherefore notbediscussed further inthisreview. and asthename implies, refers to radiotherapy where the radioactive source isindirect contact with the tumour. There are two main forms of brachytherapy used inhorses: interstitial brachytherapy,which usually used source is astrontium-90 probe. Strontium-90 has the advantage ofa very long half-life (28.7 years), therefore once aprobe has been purchased; itcontinues tohave asimilar activity fora very long time, cost effective. The bradiation produced bythe strontium-90 weak This bradiation has avery shallow depth of penetration, meaning that very high doses ofradiation can beapplied tothe surface ofthe tumour without risking exposure of normal underlying tissues. The major disadvantage ofthistherapy isthat itistherefore only suitable isusually around 0.8cmindiameter, and theoperator (Fig4).During treatment, the source isapplied directly onto the tumour surface. Depending on the location ofthe lesion, this may be performed under heavy standing sedation orvia general anaesthesia.

The prescribed tumour dose isdened asthe minimum dose in the target volume (which should include a2mm margin) and ranges from 80to100Gy(Theon 1998). The radiation surface dose willtypically beinthe order of200-250Gy, depending onthethickness ofthearea tobetreated. Where the treatment area islarger than the size ofthe probe, a multiple abutting eld con guration isrequired, where the applications are overlapping inthe tumour tissue effective treatment.

The total surface dose should not exceed 500Gy, even ifthisisfractionated (Theon 1998). This treatment isespecially suitable forthe treatment ofocular squamous cell carcinomas, with local control rates following irradiation ofocular and periocular tumours reported as being inthe horse, and can margins following incomplete surgical excision ofasuper cial lesion. Although the technique issimple and the results can be excellent, availability islimited, and only one centre intheUKcurrently has astrontium probe available horse, because ahigh tothe tumour inarelatively short time (Theon 1998). Aswith allradiation sources, when the distance is doubled from thesource, theradiation dose reduces byone- quarter; therefore normal tissues can be spared while delivering aneffective dose ofradiation tothetumour itself. Thisisespecially useful forthetreatment oftumours very close tothe eye, because the cornea and lens are especially sensitive totheeffects ofradiation, soallowing areasonable physical distance between the radioactive source and the orbit (either byplacement ofthe source orvia physical shielding methods) will afford good protection ofthese delicate structures. The most commonly used radioactive source isiridium-192, which emits c-rays and isavailable inthe areleftforaspeci edtime and are removed when theprescribed radiation dose has been achieved, which willdepend onthesize ofthetumour, the activity ofthe source and the implantation technique.

These images areused toenable computer-based treatment planning. Following the planning process, the catheters are connected toaremote afterloader which drives the high- dose rate iridium-192 source from ashielded safe into the catheters fortreatment according tothe prede ned plan (Fig7).The total treatment 2-6min, during which time theoperators monitor thehorse viaCCTV from an adjacent shielded radiation bunker.

Electronic brachytherapy involving brachytherapy etal.2015). / DECEMBER 2019super cial method using a cone applicator or an interstitial technique using applicators. The technique was designed for treating very super cial lesions such as squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in humans, with more invasive and extensive lesions not being considered suitable candidates for this technique (Doggett et al. 2015). Periocular sarcoids are often especially invasive and extensive (Knottenbelt and Kelly 2000), and the use of electronic brachytherapy for these more dif cult lesions has not been investigated. Electronic brachytherapy is currently only theoretically possible for horses under general anaesthesia as there is no tolerance for movement of the horse, and the anaesthetist, although shielded with normal x-ray lead gowns, goggles, and a lead shield, will inevitably be exposed to a low level of x-ray exposure during the treatment. Other personnel can be remote from the source during treatment, avoiding unnecessary exposure. Although these are signi cant disadvantages compared with high-dose rate brachytherapy, the relative portability, affordability and minimal requirements for setting up the system may offer a useful form of brachytherapy for the treatment of periocular tumours if it proves to be successful. Conclusions Radiotherapy has long been considered the 'gold standard ' for the treatment of periocular tumours of the horse, because of excellent long-term success rates despite the dif cult location and nature of many of these lesions. There are several methods of delivering radiotherapy to periocular tumours in the horse. Despite the excellent success rates, the high cost and limited availability of any of the techniques are signi cant disadvantages. High-dose rate brachytherapy eliminates the health and safety and practical disadvantages of low-dose rate techniques, and can be safely and successfully delivered understanding sedation in the horse. Electronic brachytherapy shows promise as an alternative technique, although the requirement for general anaesthesia and the exposure of the anaesthetist to x-rays are signi cant disadvantages.

N. van Spijk, S. Schmittand Schoster* Equine Zurich; andInstitute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University Summary Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are an emerging threat in human and veterinary medicine. There are few reports about infections caused by MDR isolates in horses. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of infections caused by MDR bacteria at the Equine Hospital Zurich between 2012 and 2015. Medical records were searched for horses with conrmed MDR bacterial infection. Multidrug resistance was dened according to human guidelines speci c for each pathogen. MDR isolates were most commonly isolated from post-procedural infections (53/110, 48%), followed by 20%) and Staphylococcus aureus (25/158, 16%) were the most common isolates. High resistance rates precluded therapy with commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The overall mortality rate was 20% (22/108) but depended on the localisation of the infection. Antimicrobial treatment prior to development of infection was reported for 89% (91/102) of horses. This study showed that MDR pathogens, mainly MDR E. coli and MRSA, cause a considerable number of infections in horses. A wide range of infections was seen, however, nosocomial infections predominated. These cases are typically hospitalised, pretreated with antibiotics, and suffering from comorbidities putting them at high-risk for acquiring infections caused by MDR isolates. The mortality of such infections was generally low but depended on site of infection. Introduction Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are an emerging threat in human and veterinary medicine (Weese et al. 2015). Antimicrobial resistance is mainly acquired by horizontal gene transfer, allowing its rapid spread within a susceptible bacterial population. At an individual horse level or short-term population level, such as in a hospital population, clonal spread is also an important means of spread of resistance (Barbosa and Levy 2000). Often, bacteria with resistance to three or more antimicrobial categories are called multidrug- resistant (MDR), however, naturally occurring intrinsic resistances present in an entire bacterial species should be excluded from this de nition. Pathogen speci c guidelines are available for human medicine, however, lacking for veterinary pathogens (Magiorakos et al. 2012). Few studies on infections caused by MDR bacteria have been published in horses and most often they focused on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRS) and extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Escherichia et al. 2009; et al. 2010; Maddox et al. 2010; Dierikx et al. 2012; Walther et al. 2014). Both species have developed resistance towards b-lactam antibiotics, one of the most important antimicrobial classes in veterinary medicine. The majority of these isolates have also acquired resistance to other important antimicrobial categories (Anderson et al. 2009; Walther et al. 2014). Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli are commensals on the equine mucosal membrane and gut, respectively (Devriese et al. 1985; Corrente et al. 2009; Damborg et al. 2012); however, they are also important pathogens causing a wide range of infections (van Spijk et al. 2016a). An increasing prevalence of equine infections caused by methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been reported during the last years (van Duijkeren et al. 2010). Reports of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, mainly E. coli , have also emerged (Dierikx et al. 2012; Walther et al. 2014). Less is known about the role of other MDR isolates such as Acinetobacter 2010; Herdan et al. 2012; Theelen et al. 2014), but a high rate of multidrug resistance was recently shown in these pathogens isolated from infections in horses (van Spijk et al. 2016b). Studies in human subjects have repeatedly demonstrated an increased length of hospitalisation, higher costs and a higher mortality of infections caused by MDR isolates compared with similar conditions caused by susceptible organisms (Lautenbach et al. 2001; Tabah et al. 2012). A delay in appropriate therapy is suggested to be the main reason for this association (Tabah et al. 2012; Weese et al. 2015). Information about the outcome of infections caused by MDR isolates in horses is scant (Anderson et al. 2009; Herdan et al. 2012; Walther et al. 2014). The aim of this study was to report cases with diagnosed infections caused by MDR bacteria in horses at the Equine Hospital of the University of Zurich between 2012 and 2015, in order to provide an overview of their occurrence, clinical presentation and outcome. Materials and methods All horses with a bacteriologically con rmed MDR bacterial infection at the Equine Hospital between 2012 and 2015 were included in the study. Multidrug resistance was de ned as acquired resistance towards at least one agent in three or \u00a92017 EVJ etal.2012; van were also included in the study, although the above-described de nition for multidrug-resistance could not be applied to these isolates. The following information was collected from the databases ofthe Equine Hospital and the Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology ofZurich: age, sex, breed, date ofadmission, number ofsamples, number of isolates, isolated bacteria and their susceptibility testing results, siteofinfection, antimicrobial therapy upto3months prior Implant infections, infections and phlebitis were grouped aspost-procedural infections. Synovial infections, osteitis and hoof abscesses were gathered tomusculoskeletal infections. Soft tissue infections included external abscesses, wounds, cellulitis and infected haematomas. Urinary tract infections contained upper and lower urinary tract infection, and omphalitis. Respiratory tract infections included pathogens isolated from the upper and lower airways. Further diagnoses were sepsis, dental infection, peritonitis, dermatitis and diverse, which included neoplasia infection and otitis. Bacteria isolated from faecal samples were excluded. Isolates considered asnonpathogenic orcontamination were excluded oninformation onbacterial species, clinical ndings. they were only included ifarole ascausative pathogen seemed reasonable based onclinical ndings. When mixed infections occurred inone sample, allisolates were included. When abacterial strain was isolated more than once from thesame siteinahorse within 6months, the isolate was only counted once inthe study (persistent infection). Bacteriological culture, identi cation and susceptibility testing including theinterpretation ofresults tosusceptible Theautomated VITEK/C2262Compact results referred tothe guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2013) and, ifinformation was lacking, guidelines from the European Committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (EUCAST 2016) and theU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA 2016) were used. Intermediate susceptibility was classi edasresistant. Results Between March 2012 and October 2015, 110 infections caused byatotal of158MDR isolates were diagnosed. 2014 and 2015 respectively. Infection with MDR isolates were reported from 1day to 30years (median 10years). Most infections caused by MDR (2-4MDR isolates) were common (32/58, 55%). Two horses had multiple infections caused bydifferent MDR isolates, simultaneously. One foal had omphalitis caused incisional infection after MDR isolates differed between organ systems and thisisdemonstrated in Table 1.Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results ofMDR isolates are shown inTable 2.High resistance rates towards commonly used antimicrobial ESBL The mortality rate ofallhorses with infections caused by MDR isolates was 20% (22/108).

Information about antimicrobial therapy prior toMDR infection was available for102/108 horses; 91/102 (89%) horses were treated with one ormore previous given / DECEMBER 2019Discussion This study showed that MDR pathogens, mainly MDR E. coli and MRSA, cause a considerable number of infections in horses. A wide range of infections was seen, however, the main group of diseased horses was affected by infections following therapeutic procedures. Multidrug-resistant E. coli was the most common isolate in this study, causing a wide spectrum of infections. Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli ,Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. and others, are common pathogens in horses (van Spijk et al. 2016a) and are known for their ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance (Vo et al. 2007). Production of b-lactamase enzymes after acquisition of plasmid-mediated ESBL is the most important resistance mechanism in Enterobacteriaceae leading to extended spectrum b-lactam resistance. The majority of MDR E. coli seen in this study was phenotypically ESBL-producing. ESBL-producing E. coli have previously been found in diverseclinical samples from horses (Vo et al. 2007; Ewers et al. 2010; Dierikx 2014). MDR Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. have so far only been reported in single equine samples and their number was likewise low in this study (Vo et al. 2007; Dierikx et al. 2012). Methicillin resistance in staphylococci is due to a modi cation of the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) (Ubukata et al. 1989). Similar to prior studies, MRSA in the present study were mainly responsible for incisional infections, phlebitis and synovial infections (Maddox et al. 2010). Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci have so far not been recognised as important pathogens in horses due to their inferior pathogenicity compared with S. aureus (Devriese et al. 1985). A considerable number of infections caused by these isolates was seen in our population and case reports of MR-CNS causing osteitis and implant infection also reported these isolates to be relevant pathogens (Trostle et al. 2001; Corrente et al. 2009). Other common MDR isolates seen in our study were A. baumannii ,Enterococcus spp. and P. aeruginosa .I n addition to their high rates of intrinsic resistance, these species are known for their ability to rapidly acquire resistance to further antimicrobials (Jokisalo et al. 2010; Herdan et al. 2012; 2014; van Spijk et al. 2016b). Pan-resistant A. baumannii strains are a serious problem in human medicine and MDR A. baumannii have already been isolated from horses (Jokisalo et al. 2010). Enterococcus spp. has been recognised as an increasingly resistant pathogen in foal sepsis and a report of MDR Enterococcus spp. causing septic arthritis was recently published (Herdan et al. 2012; Theelen et al. 2014). Diverse infections have been caused by MDR bacteria; however, post-procedural infections represented almost half of the presented cases. In contrast, respiratory infections caused by MDR isolates were rarely seen, although respiratory infections are the most commonly diagnosed bacterial infections at our hospital (van Spijk et al. 2016a). Nosocomial infections, de ned as hospital acquired infections not present at admission (WHO 2002), caused by MDR E. coli and MRSA were previously reported in horses (Anderson et al. 2009; Walther et al. 2014). Factors which have been shown to be signi cantly associated with the presence of MDR isolates in human subjects are prior use of antimicrobials, length of hospital stay, stay in the intensive care unit, the presence of co-morbidities, placement of various types of catheters, intubation and mechanical ventilation and a speci c therapeutic interventions such as tracheostomy and hydrotherapy (Lautenbach et al. 2001; Falagas and Kopterides 2006). Many of these factors are typically also present in equine cases with nosocomial-acquired post- procedural infections. The previous use of antimicrobial drugs is the most common and consistent factor in all studies evaluating risk factors for the presence of MDR isolates. At least 89% of the horses included in this study were treated with antimicrobials prior to their diagnosis of MDR infection. The presence of several concurrent MDR isolates was common in our cases. Furthermore, in one case a non-MDR Enterococcus spp. together with a MRSA causing an omphalitis was isolated at clinic entry; later on the same horse developed a surgical site infection with a MDR Enterococcus spp. strain. It is plausible that there was selection for a strain that was present as a coloniser or in the environment due to the selection pressure of antimicrobialTABLE 1: Most common MDR isolates per organ system isolated from infections in horses at the Equine Hospital of the University of Zurich (2012 -2015) Organ systemNumber of MDR isolates MDR bacterian/total per organ system (%) Post-procedural n =81 S. aureus 17 (21%) E. coli 14 (17%) CNS 13 (16%) =11 (45%) E.

Chloramphenicol, a drug that has been avoided in the past because of its adverse effects in human patients, is regaining importance because of its frequent ef cacy against MDR isolates (Gigu /C18ereet al. 2013). In order to reduce the absolute amount of antimicrobials used and their adverse effects, local therapy (i.e. drainage and disinfection) should be considered whenever possible to eliminate the infectious agent and to overcome infections caused by MDR isolates (Weese 2009). The mortality rate of horses in the present study was generally low and comparable with previous results in horses with S. aureus infections (Anderson et al. 2009). The presence of a MDR isolate has been shown to increase the mortality rate of infections in human patients (Tabah et al. 2012). It is debatable whether this is a true association or if the presence of MDR isolates is simply re flecting the presence of co-morbidities. Previous studies in dogs were not able to detect a difference in the mortality of animals with methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible isolates (Faires et al. 2010). The main limitation of the present study is the lack of a control group. Comparison of outcome between horses with and without MDR isolates and identi cation of risk factors for their occurrence was not feasible. Attempts to compare incisional infections (the largest group) with and without MDR isolates failed due to a complete lack of incisional infections with non-MDR bacteria (data not shown). In veterinary medicine, de nition of MDR isolates has not been standardised and comparison between published data is therefore dif cult. We adapted a de nition from human medicine to our eld (Magiorakos et al. 2012). Certainly, this approach was limited and a standardised de nition for MDR isolates should be agreed upon. Conclusion This study showed that MDR pathogens, mainly MDR E. coli and MRSA, cause considerable numbers of infections in horses. Most infections caused by MDR isolates were incisional, implant or catheter-related infections. Patients affected by these infections are typically pretreated with antimicrobials, hospitalised and suffered from other morbidities, putting them at high-risk for acquiring infections caused by MDR isolates. Previous antimicrobial treatment was present in a large number of cases, highlighting the importance of prudent use of antimicrobial drugs. The mortality rate of infections caused by MDR was generally low and depended on the diagnosis of the horse. Studies are required to evaluate the impact of MDR isolates on the outcome of equine infections and to determine risk factors for their occurrence.

These techniques have limited ef cacy in the removal of uroliths that have a diameter larger than the PU site, typically 4 -5 cm. Pneumatic lithotripsy as reported in this article provides a novel way to fragment these larger uroliths while containing the fragments and protecting the urethra and urinary bladder. Ten geldings and one stallion underwent a lithotripsy procedure to remove one (n =10) or several (n =1) uroliths ranging in diameter from 4 to 9 cm. A PU was performed and a laparoscopic retrieval bag was inserted into the urinary bladder through the PU site. The urolith was manipulated into the bag using blind transrectal manipulation or endoscopic guidance and the opening of the bag was exteriorised out of the PU site. A pneumatic lithotrite was used to fragment the stone. When the urolith was adequately fragmented, the fragments were removed by the use of sponge forceps and byflushing the fragments from the bag with obstetrical lube. This was continued until the bag could smoothly be withdrawn from the urinary bladder. All uroliths were successfully removed. The PU sites healed without complication and none of the horses had recurrence of presenting clinical signs. This article also discusses the difference between two types of laparoscopic retrieval bags. Pneumatic impact lithotripsy in combination with a retrieval pouch offers a safe alternative to other methods for removal of cystic calculi in the horse. Introduction The prevalence of urolithiasis in horses is reported to be 0.04 - 0.5% (Duesterdieck-Zellmer 2007). Calculi can be located anywhere along the urinary tract but are most commonly located within the urinary bladder (Laverty et al. 1992). Under normal conditions, horses excrete large amounts of calcium carbonate in their urine (Mair and Osborn 1990). This combined with the alkaline nature of their urine contributes to the formation of two different types of uroliths. Type I uroliths, which make up 90% of equine uroliths, are yellow - green spiculated stones that easily fragment. Type II uroliths, which are less common, are grey -white, smooth stones thatare more resistant to fragmentation (Schott 2004). Clinical signs associated with cystic urolithiasis include dysuria and haematuria. Cystic urolithiasis is more commonly found in male horses presumably due to their longer, less distensible urethra. If found in mares, calculi can typically be removed whole via manual dilation of the urethral sphincter or urethral although fragmentation with electrohydraulic or pulsed-dye laser lithotripsy has also been suggested (Divers 2008). In human subjects, if urinary bladder stones cannot pass naturally, they are typically addressed via transurethral cystolitholapaxy, which involves inserting a cystoscope into the urethra and delivering laser energy or shockwave (Li et al. 2015a). The length of the male horse 's urethra in combination with the relatively small diameter of an endoscope makes this procedure dif cult in horses. Moreover, when using this technique, the fragments are not contained within a surgical bag so would be more likely to irritate the urinary bladder and would potentially act as a nidus for further stone formation. Pneumatic lithotripsy has been reported to fragment renal and ureteral stones in human subjects but extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy is more commonly used in management of human urolithiasis (Radojevic et al. 2009; Li et al. 2015b). The ability to break up kidney stones, and less commonly urinary bladder stones, with this technique avoids the need for invasive surgery in human patients (Telha et al. 2016). However, extracorporeal shockwave instrumentation in human subjects uses a generator that encircles the abdomen, so unfortunately, the size of the horse precludes the use of true extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in the equine cases. Multiple techniques have been described for removal of cystic calculi in the horse. Cystotomy techniques require general anaesthesia (Beard 2004; Watts and Fubini 2013) or deep dissection of pararectal tissues (Abuja et al. 2010). Laparoscopic cystotomies have also been described (Lund et al. 2013) as well as laparoscopic-assisted techniques (Rocken et al. 2006; Stratico et al. 2012; Vitte et al. 2013). Complications associated with these techniques are rare but can include abdominal incisional dehiscence, peritonitis, uroperitoneum and incomplete removal of the urolith. Intact and manually fragmented uroliths have been removed through perineal urethrotomy (PU) as a standing procedure in geldings 10.1111/eve.12843Dechant 2014). urine scalding, haemorrhage, urethral stricture, perforation of pelvic (Laverty et al. 1992; Kilcoyne and use of radial (Foerner and Stanschi 2005; Katzman et al. 2016), ballistic (Koenig et al. 1999) and electrohydraulic shockwave (Koenig et al. 1999; Rocken et al. 2012) have been described in the horse, but all methods of shockwave have notable disadvantages. Ballistic shockwave and radial shockwave in one report (Foerner and Stanschi 2005) involved general anaesthesia, pneumatic radial shockwave in another report involved expensive instrumentation (Katzman et al. 2016) and electrohydraulic shockwave required up to six separate sessions. There are also reports of use of a pulsed-dye laser and holmium:yttrium-aluminium- garnet (holmium:YAG) laser to fragment equine uroliths. Both lasers have the disadvantages of expense, increased surgical time to fragment uroliths and incomplete fragmentation for type II calculi (May et al. 2001; Judy and Galuppo 2002; Grant et al. 2009). Although anecdotal reports of pneumatic lithotripsy in the horse exist, to the authors 'knowledge, there is only one other published report of its use in a group of horses, which uses pneumatic radial shockwave lithotripsy (Katzman et al. 2016). Shockwave lithotripsy uses sound waves to fragment uroliths, whereas the current report goes into greater detail to describe the use of a pneumatic impact lithotrite, which uses direct physical contact of a steel rod to fragment uroliths. This report also details two different types of laparoscopic retrieval bags for removal of cystic calculi through a PU. The goal of this study was to report on the success and bene ts of pneumatic lithotripsy in combination with a laparoscopic retrieval bag for removal of cystic stones in male horses. We hypothesised that pneumatic lithotripsy would require a shorter surgical time and lower equipment costs than other described methods for removal of cystic calculi in the horse. Materials and methods All horses that underwent pneumatic lithotripsy at one of the ve participating referral centres for removal of cystic calculi were included in the study. The participating referral centres were Colorado State University (CSU), Sturgis Veterinary Hospital and Equine Center, Ohio State University (OSU), the University of Georgia (UGA) and South Valley Large Animal Clinic. At least one author was physically present for all procedures. The presence of a cystic calculus was con rmed with transrectal palpation and ultrasonography with or without cystoscopy. Cystoscopy was used if the calculus/calculi could not be well characterised ultrasonographically in terms of size and number. The diameter of the stone was measured ultrasonographically. Feed was withheld from all horses for 8-24 h prior to surgery. This range is due to differences between institutions, with the longer end of the range attempted in order to decrease the amount of faecal material in the rectum during surgery. Preoperatively, all administered flunixin meglumine (PrevailTM1, 1.1 mg/kg gm mg/kg bwt, oral A level plane of sedation was maintained with either a continuous infusion of detomidine hydrochloride (20 mg/L) or butorphanol tartrate (10 mg/L) in sodium chloride (0.09%), at a rate of approximately 1 -2 drops per second (10 drops/mL) or additional i.v. boluses of detomidine hydrochloride and/or butorphanol as needed. anaesthesia was performed at the sacrococcygeal or rst intercoccygeal space. A 20-gauge, 3.8 cm (1.5 inch) needle was used, and xylazine (Anased /C2267, 0.75 mL; 20 mg/mL) were injected into the epidural space. The penis was cleaned with chlorohexidine scrub and saline (0.09% NaCl). A urinary catheter was placed using aseptic technique. The urine was drained from the urinary bladder and the catheter was left in place. The rectum was evacuated of feces and then infused with lidocaine HCl9 (20 mg/mL, 50 mL); if any strong rectal contractions were encountered during rectal palpation the horse was also administered a single dose of bromide region was clipped and prepared for aseptic surgery. A PU was performed level with, and just proximal to, the ischial arch. The urinary catheter was palpated to determine the location of the urethra. A No. 10 blade was used to create a 5 cm vertical incision through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Curved Metzenbaum scissors were used for blunt dissection through the subcutaneous tissues. Once the urethra was isolated, a No. 10 scalpel blade was used to create a 4 cm incision into the urethra. The urinary catheter was then removed from the urethra. A sterile 9.6 mm, 1 m endoscope was used to visualise the bladder in some cases. The laparoscopic retrieval bag (Retrieval bag11or Endo CatchTMII12,Fig 1 ) was inserted into the urinary bladder via the PU and the bag was deployed. The stone was placed into the bag by one of two methods: (1) transrectal manipulation of the stone (blind, Fig 2 ) or (2) under endoscopic guidance (endo, Fig 3 ). The endoscope was removed from the urinary bladder once the urolith was secured within the retrieval bag. With the urolith secured in the laparoscopic retrieval bag, the opening of the bag was exteriorised through the PU ( Fig 4 ). The interior of the bag was then lubricated with obstetrical lube (n =9, Lubrivet13)o r sterile lube (n =2, Surgilube14). The lithotripsy instrumentation consists of a stainless steel rod (pneumatic impact lithotrite) that is 0.5 inches in diameter, a pneumatic scaler, a regulator with associated air lines and a gas source ( Fig 5 ). The rod is 18 inches long. The surgical end is blunt. The opposite end is designed such that itts into a pneumatic scaler15(E in Fig 5 ). Once mounted into the pneumatic scaler the vibrating action causes the urolith to break apart when in contact. The scaler used vibrates at 4000 beats/min with 0.25 inch strokes. This air scaler requires connection to a gas line with 90 psi. The surgical end of the pneumatic impact lithotrite was passed into the exteriorised opening of the laparoscopic retrieval bag and the end of the lithotrite was held rmly in contact with the urolith. The urolith was stabilised against the rod transrectally. The urolith was fragmented by activating the lithotrite in short bursts while continuing to stabilise the \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd660 (Fig6).The fragmentation process gentle traction ontheretrieval quantity tolavage out the small pieces oftheurolith. Sponge forceps were also used to remove larger fragments. Theobstetrical lube13,14was infused into the pouch using a 60 mL catheter tip syringe and a 30 cm section ofastallion catheter. Additional fragmentation was performed if necessary .The retrieval pouch was removed from the urinary bladder when a suf cient quantity of the fragments had been flushed from the retrieval pouch opening to allow its passage through the urethra ( Fig7). Upon removal oftheretrieval bag and urolith fragments (Fig8),acystoscopic urinary bladder was free ofcalculi. Ifany fragments were present within the urinary bladder, itwas lavaged with isotonic fluids. Insome cases, fragments were removed using instrumentation (laparoscopic grasping forceps) and direct visualisation with theendoscope. When allcalculi had been successfully removed, the urinary bladder and urethral mucosa were assessed with bag perineal urethrotomy site and securing the urolith with transrectal manipulation.

The mean age was 15.5 years (range 5-22years). The horses weighedbetween 400and 660kg.Tenhorses had asingle urolith and one horse had multiple uroliths present within the urinary bladder. Urolith diameters ranged from 4cm to9cm. Only the largest urolith was measured inthe horse with multiple uroliths present. Preoperative medications included All horses before thePUwas performed and were continued for 5days post-operatively on a trimethoprim-sulfonamide and phenylbutazone. Allcalculi were successfully removed. The urolith was manipulated into thelaparoscopic retrieval bag transrectally ineight horses and endoscopy was used inthree horses. The Mila retrieval bag was used insixcases and theEndo Catch IIlaparoscopic retrieval bag was used invecases.

A total of11horses were reported inthisstudy. The pneumatic impact lithotrite Therod also readily palpated transrectally allowing for positioning ofthestone against therod. The vibration ofthe rodquickly fragments type Iuroliths and type IIuroliths require slightly more fragmentation. The rod can besterilised. The pneumatic scaler can also besterilised using requires minimal maintenance intheform ofcompressor and airtool lubricant after each use. This piece ofequipment requires some experience togaincomfort with but once used afew times becomes uncomplicated tomanipulate. The laparoscopic retrieval bag plays animportant role in thesuccess ofthistechnique because itcontains theurolith fragments and protects the urethra. Inprevious cases, fragmentation ofthe urolith into the bladder lumen then required amore extensive lavage ofthe bladder following lithotripsy. This leads toincreased bladder and urethral mucosal irritation. Theuseofalaparoscopic retrieval bag has been described previously (Menendez and Fitch 2012; Katzman etal.2016), butinone report lithotrite was notused, leading toprolonged surgical times. The laparoscopic retrieval bag does add alevel of technical difculty.

In those cases, fragments were found within the urinary bladder following extraction of the bag and more extensive lavage of the urinary bladder was required to remove the remaining fragments. It is also important that the bag is fully deployed prior to scooping the urolith. Full deployment allows the stone to pass to the most ventral portion of the bag. The opening of the bag is then exteriorised. One laparoscopic retrieval bag has fenestrations at the attachment to the ring. These fenestrations can tear free prematurely. Other models of the laparoscopic bag do not possess these fenestrations and have greater integrity at the ring. Bag strength is also important. As the urolith breaks apart, the fragments assume a grit-like texture, which can create holes within the bag, especially with type II uroliths which are more dif cult to fragment. In this study, two retrieval bags were used. One is the Endo Catch II, which has perforations at the ring so manipulations of the urolith have to be performed delicately in order to not tear the bag at the perforations. It is recommended that when the Endo Catch II bag is used, the urolith is manipulated into the bag by direct visualisation using an endoscope to help prevent this tearing. The authors recommend a thicker laparoscopic retrieval bag which is now commercially available from Mila and does not have perforations that lead to tearing. The design of the Mila bag also allows for it to be retracted and re-deployed as necessary with no damage to the bag, allowing for greater manoeuvrability of the bag. Rectal perforation due to transrectal manipulation of a urolith has been reported (Laverty et al. 1992). Transrectal palpation and manipulation should always be performed with great care but in the cases included in this study there were no complications with transrectal manipulation of the urolith. Once the urolith has been positioned into the laparoscopic retrieval bag, transrectal manipulation is restricted to the caudal 15 -20 cm (estimated) of the rectum. Claes et al. reported that the median distance from the anus for rectal tears was 25 -30 cm (Claes et al. 2008). This technique required less surgical time and was less expensive than other published techniques. Reported surgical times for removal of cystic calculi are 210 min (ballistic shockwave) (Koenig et al. 1999), 125 min (pneumatic radial shockwave lithotripsy) (Katzman et al. 2016), 7 hours (electrohydraulic lithotripsy) (Reichelt and Lischer 2013), 70 min (pararectal cystotomy) (Abuja et al. 2010) and 59 min (parainguinal laparocystotomy) (Beard 2004). The average surgical time in this study was 68.1 min. The cost to the client for the procedure was $1000 -2400 which varied across the different institutions. Complications associated with PU for the treatment of cystic calculi have been reported (Holt and Pearson 1984; Laverty al. 1992; Kilcoyne and Dechant 2014). Kilcoyne and Dechant (2014) reported a high incidence of complications following PU for treatment of urolithiasis (54.5%, 12/22) but this report overstates the risk of complications. Only four of the nine listed complications were directly related to the PU: severe haemorrhage, urethral stula, urine scald and urethral stricture. Within those cases, the urine scald only occurred in permanent PUs and the strictures only occurred in donkeys (Kilcoyne and Dechant 2014). In thisstudy, no complications associated with the PU were reported. No complications were observed in this study. Care must be taken to avoid known complications associated with transrectal palpation and PU, but the authors consider the risk of these complications to be low. Additionally, the operator must expect to spend some time gaining experience with the lithotrite and retrieval bag before being comfortable employing their use. The most serious complication that the authors can perceive is if the lithotrite becomes displaced from the stone and then either tears the bag, or worse, traumatises the bladder. For this reason, it is important to rely on transrectal palpation to assure proper placement of the lithotrite against the stone as well as frequent removal of the lithotrite to flush fragments from the bag and reorient the urolith(s). In conclusion, the reported technique for removal of cystic calculi in the standing horse results in less trauma to the bladder than techniques involving cystotomy or not involving use of a retrieval bag, the shortest mean surgical time of a standing procedure that fragments and removes uroliths, and is a safe, cost-effective alternative to other techniques.

This paper describes an ultrasonographic procedure that allows imaging oftheventral aspect ofthe sacroiliac joints. Acomplete screening should thearticular margins. Moreover, theshape ofsacral and iliac wings can vary among individuals especially depending onthegender. Introduction Sacroiliac lesions have been considered asacause ofpoor performance etal.1985; Denoix 1992). diagnosis has been tobe assumed byexclusion (Erichsen etal.2002; Local local anaesthetic solution close tothesacroiliac joint hasbeen described (Dyson and Murray 2003; Haussler 2010). Nevertheless, this technique lacks sensitivity due totheventral location ofthelesions (Dalin and Jeffcott 1986a) and speci city due tolarge diffusion in surrounding tissues (Denoix 2014) and presents ariskofsciatic nerve paresis. Therefore, Bergman etal.2013). Conversely, nuclear scintigraphy has been found diagnosis of sacroiliac joint aremainly in transrectal examination has become routinely used todiagnose sacroiliac injuries. Formore than two decades, theknowledge ofthenormal images and their variations as well as pathological changes has progressively improved (Denoix 1999). The purpose of this paper isto describe the ultrasonographic technique forimaging thesacroiliac joints of the horse transrectally and to present normal ultrasonographic appearance inorder speci iliac wing, between the asL-shaped with the convex border directed caudoventrally. Sacroiliac joints (Fig 2).The dorsal sacroiliac ligament isstrong and does not have any direct anatomical relationship with the sacroiliac joint space. Itinserts onthe ligamentous sling to thesacrum and give stability tothesacroiliac joint, allowing only one totwo degrees ofnutation also strongly contribute tostabilise the sacroiliac joints (Denoix 1992). Each sacroiliac joint ofpower from thecorresponding therest (Denoix Barone and truncus lumbosacralis providing the sciatic nerve and the gluteal nerves (Fig 3).

Onthin horses, ahigher (e.g. 10MHz) may improve image resolution. First, thehorse isplaced into stocks and therectum isevacuated with allthenecessary precautions topreserve the rectal mucosa, after approach ofthe horse 's hindquarters and adequate lubrication. Sedation may be required ifthehorse isnotrelaxed enough. Gel isapplied to the transducer before starting the rectal examination. No stand-off pad isrequired. The sacroiliac joint isimaged on parasagittal sections, transducer facing upand being placed inahorizontal axis (Fig 5).Foreach clinical case, examination ofboth sacroiliac joints should beperformed. (Fig 3). the joint space and margins must bescreened carefully from the most medial aspect ofthe and willbedescribed medial, intermediate left joint using the right hand and the right sacroiliac joint using thelefthand (Denoix 2014). Reference ultrasonographic images Knowledge ofthe normal ultrasonographic appearance of the anatomical structures involved inthe sacroiliac joint is essential tocorrectly identify pathological changes. On reference ultrasound scans, thesacral and iliac wing proles are imaged astwo regular and thin hyperechogenic lines, with surfaces asanatomical window toallow improvement ofimage quality (Figs 7,8and 9). Females and geldings have anarrower sacroiliac joint space than males with sharper margins (Figs 7a-c,8and 9).

I applaud them for adding a farrier to improve their previous writing on this topic (Moyer et al. 2012) I would like to add some additional comments since I feel equine practitioners 'and farriers 'relations have markedly improved since the late 1990s and the early 2000s. In the recently published 2018 Farrier Business Practices Report (Zank 2019), 59% of the farrier survey respondents are consulting weekly with veterinarians and only 6% rarely consult with a veterinarian. I also feel that joint veterinary and farrier therapeutic efforts have markedly increased with some good successes in these past two decades. In that same Business Practices report, 94% of farriers responded that they 'practice therapeutic shoeing -to correct lameness '. More than two- thirds (70%) of farriers said they encounter horses with thrush on a weekly or monthly basis. At least half of the respondents indicated that they had dealt with white line disease, laminitis, navicular issues or soft tissue injuries within the last month of the survey. Besides the daily working together of equine practitioners and farriers, there are many joint regular local (Mansmann 2002; Freer 2008), regional and even national CE accredited veterinary and farrier meetings that have joint attendance discussing equine medical and mechanical foot topics. At these meetings, farriers, veterinarians and highly respected veterinarians trained as farriers lecture and oversee wet labs. They are all striving to improve common medical language and moderating medical educational levels that were mentioned in the Moyer editorial. Veterinarians and farriers are reading radiographs together to enable a collaborative approach to the foot care of their client 's horses (Cota 2017; Healey 2018). The veterinary-farrier relationship exists at a high and co- operative level at the stall side of horses with foot problems. It is also critical to note that farriers as healthcare providers see and communicate potentially more frequently with horse owners than do equine veterinarians. The largest detriment to the veterinary-farrier relationship currently is the major veterinary organisations, and maybe veterinary specialty boards and state veterinary medical boards, being perceived as attempting to control equine farriery (Cota 2018a). The AVMA Model Practice Act controversy of 2018 did not need to happen. This was perceived by many farriers as disrespecting their profession and their role in equine health. It puts many equine practitioners in awkward positions trying to explain the situation to their important professional associates. Con flicts between veterinary and farrier associations are not just an American problem (Cota 2018b). If we veterinarians really want to have a decent relationship with farriers and their profession, it is the time to consider the farrier as a true equine healthcare provider. It is a discredit to the AVMA; and maybe the AAEP and other AVMA recognised Specialty boards, that the most read article in theAmerican Farrier 's Journal (AFJ) of 2018 was related to the AVMA 's proposed new Model Veterinary Practice Act. That topic was covered in two other articles in the AFJ and they ranked number 5 and 9 as most read !(Moskov 2019). Besides the veterinary profession needing to consider farriers as a critical part of the equine healthcare team so too do farriers need to consider themselves as an equine healthcare provider. This concept needs to be part of farrier training programs and emphasised in their associations, association meetings and journals. The AAEP, Veterinary Specialty Boards and progressive farrier associations can work together to make this happen. The complexities of equine foot pathophysiology, imaging, medical therapeutics, mechanical shoeing principles and farrier products are only going to get more complex in the future. More than likely most equine healthcare givers have had the important and necessary combined human medical experiences with orthopaedic surgeons, their nurses, case managers, physical therapists and other related healthcare givers and understand the importance of each in their successful personal medical recovery. It is the time that the veterinary and farrier associations work positively and respectfully together to improve each other 's professional status for the bene t of the horse and their owners. Both healthcare professions together and independently are completely necessary for good horse health. R. A.
