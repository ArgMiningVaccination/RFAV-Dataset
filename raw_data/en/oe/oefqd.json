Learn here which purported benefits are supported by science.", "sitename": "SelfDecode Supplements", "date": "2019-11-01", "cleaned_text": "Milk thistle is a popular herb for liver support and detox. Its extract (silymarin) is formulated into supplements that people use for digestive, liver, and gallbladder issues. Read on to learn more about the purported benefits of milk thistle, along with science-based evidence ratings. What is Milk Thistle (Silymarin)? Traditional Uses Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is a relative of [dandelion](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/dandelion/) and regular [ artichoke](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/artichoke-extract-13-health-benefits/). The seed-like fruits of the plant have been used in folk medicine as a \"liver elixir\" for issues to do with liver or gallbladder dysfunction [ [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6150307/), [ 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/), [ 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65780/), [4](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/herbal/silybi-mariani-fructus)]. People also traditionally use the leaves in salads and roast the fruit of the flower as a [ coffee](https://selfhacked.com/blog/coffee-may-cause-inflammation/) substitute [ [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6150307/), [ 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/), [ 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65780/)]. Silymarin is a mix of active components that are highly concentrated in a standardized extract of milk thistle seeds [ [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/)]. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCIH) concluded that little is known about whether milk thistle is effective in people, as only a few well-designed clinical studies have been conducted [ [5](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/milkthistle/ataglance.htm)]. Milk thistle supplements have not been approved by the FDA for medical use. Supplements generally lack solid clinical research. Regulations set manufacturing standards for them but don't guarantee that they're safe or effective. Speak with your doctor before supplementing. This article will take you through the evidence behind milk thistle's purported benefits and uses. Snapshot Proponents - Allegedly improves liver health and detox - Considered to be a good antioxidant and anti-inflammatory - Relatively low risk for short-term side effects Skeptics - Poor bioavailability - Bitter taste - Few high-quality clinical trials - Long-term safety unknown Purported Health Benefits of Milk Thistle Possibly Effective For: 1) Diabetes Some evidence suggests that milk thistle extract might help control blood sugar in people with diabetes when used as an add-on to conventional therapy. Silymarin (420 mg/day) improved symptoms in 2 studies of 80 people with type 2 diabetes. It reduced [fasting](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/intermittent-fasting/) blood sugar, insulin, and insulin resistance over 45 days. The extract used in this study is called Livergol by Goldaru Herbal Products Pharmaceutical Company [ [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29895491), [ 7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25765835)]. In another trial of 51 people with type 2 diabetes, 4 months of silymarin (600 mg/day) added to standard therapy reduced both short- and long-term blood sugar markers (fasting blood [ glucose](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/glucose/) and [HbA1C](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/hba1c-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-important/)) [ [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17072885)]. The combination of milk thistle with [berberine](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/berberine-19-health-benefits-of-berberine-with-references/) (Berberol) has also been researched. In one study of 85 people with type 1 diabetes, this combination reduced the insulin doses needed to keep blood sugar in check and also lowered blood fats [ [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26384091)]. In a trial of 60 people with diabetes and alcoholic liver damage, Silymarin (600 mg/day) improved [ insulin](https://selfhacked.com/blog/insulin-101/) resistance and oxidative stress while reducing the need for insulin injections over 1 year [ [10](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9126802?dopt=Abstract)]. Metabolic Syndrome It's less certain which disease markers milk thistle affects in people with metabolic syndrome. Some evidence suggests the extract improves blood sugar control in people with both diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In 136 obese people with type 2 diabetes, a combination of berberine and silymarin improved some disease markers after 6 months. It reduced fasting blood glucose and insulin, improved insulin resistance, raised [HDL](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/hdl-cholesterol/), reduced total, LDL [cholesterol](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/cholesterol/), and [triglycerides](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/triglycerides/). It also reduced BMI, waist circumference, and belly fat [ [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28685558)]. In 51 people with type 2 diabetes, silymarin (600 mg/day) reduced blood sugar but also lowered total cholesterol, [LDL](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/ldl-cholesterol/), triglycerides, and liver enzymes (AST and ALT) [ [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17072885)]. In another study of 40 people with type 2 diabetes, Silymarin (420 mg/day) improved insulin resistance, blood triglycerides, and increased the beneficial HDL cholesterol over 45 days. Plus, it reduced the inflammatory marker CRP and increased antioxidants [ [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29895491), [ 7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25765835)]. In 137 people who didn't tolerate high statin drugs, silymarin with (~200/1200 mg/day silymarin/berberine) improved blood sugar, insulin, and didn't worsen blood fats when the drugs were stopped [ [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577665)]. Scientists are investigating how milk thistle might act in cells. It seems to block Pancreatic [Lipase](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/lipase-test/), an enzyme that breaks down fats in the gut and helps absorb them. By blocking this enzyme, milk thistle may theoretically reduce the amount of fat absorbed from the diet. However, this mechanism remains unconfirmed in humans [ [13](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636882)]. 2) Indigestion (Dyspepsia) The European monograph mentions heartburn and indigestion as one of the uses of milk thistle [ [14](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-monograph/draft-european-union-herbal-monograph-silybum-marianum-l-gaertn-fructus_en.pdf)]. The popular heartburn product Iberogast contains milk thistle along with 8 other herbs. Iberogast improved indigestion, stomach [ pain](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/23-ways-to-combat-pain-naturally-by-increasing-your-opioids/), and heartburn in 3 studies. It has been around for 40 years and has a good safety profile [ [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605819/), [ 16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4928719/)]. Milk thistle is a mild bitter. [Bitter herbs](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/herbal-bitters/) are hypothesized to reduce indigestion by increasing the secretion of stomach acids and [digestive enzymes](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/digestive-enzymes/), as well as by activating the [vagus nerve](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/32-ways-to-stimulate-your-vagus-nerve-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-it/). However, it's unknown if milk thistle alone reduces indigestion since clinical studies are lacking [ [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446506/)]. Insufficient Evidence For: The following purported benefits are only supported by limited, low-quality clinical studies. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of milk thistle for any of the below listed uses. Remember to speak with a doctor before taking milk thistle supplements. Milk thistle should never be used as a replacement for approved medical therapies. 3) Liver Health An Overview Milk thistle has been researched for its liver-protective effects with mixed results. Few proper trials have been conducted. Two rigorously-designed studies found no benefit [ [5](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/milkthistle/ataglance.htm)]. A large recent analysis of 17 clinical trials concluded that the effects of silymarin on lowering the liver enzymes [ALT](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/alanine-aminotransferase/) and [AST](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/aspartate-aminotransferase-ast/) (common markers of liver damage) are clinically insignificant [ [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5526770/)]. Some scientists are studying whether milk thistle can boost levels of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione, affect inflammation and liver scarring, detox drug and toxins, or help the liver tissue regenerate. However, solid clinical data are lacking to support any of these effects [ [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4781972/), [ 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/)]. Fatty Liver Disease Some evidence suggests that milk thistle extract (silymarin) may improve markers of liver function people with non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). But it's unclear how relevant these marker changes are to disease outcomes in people with NAFLD. A combination of Milk thistle's active compound, Silybin, phosphatidylcholine, and vitamin E over 1 year improved non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a clinical trial of 179 people, some of which were also positive for hepatitis C. It reduced liver enzymes, [ insulin](https://selfhacked.com/blog/insulin-101/) [ resistance](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/top-tips-for-fixing-insulin-resistance/), and liver scarring [ [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22343419), [ 21](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4781972/)]. However, the active ingredients can reach higher blood levels in people with fatty liver disease only than in those who also have Hepatitis C. After being absorbed, silybin is secreted into the gut with bile. People with Hepatitis C can't absorb silybin again and \"recycle\" it, which seems to lower its blood concentration [ [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21865319)]. Some researchers suggested that people with Hepatitis C may need higher doses (2.1 g/day of silybin) to compensate for the liver damage that affects bioavailability. Proper clinical data are lacking to support this practice, though [ [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086763/)]. Hepatitis Data on the effects of milk thistle extracts in people with hepatitis C or hepatitis B are conflicting. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of milk thistle in people with hepatitis C or hepatitis B. An analysis of over 1k people concluded that there is a lack of high-quality data about the effects of milk thistle in patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases [ [24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17943794)]. For example, milk thistle reduced the chance of death in people with these liver diseases only in low-quality trials, but not in high-quality trials. The authors stressed that large-scale randomized clinical trials on milk thistle are needed [ [24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17943794)]. In an observational study of over 1,000 people with hepatitis C, those with the more severe forms of the disease who used silymarin were less likely to experience cirrhosis, but the effect was not clinically significant [ [25](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21083592?dopt=Abstract)]. In one clinical trial of 36 people with hepatitis C who didn't respond just to drugs (Peg interferon + ribavirin), IV silybin alone or as an add-on to the anti-Hep C drugs was well-tolerated. The authors claimed that it had an antiviral effect, but the study sample size is too small to draw any conclusions [ [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18771667)]. In another trial of 154 people with Hepatitis C who previously didn't respond to standard therapy (interferons), oral silymarin (2.1g/day) did not lower liver enzymes or virus activity after 6 months. The silybin content of the extract was unknown in this study [ [27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22797645), [ 28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22058086)]. In a low-quality clinical trial of 105 people with acute hepatitis, silymarin (420 mg/day) reduced symptoms, and improved jaundice and bile flow over 4 weeks [ [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19303273)] In a trial of 37 people with Hepatitis C, silybin combined with phosphatidylcholine reduced high ferritin levels in ~80% of the cases over 12 weeks. How this impacts disease outcomes remains unclear [ [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921818/), [ 31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18458640)]. According to an analysis of almost 400 people with hepatitis C, oral silymarin is not different from placebo. Nonetheless, some scientists are interested in investigating the effects of silybin, the active ingredient, given through a high-dose IV in people with Hepatitis C [ [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247194)]. Until more research findings become available, the use of milk thistle extracts for hepatitis remains unproven. Alcoholic Liver Disease The effectiveness of milk thistle for alcohol-related liver disease is unclear and research findings have been mixed. In a low-quality observational study of over 600 people, a water-soluble Silymarin extract (420 mg/day) over 11 months lowered high liver enzymes and [ bilirubin](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/bilirubin-benefit-how-to-optimize/) in those with alcoholic liver disease [ [33](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076375)]. Silymarin (450 mg/day) didn't affect liver function in a clinical trial of 60 people with alcoholic liver disease after 6 months. It only increased [glutathione](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/glutathione-20-scientifically-proven-health-benefits-glutathione/) and reduced [ oxidative stress](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/oxidative-stress-101/) in [ red blood cells](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/increase-decrease-red-blood-cells/). It's unclear how these markers could be clinically related to disease outcomes [ [34](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11841050?dopt=Abstract)]. Mushroom Poisoning Most mushroom poisonings worldwide are from a species called \"death cap.\" Milk thistle is the number 1 antidote for death cap poisoning, given as IV silybin (oral silybin doesn't work). It saved lives in over 90% of 1,500 cases in the US, which is judged to be better than any other antidote. Scientists say it should be given within 48h to prevent severe liver damage and increase survival [ [35](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22352731), [ 36](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6862461?dopt=Abstract)]. Liver Toxicity from Drugs and Toxins Some scientists believe milk thistle may protect the liver from drugs and toxins, but proper clinical trials are lacking [ [37](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17213517)]. In animals, silymarin and silybin had a liver-protective effect against damage from alcohol, toxins (carbon tetrachloride and thallium), a chemotherapy drug (cisplatin), Tylenol (acetaminophen), radiation, [ iron](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/iron-balance-blood-test-iron-deficiency-anemia-overload/) overload, and the poisonous mushroom death cap (Amanita phalloides) [ [2+](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/), [ 38](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ptr.3207/abstract)]. In a clinical trial of 50 children with leukemia, milk thistle use was linked with potentially reduced liver toxicity after 1 month. The authors said that further trials need to determine how milk thistle affects liver health and chemotherapy side effects in people with leukemia [ [39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20014183)]. Milk thistle doesn't protect the liver from drugs in general. For example, it didn't protect the liver from anti-tuberculosis drugs in a study of 380 people. On the contrary, it even slightly increased the risk of liver damage [ [40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243373)]. Quality of Life After Liver Transplantation In a survey of 32 people who received liver transplants, those who used milk thistle and other herbal products had better problem-solving skills, considered the supplement investment worthwhile, and reported better overall health [ [41](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17007157)]. This does not speak to the benefits of milk thistle but more likely shows that people who tend to actively seek ways to improve their health and well-being feel better. Liver Detox The liver breaks down and helps eliminate all harmful substances, both from waste products produced in the body and those that enter via food and environment. Milk thistle is traditionally used to \"protect the liver\" and facilitate detox in the general population, but no proper clinical trials have been carried out. Some alternative practitioners claim that occasional detoxes may be helpful even in people not exposed to any specific toxins. No solid evidence backs them up, however. In one study of 25 healthy people, a 7-day detox improved wellbeing and liver health. This study was too small and poorly designed to support detox protocols in the general population [ [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10895516), [ 43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499388/)]. All in all, the effectiveness and safety of milk thistle in healthy people who want to detox remains unconfirmed. The remaining studies are limited to cells and animals. Some researchers are investigating whether milk thistle reduces oxidative damage and inflammation in cells. Others wonder if it helps regenerate liver cells, glutathione, and [SOD](https://selfhacked.com/blog/the-brain-fog-gene-rs4880-or-sod2/). According to unproven theories, this plant is said to help detoxify the liver from pollutants, environmental toxins, and drugs [ [44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959115/), [ 45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4116427/), [ 46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526841/)]. Other cellular studies are exploring potentially heart-protective effects of milk thistle against [ heavy metals](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/heavy-metals-detox/) like arsenic, environmental pollutants, fluoride, and oxidative stress [ [47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5080420/), [ 48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600218/)]. Remember that many plants have antioxidant effects in cells. Most of them fail to pass further animal studies or clinical trials due to a lack of bioavailability, safety, or efficacy. Silybin protected against an algae liver toxin (microcystin) in mice and against a fungal toxin (aflatoxin) in chickens [ [49](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17696131), [ 50](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24381623)]. 4) Antioxidant Effects The antioxidant benefits of milk thistle remain unclear. Low-quality evidence points to antioxidant effects, but we don't know how predictable and meaningful these changes are. In a clinical trial of 40 people with type 2 diabetes, Silymarin (420 mg/day) over 45 days enhanced antioxidant defense and enzymes such as glutathione and [SOD](https://selfhacked.com/blog/the-brain-fog-gene-rs4880-or-sod2/). It also reduced the inflammatory marker [ CRP](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/c-reactive-protein/) [ [51](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25765835)]. In cell culture, scientists are investigating whether milk thistle: - Activates the alleged detox hub, [Nrf2](http://selfhacked.com/blog/about-nrf2-and-natural-ways-to-increase-it/)[ [52](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785346)]. - Blocks the inflammation pathway called [NF-kB](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nuclear-factor-kappa-b/)[ [52](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785346)]. - Improves mitochondrial health (via [Heat Shock Proteins](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/heat-shock-proteins-hsp70-increase-decrease/), which are hypothesized to protect cells and tissues under stress) [ [52](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785346)]. - Increases [sirtuins](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nad-and-sirt1-their-role-in-chronic-health-issues/), which might help conserve energy, reduce aging and inflammation [ [52](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785346)]. - Neutralizes free radicals, chelating free iron and [copper](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/copper/)[ [52](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785346)]. However, these mechanisms and their health relevance remain unknown in humans. 5) OCD We still don't know whether milk thistle affects symptoms of OCD. Some scientists hypothesize that it protects the brain, thus explaining why it should be further researched in people with mental health disorders. In one clinical trial of 35 people with [ OCD](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/), milk thistle extract (600 mg/day) was comparable to an SSRI drug (fluoxetine) in reducing OCD symptoms over 8 weeks. Large-scale trials are lacking [ [53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20035818)]. 6) Kidney Health There is not enough evidence to support the use of milk thistle for kidney health. In one clinical trial, silymarin (210 mg/day) for 8 weeks in people on dialysis reduced inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-alpha [ [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/)]. Some scientists are also investigating whether it protects the kidneys in animal studies and how it might affect antioxidants in kidney cell studies. In dogs, it reduced kidney damage from an antibiotic (gentamicin) when combined with [ vitamin E](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/vitamin-e-can-help-fertility-pregnancy/). Clinical trials are needed [ [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/), [54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17803742)]. 7) Acne It's still uncertain whether milk thistle has any acne-soothing effects. In a trial of 14 people, a combination of silymarin (210 mg/day), N-acetylcysteine, and Selenium reduced acne after 8 weeks by 53% [ [55](https://www.omicsonline.org/effects-of-oral-antioxidants-on-lesion-counts-associated-with-oxidative-stress-and-inflammation-in-patients-with-papulopustular-acne-2155-9554.1000163.php?aid=10078)]. 8) Prostate Health Proper clinical trials are lacking to rate the effectiveness of milk thistle for prostate health. A mix of silymarin and selenium reduced prostate symptoms in a clinical trial of 55 men. It improved urine flow and reduced bladder fullness [ [56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012146)]. The same combination reduced blood fats that are linked to prostate cancer worsening in men who previously underwent prostate-removal surgery. Further trials are required [ [57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21048810)]. 9) Iron Overload According to one theory that remains to be proven, the active compounds in milk thistle act as iron chelators. It is being researched for binding excessive iron in genetic disorders of iron buildup. Silybin reduced iron absorption in 10 people with a genetic disorder that causes iron buildup and overload (Hemochromatosis) [ [58](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20628405)]. Silymarin reduced iron overload (in combination with desferrioxamine) in 49 people with - [thalassemia](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/thalassemia/), one of the most common genetic disorders [ [59](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23278124?dopt=Abstract)]. According to a large review 74 studies, silybin from milk thistle may reduce high iron and organ damage in people with thalassemia when used as an add-on, but large-scale trials are needed [ [60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779508/)]. 10) Chemo and Radiotherapy Side Effects Large-scale clinical trials have yet to determine the effectiveness and safety of milk thistle creams and oral formulations for reducing chemo and radiotherapy side effects. Silymarin from milk thistle formulated into a cream (Leviaderm) prevented skin damage from radiotherapy in one trial of over 100 breast cancer patients [ [61](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21786113?dopt=Abstract)]. Silymarin gel 1% applied on the palms and soles of hands and feet protected from skin damage typically caused by a chemotherapy drug (capecitabine) in 40 people with stomach cancer [ [62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28635153)]. In a low-quality trial of people with brain metastases undergoing radiotherapy, a combination of [omega-3](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/fish-oil-top-22-science-based-health-benefits-of-fish-oil/) fatty acids and milk thistle increased survival and decreased tissue damage from the radiation [ [63](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2612997/)]. In 77 people with cancer undergoing radiotherapy of the head and neck, silybin (420 mg/day) reduced painful mouth inflammation over 6 weeks [ [64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27555604)]. However, milk thistle didn't reduce kidney damage from the chemotherapy drug Cisplatin in one small clinical trial [ [65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25857366)]. Lacking Evidence For: No clinical evidence supports the use of milk thistle for any of the conditions listed in this section. Below is a summary of the existing animal and cell-based research, which should guide further investigational efforts. However, the studies listed below should not be interpreted as supportive of any health benefit. 11) Bone Health The effects of milk thistle on bone health in humans are unknown. Milk thistle (silymarin) improved bone healing and increased bone mineral density in mice with bone fractures [ [66](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24093748)]. Some researchers believe that milk thistle may compensate for low estrogen levels after menopause. It prevented bone loss and increased the activity of cells that help mineralize and rebuild bones in postmenopausal mice. One research group is investigating whether it raises the activity of bone-forming cells in dishes [ [67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23781510), [68](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898547)]. 12) Milk Production Although milk thistle has been used traditionally by pregnant women to increase milk production, the safety of supplementation in pregnant women is unknown. Pregnant women should not take milk thistle unless directed by a doctor [ [69](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23012383), [ 70](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501771/)]. In only one low-quality study of 50 breastfeeding women with low milk production, milk thistle slightly increased milk production after a month of daily use (420 mg/day) [ [70](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501771/), [ 71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19260380)]. 13) Red Blood Cells Scientists are studying the effects of silymarin on free radicals and glutathione in red blood cells [ [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/)]. 14) Weight Loss The effects of milk thistle on weight loss are unknown. Like many natural substances, it had some anti-obesity effects in animals. Many such plants turn out to be ineffective for weight loss in humans. In one study, milk thistle prevented mice fed a [high-fat diet](http://selfhacked.com/blog/low-carb-diet-vs-high-carb-diet/) from developing metabolic disease [ [72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039206/)]. Researchers are investigating whether silybin stops fat cells from developing and dividing in test tubes. They are also looking at its effects on weight-associated genes, such as [SIRT1](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nad-and-sirt1-their-role-in-chronic-health-issues/), [ PPAR alpha](https://selfhacked.com/blog/about-ppar-alpha-and-natural-ways-to-activate-it/), and [Pgc-1alpha](http://selfhacked.com/blog/about-pgc-1alpha-and-natural-ways-to-increase-it/) in cells and tissues [ [73](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19360322), [74](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26834634)]. It's uncertain if milk thistle can aid in weight loss in humans, though. 15) Bile Flow Some research in animals and cells focused on how milk thistle impacts blocked bile flow, suggesting that it might raise the production of bile salts and their secretion into the gut. This mechanism remains undetermined in humans [ [75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16611084), [ 76](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086715)]. 16) Hangovers Some people use milk thistle to reduce hangovers. Clinical studies have not investigated this use. In mice given a lot of alcohol over a short period of time, milk thistle protected the liver from injury and reduced inflammation. We can't translate these findings to humans [ [77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217313/)]. 17) Inflammation Scientists investigated the effects of silybin on pregnant mice with infections. They hypothesize it reduces inflammation in the brain and preterm births by affecting inflammatory Another unproven theory suggests that milk thistle may improve autoimmune conditions by reducing the [Th1](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/supplements-people-th1-dominant/) [7](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/th17/) [ response](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/th17/). The effects of milk thistle on autoimmunity in humans are unknown. Scientists wonder if one of the reasons why women are more susceptible to Th17-dominant autoimmune diseases is because of [ estrogen](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/estradiol/)'s involvement in the healthy immune response. In order to reduce the Th17 inflammatory response, estrogen receptors might need to be activated. Estrogen normally does this, but its levels drastically fall in women after menopause [ [80](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25888974)]. Early studies suggest that milk thistle might activate estrogen receptors. In a study of healthy people and those with rheumatoid arthritis, silybin increases ER-beta and miR-155. It seems to bind to estrogen receptors in white blood cells, which may reduce the autoimmune response and inflammatory cytokines ( [IL-17](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/th17/) and TNF-a) [ [81](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30174672)]. 19) Infections We don't know how milk thistle might affect infections in humans. Its effects against the following microbes are being researched in cell culture or lab animals: - Influenza A [ [82](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23836164)]. - Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus [ [87](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398291/)]. 20) Brain Health No human studies on the effects of milk thistle on brain health in humans exist. Scientists are exploring whether silybin and milk thistle extracts affect the following pathways in animals and cells: - Infection-related brain inflammation [ [78](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647589)]. - Memory loss from oxidative stress (in the brain's memory hub, the hippocampus) [ [88](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961891)]. - The expression of [BDNF](https://selfhacked.com/blog/a-comprehensive-list-of-natural-ways-to-increase-bdnf/), which helps make new brain cells, and of tyrosine receptor kinase B ( [TrkB](http://selfdecode.com/gene/ntrk2/?utm_source=seo&utm_medium=selfhacked&utm_campaign=id00002)), which helps make and strengthen new connections in the brain in response to BDNF [ [88](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961891)]. - Symptoms of Parkinson's disease and damage from stroke (via [NF-kB](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nuclear-factor-kappa-beta/)and microglia) [ [88](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961891), [89](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934474/)]. Some scientists think silymarin may be an anti-aging compound. They posit it might activate [ hormesis pathways](https://selfhacked.com/blog/ideas-hormesis/), increasing stress resilience and defense mechanisms similar to adaptogens. Researchers suspect these pathways might be linked to [longevity](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/lifestyle-diet-increase-longevity/) and brain protection [ [90](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25613505)] Still, no evidence backs them up. Silymarin extended the lifespan of worms, but its anti-aging effects haven't been studied in lab animals or humans [ [90](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25613505)]. 21) Interaction with Anti-Seizure Drugs SIlymarin reduced liver injury from anti-seizure drugs in a small trial of 55 children with epilepsy [ [91](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28603098)]. In rats, milk thistle blocks Pgp, a protein that is suspected to stop drugs from being absorbed in the gut or from passing to the brain [ [92](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602600), [ 93](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29122665)]. 22) Wound Healing The effects of milk thistle on wound healing in humans is not known. Silymarin increases skin regeneration and decreases inflammation in rats with wounds. Silybin sped up wound healing in rats possibly by affecting genes that help the skin rejuvenate. In cellular studies, milk thistle gel increased [ collagen](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/health-benefits-collagen/) and the activity of collagen-producing cells (fibroblasts) [ [94](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186158)]. 23) Fertility We don't know how milk thistle might affect fertility in humans. Milk thistle with [ rosemary](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/rosemary-benefits/) increased [ semen](https://selfhacked.com/blog/unhealthy-ejaculate/) quality, boosted antioxidant status, fertility, and sexual performance in rabbits [ [95](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28765034)]. Since milk thistle also has estrogen-like effects, its effects on fertility in men would need to be studied well in humans. Phytoestrogens that over-activate estrogen receptors usually reduce libido in men and increase the risk of erectile dysfunction [ [96](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854098/)]. Some researchers have suggested that milk thistle should be studied for increasing the chances of successful In vitro fertilization, but proper studies are lacking [ [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586829/)]. Cancer Research Milk thistle has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Large-scale, properly-designed studies are needed. In one clinical trial, 60 people with benign polyps in the colon (which often develop into colon cancer) took a herbal blend with milk thistle, a flaxseed antioxidant, and oat fiber for 2 months before colonoscopy. The combination increased estrogen receptors in the colon, which is hypothesized to be beneficial [ [97](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3718900/)]. A combination of Milk thistle (Silymarin) and [selenium](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/health-benefits-selenium/) reduced markers of prostate cancer worsening (LDL and total cholesterol) in 19 men who previously had their prostate removed [ [98](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21048810?dopt=Abstract)]. Milk thistle has low bioavailability, but standardized extracts might reach the blood. In 12 women with breast cancer, a combination of silybin and [ phosphatidylcholine ](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/health-benefits-phosphatidylcholine/)(2.8 g/day) for 4 weeks before surgery seemed to build up in the breast cancer tissue more than in healthy tissue [ [99](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26526990)]. In one study, high doses (up to 13 g/day) of a special milk thistle formulation (Silybin-phytosome) over 4 weeks were safe in 13 people with prostate cancer [ [100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17077998)]. Milk thistle is also being researched for preventing skin damage in animal studies [ [101](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15586237)]. Animal research is also investigating the effects of silybin on prostate cancer and breast tumors [ [102](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19047104/), [103](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15476849), [104](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332330), [105](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9563902)]. Limitations and Caveats Although there is a fair amount of clinical data, most trials were low-quality. More research is needed to determine the effects of milk thistle on various disease states in humans. Bioavailability was a big issue in many studies, especially in cases of disease when high levels of the active compounds need to reach the blood. Intravenous silybin was used at times, which is very different from taking oral supplements. Many studies were only done in animals or in cells. Their findings can't be extrapolated to humans. Learn More Takeaway Milk thistle is an herb with a long history of use for indigestion, liver and gallbladder problems. It's an ingredient in Iberogast, a mix of bitters and other herbs. According to clinical studies, Iberogast mildly improves indigestion. The only other use of milk thistle that's backed up by decent research is for supporting blood sugar balance in diabetics. In this case, milk thistle needs to be added to standard drug therapy to be effective. On the other hand, there's not enough good evidence to support the use of milk thistle for liver health or detox. Some findings have been mixed and supplementation is not recommended in people with liver disease until more research comes out. "}
