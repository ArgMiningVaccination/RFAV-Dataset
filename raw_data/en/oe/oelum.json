In pursuit of this endeavor, the following Exposure Control Plan (ECP) is provided to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens in accordance with the OSHA standard on bloodborne pathogens. A copy of this standard, Part 1910.1030, Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations may be accessed on the Univer sity Police and Safety Office web site. This standard requires each employer with employees who have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) to have a written Exposure Control Plan. The ECP for the University is de signed to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens including HBV, HCV and HIV, and is specific to NDSU INTRODUCTION Each person who has exposure must become familiar with, and adhere to the provisions of our Exposure Control Plan. Part -time, temporary, contract and per diem employees who are determined to have bloodborne pathogen exposure shall be covered by this plan as well. The Exposure Control Plan will be updated when changes occur and annually by the UP&SO . The ECP is a key document to assist NDSU Departments/Supervisors in implementing and ensuring compliance with the standard, thereby protecting our employees. This ECP includes: Procedures Definitions Program administration and responsibilities Determination of employee ex posure Explanation of the epidemiology, modes of transmission and symptoms of HBV, HCV and HIV Implementation of various methods of exposure control, including: o Universal and Standard Precautions o Engineering and work practice controls o Personal protective equipment o Housekeeping, including regulated waste management Hepatitis B vaccination and follow -up Post-exposure evaluation and follow -up Procedures for evaluating circumstances surrounding an exposure incident Communication of hazards to employees and trai ning Record keeping Program e valuation The methods of implementation of these elements of the standard are discussed in the subsequent pages of this Exposure Control Plan. A copy of the Exposure Control Plan shall be readily accessible to all employees d uring work hours, and may be accessed by contacting the University Police and Safety Office (UP&SO) at 231 -7759 or on the UP&SO web page . Faculty, Staff and Students will receive an explanation of this Exposure Control Plan (ECP) during their initial man datory Baseline Safety T raining provided by UP&SO . If requested, a copy of this ECP will be provided to any employee within 15 days of the request. Exposure Control Plan - 4 - DEFINITIONS Blood - human blood components including plasma, platelets, and serosanguineous fluids (e.g., exudates from wounds). Also included are medications derived from blood, such as immune globulins, albumin, and factors 8 and 9. Bloodborne Pathogens - includes any pathogenic microorganism that is present in human blood or other potentially infectious material ( OPIM ) and can infect and cause disease in persons who are exposed to blood containing the pathogen. Pathogenic microorganisms can cause diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, malaria, syphilis, babesiosis, brucellosis, leptospirosis, with HTLV -II, and viral hemorrhagic fever. Clinical Laboratory - a workplace where diagnostic or other screening procedures are performed on blood or other potentially infectious material. Contaminated - the presence, or the reasonably anticipated presence, of blood or other potentially infectious materials on an item or surface. Contaminated Laundr y - laundry that has been soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials or may contain sharps. Contaminated Sharps - any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin including, but not limited to, needles, scalpels, broken glass, broken c apillary tubes, and exposed dental wires. Decontamination - the use of physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate, or destroy bloodborne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particle s and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal. Disinfect - the use of a physical or chemical procedure to destroy certain microbial life. Levels of disinfection include low, intermediate and high. Unlike sterilization, even high -level disinfection does not kill bacterial endospores. Surface disinfectants are ranked as either low or intermediate. These include EPA registered tuberculocidal disinfectants or 1:10 freshly mixed bleach and water. If blood or other potentially infe ctious materials are to be disinfected from a contaminated surface, one of these intermediate- level disinfectants is required to be used. Engineering Controls - controls that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace. Examples include safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharp injury protection (SESIPs) and needleless systems. Exposure Incident - a specific eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, non- intact skin (e.g., dermatitis, hangnails, cuts, abrasions, chafi ng, and acne), or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials incident that results from the performance of an employee's duties. Exposure Control Plan - 5 - Hand Washing Facilities - an area that provides an adequate supply of running potable water, soap and single use towels or hot air drying machines for hand washing. Licensed Healthcare Professional (HCP) - a person whose legally permitted scope of practice allows him or her to independently perform the act ivities required by the program , Hepatitis B Vaccination and Post -Exposure Evaluation and Follow -up. HBV - Hepatitis B Virus; the virus that causes hepatitis B HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus; the virus that causes AIDS Near Miss - a potential hazard that may cause an injury, e xposure or illnes s. No injury/incident has occurred, but the potential is there. Near Miss hazards need to be reported immediately. Needleless Systems - devices that do not use needles for: (1) the collection of body fluids or withdrawal of body fluids after initial ven ous or arterial access is established; (2) the administration of medication or fluids; or (3) any other procedure involving the potential for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens due to percutaneous injury involving contaminated sharps. Examples of needleless systems include, but are not limited to, intravenous medication delivery systems that administer medication or fluids through a catheter port or connector site using a blunt cannula or other non- needle connection, and jet injection systems that deliver subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of liquid medication through the skin without use of a needle. Occupational Exposure - reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties. This includes the potential for contact as well as actual contact with blood or OPIM. Other Potentially Infectious Materials (OPIM) - 1. The following human body fluids: semen and v aginal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal flui d, amniotic fluid, saliva (due to the presence of blood), and any body fluid visibly contaminated with blood 2. Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than inta ct skin) from a human (living or dead) and; all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids 3. HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV - or HBV - containing culture medium or other s olutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. Parenteral - piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events as needle sticks, human bites that break the skin, cuts, and abrasions. Perso nal Protective Equipment - (PPE) specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g. uniforms, pants, shirts or blouses) not intended to function as protection against a hazard, are NOT consider ed PPE. Exposure Control Plan - 6 - Production Facility - a facility engaged in industrial- scale, large volume or high concentration production of HIV or HBV. Regulated Waste - liquid or semi -liquid blood or other potentially infectious materials; contaminated items that would rele ase blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi -liquid state if compressed; items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable of releasing these materials during handling; contaminated s harps; and pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or other potentially infectious materials. Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Protections (SESIPs) - non- needle sharp or a needle device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a ve in or artery, or administering medications or other fluids, with a built -in safety feature or mechanism that effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident. These may include: syringes with guards or sliding sheaths that shield the attached needle after use; needles that retract into a syringe after use; shielded or retracting catheters used to access the bloodstream for intravenous administration of medication or fluids; intravenous medication delivery systems that administer medication or fluids th rough a catheter port or connector site using a needle that is housed in a protective covering, blunt suture needles; and plastic capillary and blood tubes. Soiled - dirty. NOT contaminated with blood or OPIM. An employee's uniform may be soiled with dirt and sweat from the day's work. The uniform would be contaminated if blood or OPIM were on the uniform. Source Individual - any individual, living or dead, whose blood or other potentially infectious materials may be a source of occupational exposure t o the employee. Examples include, but are not limited to: hospital and clinic patients; clients in institutions for the developmentally disabled; trauma victims; clients of drug and alcohol treatment facilities; residents of hospices and nursing homes; hum an remains; and individuals who donate or sell blood or blood components. Standard Precautions - an approach to infection control in which human blood and ALL human body fluids are treated as if known to infectious for HIV, HBV, HCV or other bloodborne pathogens. Sterilize - the use of a physical or chemical procedure to destroy all microbial life including highly resistant bacterial endospores. Universal Precautions - an approach to infection control in which human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, HCV or other bloodborne pathogens. Work Practice Controls - controls that reduce the likelihood of exposure by altering the manner in which a task is performed (e.g. handling medical waste with gloves). Exposure Control Plan - 7 - PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION Employer Responsibilities In compliance with OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogen Standard, NDSU requires each separate location (if applicable) with employees who have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectio us mate rials (OPIM) to maintain this written Exposure Control Plan. This plan should be designed to eliminate or minimize individual exposure to bloodborne pathogens including HBV, HCV and HIV, and should be specific to each particular place of employment. All a spects of this plan, including training resources , shall be provided and made available to Faculty, Staff and Students. The Exposure Control Manager(s ) The exposure control plan will be developed and maintained by the University Police and Safety Office w ith the help of Staff, Faculty and Students. It s hould be noted that NDSU Departments are ultimately responsible for the content s of this plan and its implementation b y employees within this institution . The Exposure Control Manager(s) will review this Pl an at least annually and whenever necessary to reflect new or changed exposure potential tasks and procedures . The Exposure Control Manager should be given not only the responsibility to manage the development of the program, but the authority, along with NDSU, to implement and enforce its requirements. This authority should be made clear to all employees. Specific Responsibilities Responsibility for Implementing, Maintaining and Updating the ECP Supervisors and the UP&SO will be responsible for the im plementation, maintenance, review and updates of the Exposure Control Plan at least annually, and whenever necessary , to include new or modified tasks and procedures which affect occupational exposure and to reflect new or revised employee positions with o ccupational exposure. Responsibility for Engineering and Work Practice Contr ols, Labeling, Housekeeping and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Supervisors and their Departments will be responsible for providing , maintaining and updating all necessary p ersonal protective equipment (PPE), engineering controls (e.g. sharps containers and SESIPS), labels, and red bags as required by the standard; and will ensure that adequate supplies of the aforementioned equipment are available in the appropriate types an d sizes. Responsibility for Training The Departments will be responsible for training, documentation of training and making the written ECP available. Responsibility for Medical Actions and Record Keeping Departments will be responsible for ensuring that all medical actions required are performed and that appropriate medical records are maintained. Exposure Control Plan - 8 - Employee Responsibilities Staff , Faculty and Students of NDSU have certain responsibility to prevent bloodborne pathogen exposures. These include: Attending a ll training sessions and signing documentation stating that training has been received for the prevention of the spread of bloodborne pathogens. Taking precautions in the handling of sharps, blood or other potentially infectious fluids or materials. Immediately reporting an incident/accident that causes any blood and/or other potentially infectious materials to become an exposure or threat of exposure (24 hour requirement). Reporting unsafe behaviors, practices or situations immediately in order to prevent accidents. Participating in the evaluation of devices engineered to eliminate or reduce the potential for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Participating in the process of establishing policies and procedures intended to eliminate or reduce the potential f or exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Reporting \"Near Misses\" Near Misses Changing an unsafe behavior is the best method of preventing an accident. Identifying \"Near Misses\" is crucial in order to reevaluate procedures and re -train individuals. Even thoug h only one individual may be identified as performing an exposure potential task in an unsafe manner, there may be others utilizing this same behavior that have simply not been identified. (e.g., employee \"popping\" the finger off a glove in order to feel a vein) For this reason, if a task is identified as being performed unsafely, all individuals who perform that task will be re -trained on its safe performance. This re- training should be documented. ACCIDENTS, NEAR MISSES , UNSAFE BEHAVIORS, AND UNSAFE S ITUATIONS WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REPORTED TO : The University Police and Safety Office at 231 -7759 Methods for reporting unsafe behaviors established by NDSU may include: Confidential meetings w ith the Safety Office Report forms Contact the UP&SO at 231 -7759 EMPLOYEE EXPOSURE DETERMINATION Bloodborne Diseases The Bloodborne Pathogen Standard was promulgated to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens. These bloodborne pathogens (carried in the blood and OPIM) can be spread from one person to another through parenteral, mucous membrane and non- intact skin contact. This can lead to the contraction of serious bloodborne diseases. The most common of these diseases are hepatitis B caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C caused by the hepa titis C virus, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There are many other bloodborne diseases that can be contracted on the job in the same way as these three. These include malaria, syphilis, human T -lymphotrophic virus Type Creutzfeldt -Jakob hemorrhagic fever. We will discus s HBV, HCV and HIV. Exposure Control Plan - 9 - Hepatitis B Virus The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been a major bloodbor ne hazard facing healthcare and other professions for decades. Since OSHA's mandate of the use of Universal Precautions as well the HBV vaccine for all employees performing tasks that would expose them to blood or OPIM, thousands of w orkers have been spared this disease. Hepatitis B is still a problem for the general public as well as those unvaccinated workers. This disease affects almost 1.5 million people in the United States, resulting in thousands of hospitalizations and many de aths. Of those infected with hepatitis B: 1/3 of those infected will have no symptoms at all 1/3 of those infected will have mild flu symptoms 1/3 of those infected may suffer from flu- like symptoms so severe that they may require hospitalization. These symptoms are: jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, skin rash, and fever The incubation period for HBV is 160- 180 days. About ten percent of those infected with HBV will become chronically infected. When an individual develops chronic hepatitis B, a variety of outcomes are possible, ranging from a chronic carrier state with very little, if any, liver damage, to ongoing chronic hepatitis of varying degrees of severity. The latter may at times progress to cirrhosis with all its c linical implications. The good news is that there is a vaccine that can prevent infection from HBV. More about the vaccine and your rights as an employee will be discussed later in this ECP. Hepatitis C Virus HCV infection occurs among persons of all ages, but the highest pr evalence rates of HCV infection are found among males aged 30 to 49 years . The incubation period of the acute infection is 7- 8 weeks. Less than 15% of patients with HCV infection have a spontaneous cure. HCV infection causes chron ic hepatitis in 85% of patients. 85% of those infected with HCV have no symptoms at all 15% suffer symptoms including: jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite There is no vaccine that can prevent infection from HCV. The best prev ention is to practice Universal Precautions and follow the policies and procedures set down in this Plan intended to prevent or decrease your changes of acquiring any bloodborne disease on the job. Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV, the virus that causes A cquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), attacks the body's immune system. A person infected with HIV: May suffer from flu -like symptoms, fever, diarrhea and fatigue Will eventually develop AIDS May carry the virus without developing symptoms for severa l years May develop AIDS -related illnesses including neurological problems, cancer and other opportunistic infections such as pneumocystosis pneumonia and esophageal candidiasis. Exposure Control Plan - 10 - There is no vaccine to prevent infection. Let us reemphasize that the best prevention is to practice Universal Precautions and follow the policies and procedures set down in this Plan intended t o prevent or decrease your chanc es of acquiring any bloodborne disease on the job. How Are Bloodborne Pathogens Transmitted Pathogens, which are contained in blood and OPIM, must be introduced into the body for an employee to become exposed. An \"exposure potential task\" is a task that could potentially expose the employee in one of the following ways: Parenteral exposure from needles, scal pels, broken glass, sharp instruments, or anything that can pierce, puncture or cut your skin that is contaminated with blood or OPIM. Non-intact skin such as an existing wound, eczema, broken cuticle, or rash coming in contact with blood or OPIM. Mucous membranes such as the eyes, nose, and mouth becoming splashed, sprayed, or touched with blood or OPIM. Remember, touching contaminated surfaces can be a mode of spreading disease. The HBV virus can survive on environmental surfaces and objects dried and at room temperature for as long as a week. More about decontamination of surfaces will be discussed in the \"Housekeeping\" section of this ECP. Determining At Risk Employees and Tasks Determination is made without regard to the use of personal protective equipment when determining which tasks, procedures, and job positions may have occupationa l exposure potential . Employees shall be informed by their Department/Supervisor of the exposure potential tasks required by their jobs. All job positions that invo lve tasks and procedures during which exposure to blood or OPIM may take place, fall into one of two categories: Job classifications in which all employees may have occupational exposure (e.g., Police, Nurses, Physicians, Colleg e of Pharmacy, Family Science and Day Care, Wellness Center, Athletic Trainers, Veterinary and Micro Science, Health Nutrition and E xercise Science, Safety Office , Biotechnology, Residence Life, Faculty, Staff, Students working with human blood and tissue). All the employees with these job classifications have a potential exposure risk. Job classifications in which some employees have occupational exposure (e.g., Custodial, Housekeeping, Plumbers, Labs, Day Care etc.) For example, a department might employ several personnel, but only one packages the medical waste once a month; or only one person scrubs instruments when it gets really busy. Note: Even if an employee in a particular job classification \"rarely\" performs an exposure task such as handling contaminated material, he/she mu st be trained on bloodborne pathogen exposure, how to safely perform the task, and be offered the HBV vaccine. Any part -time, temporary, contract and per diem employees hired to perform tasks with potential for exposure to bloodborne pathogens will be tr ained by the Department or Supervisor regarding the controls utilized within this institution to eliminate or reduce exposure. Provision of HBV vaccine, Exposure Control Plan - 11 - post-exposure follow -up, record keeping, and generic training will be provided by the contracted emplo yee or service. ENGINEERING AND WORK PRACTICE CONTROLS Engineering and work practices designed to eliminate or minimize employee exposure shall be used when performing exposure potential tasks. All procedures involving blood and OPIM will be performed i n a way that prevents or minimizes splashing, spraying, spattering, and generation of droplets. Where occupational exposure remains, personal protective equipment shall also be used. Engineering and work practice controls will be evaluated, maintained, a nd/or replaced on a regular schedule to ensure their continued effectiveness. This depa rtment identifies the need for changes in engineering controls and work practices through review of incident records, use of checklists, evaluation forms and employee interviews. Should an exposure incident occur while using these controls, the controls will be evaluated as to the reason for the failure, corrected, and changes will be made to this Exposure Control Plan in order to prevent future incidents. Training of employees will occur immediately, reflecting the new changes. Some of the sharps, or breakable sharps, devices used that pose a risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens include needles for injections, lancets, scalpels, vascula r access catheters, suture needles, capillary tubes, vacuum tubes, etc. Specific engineering and work practice controls used to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens include but may not be limited to: Non-glass capillary tubes SESIPs (Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Prevention) Universal Precautions or Standard Precautions Sharps Containers Avoiding distractions and slowing down when necessary Universal Precautions (UP) and Standard Precautions (SP) NDSU as well as OSHA requ ires that Universal Precautions or Standard Precautions be observed to prevent contact with blood or body fluids. The difference between UP and SP is as follows: Universal Precautions: All blood and OPIM are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, HCV and other bloodborne pathogens, regardless of the perceived low or high risk of the patient/person from whom they came. Standard Precautions: Incorporates the major features of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Precautions and applies the se principles to all individuals regardless if their diagnosis is presumed infection status . Standard Precautions apply to (1) blood, (2) all body substances, secretions, and excretions (except sweat) regardless of whether or not these substances contain visible blood, (3) non- intact skin, (4) mucous membranes, and (5) non- preserved tissues. Standard Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmitting of microorganisms from both known and unknown sources of infection in the hospital setting. At a m inimum, all employees at this institution will practice Universal Precautions. Exposure Control Plan - 12 - Hand W ashing Employees will wash their hands for approximately 20 seconds with soap and tepid running water immediately or as soon as possible after all glove or other personal protective equipment removal. Hand sanitizers may be used in situations if there are no means to wash (i.e., health fair). This procedure must be followed by washing with soap and water as soon as feasible. Employees will wash skin with soap and water or flush mucous membranes with water immediately following contact with blood or OPIM. Workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis should refra in from all direct patient care and from handling other patient care equipment until the condition res olves. Sharps Handling Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Protections (SESIPs) Medical devices with sharps injury prevention features that are cleared by the FDA {510(K)} will be used whenever possible. Devices should have design features with the foll owing characteristics: A fixed safety feature that provides a barrier between the hands and needle after use; the safety feature should allow or require the worker's hands to remain behind the needle at all times The safety feature is an integral part of t he device and not an accessory The safety feature is in effect before disassembly and remains in effect aft er disposal to protect users, trash handler s, and for environmental safety The safety feature is as simple as possible, and requires little or no tra ining to use effectively The device will not jeopardize patient or employee safety or be m edically inadvisable The device will make an exposure incident involving a contaminated sharp less likely to occur. Examples of such devices include: o Needle- protected systems o Needleless systems o Self-sheathing needles o Safety phlebotomy needles o Retracting lancets o Plastic blood tubes and plastic or mylar -coated capillary tubes o Blood transfer devices o Blunt suture needles Engineering Controls and SESIPS Evaluation Evidence to ensure engineering controls and sharps -injury protection effectiveness, sharps and engineering controls will be evaluated on a regular basis. Identification, evaluation and selection of effective engineering controls shall be accomplished through: Review of materials provided by research entities, government regulations, industry associations, and product manufacturers such as: o Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OS HA) \" Bloodborne Pathogens and Needlestick Prevention. \" o University of Virginia Health System \" International Healthcare Worker Safety Center \" Exposure Control Plan - 13 - Use of evaluation forms and hands -on assessment of device s Following the Procedures for New Technology, SESIPs, and ECP Evaluation Annual review of new technology Specific SESIPs Evaluated Device Name Device Use Manufacturer Date Evaluated PROCEDUR ES FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY, SESIPS, AND EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN EVALUATION AND UPDATE 1. A review of the bloodborne pathogen standard in this manual will precede policy development. 2. Research will be accessed on products through available data from a variety of so urces which may include our state medical association, American Medical Association, American Nurses' Association, Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, and websites of prospective safety device manufacturers. When reviewing the bloodborne pathogen standard, reviewer will not simply skip to the engineering controls section and add the new requirements. 3. Employee training program will be reviewed to assure training on HCV as well as the other required topics is in place. 4. Suppliers or manufacturers should be contacted for samples of safety needles, safety scalpels and blades, blunt suture needles, IV connectors and any other safety sharps replacement device. Instructional materials such as videos and data on proper use will be requested. 5. A staff meeting will be scheduled to discuss the new regulations and plans for evaluating products. Clinical em ployees or job classifications asked to volunteer to participate in the evaluation of any safety device that will replace a device t hey current use will be identified in this ECP. 6. Once the sample products arrive, all evaluators will meet. Each evaluator will receive one evaluation tool for each brand of device being evaluated. Instructional videos and manufacture- provided training s hould be utilized when possible. 7. Implement the clinical trial of the product(s) . During the trial period, each evaluator should complete the evaluation tool for each product tried. Exposure Control Plan - 14 - 8. The evaluation team will meet to review evaluations and discuss the pro s and cons of each device evaluated. The team will decide, using the objective data gathered, what devices will be implemented. If safety devices for certain procedures are not to be implemented, the team will justify in writing why and how this decision was made. The following criteria may justify not switching to a safety device from a traditional device: No safety device on the market for the particular procedure Less safe for the operator than your traditional device Interfered with pati ent care deli very Was less safe for the patient 9. The final step is to fully implement the safety devices, as well as any other new engineering devices and procedures determined to be good choices to prevent the potential for sharps injuries. 10. File documentation of all ev aluations and updates. 11. After a month or so (sooner if problems with a device arise), the team should meet again to establish if the products that have been implemented are still working as first determined. 12. The exposure control plan, procedures and new tec hnology will be reviewed at least annually. As required by OSHA and NDSU, safety policies and procedures will be enforced. Compliance by employees to the safety policies and procedures may be encouraged in a variety of ways: Progressive discipline (i.e., three strikes you 're out) is one way. A written policy on enforcement of safety policies must be enforceable. Do not establish a written policy if the facility does not intend to enforce it. A positive reinforcement approach should always be attempted prior to discipline. One example would be adding safety compliance to performance reviews. If an employee knows that his or her next raise will be in part based on compliance to facility safety policies and procedures, the employee is likely to increase compliance. General Sharps Handling Procedures Faculty, Staff and Students shall not break, shear, or clip contaminated sharps under any circumstances. Faculty, Staff, Students and physicians will make use of the \"safe zone\", and will never directly pass contaminated sharps to each other. You may not bend, recap or remove needles or other sharps unless the medical procedure requires such and no alternative is available. If this is the case, using a one -handed tech nique or recapping device when performi ng the procedure is required. In addition, the facility must be able t o justify this necessity (i.e. injection of local anesthesia) . Students requiring the use of sharps (needles, lancets) must obtain an individual sharps disposal container from the Resid ent Hall office. Sharps Containers for Disposable and Reusable Sharps Disposable sharps shall be discarded immediately or as soon as feasible in containers that are: Able to be closed prior to removal \u00be Full Puncture resistant Leak -proof on sides and bot tom Exposure Control Plan - 15 - Labeled biohazard or color -coded red Easily accessible to personnel and located as close as possible to the point of use, or where sharps might be found. Maintained upright throughout use Replaced routinely and may not be overfilled Appropriate in size for devices placed in them Designed with visible opening, below eye level, if wall -mounted Designed with an unobstructed opening that allows devices to drop in easily Sharps containers shall be re- evaluated annually by using such methods as checklists, e valuation tools such as the one provided by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), manufacturer information, and current research to determine the safety and appropriateness of the containers being utilized within each facility. Contaminated sharps shall never be transported down the hall. If it is necessary to maintain a sharps container other than near the point of use, the sharps container shall be carried to the point of use. If the container already contains sharps, it must be closed prior to transport. Reusable sharps such as scissors that are contaminated shall be placed as soon as possible after use in appropriate containers until properly reprocessed. These containers shall be: o Puncture resistant o Labeled with biohazard or red o Leak -proof on the sides and bottom o Designed so sharps are not stored or processed in a manner that requires employees to reach by hand into the containers where the sharps have been placed Employee Input NDSU shall solicit input from both manageria l and non- managerial employees responsible for direct patient care and research regarding the identification, evaluation, and selection of effective engineering controls, including safer medical devices. Faculty, Staff and Students selected to evaluate s uch devices should represent the range of exposure situations encountered in this workplace, such as PI's, pediatrics, phlebotomy, and surgery. A Sharps Injury Log Under Federal OSHA r egulations, NDSU (SIC code 801) is exempt from maintaining a sharps injury log as that exemption applies to partial exemption of 29 CFR 1904. Despite this exemption, NDSU has elect ed to establish and maintain a sharps injury log for the recording of percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. This may help NDSU to identi fy the need to eliminate identified unsaf e engineering devices. T he information in the sharps injury log shall be recorded and maintained as to protect the confidentiality of the injured employee for a minimum of five years by the University Police and Safety Office. The sharps injury log shall contain, at a minimum: The type and brand of device involved in the incident The department or work area where the exposure incident occurred and an explanation of how the incident occurred. Exposure Control Plan - 16 - The fact that NDSU is e xempt from the OSHA 300 and Sharps Injury Log does not exempt the University from all other elements of the Bloodborne Pathogen standard, including revisions and evaluation of engineering controls such as safety needles. Note: Certain states with their own state OSHA programs require all facilities regardless of size to maintain a Sharps Injury Log. Preventing Contamination of Food and Personal I tems Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in work areas where contamination could occur. Food and drink shall not be kept in refrigerators, freezers, shelves, cabinets or on countertops or bench -tops where blood or OPIM are present. If nurses' stations, physicians', researchers or teaching work are as could be contaminated with blood or OPIM from exposure potential tasks being performed in those areas, eating and drinking is not allowed. Applying make -up, placing contact lenses, brushing teeth and other personal hygiene procedures may be allowed in t he following areas: restrooms, personal office, etc. Storage of food and drink is allowed in the following areas: break room, refrigerator and cabinets, non- clinical/research/teaching desk areas, personal offices, reception area. Transport or repair of c ontaminated equipment Equipment that could become contaminated with blood or OPIM must be examined prior to service or shipment and decontaminated if feasible. If equipment cannot be decontaminated, biohazard labels stating which portions of the equipment remain contaminated must be affixed to those portions. Always be sure the service person, on or off site, has been notified of potential exposure from such equipment. Equipment to be shipped or serviced: (e.g., Sterilizers, Patient- Care Equipment, Instruments, Other Equipment). Should the above equipment (or other that may not be listed here) become even potentially contaminated with blood or OPIM: sterilization, when possible, should take precedence over disinfection. If sterilization or high level disinfection (submersion) is not possible, all exposed surfaces shall be wiped down and, if possible, lines shall be flushed with an EPA registered tuberculocidal disinfectant. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) will be provided at no cost to employees. It is to be used whenever there is potential risk of exposure to blood or OPIM. PPE shall be evaluated as to appropriateness, size and effectiveness as needed and on an annual basis. PPE will consist of, but may not be li mited to, gloves, masks, fluid resistant gowns, lab coats, face shields, eye protection, and resuscitation devices. Each department will make every effort to ensure that each employee uses appropriate personal protective equipment. It is the responsibili ty of each Faculty, Staff, and Student to follow the policies established within this Exposure Control Plan. Failure to do so could be subject to disciplinary action. Each individual shall also notify the Exposure Control Manager or their Supervisor if he or she is having problems using provided PPE in order for appropriate changes to be made. Exposure Control Plan - 17 - PPE is only effective if it prevents blood or OPIM contamination of the person's clothes, uniform, eyes, nose, mouth, and skin. PPE has limitations, and therefore s hould not be used if it is in poor condition. The individual's uniform is not PPE. If a lab coat is only worn as part of the uniform and removed or covered prior to performing exposure potential tasks, it would not be considered PPE. On the other hand, if the lab coat is being worn to protect clothing from potential contamination, it would be considered PPE. Appropriate sizes, types, and alternative PPE such as hypoallergenic gloves will be provided at no charge to employees. Cleaning, repair, replacement, and disposal of PPE will be provided at no charge to employees. If a garment is penetrated by blood or OPIM, the garment shall be removed immediately, or as soon as feasible. PPE will be removed prior to leaving the work area and placed in a designated area or container for storage, laundry, or disposal. If a rare situation occurs where it is the individual's professional judgment that the brief declination to wear PPE is in the best interest of delivery of healthcare or protection of a co- worker, the supervisor will evaluate that situation and determine procedures to be followed in future instances. In the case of such a situation, the supervisor shall be notified immediately. Gloves Gloves will always be worn when there is reasonable anticipation t hat an individual will have hand contact with blood or OPIM, mucous membranes, or non- intact skin, when performing vascular access procedures, and when handling or touching contaminated items. Disposable exam gloves are to be changed when contaminated or they become torn, punctured or sticky (integrity is compromised.) Disposable exam gloves are meant to be single use. They are not to be washed or decontaminated for re -use on the same or a new patient. To be used as proper PPE, gloves must be worn on both hands. Glove fingers are not to be removed. When removing disposable gloves: o Pinch the part of the glove covering the palm of one gloved hand and pull the glove off being careful not to touch the ungloved hand o Next, place the thumb of the ungloved hand i nside the remaining gloved hand's glove, being careful not to touch the outside of the glove, and pull it off. Dispose of properly and wash hands immediately. Utility gloves will be worn for all housekeeping duties and will be removed and disinfected or discarded into regular trash if cracked, peeling, torn, punctured, or otherwise deteriorating and therefore not functioning as an adequate barrier. Exam gloves will be in various locations including l aboratory counters, sterilization, procedure room cabinet s, etc. Following their use, disposable gloves are deposited appropriately, e.g., in the regular trash, unless they are determined to be regulated waste...see definition of Regulated Waste. Following their use, utility gloves are cleaned appropriately, e.g., washing with soap and water, and spraying with surface disinfectant if contaminated. Gloves should be autoclaved periodically. The gloves should be stored in a manner to allow drying of inside of gloves. Exposure Control Plan - 18 - Masks and Protective Eyewear Masks are provided a nd shall be worn when performing procedures with potential for producing splash or splatter. N-95 respirator masks designed to prevent blood exposure must be worn when certain procedures, such as use of lasers, could produce smoke or fumes as well as bl ood or OPIM splatter. Goggles, shields, masks with shield attached or eye wear with solid side shields shall be worn to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes when procedures with potential for producing splash or splatter are performed. Whenever tasks are performed that could generate aerosols that may contain blood or OPIM, the employee should wear a mask in combination with a shield or other protective eyewear. Note: If splash or spray to the face is a potential, all mucous membranes must be cover ed. Masks are to be changed immediately or as soon as feasible: If they become damp or contaminated After each patient Following its use, reusable eye/face protection is cleaned appropriately, e.g., placing reusable shield in sink and washing with soap a nd water. Spray with disinfectant if eye protection has become contaminated. Rinse with water prior to placing on face. If prescription glasses are used as PPE, they must have solid side shields. If masks or disposable shields are used, dispose of in reg ular trash unless determined to be regulated waste. Resuscitation/Ventilation Devices Faculty, Staff and Students will use bag -valve devices or shields with one -way valves if CPR is required to be performed. Following their use, reusable resuscitation de vices are cleaned appropriately, e.g., washing with soap and water and spraying with disinfectant. If disposable devices are used, dispose of in trash unless determined to be regulated waste - place in red bag. Protective Clothing/Garments Task -appropria te garments such as lab coats, fluid resistant gowns, surgical caps, or shoe covers will be worn when exposure potential tasks are performed. The type and characteristics will depend upon the task and degree of pote ntial exposure. For example, while perfo rming a particular task , there is potential for fluid to soak through a lab coat, then the lab coat would not be appropriate PPE for this task. Note: While personal shoes are certainly not considered PPE, and should be covered if there is a chance of expo sure to blood or OPIM, shoes that are close -toed, and prevent slipping should always be worn. This will prevent or reduce accidental exposure from spills, dropping of needles, and other potential foot hazards. Exposure Control Plan - 19 - When removed, contaminated gowns or jackets s hould be handled so as to prevent contamination of the individual. Pull garments off inside out and containerize. Following their use, disposable garments should be discarded appropriately, e.g., placed in trash unless determined to be regulated waste. P rotective garments should be removed prior to leaving the work area. Following their use, reusable garments are handled appropriately, e.g., placed in red biohazard bag or laundry bag provided by laundry service. Certain tasks with additional exposure pot ential that are not being performed at this time may need to be added to the task table. The decision as to the type of PPE must be based upon the potential for exposure to uniform, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, or non- intact skin. Always assess the situatio n carefully prior to making a decision regarding PPE. The following are examples of MINIMAL PPE to be worn for exposure potential tasks: Check if Task Performed TASK PPE (Add additional PPE as Required) Picking up and disposing of contaminated sharps Gloves Cleaning up body fluid spills Gloves, mask, eye protection, gown Disinfecting contaminated objects Gloves, mask, eye protection, gown Handling contaminated laundry (blood or OPIM on it Gloves, mask, eye protection, gown Handling contaminated waste (blood or OPIM on it Gloves, mask, eye protection, gown Performing CPR Resuscitation device. Depends on the severity of the injury and presence of blood or OPIM. Performing first aid Depends on the severity of the injury and presence of blood or OPIM. Gloves at a minimum. Finger and/or heel sticks Gloves Injections Gloves Vascular access Gloves Dressing removal Gloves Suturing/stapling Gloves Suture/staple removal Gloves Foreign body removal Gloves Exposure Control Plan - 20 - Biopsy Gloves Surgical procedures with potential for splash or splatter Sterile gloves, mask, eyewear, gown Surgical procedures without potential for splash or splatter Sterile gloves, mask Specimen handling Gloves Throat culture Gloves Flex sigmoidoscopy Gloves, mask , eyewear, gown Cryosurgery Gloves, mask Colposcopy Gloves, mask Lab procedures dealing with blood or OPIM Gloves, mask, eyewear, gown Lab procedures dealing with non -blood or OPIM body fluids Gloves Ear lavage and/or nasal smear Vaginal sonogram Gloves Pelvic and rectal exams Gloves Penile and/or vaginal collection Gloves Urinary catheter placement and removal Gloves Clip skin tags Gloves Arthrocentesis Gloves I & D Gloves Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Training and Certification The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has revised certain standards effecting the design, selection and use requirements for PPE designated to protect the eyes, face, head, feet and hands. Included in this revision is the requirement for the employer to assess the workplace to determine if hazards are present that would necessitate the use of PPE. If such hazards are found to be present, the employer will: Exposure Control Plan - 21 - select, and have each affected employee use, the types of PP E that will protect the affected employee from the hazards identified in the hazard assessment communicate selection decisions to each affected employee select PPE that properly fits each affected employee The Supervisor will be responsible for the hazard assessment, selection, and training on the use of appropriate PPE for the tasks or pr ocedures employees will perform . PPE Certification of Hazard Assessment Defective and damaged equipment or PPE shall not be used. o If tasks are performed that may require face and eye protection from: Flying particles Liquid chemicals Acids or caustic liquids Chemicals gases or vapors Biohazards o If tasks are performed that may require hand protection from: Harmful substances that could be absorbed Severe cuts or laceration s Severe abrasions Punctures Chemical Burns Thermal Burns Biohazards o If tasks are performed that may require head/foot protection from: Punctures Falling objects Chemical burns Biohazards PPE Training o Potentially exposed employees will be trained on the following : When PPE is necessary What PPE is necessary How to properly don, doff, adjust and wear PPE Limitations of the PPE Proper care, maintenance, useful life of PPE Disposal of PPE Faculty, Staff and Students shall be retrained if it is determined the previously trained do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the need for use of the PPE and do not properly utilize the PPE. Faculty, Staff and Students shall be retrained if there is a change in workplace task, type of PPE, or the need for PPE. Exposure Control Plan - 22 - Housekeeping NDSU shall ensure that all work areas are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. All equipment and environmental and working surfaces shall be cleaned and decontaminated after contact with blood or OPIM. Surface decontamination shall occur: After completion of procedures where work surfaces become contaminated. Immediately or as soon as feasible when surfaces become overtly contaminated or after any spill of blood or OPIM. At the end of the work shifts if the surface may have become contaminated since the last cleaning. Any protective coverings will be replaced after each patient/procedure if they may have become contaminated. All bins, pails, cans and similar receptacles intended for reuse that could potentially become contaminated will be inspected regularly, and will be cleaned immediately or as soon as feasible upon visible contamination. Broken glassware which may be contaminated shall not be picked up directly with the hands. It will be picked up using forceps, tongs, or a dust pa n and brush. The following written schedule for worksite cleaning and method of decontamination is based upon: Location within the facility (exam room vs. medical records) Type of surface to be cleaned (sink vs. floor) Type of soil present (dirt vs. blood) Tasks or procedures being performed in the area (patient care vs. bookkeeping) ALWAYS FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURER'S DIRECTIONS WHEN USING CLEANERS AND DISINFECTANTS Cleaning and Disinfecting Schedule 1. Room : Exam rooms (and other direct patient care areas ) Surfaces: Surfaces that cross contamination could have occurred Frequency: Disinfect daily or immediately following patient procedure if surfaces could have become contaminated . If using barriers, they shall be changed between patient s. Disinfectant: When cleaning and disinfecting contaminated surfaces, use an EPA registered tuberculocidal surface disinfectant or cleaner. PPE used: Gloves (as well as mask and goggles if splatter or aerosol is created) 2. Room Laborato ries Surfaces: Surfaces where cross contamination could have occurred Frequency: Disinfect immediately following procedure if surfaces could have become contaminated. Disinfect at the end of each work shift. Disinfectant: When cleaning and disinfecting contaminated surfaces, use an EPA registered tube rculocidal surface disinfectant or cleaner. PPE used: Gloves (as well as mask and goggles if splatter or aerosol is created) Exposure Control Plan - 23 - 3. Room Sterilization Surfaces: Surfaces wher e cross contamination could have occurred Frequency: Disinfect immediately following procedure if surfaces could have become contaminated. Disinfect at the end of each work shift. Disinfectant: When cleaning and disinfecting contaminated surfaces, use an EPA registered tuberculocidal surface disinfectant or cleaner. PPE used: Gloves (as well as mask and goggles if splatter or aerosol is created) 4. Room /Other : All areas Surface: Waste containers, horizontal surfaces, drawers wi th instruments, and floors Frequency Daily as appropriate Disinfectant: EPA registered tuberculocidal surface disinfectant on all areas that could have become contaminated with blood or body fluids, or in all other cases a low -level cleaner/dis infectant may be used for cleaning soiled surfaces. PPE used: Gloves (mask if aerosol or splatter is created) 5. Room /Other : Entire facility Surface: Vacuum floors, dust surfaces, clean rest rooms Frequency Daily as appropriate Disinfectant: Cleaners and low -level disinfectants PPE used: Gloves (mask and gown if splatter may occur) Thorough cleaning (all surfaces, including vertical surfaces) will be performed in exam rooms, labs, procedure rooms and other areas at an appr opriate freque ncy (e.g., monthly at a minimum ). If vertical surfaces become soiled, cleaning shall occur as soon as feasible. Blood or OPIM Spill Cleanup Spill clean -up kit will consist of absorbent, dustpan and broom/scoop (for this use only), PPE, and plastic bag. Blood or OPIM spills are to be cleaned up immediately or as soon as feasible: Determine what PPE is to be used, depending on size and location of spill (gloves, mask and eyewear recommended.) If fluid spill only on hard surface, place paper towels or absorbent over the spill to absorb fluid. If a large spill, or if spill contains broken glass, place absorbent only over spill to absorb, and sweep into dustpan. Never pick up glass with your hands. If dried spill, soak with disinfectant first. Place paper towels (or material in dustpan) into a red bag. Broken glass will be placed into sharps container using tongs or dustpan. Spray contaminated surface with EPA registe red tuberculocidal disinfectant or cleaner and wipe with clean paper towel in o rder to clean. This may need to be repeated. Spray again with the disinfectant and let sit according to manufacturer's instructions in order to disinfect. Be sure to block off the area to reduce potential of slips and falls. Exposure Control Plan - 24 - If spill is on carpeting , sprinkle with disinfecting absorbent, allow to absorb, then sweep or scoop it up. Clean area with appropriate cleaner using gloves and any other PPE determined necessary. Never vacuum area until the absorbent has been cleaned up and the carpet cleaned. Dispose of red bag immediately in medical waste receptacle. Dispose of PPE in trash or medical waste receptacle if determined to be regulated waste. Review procedures to determine the cause of this spill and if changes in policy and procedure need to be m ade. Blood and OPIM spill kits are located in all labs, research and procedure areas. Contact the University Police and Safety Office for information on spill kits. Laundry Contaminated laundry (if contaminated with blood or OPIM) shall include: o Reusab le PPE o Reusable coverings such as towels, Lab coats, etc. contaminated with blood or OPIM o Any employee clothing or uniform contaminated with blood or OPIM Contaminated laundry shall not be : o Sorted or rinsed at the location of use o Taken home for laundering by employees Contaminated laundry shall be: o Handled as little as possible and with a minimum of agitation o Bagged or containerized at the location where it was used o Placed in plastic bags if there is a chance of soaking or leaking through the bag o Handled with a minimum PPE of gloves o Placed and transported in red bags or biohazard labeled containers unless : NDSU treats all laundry universally (as if all contaminated). In this case, an alternative colored bag may be used, such as blue or yellow, as long a s all employees are aware that the blue or yellow bags hold contaminated laundry The laundry facility where the laundry is being sent for cleaning treats all laundry universa lly (as if all contaminated). If this is the case, this facility's laundry m ay be sent to the launderer in the laundry's provided bag or the altern ative colored bag used by this facility Handling of contaminated laundry will be as follows: Soiled (simply dirty) laundry is segregated from laundry contaminated with blood or OPIM Or All laundry is treated with universal precautions (as if all contaminated) Laundry items should be containerized appropriately using these examples as guides: Lab coats, scrub jackets, patient drape, towels, bedding and other laundry that has been conta minated with blood or OPIM shall be placed into a red bag located in the storage room closet. Items NOT contaminated, but simply soiled shall be placed in a separate laundry bag for washing separate from any contaminated laundry. Exposure Control Plan - 25 - If contaminated items are laundered on -site, they shall be cleaned in the following manner: (BSA, Wellness Center, etc.) o Use gloves and gown (additional PPE if determined necessary) o Wash at 160 degrees Fahrenheit (hot) o Use bleach if uncertain of the temperature o Dry at 212 degrees F ahrenheit (hot) o Discard any blood or OPIM -contaminated plastic bag s o Laundry is to be handled only by trained employees Since lab jackets/coats can harbor a variety of contaminates, they should be changed daily to prevent cross -contamination. If emp loyee, faculty, student or patient clothing or other items that cannot be discarded become contaminated with blood or OPIM, they will be removed, taking care not to contaminate skin, hair, etc. They will be laundered as contaminated (see above) or contain erized in red or alternative colored bag and sent to laundry or dry cleaners at no charge to employee or patient. Sterilization and Disinfection Sterilization and disinfection procedures used are taken from the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines . Surface Disinfection The cleaning and disinfection of contaminated work surfaces after completion of procedures is required to ensure that individuals are not unwittingly exposed to blood or OP IM remaining on a surface. Appropriate disinfectants to be used on work surfaces include a diluted bleach solution (1:10 bleach to water mixed daily and stored in plastic containers) and EPA -registered tuberculocidal surface disinfectants. The U.S. Envir onmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has created a list of registered disinfectants . List B or E would be appropriate surface disinfectants to use for blood or OP IM disinfection. If the agent is to be used to both clean and disinfect, contact the company to determine if the disinfectant is also marketed as a cleaner. Instrument Sterilization and Disinfection Reprocessing Definitions Critical Items : Instruments or devices that enter into the body or contact blood or broken skin. These items must be sterilized. Semi -Critical Items : Instruments or devices that may touch mucous membranes but do not penetrate tissue or contact blood or broken skin. These items should be sterilized if at all possible, but at a minimum soaked in a high level disinfectant. Non- Critical Items : Devices, such as a blood pressure cuff, which only touch intact skin, may be disinfected with a low or intermediate level disinfectant. Sterilization : Sterilization is the destruction of all microbial forms. It should be used for all critical items and all semi- critical items when possible. (Scopes and other sensitive equipment should be disinfected according to the manufacturer's instructions.) Heat sterilization such as a utoclave, flash sterilizer, gas or dry heat is the preferred method of sterilization . Exposure Control Plan - 26 - Chemical sterilization (i.e., glutaraldehyde) will sterilize after hours of submersion , but instruments cannot retain their sterility, so it is not appropriate for critical items. Disinfection: The destruction of some but not all forms High -level (destruction of all organisms except spores ) chemical disinfection with chemical sterilant (glutaraldehyde) usually 20 minutes submerged. Used for semi -critical items that cannot be sterilized. NOT TO BE USED FOR CRITICAL ITEMS. Glutaraldehyde should not be used as a surface disinfectant due to the release of vapors that could be a respiratory hazard. Intermediate -level (destruction of most lipo phylic, many hydrophylic viruses and many bacteria.) This is used for surface disinfection Low-level (does not affect many organisms.) Used for non- critical cleaning such as blood pressure cuffs, floors and trash cans. This is included in many instrument pre -soaks. One-time-use disposable items should be used if critical items cannot be heat sterilized and monitored to confirm sterility. Instrument Reprocessing Procedure Instruments shall be sterilized after each use. Instruments will be cleaned and s terilized or disinfected according to manufacturer's recommendations by autoclave, chemical sterilization, or other proven method of instrument sterilization. Instruments may need to be processed using anti - rust solution. Instrument Transport Place inst ruments into reusable container/cassette in exam room after use Gloved individuals shall carry instruments/devices in reusable container to sterilization area Place in a holding solution (soapy water) if not cleaned immediately Instrument Cleaning Note: Use of an ultrasonic cleaning unit is recommended for cleaning of instruments due to the reduced possibility of splash and sharp instrument injury. If cleaning instruments by hand: Don utility gloves, mask/shield, and gown and scr ub instruments to remove debris Rinse instruments with water. Do not reach into holding container by hand as visibility may be limited and a cut injury may occur. Once rinsed, dump instruments out on toweled surface to dry Pat or allow to air dry If reusable, transport containe r shall be disinfected with an intermediate level disinfectant to prevent cross contamination when placed on counters, etc. Instrument sterilization or disinfection after cleaning Heat sterilization: o Lubricate instruments as needed (bag and date if criti cal instruments) o Place into sterilizer for appropriate treatment time Exposure Control Plan - 27 - Chemical sterilization: o Keep lid on containers when not in use o Place devices (items that cannot be heat sterilized) into chemical sterilant solution , and follow manufacturer's directions for instrument sterilization. Note: High level chemical disinfection is usually between 10- 20 minutes. Sterilization usually takes between 8 -10 hours. o Note time instruments were placed into solution o Each time additional contaminated instruments are adde d to the solution, ALL instruments start the treatment process -time over. o Remove, rinse with water, and place on a non- contaminated surface. Dry and place into clean containers or drawers. Sterilization Efficacy Testing Monitoring to assure efficacy of s terilization devices (i.e., autoclave) is required by many states and agencies . Biological monitors contain non- pathogenic bacterial spores. Sterility is defined as the destruction of all life, including bacterial spores. Therefor e, to assure sterility of instruments, the bacterial spores within the monitor must be killed. Recommended procedures for efficacy testing: Biological monitoring (spore testing) of autoclave will be completed weekly or as monitoring service recommends. A log will be maintaine d documenting monitoring . Spore testing is performed as recommended by the CDC as well as sterilization device manufacturer and monitoring service Spore testing log will be maintained by the user. If a heat sterilization unit (i.e., autoclave) is unavaila ble, glutaraldehyde or other chemical sterilants may be used for other -than-critical instrument sterilization. These chemicals should be monitored as to the activity of the chemical. Always use appropriate monitors for the specific chemical sterilant being used, and according to manufacturer's directions. T his testing does not prove sterility, it only documents that the chemical was active at the time of testing. Note: once instruments are placed into sterilant, other instruments shall not be added unti l previous instruments are sterilized. Adding additional instruments starts the sterilization process over for all instruments. Chemical monitoring of chemical sterilants should be completed weekly or as monitoring product manufacturer recommends. A log will be maintained documenting monitoring . Chemical monitoring is performed by the user Chemical monitoring log is maintained by the user Faculty, Staff and Students will be trained in the use of all disinfectants and sterilants used in their departmen t. All monitoring documentation should be maintained for no less than 5 years. REGULATED WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OSHA defines regulated waste (commonly called medical waste) as: Liquid or semi -liquid blood, or other potentially infectious materials (OPI M) Contaminated items that would release blood , or OPIM in a liquid or semi -liquid state if compressed Exposure Control Plan - 28 - Items that are caked with dried blood, or OPIM and are capable of releasing these materials during handling Contaminated sharps Pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or OPIM One of the most confusing topics with which facilities deal is regulated waste. The amount of contamination is the key. Some facilities feel more comfortable disposing of all items that have been merely contaminat ed with blood or OPIM, no matter what the amount. OSHA and state and local statutes do not require this. The definition above is the minimum to follow. Note : Faculty, Staff and Students must handle items contaminated with ANY amount of blood or OPIM us ing Universal Precautions; the definition of regulated waste refers to how much blood or OPIM that item contains in order to decide if it should be discarded in the regular plastic -lined trash container, or the red -bag lined regulated waste container. Types of Regulated Waste Sharps Waste Please refer to \"Engineering and Work Practice Controls\" in this plan for the proper handling of contaminated sharps and sharps container criteria, transport, and usage. Always place the sharps container into a secondary container if leakage is possible. This container shall meet the same criteria as the original container. Other Regulated Waste Other regulated waste (\"soft waste\" such as blood soaked gauze) must be placed in containers, which are: o Closable o Constructed to contain all contents and prevent leakage of fluids during handling, storage, transport or shipping o Appropriate in size for devices placed in them o Designed with a visible opening, below eye level, if wall -mounted o Designed with an unobstructed opening that allows devices to drop in easily o Labeled with a biohazard label or color coded red o Closed prior to removal o Placed into a secondary container that meets the same criteria as the primary container, if outside contamination of the primary container occurs Disposal of all regulated waste shall be in accordance with applicable regulations of the United States, States and Territories, and political subdivisions of States and Territories. As this statement addresses, federal regulations may be different from each state's regulations for the packaging, transport, and treatment of medical waste. For this reason, NDSU has researched the proper regulations concerning medical waste for this state and currently abides by those regulations. Exposure Control Plan - 29 - Waste Containment, Tr ansport and Treatment Only trained employees, utilizing Universal Precautions, will contain regulated medical waste. Waste manifest documenting waste transport shall only be signed by employees trained as to determine if the regulated waste container has been properly contained and labeled. Regulated waste is contained, transported, and treated in the following manner: Sharps Containers o Removal Frequency When \u00be full, the lid shall be securely closed in order to ready the container for removal and transport to the treatment facility. New sharps containers will be delivered at the time of waste pickup. o Documentation A four -part form is used. The original remains with the generating department. The second copy is retained by the UP&SO. The third copy is h eld by the incinerating department and the fourth is returned to the UP&SO office following the incineration of the waste. Red bag -lined containers o Removal Frequency When \u00be full, the waste shall be removed and transported for disinfection of incineration . o Documentation Disinfection by immediately transferring the waste to autoclave facilities within the laboratory buildings is processed by the individual departments without UP&SO involvement. For items needing incineration, a four -part form is used. The original remains with the generating department. The second copy is retained by the UP&SO. The third copy is held by the incinerating department and the fourth is returned to the UP&SO office following the incineration of the waste. Manifests, waste use evaluation, and procedure performance shall be evaluated annually. Management of the regulated waste program including maintenance of the documentation for NDSU is coordinated by the University Police and Safety Office. Proof of regulated waste destr uction shall be filed and maintained for a minimum of 3 years or time required by state and local jurisdictions. Documentation of medical waste destruction shall be maintained for the time required by state and local regulations, and at a minimum of 3 yea rs. Documentation returned by the treatment facility documenting the proper destruction of NDSU's regulated waste is maintained at the University Police and Safety Office. The medical waste disposal service used by NDSU is through NDSU incineration. Regulated Waste Labeling for Transport Under normal procedures, no regulated biohazardous waste leaves the campus. This information is to be used for special case purposes only. Exposure Control Plan - 30 - Prior to transport from this facility it is typically required from state env ironmental agencies that the waste container be labeled. The generator (NDSU) has a \"cradle to grave\" liability for the waste leaving this facility; it is therefore crucial that correct handling and labeling of waste be performed to protect employees, the public and the environment. Labeling should typically consist of \u00bd inch high letters written in indelible ink and including: Name and address of the generator (this facility) and Identification number (waste transporter account number) or Date of ship ment. HEPATITIS B VACCINATION The hepatitis B vaccine is administered according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines \" Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis \" (MMWR, vo l. 50, no. RR -11, June 29, 2001. HBV Vaccine This plan has already discussed that Hepatitis B virus is a very resistant and virulent virus, and is much easier to transmit than HIV. Hepatitis B is a very serious disease. The good news is that it can be prevented. There is a vaccine that is 97% effective against the virus. It comes in a series of three injections It is synthetic, so you can't get a disease from it There are very few medical contraindications (the healthcare professional will evaluate each person prior to injection). NDSU strongly advises the acceptance of this vaccine if advised by the healthcare professional. Hepatitis B Vaccine Availability NDSU makes the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series available: To all Faculty and Staff who have occupational exposure to blood or OPIM At no cost to the employee. (Departmental responsibility) o no out of pocket expe nses to the employee o no use of employee or employee's spouse's insurance o no employee reimbursement program is allowed o no amortization contract requiring repayment of cost is allowed o no waiver of liability with respect to acceptance is allowed To employees at a reasonable time and place Performed by or under the supervision of a licensed physician or by or under the supervision of another licensed healthcare professional who will provide a written opinion (each state's licensing facility w ill determine which healthcare professionals in the respective state are allowed to perform this task.) A Healthcare Professional's Written Opinion for HBV Vaccination is attached to this program . Provided according to recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service (boos ters if they are advised in the future.)* Shall ensure that all laboratory tests are conducted by an accredited laboratory at no cost to the employee. Exposure Control Plan - 31 - To the employee after required training and within 10 working days of assignment to exposure potential tasks. *Based upon the recommendations made by the U.S. Public Health Service/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1998, OSHA requires that a titer be offered and measured on each employee 1 -2 months following the last injection of the 3- injection series. If the antibody level is too low or not detectable, the series will be repeated or recommendations of the healthcare professional will be followed. Administration of this titer follows the same criteria as the HBV vaccination series listed above. If antibody testing following the second vaccination series given to the employee shows lack of conversion, the employee will be referred to an infectious diseases specialist to determine the reason for non -conversion. If the schedule of HBV v accinations has been interrupted, the entire course does not need to be restarted. If the vaccination series is interrupted after the first dose, the second and third doses should be given separated by an interval of 3 -5 months. Persons who are late for the third dose should be given this dose when convenient. If a new employee does not have proof of previous administration of the series followed by a titer, a titer will be run to document proof of conversion if it has been less than 6 months since the series was given. It is not recommended by the CDC at this time to test antibody on employees who have had the vaccination series previous to the recommended post -vaccine testing period. It is not recommended by the CDC at this time to give routine boo ster injections. Vaccine is not required of employees with potential for exposure if: Previously received complete hepatitis B vaccination (NDSU will need documentation of vaccine or signed statement as part of the employee's medical record; must also sig n HBV declination) Antibody testing reveals the employee is immune Medical reasons show contraindication to the vaccine. Contraindications include: o Allergy to yeast or other ingredients o Auto immune disease o Fever The healthcare professional (HCP) will: o Be sent a copy of the OSHA bloodborne pathogen standard by NDSU o Establish a medical record and discuss contraindications and immunity o Vaccinate employee (or discuss contraindications and immunity) o Start post -exposure prophylaxis (if giving HBV vaccine post -exposure) as may be indicated by type of exposure and status of source individual o Return a written opinion (vaccine indicated and received), a copy of which NDSU will provide the employee NDSU will not make participation in a prescreening program, testing f or HBV, a prerequisite for receiving the hepatitis B vaccination. If the employee initially declines the vaccine, but at a later date while still employed with bloodborne exposure, decides to accept it, the vaccine will be provided at that time. Exposure Control Plan - 32 - Any employ ee who consents or declines the hepatitis B vaccine must sign the consent or declination form. This declination is not to have any changes made to the way it is written, including additions or deletions that may change the intent of the document.
