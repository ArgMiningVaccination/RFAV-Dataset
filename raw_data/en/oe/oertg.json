The following is the translated version of the full text of his speec h. Speec h by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China At the Welcoming Dinner Hosted by Local Governments And Friendly Organizations in the United States Seattle , 22 September 2015 Dr. Henr y Kissing er, Governor Jay Inslee of the State of Washington, Secretar y of Commerce Penny Pritzk er, Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle , Chairw oman Carla Hills of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations ,Chair man Mark Fields of the U.S.-China Business Council, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends , Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Dr. Kissing er, for your kind introduction. Dr. Kissinger has always been able to come up with some new observations. His introduction has really given me a new perspecti ve to look at myself. It is great to be among so many friends , old and new, in the State of Washington and the City of Seattle , President Xi Jinping Visits U .S., Attends Summits th Marking 70 Anniv ersar y of the UN XI JINPING'S SPEECH ON CHINA-U.S. RELATIONS IN SEATTLE 5 News Fr om China October 2015President Xi Jinping V isits U.S. the first leg of my state visit to the United States . Let me begin by extending to you and, through you, to all the American people , my cordial greetings and best wishes . I am no str anger to the St ate of Washington and the City of Seattle . Known as the Evergreen State and the Emerald City , here y ou ha ve got the majestic Mt. Rainier and the charming Lake Washington. The film Sleepless in Seattle has made the city almost a household name in China. Besides , Washington is the leading state in U.S. expor t to China and China the number one trading partner of the Port of Seattle . Washington and Seattle have become an impor tant symbol of the friendship between Chinese and American people and the win-win cooperation between the two countries . As a Chinese saying goes, the fire burns high when everyone brings wood to it. It is the loving care and hard work of the national governments, local authorities, friendly organizations and people from all walks of life in both countries that have made China-U .S. relations flourish. In particular , the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations , the U.S.-China Business Council, the U.S.-China Policy Foundation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA, the Committee of 100, the China Institute , the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society, the Brookings Institution and many other friendly groups and individuals have made untiring effor ts over the years to promote friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries and brought the relationship to this far. Let me pay high tribute and express my heartfelt gratitude to all the local governments , social organizations , universities , think tanks and people from all sectors of society who have dedicated themselv es to the cause of China-U .S. friendship . Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends , Since the founding of the People's Republic , especially since the beginning of reform and opening-up , China has set out on an extraordinary journey, and the Chinese of my generation have had some first-hand experience . Towards the end of the 1960s when I was in my teens , I was sent from Beijing to work as a farmer in a small villag e of Liangjiahe near Yan'an of Shaanxi Province , where I spent seven years . At that time, the villag ers and I lived in \"earth cav es\" and slept on \"earth beds\". Life was very hard. There was no meat in our diet for months . I knew what the villag ers wanted the most. Later I became the villag e's party secretar y and began to lead the villag ers m production. I understood their needs . One thing I wished most at the time was to make it possible for the villag ers to have meat and have it often. But it was very difficult for such a wish to come true in those years . At the Spring Festival early this year, I retur ned to the villag e. I saw blacktop roads . Now living in houses with bricks and tiles, the villag ers had Inter net access . Elderly folks had basic old-ag e care and all villag ers had medical care coverage. Children were in school. Of course , meat was readily available . This made me keenly aware that the Chinese dream is after all a dream of the people . We can fulfill the Chinese dream only when we link it with our people's yearning for a better life. What has happened in Liangjiahe is but a microcosm of the progress China has made through refor m and opening-up . In a little more than three decades , we have turned China into the world's second largest econom y, lifted l.3 billion people from a life of chronic shortage and brought them initial prosperity and unprecedented rights and dignity . This is not only a great chang e in the lives of the Chinese people , but also a huge step forward in human civilization and China's major contribution to world peace and development. At the same time, we are soberly aware that China is still the world's largest developing countr y. Our per capita GDP is only two thirds that of the global average and one seventh that of the United States , ranking around 80th in the world. By China's own standard, we still have over 70 million people living under the poverty line. If measured by the World Bank standard, the number would be more than 200 million. Over 70 million citizens live on basic living allowances , and the number of people with disabilities exceeds 85 million. During the past two years , I have been to many poor areas in China and visited many poor families . I wouldn't forget the look in their eyes longing for a decent, happy life. I know that we must work still harder before all our people can live a better life. That explains why development remains China's top priority . To any one charged with the governance of China, their primar y mission is to focus all the resources on improving people's living standard and gradually achieve common prosperity . To this end, we have proposed the two centenar y goals, i.e. to double the 2010 GDP and per capita income of the Chinese and complete the building of a moderately prosperous society by 2020 and to build a prosperous , strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious moder n socialist countr y and realize the great renew al of the Chinese nation by the middle of the centur y. Whatev er we News Fr om China October 2015 5President Xi Jinping V isits U.S. do now is aimed at fulfilling these goals. To succeed in completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects , we must comprehensively deepen reform, advance law-based governance , and apply strict party discipline . That is what our proposed four-prong ed strateg y is all about. Since you are all interested in such issues as the direction of China's development and China's policy orientation, let me take this oppor tunity to share with you some of my thoughts in this regard. -- China's econom y will stay on a steady course with fairly fast growth. The Chinese economy is still operating within a proper range. It grew by 7 percent in the first half of the year, and this growth rate remains one of the highest in the world. This has not come by easily given the complex and volatile situation in the world econom y. At present, all economies are facing difficulties , and our econom y is also under downward pressure . But this is only a problem in the course of progress. We will take coordinated steps to achieve stable growth, deepen refor m, adjust structure , improve livelihood and prevent risks, while strengthening and innovating macro regulation to keep the growth at a medium-high speed. Currently , China is contin uing to move forward its new type of industrialization, digitalization, urbanization and agricultural moder nization. China has a high savings rate, a huge consumption potential, a hard-working population and a rising propor tion of middle-income people. This creates an enormous space for the services sector and offers a big mark et with great potential. China will focus more on impro ving the quality and efficiency of economic growth and accelerating the shift of growth model and adjustment in economic structure . We will lay greater emphasis on innovation and consumption-dri ven growth. In this way, we will solve the problem of unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable development and enable the Chinese econom y to successfully transfor m itself and maintain strong momentum of growth. Recent abnormal ups and downs in China's stock mark et has caused wide concer n. Stock prices fluctuate in accordance with their inherent laws. And it is the duty of the government to ensure an open, fair and just mark et order and prevent massive panic from happening . This time, the Chinese government took steps to stabilize the mark et and contain panic in the stock mark et and thus avoided a systemic risk. Mature mark ets of various countries have tried similar approaches. Now, China's stock mark et has reached the phase of self-reco very and self-adjustment. On 11 August, China moved to impro ve its RMB central parity quotation mechanism, giving the mark et a greater role in deter mining the exchang e rate. Our effor ts have achieved initial success in correcting the exchang e rate deviation. Given the economic and financial situation at home and abroad, there is no basis for contin uous depreciation of the RMB . We will stick to the purpose of our refor m to have the exchang e rate decided by market supply and demand and allow the RMB to float both ways. We are against competitive depreciation or a currency war. We will not lower the RMB exchang e rate to stimulate export. To develop the capital mark et and impro ve the mark et- based pricing mechanism of the RMB exchang e rate is the direction of our refor m. This will not be chang ed by the recent fluctuation in the stock mark et or the foreign exchang e mark et. -- The key to China's development lies in refor m. Our refor m is aimed at moder nizing the countr y's governance system and governance capabilities , so that the mark et can play a decisi ve role in the allocation of resources, the government can play a better role and there is faster progress in building the socialist market economy, democracy, advanced culture , harmonious society and sound environment. At the third Plenar y Session of the 18th Party Central Committee in 2013, we decided on an overarc hing plan for 6 News Fr om China October 2015President Xi Jinping V isits U.S. deepening refor m featuring over 330 measures . In 2014, 80 major refor m items were by and large completed. In the first half of this year, we rolled out over 70 key refor m programs, with their effects gradually becoming evident. When it comes to the toughest refor ms, only those with courag e will carry the day. We have the resolv e and the guts to press ahead and take refor m forward. We will stick to the direction of mark et econom y refor m and contin ue to introduce bold and result-oriented refor m measures concer ning the market, taxation, finance, investment and financing, pricing, opening-up and people's livelihood. -- China will never close its open door to the outside world. Opening- up is a basic state policy of China. Its policies of attracting foreign investment will not chang e, nor will its pledg e to protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in China and impro ve its services for foreign companies operating in China. We respect the international business norms and practices of non-discrimination, obser ve the WHO principle of national treatment, treat all mark et players including foreign-in vested companies fairly, and encourag e transnational corporations to engage in all forms of cooperation with Chinese companies . We will address legitimate concerns of foreign investors in a timely fashion, protect their lawful rights and interests and work hard to provide an open and transparent legal and policy environme nt, an efficien t administrati ve environment and a level playing field in the mark et, with effecti ve ID protection in particular , so as to broaden the space of cooperation between China and the United States and other countries . -- China will follow the basic strateg y of the rule of law in governance. \"Law is the very foundation of governance .\" We will coordinate our effor ts to promote the rule of law in governance and administration, put the building of the countr y, the government and society on the solid basis of the rule of law, build greater trust in the judici al system and ensure that human rights are respected and effecti vely upheld. China will give fair treatment to foreign institutions and foreign companies in the countr y's legislati ve, executive and judicial practices . We are ready to discuss rule-of-la w issues with the U.S. side in the spirit of mutual learning for common progress. China is a staunc h defender of cybersecurity . It is also a victim of hacking. The Chinese government will not, in whatev er form, engage in commercial theft or encourag e or suppor t such attempts by anyone. Both commercial cyber theft and hacking against government networks are crimes that must be punished in accordance with law and relevant international treaties . The international comm unity should, on the basis of mutual respect and mutual tr ust, w ork together to build a peaceful, secure, open and cooperati ve cubers . China is ready to set up a high level joint dialogue mechanism with the United States on fighting cybercrime . China recognizes the positi ve role played by foreign non-profit organizations (NPO). So long as their activities are beneficial to the Chinese people , we will not restrict or prohibit their operations but will protect their operations through legislation and protect their legitimate rights and interests . On their part, foreign NPOs in China need to obey Chinese law and carry out activities in accordance with law. -- China will contin ue fighting corruption. As I once said, one has to be very strong if he wants to strike the iron. The blacksmith referred to here is the Chinese Comm unist Party. The fundamental aim of the Party is to serve the people heart and soul. The Party now has over 87 million members , and unavoidably it has problems of one kind or another . If we let these problems go unchecked, we will risk losing the trust and suppor t of the people . That is why we demand strict enforcement of party discipline as the top priority of governance . In our vigorous campaign against corruption, we have punished both \"tigers\" and \"flies\", corrupt officials irrespecti ve of ranking, in response to our people's demand. This has nothing to do with power struggle. It's nothing like what you see in House of Cards . China is ready to cooperate closely with international comm unity in fighting corruption and tracking down fugiti ves. The Chinese people look to the U.S. for suppor t and coordination so that corrupt elements will be denied an overseas \"safe haven\". -- China will keep to the path of peaceful dev elopment. W e hav e just commemorated the 70th anniversar y of the victor y of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. An impor tant lesson histor y teaches us is that peaceful development is the right path, while any attempt to seek domination or hegemony through force is against the historical tide and doomed to failure . The Chinese recognized as early as 2,000 years ago that \"though a countr y is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin.\" China's defense policy is defensi ve in nature and its militar y strateg y features active defense . Let me reiterate here that no matter how developed it could become , China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion. To demonstrate our commitment to peaceful development, I announced not long ago that the size of China's militar y will be cut by 300,000. China is ready to work with other countries to build a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation at its core, News Fr om China October 2015 7President Xi Jinping V isits U.S. replacing confrontation and domination with win-win cooperation, and adopting a new thinking of building partnerships , so as to jointly open up a new vista of common development and shared security . As far as the existing international system is concer ned, China has been a participant, builder and contributor . We stand firmly for the international order and system that is based on the purposes and principles of the UN Char ter. A great number of countries, especially developing countries, want to see a more just and equitable international system, but it doesn't mean they want to unravel the entire system or start all over again. Rather , what they want is to refor m and impro ve the system to keep up with the times . This would serve the common interests of all countries and mankind as a whole . China has benefited from the international community in development, and China in tur n has made its contribution to global development. Our \"Belt and Road\" initiati ve, our establishment of the Silk Road Fund and our proposal to set up the Asian Infrastr ucture Investment Bank (AIIB) are all aimed at helping the common development of all countries rather than seeking some kind of spheres of political influence . The \"Belt and Road\" initiative is open and inclusi ve. We welcome participation of the U.S. and other countries and international organizations . We have vigorously promoted economic integ ration in the Asia Pacific and the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific in particular , because we want to facilitate the shaping of a free, open, convenient and dynamic space for development in the Asia Pacific . We call for an outlook of common, comprehensive, cooperati ve and sustainable security , because we want to work with other countries in the region and the rest of the international comm unity to maintain peace and security in the Asia Pacific . Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends , In our Sunnylands meeting in 2013, President Obama and I reached the impor tant agreement to jointly build a new model of major - countr y relationship between the two countries . This was a major , strategic choice we made together on the basis of historical experience , our respecti ve national conditions and the prevailing trend of the world. Over the past two years and more , the two sides have acted in accordance with the agreement, steadily moved forward bilateral coordination and cooperation in various fields and made impor tant progress. We worked hand in hand to cope with the aftermath of the international financial crisis and promoted global economic recovery. We deepened pragmatic exchang es and cooperation in all fields which brought about tangible benefits to the two peoples . Last year, bilateral trade, two-way investment stock and total number of personnel exchang es all hit a record high. We maintained close comm unication and coordination on such international and regional hotspot issues as the Iranian nuclear issue, the Korean nuclear issue, South Sudan, Afghanistan, the Middle East as well as such global issues as fighting against Ebola and countering terrorism. As an old Chinese saying goes, \"Peaches and plums do not talk, yet a path is formed beneath them.\" These worthy fruits of cooperation across the P acific Ocean speaks eloquently to the vitality and potential of China-U .S. relations . This leads to the question: what shall we do to advance the new model of major countr y relationship between China and the U.S. from a new starting point and how can we work together to promote world peace and development? The answ er, in m y view , is to stic k to the right direction of such a new model of relationship and make gradual yet solid progress. An ancient Chinese said, \"A decision can be properly made after taking into account the past, the future and the normal practices .\" A number of things are particularly important for our effor ts. First, w e must read eac h other's strategic intentions correctly. Building a new model of major - countr y relationship with the United States that features non-conf lict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation is the priority of China's foreign policy . We want to deepen mutual understanding with the U.S. on each other's strategic orientation and development path. We want to see more understanding and trust, less estrangement and suspicion, in order to forestall misunderstanding and miscalculation. We should strictly base our judgment on facts, lest we become victims to hearsa y, paranoid or self-imposed bias. There is no such thing as the so-called Thucydides trap in the world. But should major countries time and again make the mistak es of strategic miscalculation, they might create such traps for themselv es. Second, we must firmly advance win-win cooperation. Cooperation is the only right choice to bring about benefits. But cooperation requires mutual accommodation of each other's interests and concer ns and the quest of the greatest comm on ground of conv erging interests . If China and the United States coop erate well, they can become a bedroc k of global stability and a booster of world peace . 8 News Fr om China October 2015President Xi Jinping V isits U.S. Should they enter into conflict or confronta tion, it would lead to disaster for both countries and the world at large. The areas where we should, and can, cooperate are very broad. For instance , we should help improve the global governance mechanism and work together to promote a sustained growth of world economy and maintain stability in the global financial mark et. We should conclude as soon as possible a balanced and high- quality bilateral investment treaty (BIT), deepen the building of a new type of mil-to-mil relations between the two countries , expand pragmatic cooperation on clean energ y and environmental protection, strengthen exchanges on law enforcement, anti-corruption, health and local affairs and tap the cooperation potential in infrastructural development. We should deepen comm unication and cooperation at the United Nations , APEC , G20 and other multilateral mechanisms as well as on major international and regional issues and global challeng es, so as to make a bigger contribution to world peace , stability and prosperity . Third, we must manag e our differences properly and effecti vely. As a Chinese saying goes, \"The sun and the moon shine in different ways, yet their brightness is just right for the day and the night respecti vely.\" It is precisely because of so many differences that the world has become such a diverse and colorful place , and that the need to broaden common ground and iron out differences has become so impor tant. A perfectly pure world is non-existent since disagreem ents are a reality people have to live with. China and the United States do not see eye to eye on every issue, and it is unavoidable that we may have different positions on some of the issues . What matters is how to manag e the differences . And what matters most is that the two sides should respect each other , seek common ground while reser ving differences, take a constructive approac h to enhance understanding and expand consensus and spare no effor t to turn differences into areas of cooperation. Fourth, we must foster friendly sentiments among our peoples. People-to-people relations under pin state-to-state relations. Though geographically far apart, our peoples boast a long histor y of friendly exchang es. Some 230 years ago, Empress of China, a U.S. merc hant ship, sailed across vast oceans to the shores of China. Some 150 years ago, tens of thousands of Chinese workers joined their American counter parts in building the trans- continental Pacific Railw ay. Some 70 years ago, China and the United States , as allies in World War II, fought shoulder to shoulder , to defend world peace and justice . In that war, thousands of American soldiers laid down their precious lives for the just cause of the Chinese people . We will never forget the moral support and invaluable assistance the American people gave to our just resistance against aggression and our struggle for freedom and independence . The Chinese people have always held American entrepreneurship and creati vity in high reg ards. In my young er years , I read the Federalist Papers and Thomas Paine's Common Sense . I was interested in the life story and thinking of Georg e Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and other American statesmen. I also read works of Henr y David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain and Jack London. I was most captivated by Ernest Hemingw ay's The Old Man and the Sea and its descriptions of howling wind, driving rain, roaring waves, small boat, the old man and sharks . So when I visited Cuba for the first time, I paid a special visit to the breakw ater in Cojimar where Hemingw ay wrote the book. And in my second visit of Cuba, I dropped by the bar Hemingw ay frequented and ordered a mojito , his favorite rum with mint leaves and ice. I just wanted to feel for myself what was on his mind and what the place was like as he wrote those stories . I believ e that it is always impor tant to make an effor t to get a deep understanding of the cultures and civilizations that are different from our own. The Chinese character Ren or people is in a shape of two strok es supporting each other. The foundation of China-U .S. friendship has its roots in the people , and its future rests with the youth. I wish to announce here that China suppor ts the initiati ve of sending a total of 50,000 Chinese and American students to study in each other's countries over the next three years . China and the U.S. will launc h a China-U .S. Year of Tourism in 2016. China on its part will create more favorable conditions for closer people-to-people exchang es. Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends , Dr. Kissing er wrote in his book World Order and I quote , that \"each generation will be judged by whether the greatest, most consequential issues of the human condition hav e been faced.\" And Martin Luther King said, \"The time is always right to do the right thing .\" Today, we have come once again to a historical juncture . Let us work together to bring about an even better future for China-U .S. relations and make an even greater contribution to the happiness of our two peoples and the well-being of the people the world over. Thank you. News Fr om China October 2015 9President Xi Jinping V isits U.S. Mr. President, Dear Colleagues , Seventy years ago, the earlier generation of mankind fought heroically and secured the victor y of the World Anti-F ascist War, closing a dark page in the annals of human histor y. That victor y was hard won. Seventy years ago, the earlier generation of mankind, with vision and foresight, established the United Nations . This universal and most representative and authoritative international organization has carried mankind' s hope for a new future and ushered in a new era of cooperation. It was a pioneering WORKING T OGETHER TO F ORGE A NEW P ARTNERSHIP OF WIN-WIN COOPERATION AND CREATE A COMMUNITY OF SHARED F UTURE FOR MANKIND Statement b y H.E. Xi Jinping, President of the P eople' s Republic of China, at the General Debate of the 70th Session of the UN General Assembl y, New York, 28 September 2015 12 News Fr om China October 2015President Xi Jinping V isits U.S. initiati ve never under taken before . Seventy years ago, the earlier generation of mankind pooled together their wisdom and adopted the Charter of the United Nations, laying the cornerstone of the contemporary international order, and establishing the fundamental principles of contemporary international relations. This was an achievement of profound impact. Mr. President, Dear Colleagues , On the third of September , the Chinese people , together with the world\u00a1\u00afs people, solemnly commemorated the 70th anniversar y of the victor y of the Chinese People' s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-F ascist War. As the main theater in the East, China made a national sacrifice of over 35 million casualties in its fight against the majority troops of Japanese militarism. It not only saved itself and its people from subjug ation, but also gave strong suppor t to the forces against aggression in the European and Pacific theaters , thus making a historic contribution to the victor y of the World Anti-F ascist War. Histor y is a mirror. Only by drawing lessons from histor y can the world avoid repeating past calamity . We should view histor y with awe and human conscience . The past cannot be chang ed, but the future can be shaped. Bearing histor y in mind is not to perpetuate hatred. Rather , it is for mankind not to forget its lesson. Remembering history does not mean being obsessed with the past. Rather , in doing so, we aim to create a better future and pass the torch of peace from generation to generation. Mr. President, Dear Colleagues ,The United Nations has gone through the test of time over the past sev en decades . It has witnessed effor ts made by all countries to uphold peace , build homeland and pursue cooperation. Having reached a new historical starting point, the United Nations needs to address the central issue of how to better promote world peace and development in the 21st centur y. The world is going trough a historical process of accelerated evolution: The sunshine of peace , development and progress will be powerful enough to penetrate the clouds of war, poverty and backwardness. The movement toward a multi-polar world, and the rise of emerging markets and developing countries have become an irresistible trend of history. Economic globalization and the advent of an infor mation age have vastly unleashed and boosted social producti ve forces . They have both News Fr om China October 2015 13created unprecedented development oppor tunities and given rise to new threats and: challeng es which we must face squarely . As an ancient Chinese adage goes, \"The greatest ideal is to create a world truly shared by all.\" Peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom are common values of all mankind and the lofty goals of the United Nations . Yet these goals are far from being achieved, and we must contin ue our endea vor to meet them. In today's world, all countries are interde pendent and share a common future . We Should renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Char ter, build a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation, and create a comm unity of shared future for mankind. To achieve this goal, we need to make the following effor ts: \"We should build partnerships in which countries treat each other as equals, engage in mutual consultation and show mutual understanding. The principle of sovereign equality underpins the UN Charter. The future of the world must be shaped by all countries. All countries are equals. The big, strong and rich should not bully the small, weak and poor, The principle of sovereignty not only means that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries are inviolable and their internal affairs are not subjected to interference. It also means that all countries' right to independently choose social systems and development paths should be upheld, and that all countries' endeavors to promote economic and social development and improve their people's lives should be respected. We should be committed to multilateralism and reject unilateralism. We should adopt a new vision of seeking win-win outcomes for all, and reject the outdated mindset that one's gain means the other' s loss or that the winner shall take all. Consultation is an impor tant form of democracy , and it should also become an important means of exercising contemporary international governance. We should resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should forge a global partnership at both international and regional levels, and embrace a n ew approach to state-to-state relations , one that features dialogue rather than confrontation, and seeks partnership rather than alliance. Major countries should follow the principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation in handling their relations . Big countries should treat small countries as equals , and take a right approac h to justice and interests by putting justice before interests . We should create a security architecture featuring fairness, justice , joint contribution and shared benefits . In the age of economic globalization, the security of all countries is interlink ed and has impact on one another . No countr y can maintain absolute security with its own effor t, and no countr y can achieve stability out of other countries' instability . The law of the jungle leaves the weak at the mercy of the strong; it is not the way for countries to conduct their relations . Those who adopt the high-handed approac h of using force will find that they are only lifting a rock to drop on their own feet. We should abandon Cold War mentality in all its manifestation, and foster a new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security . We should give full play to the central role of the United Nations and its Security Council in ending conflict and keeping peace , and adopt the dual approach of seeking peaceful solution to disputes and taking mandator y actions , so as to turn hostility into amity . We should advance international cooperation in both economic and social fields and take a holistic approach to addressing traditional and non-traditional security threats , so as to prevent conflicts from breaking out in the first place . We should promote open, innovative and inclusive development that benefits all. The 2008 international financial crisis has taught us that allowing capital to blindly pursue profit can only create a crisis and that global prosperity cannot be built on the shaky foundation of a market without moral constraints. The growing gap between rich and poor is both unsustainable and unfair. It is important for us to use both the invisible hand and the visible hand to form synergy between market forces and government function and strive to achieve both efficiency and fairness. Development is meaningful only when it is inclusive and sustainable. To achieve such development requires openness, mutual assistance and win-win cooperation. In the world today, close to 800 million people still live in extreme poverty, nearly six million kids die before the age of five each year and nearly 60 million children are unable to go to school. The just concluded UN Sustainable Development Summit adopted the Post-2015 Development Agenda. We must translate our commitments into actions and work together to ensure that everyone is free from want, has access to development and lives with dignity .

As the overall strength of developing nations impro ves, the South-South cooperation is set to play a bigger role in promoting the collecti ve rise of developing countries and generating a robust, sustained, balanced and inclusi ve growth of the world econom y. Xi Jinping raised the following proposals on South-South cooperation in the new era. The first is to explore diversified paths of development. A matched key is required to open the lock. The developing countries should stick to the development paths of their independent choice and with their unique characteristics, share successful experience in governance and administration of state affairs , focus on capacity-building, explore growth potentials, solve development difficulties and improve the well-being of the people . The second is to commit to docking the development strategies of developing nations.

The third is to strive for results from practical development. The developing countries should concentrate on rolling out a number of flagship projects with strategic and exemplar y significance by taking connectivity and production capacity cooperation as breakthrough points and giving full play to such new mechanisms as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank of BRICS , so as to generate sound economic , social and environmental effect and instill vigor to South-South cooperation.

Xi Jinping announced that in order to help other developing countries to grow econom y and impro ve people' s livelihood, China will carry out the \"Six 100s\" initiati ve, according to which it will make available to other developing countries in the next five years 100 poverty reduction programs, 100 agricultural cooperation projects, 100 trade promotion and aid programs, 100 environmental protection and climate change programs, 100 hospitals and clinics , and 100 schools and vocational training centers .

The People' s Daily has summed up a series of key words to help people have a better understanding of the main idea of President Xi's speec h. The United Nations established the Millennium Development Goals 15 years ago in the hope of helping hundreds of millions of people live a better life, Xi said in his speec h. \"We experienced sustained global economic growth as well as the international financial crises ,\" said President Xi, adding \"we witnessed the rise of developing countries and faced the reality of imbalanced development between the North and the South. \" Xi stressed that while 1.1 billion people have shaken off poverty, more than 800 million people are still in starvation. President Xi briefed the audience on the role and contributions of China in implementing the Millennium Development Goals over the past 15 years . He said that China has lifted 439 million people out of poverty and made remarkable progress in areas of education, health and women 's welfare over the past 30-plus years since the countr y embark ed on refor m and opening-up . Xi pointed out that peace and development are still two major themes of the present era.Millennium Development Goals Peace and DevelopmentTo cope with global challeng es including the recent refug ee crisis in Europe , the fundamental way out is to seek peace and achieve development, he said. In the face of many challeng es and difficulties , the world must focus on the key issue \u00a8C the development, he said, stressing that only development can eliminate the root cause of conflicts, protect the basic rights of the people , and meet the people' s yearning for a better life. Xi said that the post-2015 development agenda provides new visions for global development and new oppor tunities for international development cooperation. \"It is a high-standard task list as well as a heavy letter of commitment, \" he said. He stressed that the international community should strengthen cooperation and jointly implement the post-2015 development agenda to achieve win- win cooperation. He also said that China has solemnly committed itself to implementing the post-2015 development agenda responsibly and will continuously promote global development through solidarity and cooperation. \" In this regard, Xi called for the following four kinds of development: - Fair development so that development oppor tunities will be more equal. - Open development so that the Post-2015 Development Agenda Common Developmentachievements of development can benefit all parties. - Comprehensi ve development so that the foundation of development can be more solid. - Innovative development so that development potential can be fully released. Xi put forward a four-point proposal for the international community: building up the development capacities; impro ving the international environment for development; updating the partnership for development; and strengthening the coordination mechanisms for development. Xi called for enhancing the development capabilities, saying differen t countrie s should make different development strategies according to their own national situations . He called on all countries to work together to maintain international peace for the sake of development. Meanwhile, international financial institutions should step up governance refor m, and multilateral development agencies should increase their supply of development resources , he said. Xi proposed that the international community, while maintaining the role of South-Nor th cooperation as the main channel, should work to deepen South-South and tripar tite cooperation. In addition, Xi said, countries need to step up their macroeconomic policy coordination to avoid, as much as possible , negative spillover effects, and regional organizations should accelerate their integ ration process Win-W in CooperationPresident Xi Jinping V isits U.S. 28 News Fr om China October 2015China-India Relations and build their overall competitiveness by mutually complementing intra-regional advantag es.

In addition, China will exempt the debt of the outstanding intergovernmental interest-free loans due by the end of 2015 owed by relevant LDCs, landlocked developing countries and small island developing countries, the president said.

China-India Relations PRESIDENT OF INDIA 'S MESSAGE AND PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA 'S WEIBO TH FOR THE 66 ANNIVERSAR Y OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PEOPLE 'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA News Fr om China October 2015 29China-India Relations 30 News Fr om China October 2015Shri Mahesh Sharma, Honorable Minister of State for Tourism and Culture, Your Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends , Tonight we are gathered here to celebrate the 66th anniversar y of the founding of the People' s Republic of China .On behalf of the Chinese Embassy , I would like to extend my warm welcome and hear tfelt thanks to Dr. Mahesh Sharma and all the friends present. In the Chinese tradition, 6 is an auspicious number , and the age of 66 is doubly auspicious . So thank you for sharing this auspicious occasion with us. China has traveled a remarkable journey over the past 66 years . \u2014A poverty-stric ken countr y at the founding of New China, it has grown into the second largest econom y in the world, with 600 million people lifted out of abject poverty and average life expectancy raised from 35 years to 76 years .\u2014A countr y newly emerg ed from conflict and instability at the dawn of 1949, it has embark ed on a path of peaceful development, achieving harmony and stability at home and contributing peace- solutions as well as peace-k eepers to the world. \u2014A once isolated countr y, it is now deeply integ rated in the global system as a responsible stakeholder committed to win-win cooperation with all and confrontation with none .REMARKS BY AMBASSADOR LE YUCHENG AT THE NATIONAL DAY R ECEPTION News Fr om China October 2015 31China has made tremendous progress after 30-plus years of refor m and opening up, and is now at the cusp of new transfor mation. Given the sluggish global econom y and the domestic structural readjustment, it is true that the Chinese economy is under downward pressure . But the very magnitude of our econom y means ample room for maneuv er, and effecti ve measures are introduced to meet the challeng es that come our way. \u2014We are encouraging mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation and putting into practice new initiati ves such as \u00a1\u00b0Made in China 2025\u00a1\u00b1 and \u00a1\u00b0Inter net Plus\u00a1\u00b1 to bring out the full potential and creati vity of our people . \u2014We are streamlining government and deleg ating power to lower lev els to energize the invisible hand of the mark et while exercising the visible hand' s due responsibility . \u2014And we are strengthening environmental and labor rights protection and the rule of law to meet people' s aspiration for a better life and a green, sustainable future . As a result, despite the moderation in speed, the Chinese econom y contin ues to run within the proper range and is moving in a positi ve direction. In the first half of this year , the econom y expanded by 7%, registered urban unemplo yment rate was around 5.1%, energy intensity was down by 5.9%, the growth of high-tec h industries is over 10%, the service sector accounts for almost half of GDP , and consumption contributes 60% to growth. These figures show that the Chinese econom y is still on a sound footing . And the goal of comfor table and decent life for every Chinese is within sight. On the diplomatic front, China is a staunc h suppor ter of peace . Seventy years ago, suffering a casualty of 35 million people , China, fighting alongside people of other countries , defeated fascism. Sev enty years on, China is the largest contributor of peace keepers among the P5. When it comes to upholding peace , we don't simply talk the talk, but rather , walk the walk. China is a active contributor to development. We believ e in the conce pt of sharing and common prosperity , and are promoting a comm unity of common destiny to enable our neighbors , among others , to share in China' s development through the land and maritime Silk Road, the AIIB and other initiati ves. China-India Relations 32 News Fr om China October 2015 China-India Relations China is never a free-rider , but welcomes all countries to get on board China' s fast train of growth. China is a constr uctive builder of international order . A party to almost all intergovernmental organizations and over 400 multilateral treaties , China actively taps into the Oriental wisdom to contribute new ideas as much as solutions to make the global order more relevant and responsi ve. President Xi Jinping' s ongoing state visit to the US and upcoming participation in the UN summits speak volume of China's commitment to peace and development. The visit will give more substance to the new model of major -countr y relations and inject positi ve energ y to building a more fair and equitable international order . This year has also witnessed tangible progress in China-India relations . There have been quite a few landmark events including the visit by PM Modi to China and the evident chemistry between our leaders , the opening of Nathula Pass for Indian Yatris to Kailash Manasarovar and the imple- mentation of e-visa for Chinese tourists . Many are breakthrough developments that attest to a turning point in our relations. What's especially encouraging is our people' s growing passion in each other and the all-round dynamism in our two societies to engage with each other . This is crucial because as China-India relations gather steam, they have gone beyond the bilateral scope with increasing global strategic significance . Now it is incumbent upon us to set our relationship on a steady course of sound growth, because how we engage with one other not only matters to our two countries and peoples , but will also shape the future of Asia and beyond. A few days ago, I received a letter from an 11-year old girl from Mumbai, Tanushree . She wrote that India and China should keep the past behind and move ahead, and children can play the role of friendship ambassadors in this journey of friendship. Today, Tanushree is also here with her family . Let's give her a big round of applause . Welcome , Tanushree! And I'm happy to invite her to visit China as friendship ambassador . Actually , a few days ago, 21 Indian students just got back from an exciting homestay trip to China, and I'm sure Tanushree will enjoy her visit next year. With Tanushree and many like her in our societies , I see unbounded potential in China-India relations and am more optimistic than ever of what we can achieve down the road. Now, I invite you to raise your glasses in a toast: To the 66th anniversar y of the People' s Republic of China! To the brighter future of China- India relations! To the health of all guests present! News Fr om China October 2015 33It's been a little over one year since I became Chinese ambassador to India, and the tangible progress in our relations is not lost on me, or anyone. I am deeply encourag ed by the burgeoning cooperation and growing friendship and am more optimistic than ever of the bright prospect of China-India relations . Engagement between our leaders have become a regular occur rence . Over the past year, President Xi Jinping and PM Modi met 5 times , including their mutual visits . The chemistr y between our leaders is visible as President Xi tried his hand on a legendar y Charkha and swung on the typical Gujarati Jhoola with Prime Minister Modi, and as Prime Minister Modi opened his Weibo account to comm unicate with Chinese fans and posted the \"super selfie\" with Premier Li. Such chemistr y, hard to envisag e a year ago, has generated in both societies strong passion and affection for each other . Every cell of the society is now mobilized, adding wings and breathing new life to our relations . In terms of business cooperation, the two big mark ets of China and India ha ve much to offer each other . Chinese accum ulative investment in India almost tripled to $2.7 billion this year. There is huge demand and desire on both par ts to join hands , especially in such key areas as manufacturing and infrastructure. The Chinese real estate giant Wanda group plans to work with Haryana government to build a township in Kharkhoda with initial investment of US$10 billion. And Sany Group , China' s No.1 and the world's No. 5 construction machiner y manufacturer , plans to build on its investment in India and develop global R&D, manufacturing, sourcing and CHINA-INDIA R ELATIONS, SOARING TO NEW HEIGHTS AMBASSADOR L E YUCHENG 34 News Fr om China October 2015China-India Relations training bases here in the coming five years . Its Chair man and President, along with a group of heavy-w eight Chinese businesses , are meeting with PM Modi. I am sure the meeting will be followed by more investment and cooperation. Sub-national ties are flouring, putting the overall bilateral relations on a solid footing . The first Local Leaders' Forum was held and 10 pairs of sister cities and states/pro vinces established. Every week I receive local deleg ations from China. Not long ago, governor Zhu Xiaodan of Guangdong province led a huge business deleg ation to visit Gujarat, during the economic and trade fair attended by more than 100 Chinese and Indian businesses , 15 agreements worth $500 million were signed. A number of Indian Chief Ministers have visited China, including Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. People-to-people exchanges have picked up remarkably . The opening of Nathula Pass and the launc h of e-visa for Chinese tourists are signal events in China-India relations . So far, five official batches of over 200 pilgrims have realized their dream Yatra to Kailash Manasarovar . And discussion is under way to add more batches from next year. During this year's Kumbh Mela, the holy water from Kailash Manasaro var was fetched to mingle with the holy water from the Gang es. The conf luence of the two holy waters is also a symbol of the friendship between our two peoples . Speaking of e-visa, credit should be given to PM Modi for this popular move. In August alone , this first month since its implementation, the number of Chinese visitors traveling to India has doubled, and the figure may well exceed one million in the next five years . The increase of personnel exchang es is a two-way street, our embassy alone , not to mention consulates-g eneral in other parts of India, issues nearly 2000 visas on a monthly basis, with the peak number reaching 2700 per month. As interest in each other increases, more art exhibitions, cultural perfor mances , book fairs and media forums are held. More Indians are taking up Chinese and using WeChat. Indian food and Bollyw ood films have become a hit in China. And I can't wait to watch the three films co-produced by China and India about Kongfu Yoga, Xuanzang and a journey to India. Next year is the \"Visit China Year\" in India, the rich tourism and cultural resources in our two ancient civilizations are waiting to be explored. As close neighbors that enjoy time-honored friendship , we have every reason to reach out and visit each other more . As India hosts the BRICS Summit and China hosts the G20 Summit in 2016, there are many oppor tunities for our leaders to meet and talk. Leadership-lev el engagement and people-to-people exchang es will reinforce each other and inject still more dynamism to our relations . Though this means a heavier workload for us at the embassy , we are just as happy and encourag ed as we are busy. Media has played an indispensable role in covering and promoting China-India relations . I applaud your good work and am always happy to meet the press . As China-India relations are poised to soar to new heights , I see a big part to play for Deccan Herald. CHINESE ECONOMY: SPRINT TO MARATHONAMBASSADOR L E YUCHENG In August, the 15th IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) World Championships were held in Beijing . I was especially impressed by the endurance and tenacity in long- distance running as well as the speed and passion in sprint. It made me ponder over the Chinese econom y, whose rapid growth over the past 30 years is similar to sprinting, fast yet not sustainable . Now, the Chinese econom y has shifted to the long- distance running mode, a little slower, but healthier and more sustainable . The 7% growth rate China achieved in the first half of the year is not at all easy . Given a $10 trillion economy, 7% growth actually generates more increase in volume than the double-digit growth in the past, which deser ves a \"thumbs-up\". China now pays more attention to the quality of its econom y and no longer pursues quantity alone . While maintaining medium- to high-speed economic growth, it contin ues to optimize its structure . Just like a News Fr om China October 2015 35young man who no long er grows as fast in height as a teenag er, but whose body is built strong er and mind enric hed. The vitality of the Chinese economy comes from the adjustment of economic structure . In the first half of this year, the econom y expanded by 7%, the service sector accounting for almost half of gross domestic product (GDP) and consumption contributing 60% to growth. The growth of high-tec h industries was over 10% and energ y intensity was down by 5.9%. These figures show that despite moderation of the speed, the Chinese econom y is going for better quality and has transfor med from labour intensi ve to science and te chnolog y intensi ve, which lays the foundation for sustainable development. The vitality of the Chinese economy comes from entre preneurship and innovation. The Chinese government has adopted vigorous measures to promote mass entre preneurship and innovation, streamline administrative procedure, lower threshold and costs of doing business, and stimulate entre preneurial passion. For the past one-and-a-half years , over 10,000 new businesses have been registered on a daily basis in China. The stories of Chinese companies such as Xiaomi and Alibaba are popular and inspiring in India. Established five years ago with only a dozen people , Xiaomi has its mark et value soaring to $45 billion now. Alibaba, through innovation, has become a world- renowned corporate giant with a $150 billion mark et value. Recently , Chinese smartphone company Smartisan's growth miracle has caught much attention. In 2012, a Chinese English teacher founded Smar tisan with innovative ideas to develop smartphones and their operating system. Its market capitalization reached $400 million within three years , an increase of 51 times . In China, there are many such successful companies , which grow from scratc h to strength and provide a steady stream of new momentum for the Chinese econom y. The vitality of the Chinese economy comes from domestic consumption. The Internet econom y and sharing econom y have made Chinese people' s lives more convenient while boosting consumption. For example , ordinar y people can make an appointment online with a chef on-site service and a chef comes to your house with a full set of kitchen utensils and ingredients . This w ay, you can enjo y the intimacy of home dining and the luxur y of five-star food without the five-star price , and the best part, you 36 News Fr om China October 2015China-India Relations don't even need to do the shopping beforehand or the dishes afterw ards. The online trading platfor m run by Alibaba accounts for 12% of China' s retail mark et, with up to 367 million users and 30 million express parcels delivered every day. The Chinese always save for the rainy day. So now, despite the difficulties in the global econom y, the Chinese people have plenty of money to spend, contributing to increased consumption. China's development has brought and will contin ue to bring oppor tunities to the world. And we welcome other countries to board China's express train of development. The purpose of China raising the \"belt and road\" initiati ve and setting up the Asian Infrastr ucture Investment Bank is to share development oppo rtunities with other countries . Last year, China's contribution to global economic growth was 25.8%, and in the first half of this year, it increased to about 30%. China is now the largest trading partner of more than 120 countries and regions in the world. China attaches impor tance to strengthening cooperation with neighbouring countries , and India is among our largest developm ent partners. Over the past year, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have met five times , including their mutual visits . The fast-g rowing relationship between China and India has generated growing passion in each other and the all-round dynamism in our two societies to engage with each other. Chinese accumulative investment in India almost tripled to $2.7 billion by the end of this June. Businesses are eager to explore each other's markets. The Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group is planning to invest $15 billion in the next 10 years in the constr uction of enter tainment and industrial parks . China Railw ay has won the bid for the Delhi-Mumbai high-speed rail project feasibility study out of 12 companies from seven countries . India has started issuing e-visas for Chinese tourists , a move that has and will significantly boost tourism and people-to-people exchanges. In August alone, the number of Chinese tourists visiting India doubled. With growing passion , Sino-Indian economic cooperation will usher in a new climax. China is known as the \"world factory\", and India the \"world office\". We can better align our development strategies and work together to make the Chinese phoenix and Indian peacoc k fly higher .

Since 2012, London has been seeking to become the key Western hub for trading the Chinese yuan. Among the 53 agreements made in the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue this September , three are focused on bilateral financial cooperation. In his state visit to China this September , British Finance Minister George Osborne said Britain welcomes China to participate in the constr uction of its new nuclear programs.

STATE COUNCILOR Y ANG JIECHI'S INTER VIEW WITH INDEPENDENT NEWS & MEDIA SOUTH AFRICA (1) As Your Excellency have visited South Africa several times, what' s your impr ession about South Africa? What is the aim of your trip to South Africa this time? State Councilor Yang Jiechi: South Africa is known as the \"Rainbo w Nation\". Every time I visit South Africa, I am deeply impressed with its breathtaking scener y, diverse cultures of unique charm, and the warm hospitality of the South African people . More impor tantly , I am always heartened to see new chang es in South Africa. In recent years , under the leadership of President Zuma, the South African government has pursued a policy of national reconciliation, committed itself to growing the econom y and impro ving people' s livelihood and enhanced its international standing and regional influence . I sincerely wish the South African people greater strides in the path of national development. My visit this time is for the main purpose of comparing notes with the South African side with regard to the preparations for the FOCA C summit in Johannesburg this December and having an in-de pth discussion on the arrangements and deliverables of President Xi Jinping' s visit to South Africa. We wish to work together with South Africa to translate the impor tant agreement reached by our two presidents into concrete actions and specific programs and make the summit and the visit a complete success . (2) This year marks the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). How do you evaluate the past 15 years' development of FOCAC? As we all know, the upcoming summit is the first FOCAC summit held on African soil. What is the significance of this summit for China-Africa cooperation, and what outcomes can we expect from the summit? 42 News Fr om China October 2015External Affairs State Councilor Yang Jiechi: Since the inception of FOCA C 15 years ago, China and Africa have had fruitful cooperation across the board. Political mutual trust has grown significantly . The two sides understand and suppor t each other on matters involving each other' s core interests and major concer ns, thus upholding the common interests of China, Africa and the developi ng world. Our practical cooperation has progressed in leaps and bounds, delivering tangible benefits to both the Chinese and African people . Statistics show that in 2014, trade between China and Africa exceeded US$220 billion and China' s investment stock in Africa surpassed US$30 billion, an increase of 22 and 60 times respecti vely over the figures in 2000 when FOCA C was just established. Moreo ver, the share of China-Africa trade in Africa's total foreign trade has increased from 3.82% to 20.5%. What is particularly notew orthy is China' s commitment to helping Africa break the two development bottlenecks of underdeveloped infrastr ucture and lack of human resources . The effor ts have already made a big difference . By June 2015, over 3,800 kilometers of railways and 4,334 kilometers of roads have been either built or under constr uction in Africa with Chinese financing . More than 200 schools of various kinds have been established with Chinese assistance or financing . The Chinese government provides Africa with more than 7,000 government scholarships each semester and holds over 100 multilateral and bilateral technical and manag ement training programs and senior officials workshops for Africa each year. FOCA C has proven to be an impor tant platfor m for collecti ve dialogue between China and African countries and an effective mechanism for enhanced practical cooperation. As such, FOCA C is very much welcomed by all parties and has indeed become a banner for promoting China-Africa unity and cooperation and leading international cooperation on Africa. As far as the African countries are concerned, they have the common desire to accelerate industrialization and agricultural moder nization in a bid to realize economic independence and self- reliant, sustainable development. After more than 30 years of refor m, opening up and rapid development, China has developed a large number of competitive industries and accumulated strong production capacities . This puts us in a better position to work with other countries to achieve win-win development based on complementarity of strengths . In other words, given their respecti ve strengths , China and Africa are each other' s oppor tunity and need each other for cooperation and development. Convened against such a background, the FOCA C Summit, the first of its kind to be held on the African continent, will have great and far-reaching significance for boosting comprehensi ve transfor mation and upgrading of China-Africa relations and promoting more balanced, inclusive and sustainable development of the world. In his first visit to Africa in 2013, President Xi Jinping put forth the principles of sincerity , real results , affinity and good faith to guide our relations with Africa, and called for taking a right approac h to justice and interests . The fundamental purpose is to closely combine effor ts to help Africa achieve economic independence, self-reliance and sustainable development with China's own development, and achieve win-win cooperation and common development. China and Africa will seize this rare historical oppor tunity of the summit, fully leverage their advantag es of political mutual trust and economic complementarity and step up mutually beneficial cooperation in the five priority areas of industrialization, agricultural moder nization, health, people-to- people exchang es and peace and security . We believ e that this summit, through its new plans , new blueprint and new momentum for China- Africa cooperation, will send to the rest of the world a strong messag e of China and Africa working together for win-win cooperation and common development and usher in a new prospect of development to people in China, Africa and beyond. China, in the spirit of equal- footed consultation and joint preparation for the summit, stands ready to work with South Africa and the other 50 FOCA C members on the African side to make the summit in Johannesburg a historic gathering that will strengthen China-Africa unity and lead China-Africa cooperation to the future , thus writing a new chapter for China- Africa relations . (3) How do you see today' s China-South Africa ties, and what are the opportunities and challenges? What outcomes can we expect from President Xi's visit to further the China-South Africa relations? State Councilor Yang Jiechi: With the establishment of the comprehensi ve strategic partnership and the signing of the China-South Africa 5-10 Year Framew ork on Cooperation, the relationship between China and South Africa is at its best in histor y. The two countries enjoy close high-lev el exchang es. This year alone , the two presidents News Fr om China October 2015 43External Affairs will have five meetings . We have reached an unprecedented level in political mutual trust and given each other understanding and suppor t on issues relating to each other' s core interests and major concerns. Practical cooperation is booming, delivering more real benefits to people of both countries . In 2014, bilateral trade reached US$60.3 billion, an increase of 40 folds over that of 1998 when the diplomatic ties were established. The stock of Chinese investment in South Africa has reached US$12 billion, making China one of the major in vestors in South Africa. At the same time, South Africa is the leading African investor in China. I have every confidence in the future growth of China-South Africa relations . Richly endo wed in natural and human resources and committed to its strategy of reindustrialization, South Africa enjoys huge market size and development potential. As for China, thanks to its rapid economic growth for more than three decades , it boasts comparati ve advantag es in capital, technolog y, business and personnel. China and South Africa are each other's necessary and natural partners of development and have before them a rare, historic oppor tunity for cooperation. President Xi Jinping will attend the FOCAC Summit in Johannesburg and visit South Africa. This will surely give a strong boost to the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries . The two sides need to seize this important opportunity to fully leverage their advantag es in political mutual trust and economic complementarity, deepen cooperation in such key areas as special economic zone, marine econom y, manufacturing industr y, energ y and resources ucture and promote win-win cooperation for commo n developm ent, thus bringing more tangible benefits to the two peoples . Of course , the two sides also face numerous challenges in implementing, in a more effecti ve manner , the impor tant agreement reached by the leaders of our two countries . We hope that the two sides will create for each other better business and investment environment, find opportunities amid c halleng es and tur n enor mous cooperation potential into fruitful results on the ground. (4) Currently, China is encounter ed with slowdown in economic growth with its stock and currency markets having undergone fluctuations, which have attracted world's attention. Some people ask whether Africa can still count on China's development to bolster Africa' s development and argue Africa should turn to other partners and strengthen cooperation with them. How do you see the current state of the Chinese econom y and its development prospect? Under such circumstances, how could the two sides further deepen win-win cooperation? What are the prospects of China- Africa cooperation? State Councilor Yang Jiechi: Since the introduction of refor m and opening up more than 30 years ago, the Chinese economy has grown rapidly at an average annual rate of about 10%. It is now the second largest in the world. At present, the Chinese econom y is shifting from a high-speed growth to a medium-high growth. This is not only because of the sluggish recovery of the world econom y as a whole , but also a result of China' s proacti ve manag ement to promote structural refor m, lower the speed of growth and impro ve the quality of growth. We define this as the \"new normal\" of the Chinese econom y. In the long run, it will help increase the efficiency of the Chinese econom y and upgrade it, and ensure that the Chinese econom y contin ues to grow in a steady and sound manner . The Chinese economy registered a 7% growth in the first half of this year . Such perfor mance is still one of the best among the world's major economies . The long- term prospects of the Chinese econom y remain sound. Major steps are being taken in China to stabilize growth, deepen reform, adjust structure , impro ve people' s well- being and prevent risks in order to sustain a medium-high speed of growth. China is making progress in its pursuit of a new type of industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural moder nization, and with a high savings rate and consumption potential, China e njoys huge mark et space and potential. China' s stock mark et has reached a stage of self- correction and self-adjustment. And there is no basis for contin uous depreciation of the RMB . Statistics sho w that the Chinese economy remains a major contributor to economic growth in the whole world and in Africa. In the first half of this year, 30% of the world economic growth came from China, and China' s role in facilitating the rapid growth of African economies is widely appreciated. It is true that China' s impor t and expor t have somewhat slowed down this year, due to price drop of commodities on the international mark et. But in terms of aggregate volume , China is still buying more commodities , not less, and its impor t of goods will remain on a steady upward trajector y. It is estimated that in the next five years , China will 44News Fr om China October 2015External Affairs impor t US$10 trillion of goods and invest over US$500 billion o verseas , and outbound visits made by Chinese people will exceed 500 million. What has happened proves that China' s refor m and opening-up have created development oppor tunities to the world and contributed in many ways to Africa' s rapid development. China will contin ue to advance refor m and opening up. This will bring not just more dividend to the development of the Chinese econom y, but also more oppor tunity for the prosperity of Africa and the world. Having gone through thick and thin together , China and Africa are bound by this comm unity of shared future and interests . In the 1960s and 1970s, the two sides forged profound friendship in the fight for national independence and liberation. Today, nothing should stop the two sides from coming together to pursue common development. Africa is blessed with abundant natural and human resources and enjoys huge mark et and development potential. The Agenda 2063 and its first Ten Year Plan adopted at this year's AU Summit have prioritized industrialization and sustainable development, usher ing Africa into a new stage of development. As for China, with more than three decades of fast growth, it now has rich experience , mature technolog y, cost- effecti ve equipment and sufficient capital in the field of industrialization. More impor tantly , China has the strong political will to support Africa in achieving economic independence and self- reliant sustainable development. China and Africa will usher in a new phase of win-win cooperation and common development. As an impor tant member of the international community, Africa deserves greater international suppor t in its development. China welcomes more diversity in Africa' s partnerships and stands ready to work with other partners in the international comm unity to suppor t Africa under the principle of \"raised, agreed and led by Africa. \" China believ es Africa belongs to the African people . Respecting Africa' s centrality is essential for such cooperation. (5) South Africa is the rotating chair of the Group of 77 plus China this year. Not long ago, China and the UN co-hosted the High-Lev el Round Table on South-South Cooperation in UN headquarters. President Xi Jinping chair ed the meeting and shared his views on South-South cooperation. As two impor tant developing countries, what roles could China and South Africa play in promoting South-South cooperation? And what kind of cooperation could be launched in the futur e? State Councilor Yang Jiechi: South-South cooperation is an impor tant means for developing countries to seek strength through unity and pursue win-win outcome . It is also a significant force in international development cooperation. China attaches great importance to South-South cooperation. It initiated and co- chaired with the United Nations the Round Table on South-South Cooperation during this year's UN Sustainable Development Summit. President Xi Jinping and over 20 foreign leaders and representati ves of international organizations review ed the journey of South- South cooperation and explored future cooperation and development, which has lent fresh impetus to South-South cooperation. As President Xi pointed out at the High-lev el Round Table on South-South Cooperation, the post- 2015 development agenda has set higher development goals and raised higher development requirements for all countries. South-South cooperation should take the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda as an oppor tunity to boost developing countries' development in quality , scale and scope . China and South Africa are both major developing countries . We should stand firm in upholding the overall interests of developing countries in for mulating the post-2015 development agenda and on other major international issues . We have provided assistance within our abilities to African and other developing countries and given suppor t to all countries in achieving common prosperity in order to take South-South cooperation to new heights . Today, pursuing the common task of development, China and South Africa have all the more reason to work together. As President Xi points out, developing countries need to share their successful governance experience , synergize development strategies , start with connecti vity and global production capacity cooperation to build closer partnerships in trade , finance , investment, infrastr ucture and environmental protection. Along this line of thinking, China will step up practical cooperation with South Africa. Meanwhile, China will contin ue to work with South Africa to promote global economic governance refor m, urge developed countries to make good on their ODA commitment, impro ve the exter nal environment for the development of developing countries , and help them achieve poverty reduction and dev elopment goals and successfully implement the post-2015 development agenda. News Fr om China October 2015 45External Affairs (6) Both China and South Africa are BRICS members. Actuall y it is China that invited South Africa into BRICS . As the world econom y is undergoing profound adjustment, BRICS countries also face some difficulties and challenges in developme nt and coopera tion. Some people think BRICS cooperation has already lost its momentum. How do you see the prospects of BRICS cooperation? State Councilor Yang Jiechi: Given the current sluggish world economic growth, the BRICS countries now face growing difficulties and challeng es in their economic development. However, as a Chinese saying goes, it takes a long-ter m view to put things into perspecti ve. Similarly , we need to adopt a historical, long-ter m and holistic perspective to truly understand the development of and cooperation among the BRICS countries . In the short run, the BRICS countries do see some moderation in their economic growth and face certain problems in structural adjustment and transition. Nonetheless , if we look beyond the immediate trend lines, these are inevitable hurdles that come with development and must be overcome in order to leap over the middle- income trap. Moreo ver, we have to recognize what remains unchang ed. The positi ve fundamentals of the BRICS economies and their tremendous potential for future growth have not chang ed. The historical trend of their rising stature in the international political and economic landscape also remains unchang ed. Compared with the past, the economic growth of the BRICS countries may have somewhat dropped from their record high. But compared with other countries in the world, their speed of growth remains at quite a high level, particularly when compared with that of the developed countries . Over the past decade , the BRICS countries have accounted for over 50 percent of world economic g rowth. According to the IMF projections , the average growth rate of the BRICS countries between 2015 and 2020 will contin ue to outpace the world average, which means that they will remain impor tant drivers of world economic growth. Internationally, the BRICS coun tries have been profoundly affected by inadequate global demand, lackluster trade and investment, and weak commodity prices . Domestically , as they press ahead with economic transformation and upgrading through proactive policy readjustment, they have to pay the price and experience the growing pains . However, with the attainment of growth featuring better quality and high efficiency , their economic structure will be impro ved and t heir inherent momentum of growth will be strong er. In recent years , cooperation among the BRICS countries have grown with far greater depth and breadth than that of the inception period. With the participation of South Africa in particular, the BRICS members have covered four continents and spanned both the North and South hemispheres. Having such growing influence and appeal, the BRICS has become a major force in the international relations and an active player in the building of international system. The BRICS countries have launc hed the New Development Bank and the Conting ent Reserve Arrangement. These two flagship programs fully testify to the ability of BRICS countries in carrying out effecti ve cooperation. We are convinced that as long as the BRICS countries pull in one direction, uphold the spirit of openness , inclusi veness and win-win cooperation and work together for closer partnership, BRICS cooperation will embrace an even brighter future .

TU YOUYOU 'S NOBEL PRIZE AWARD BRINGS MORE CONFIDENCE AND INTROSPECTION TO CHINESE BEIJING , Oct. 6 (Xinhuanet) \u2014 Chinese scientist Tu Youyou on October 5 won the Nobel Prize in physiolog y or medicine amongst a trio for discovering parasite therapies. Together, the three scientists found \"therapies that have revolutionized the treatment of some of the most devastating parasitic diseases\". 85-year -old Tu is awarded this world-reno wned prize for her contribution to reducing the death rate of malaria, minimizing patients' suffering and promoting mankind's health. This is what science is all about. Tu's name \"Youyou\", or \"Yuyu\", came from the Classic of Poetry, the oldest existing collection of Chinese songs and odes. The characters depict the cheerful sounds deer make when calling for mates . Tu has spent 40 years' time on scientific researc h. Although the Nobel Prize did not come to her until four decades later, it is definitely the most privilege reward that recognizes Tu's dedication and perseverance in discovering artemisinin. Tu's finding has saved millions' lives during the 40 years . This also proves the value of her researc h product. The reward is never too late Created in China 56 News Fr om China October 2015Created in China in that aspect. The moment of joy and satisfaction when she disco vered the artemisinin after all kinds of failures in experiments is eternal. Tu has won some attention when she got the Lasker Award in 2011. But there is no way to compare her popularity back to the attention she is receiving today. As the first Chinese mainland Nobel Prize Winner of natural science award, Tu's winning completely surprised Chinese people , who have long been wondering when the first Chinese Nobel Laureate in natural science would appear . Tu is an alumni of Peking University . She studied at the Peking University Health Science Center , Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , from 1951 to 1955. Not only is Tu the first Chinese Nobel Laureate in natural science , she is the first Nobel Laureate who received all scientific trainings in China. The award she won made Chinese scientists gain tremendous confidence . Let's backtrac k to 40 years ago. Tu accomplished the breakthrough findings without access to any advanced equipment, communi- cation with outside world and papers to researc h. However, over the 40 years, improvements and innovations have transformed everything. Nowadays, Chinese scientists have the passion to invent. As Premiere Li Keqiang mentioned in his letter , \"Tu's winning the prize signifies China's prosperity and progress in scientific and technological field\". Evidently, Chinese scientific researc h has been playing a leading role in the world. And one can be sure that there is going to be a second or third \"Tu\" coming .Tu's winning will help people come to realize that all those international publications and journals, whether it is the Nobel Prize , SCI publishing, Nature , or Science , are all just gimmic ks of measuring tools. There's no need to improperly belittle oneself . The sole key is to be oneself and try one's best with confidence . There had been doubts about \"whether there would be a Chinese national awarded the Nobel Prize .\" This sort of doubts is unnecessar y. The scientific awards are equal to all, as long as the researc h findings are good enough. Tu's record-breaking winning serves as a reminder to those who are too eager for instant success . Science is never about instant success . There is no w ay to me asure how much you spend on scientific researc h and compare it with how much reward you get. Some may question about Tu's lacking a doctoral degree, international experience , and a title as academician of the Chinese academ y. Tu's experience is unique . It is hard to predict whether the next Chinese Nobel Laureate may have any of these backgrounds . There's no need to tag a scientist and to look at the whole scientific comm unity through these kinds of tags. The fact that Tu has none of these three backgrounds also reminds us that science should be more accessible to all. One shall be able to become a scientist no matter what kind of background he or she comes from, as long as one devotes into scientific researc h. There have been discussions on people who really love science are never aiming File photo taken on Sept. 23, 2011 shows Chinese pharmacologist Tu Youyou posing with her trophy after winning the Lasker Award, a prestigious U.S. medical prize, in New York, the United States.

They might not achieve much during their whole lives. But their contributions are infinite . They work so hard to prove the wrong way so that the future researc her will be closer to the right one. For Chinese scientists , a more diverse and flexible measurement and awarding system are needed. A lot of Japanese Nobel Laureates came from companies and independent institutions . In the U.S., companies such as Microsoft hire a lot of talented scientists for their researches. In a recent reform regulation jointly passed and distributed by General Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and General Office of the Comm unist Party of China, decisions have already been made on transfor ming the current measuring system from researc h product quantity to its quality and how innovative the product is. Any real contribution the researc h has made to the society is also counted. This kind of regulation will allow more space and time for Chinese scientists to devote into their researc hes. Artemisinin and science saved lived around the world. Tu saved the confidence of Chinese scientists , who will care less about whether a Chinese scientist be awarded the Nobel Prize in the future . William Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Tu Youyou jointly won the 2015 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work against parasitic diseases .

The link was later extended as far as Xigaze, Tibet' s second largest city. The Lhasa-Xigaze railway, which opened on Aug. 1 last year, has carried large numbers of tourists to Xigaze, home of the mountaineers' base camp for Qomolangma, known in the West as Mount Everest. Batsang, deputy director of the Xigaze Development and Reform Commission, said more than 40,000 visitors used the railway in the first month of operation.

During his long working life, Yarphel has developed a special routine and follows a number of rituals . Whenev er he drives past the peak of a mountain, he honks his horn.\" It's a greeting to the gods, asking them to bless us.\" He said. More prosaically , it's also a good way to let other motorists know he's there . \"On unpa ved roads , visibility is often zero because your vision is obscured by the clouds of dust that rise from the road surface ,\" he said. The 1,100-kilometer journey from Xig aze to Burang used to tak e at least two days, because \"driving 12 hours a day on such a bumpy road was hard and I was exhausted pretty quickly,\" he added. Things chang ed when the road was asphalted, cutting the journey time by half. According to Tsering Nyodrub, head of the United Front Work Department in Gyangze, monasteries are usually built on hills, and that makes travelling difficult for monks and pilgrims. Since 2011, the regional government has invested about 1.5 million yuan in the construction of roads near monasteries and other religious sites. The five-year road-building project aims to make 70 percent of the region 's 1,700 registered monasteries accessible by the end of the year. However, that sum was just a drop in the ocean of the total investment the government has made in Tibet's transportation infrastr ucture in the past 50 years . The local transpor tation authority said that in 1950 the region had no paved roads , but by the end of last year, 75,000km had been constr ucted.
