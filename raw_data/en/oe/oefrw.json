A combination of therapies are employed, tailored to your specific condition. Cancer treatment at Vitality Integrative Medicine has several goals: Adding evidence-based non-toxic treatments for cancer Improving the efficacy of conventional care. Improving immune function, with the goal of decreasing infection risk and fighting cancer cells. Decreasing side effects of treatment and improving the quality of life. Treatment includes several components: IV therapy Specific intravenous nutrients have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of cancer. High dose IV vitamin C is commonly employed. In the high blood concentrations which are attainable only by IV therapy, vitamin C acts as an OXIDANT, not an antioxidant. This oxidative action selectively kills cancer cells. In this way, vitamin C has been shown to inhibit tumor growth. It is also synergistic with radiation and many chemotherapies, improving their efficacy. Other intravenous treatments for cancer include blood ozone therapy, mistletoe therapy, Poly-MVA, and nutrient IV's (Myers cocktail). While chemotherapy can be potentially lifesaving, it is often associated with side effects which can cause discomfort and decreased quality of life, and which can even be life-threatening and necessitate discontinuation of the chemotherapy. These side effects include toxicity to bone marrow resulting in increased risk of infections, toxicity to liver and kidneys, and digestive tract toxicity. High dose vitamin C IV therapy has been shown to reduce these toxicities. Other supplements and IV therapies similarly are chosen for their protective actions against the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Dietary therapies Specific diets vary based on individual need and are chosen based on available current evidence, with the goal being to decrease tumor growth, improve immune status, and maintain body weight. Strategies may include calorie restriction, ketogenic diet, and other dietary guidelines based on individual needs. The doctor helps guide you to successfully implement the dietary strategies. Off-label pharmaceuticals and low-toxicity targeted treatments A variety of drugs developed and used for non-cancer purposes have been adopted by integrated doctors for cancer because they have been associated with improved survival, improved tumor response, or because they interfere with certain biochemical mechanisms that cancer cells rely on. Supplements and Herbs Supplements are employed for their ability to improve immune function, impair tumor growth and metastasis, decrease side effects of conventional treatment, and improve the quality of life.
