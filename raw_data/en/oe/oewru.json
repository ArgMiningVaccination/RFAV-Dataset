IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 4 Executive Summary The 2022 Immunization Status Survey of 24- month -old Children (Immunization Status Survey) in Tennessee is conducted by the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program (VPDIP) and Tennessee's 13 Regional and Metro Health Departments. The purpose of this survey is to track progress toward achie ving the national Healthy People objectives for immunization coverage with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) routinely recommended early childhood vaccines. This survey utilizes a retrospective cohort research design to determine the up- to-date (UTD) immunization rates for 24-month -old children born in Tennessee. The survey population is composed of random samples drawn from birth certificates of infants born in each of the 13 health department regions. The children sampled for the survey were born during the first quarter of 2020 and celebrated their second birthdays between January 1 and March 31, 2022. Identifying information was obtained from electronic birth records, and immunization history data were collected primarily via the statewide immunization registry, Tennessee Immunizations Information System (TennIIS). Immunization rates for the 4:3:1: FS:3:1:FS series (4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 Hepatitis B, 1 Varicella, and 4 PCV) were based on the childhood immunization and catch-up schedules recommended by the ACIP in 2022. The results of the survey are aggregated to give regional and statewide statistics on immunization coverage rates in Tennessee and track the progress toward achieving a goal of 90% coverage with on-time immunization for each routinely recommended vaccine before age two years. Each child's immunization record was reviewed to determine if they were UTD. If the child was not UTD, an effort was made by local public health staff to contact parents, guardians, and providers to obtain any missing immunization history data. If further follow -up revealed that the child was truly not UTD, the data collection process served as a reminder -recall system for parents and providers. If all the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series vaccination dates occurred before the child reached 24 months of age or if the series was completed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) catch -up schedule guidance, the child was classified as UTD by 24 months. Children were excluded from the UTD by 24 months classification if at least one of the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series dates occurred after the child reached 24 mo nths of age and did not meet the catch- up schedule recommendations . In 2022, the Tennessee statewide UTD immunization r ate by 24 months was 77.1%, up from 74.8% in 2021 (Table 3, pg. 1 8). Historically, Tennessee has high vaccination rates, but has not yet achieved most Healthy People objectives for either 2020 or 2030. In 2022, Tennessee met four out of the 12 HP2020 objectives and one of the three HP2030 objectives. Tennessee ranks in the bottom 30% of states for the com pletion of 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series ranking 33rd in the nation and fifth out of eight in Region 4 of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) , which includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and South Carolina .1,2 Additionally, there was considerable variation by region in the percent of children found to be UTD by 24 months (with data collection) , ranging from 64.3% in the Upper - Cumberland Region (UCR) to 92.3% in the Knox County Region (KKR). Caution should be taken when interpreting immunization rates for a region with a low response rate because children who are excluded from the study due to being unable- to-locate (UTL) could also be the least UTD . The greatest UTD by 24 months improvement was observed in Jackson Madison Region (JMR), which had a 13.1 percentage point increase from 2021 to 2022 ( Table 8 , pg. 38). A preliminary immunization rate was calculated: UTD by 24 months (as reported to TennIIS). This rate represents the percentage of study participants whose vaccines were UTD by 24 months based only on the information found in TennIIS prior to the survey, i.e., no follow up with parents or providers. In Tennessee, providers voluntarily report vaccine administration to TennIIS other than vaccines that are provided through a federally -funded program such as the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program . For all 24 -month - ld children in Tennessee, the UTD immunization rate based on TennIIS data alone was 8.9%, 0.8 percentage points lower than 2021 and 68.2 percentage points below the UTD by 24 months ( with data collection) rate for 2022 . This suggests that there is substantial underreporting to TennIIS by Tennessee healthcare providers. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 5 The percentage of Tennessee children who received the fourth dose of DTaP by 24 months of age increased by 4 percentage points from 2021 to 2022. This rate continues to significantly lag behind the percentage of children who received the third dose by 24 months of age. Historically, Tennessee has not met the Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) objective for DTaP. In fact, 93.8% of children received three doses of DTaP by 24 months of age while only 81.3% received their fourth dose in 2021 ( Figure 16, pg. 35 ). The third dose of D TaP can be given as early as 6 months of age; however, the fourth dose must be delayed until at least 12 months of age and 6 months after the third dose. These results suggest that patient outreach efforts specific to the fourth dose of D TaP may be helpful for parents after their child's one year check -up. Although young children have increased risk of developing serious flu- related complications such as pneumonia, dehydration and death Tennessee children continue to be under vaccinated for influenza.3 Therefore, promoting timely immunization practices with influenza vaccine are a high priority for VPDIP . Among the 2022 cohort, only 48. 3% of 24-month -old children had achieved the H P2020 objective of two doses of influenza vaccine by 24 months of age, a decrease from 54.8 % in 2021 (Table 3, pg. 1 8). In addition to individual vaccine analysis, multiple risk factors and their potential effects on UTD status were evaluated. These risk factors include program enrollment, race, number of siblings, etc. Enrollment in a medical safety -net programs, TennCare and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), was analyzed to determine if a child had ever been enrolled in one or both programs at any tim e Participants were assigned into categories based on their enrollment status (TennCare only, WIC only, or enrollment in bot h programs). The UTD rate by 24 months for children who were enrolled in WIC only (69.6%) was much lower than in any of the other categories, including those not enrolled in either program (Table 4, pg. 2 4). The 2022 Immunization Status Survey report offers the people of Tennessee and its health regions a chance to study demographic and immunization history data simultaneously, so that evidence- based programs can be created to raise immunization rates across the state of Tennessee.

The survey is composed of random samples drawn from birth certificates of infants born in each of the 13 health department regions, which are aggregated to give statewide an d regional statistics on immunization coverage rates in Tennessee. Safety and Efficacy of Immunizations The United States has the safest and most effective vaccine supply in its history. Prior to licensure, rigorous clinical trials are carried out by the vaccine manufacturers and reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Vaccines are recommended only when proven to be safe, effective, and beneficial. After licensure, vaccines continue to be monitored for rare advers e reactions. Most vaccinated children never experience an adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are minor and include soreness at injection site, a rash, or a mild fever that subsides within one to two days. 3 Vaccines help t he body build immunity against disease. Because of the success of vaccines, many diseases that were historically commonplace have become rare or have been eliminated from the United States. By vaccinating a child, benefits also extend to others. Individuals who cannot develop immunity from vaccines, have medical conditions that do not allow them to be vaccinated, and babies who are too young to be vaccinated rely on the immunity of those around them to protect them from serious infectious diseases. 4 Value of Immunizations Timely routine vaccination of children protects community health, prevents outbreaks, and saves money and lives. The federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, implemented in 1994, assures affordable access to all routi ne vaccines for children who are without private insurance coverage. In Tennessee, over 600 providers across the state are enrolled as VFC providers and there is at least one VFC provider in each of Tennessee's 95 counties. CDC has reported that the routine vaccines given to U.S. children born between 1994 and 2018 will prevent an average of 419 million childhood illnesses and prevent the premature death of 936,00 of these children over their lifetimes. 5 Additionally, CDC calculates that vaccination of each U.S. birth cohort according to the current immunization schedule yields a net savings of nearly $406 billion in direct medical costs and $1.9 trillion in total costs to society. 6 With roughly two percent of the U.S. population living in Tennessee, this suggests Tennessee has benefitted from the prevention of approximately 8.4 million cases of disease in the past decade, with annual savings of $8.1 billion in direct medical costs and $38 billion in total costs to society. In Tennessee, unvaccinated and under -vaccinated children have comprised substantial proportions of reported vaccine -preventable infections such as measles, mumps, and pertussis (whooping cough) . Most children who die each year from seasonal influenza are unvaccinated. 7,8 These diseases not only place Tennesseans at risk for significant morbidity and mortality, but also create significant fiscal burden upon the State . Even small outbreaks place tremendous strain upon our public health system and divert attention from other critical public health initiatives. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 10 Vaccines Assessed This survey assesses vaccine completion according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) recommendations for protection against ten serious illnesses before the age of 24 months: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (combined as DTaP), mumps, rubella (combined (HBV), varicella (VAR), and Streptococcus pneumoniae or \"pneumococcus\" (PCV). Combined, these are known as the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series. 9 Additionally, this survey analyzes completion of hepatitis A (HAV), rotavirus (RTV), and seasonal influenza (Flu) vaccines. Table 1. ACIP List of Diseases to Prevent through Vaccination of Children < 24 Months of Age Disease(s) Possible complications of disease Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTaP) Diphtheria : upper airway obstruction, pneumonia, respiratory failure, death Tetanus : spasms of respiratory and skeletal muscles, death Pertussis : severe, long -term cough, vomiting, breathlessness, death in infants Poliomyelitis (IPV) Paralysis, death Measles, cardiac problems, encephalitis, death Mumps : decreased fertility, meningitis, arthritis, hearing impairment Rubella: arthritis, encephalitis, birth defects Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) Pneumonia, meningitis, neurologic problems, death Hepatitis B (HBV) Fulminant cancer, cirrhosis, premature death Varicella ( VAR/Chickenpox) Rash illness, severe disease in immunocompromised, birth defects, encephalitis, death Pneumococcus (PCV) Ear infections, pneumonia, meningitis, blood stream infections, death Hepatitis A (HAV) fever, nausea, jaundice, death Influenza (Flu) secondary pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic diseases, hospitalizations, death Rotavirus (RTV) dehy dration, hospitalization, death IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 11 Vaccine Completion Logic Complete on -time immunization in this survey is defined as having received four doses of DTaP vaccine, three doses of IPV vaccine, one dose of MMR vaccine, three or four doses of HIB vaccine (depending on brand received or any child clinically considered complete based on the CDC's \"catch -up\" schedule), three doses of HBV vaccine, one dose of VAR vaccine and four doses of PCV vaccine (or any child clinically considered complete based on the CDC's \" catch - up\" schedule). This survey accounts for the vaccine brand, if known, and classifies a child as complete only if the appropriate number of doses have been administered. I f any documented HIB dose was given as the four -dose product, then only receipt of four doses was considered as a complete series. In the absence of documentation of vaccination brand, receipt of four doses of HIB is classified as series completion. Likewise, if any documented RTV dose was given as the three -dose product, then only receipt of three doses was considered as a complete series. In the absence of documentation of vaccination brand, three doses of RTV are classified as series completion. This me thodology change accounts for both the vaccine schedule and vaccine brand to ensure that only children who have received the vaccine on the correct schedule and with the correct brand are considered complete. As a result, point estimates for HIB and RTV coverage rates are lower than previous estimates, but also more accurate a nd m ore consistent with methods used by the CDC. In 2019, additional analyses were included to account for the HIB and PCV catch -up schedules. Prior to 2019, counts of vaccinations were used to calculate series completion for both HIB and PCV. However , this method inaccurately captured completion for these vaccines due to the unique vaccination schedules that exist when a child receives their first dose after the recommended age, but prior to 24 months. By assessing completion based upon requirements for the age of first vaccination, HIB and PCV completeness more accurately mirrors ACIP forecasting and clinical decision -making. Table 2. Catch -Up Guidance for PCV and HIB, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 10 Age at Dose 1 Age at Dose 2 Age at Dose 3 Recommendation PCV < 12 months old < 12 months old < 12 months old Needs 4th dose 8 weeks later < 12 months old Between 7 -11 months old Needs 3rd dose 8 weeks later > 12 months old Needs 2nd dose 8 weeks later 24-25 months No additional dose needed HIB < 12 months old < 12 months old < 12 months old Needs 4th dose 8 weeks later < 12 months old Between 12 -14 months old Needs 3rd dose 8 weeks later < 12 months old > 15 months old No additional dose needed Between 12 -14 months Needs 2nd dose 8 weeks later > 15 months old No additional dose needed IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 12 Special Vaccine Considerations Hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) HAV is a two- dose series, starting on or after the first birthday. As the recommended dose spacing is six months, children who have only one dose by the second birthday are still on schedule. For this reason, this survey reports 24 -month -old children as up- to-date with one dose of HAV. HAV will not be compared to HP2020 objectives in this report, as the HP2020 objective reflects completion of the 2 -dose series. Tennessee experienced a multi -state epidemic of acute hepatitis A that began in 2017 and spanned more than two and a half years. Over the course of the outbreak, 3,149 Tennesseans were infected, 1,923 were hospitalized, and 28 died because of their illness . Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) birth dose HBV birth dose is one dose of HBV vaccine , given bet ween 24 hours and three days of life. In 2016, CDC revised its guidance to recommend routine administration of a hepatitis B birth dose within 24 hours of life (rather than prior to hospital discharge). This survey utilizes the maximum number of days pa st birth (3 days) to evaluate HBV birth dose. This method also aligns with the HP2020 objective for HBV birth dose which is also classified as one dose of HBV within 3 days of life. Birth dose hepatitis B is a key strategy to eliminate transmission of the hepatitis B virus from an infected mother to her infant. The Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Immunizations Program (VPDIP) manages the cases of more than one hundred infants who are exposed to the hepatitis B virus through their infected mothers each year. These infants are at high risk of chronic liver disease and early death, which can be avoided with appropriate vaccination. Influenza vaccine (F lu) Influenza vaccine (F lu) is given annually to children aged six months and older; two doses should be given during a child's first influenza season. Because protection is conferred only after two doses for this populations, this survey measures the proportion of children who hav e received two or more doses by their second birthday. Many children who die each year from influenza failed to receive an annual influenza vaccination. Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (HIB) HIB is either a three or four -dose series, starting on or after the second month of life . Two HIB schedules exist, depending upon the vaccine used. The full series (FS) of the Merck \u00a9 product requires three doses; the FS of the Sanofi Pasteur\u00a9 product requires four doses. Any mixed -brand schedule requires four doses. Any child receiving one or more doses of the 4 -dose HIB product must have received four doses before the 25th month of life to be considered complete and on -time. This classification by HIB product s administered reduces the degree of overestimation of on-time completion demonstrated by past reports. Since the introduction of the HIB vaccine in 1987, the annual incidence of invasive Hib disease in children aged younger than 5 years old decreased by 9 9%. 11 In 2022, Tennessee had fewer than 5 reported case s of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) statewide. Rotavirus vaccine (RTV) RTV is either a t wo or three -dose series, starting on or after the second month of life. As with HIB vaccine, two rotavirus vaccine products are available with different dosing schedules. Rotateq \u00a9 (Merck), requires three doses; Rotarix\u00a9 (GSK) requires two doses. Mixed brand schedules require three doses. RTV is unique among vaccines as the series must be initiated no later than 15 weeks of age and no doses should be given after eight months of age. Prior to the introduction of the vaccine in 2006, RTV was the leading cause of leading cause of severe diarrhea among infants and young children. Each year, the vaccine prevents an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 hospitalizations among U.S. infants and young children. 12 IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 13 Healthy People 2020 objectives Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) objectives were established by the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide national targets for population health that were to be achieved prior to January 1, 2020. These objectives included vaccine cov erage rates among children 19 -35 months of age and were tracked nationally through the National Immunization Survey (NIS). Although HP2020 ended, TDH continues to strive to reach or exceed each of these targets as quickly as possible and maintain those high rates of immunization coverage among children. The followi ng objectives for the percentage of children immunized between 19 -35 months of age were established by HP2020 and are relevant comparisons to the results of this survey: 80% complete t he 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series 90% complete each individual vaccine inclu ded in the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series 80% complete rotavirus vaccination with two or more doses 70% complete influenza vaccination with two or more doses 85% of all children receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within three days of life Healthy People 2030 Objectives Healthy People 2030 (HP2030) objectives are established by the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide national targets for population health to be achieved prior to January 1, 2030. These objectives include vaccine coverage rates among children 2 years of age and are tracked nationally through the National Immunization Survey (NIS). TDH aims to reach or exceed each of these targets as quickly as possible and maintain those high rates of immunization coverage among children. The following objectives for the percentage of children immunized by 2 years of age have been established by HP2030 and are relevant comparisons to the results of this survey: 90% complete DTaP vaccination with four or more doses 90.8% complete MMR vaccination with one or more doses 1.3% of children receive 0 doses of recommended vaccinations Although HP2030 has established new objectives, Tennessee did not meet all objectives of HP2020 and will continue to use relevant HP2020 o bjectives as comparison measures in this report. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 14 Methods Survey Design The annual Immunization Status S urvey of 24 -month -old Children in Tennessee utilizes a retrospective cohort research design to determine the up- to-date (UTD) immunization rates for 24 -month -old children born in the state of Tennessee. The survey is composed of targeted random samples drawn from birth certificates of 1,5 74 (comprised of approximately 121 children from each of the 13 health department regions) infants born during the first quarter of 2020 in Tennessee. These children celebrated their second birthdays between January 1 and March 31, 2022 . Identifying information was obtained from electronic birth records and immunization data were collected primarily via the Tennessee Immunization Information System (TennIIS). Immunization rates for the 4:3:1: FS:3:1:FS vaccine series (4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 Hepatitis B, 1 Varicella and 4 PCV vaccine doses) were based on the childhood immunization and catch-up schedules recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention (CDC) in 20 22. During the three- month data collection period, each immunization date was compared to the child's birth date to determine whether it was administered before or after 24 months of age and if it was a valid administ ered vaccine according to the ACIP vaccine schedule. If all of the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS vaccine dates occurred before the child reached 24 months of age or if the series was completed according to the CDC's catch -up schedule guidance, the child was classified a s up -to-date by 24 months. Children were excluded from the up -to-date by 24 months classification if at least one of the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS dates occurred after the child reached 24 months of age and did not meet the ACIP on -time or CDC catch -up schedule reco mmendations. A rate was calculated, up- to-date ( UTD by 24 months ( as reported to TennIIS ), served to ascertain how accurately TennIIS data reflect UTD immunization rates by 24 months of age, without parent/provider contact. Immunization rates of the UTD by 24 months ( with data collection ) were calculated for the entire sample and health region- specific samples. The UTD immunization rate s were also calculated for demographic subgroups within these samples. 1 Infants in WIC have immunization records reviewed at WIC visits. Targeted education and telephone follo w-up are the primary tools used to encourage catch -up immunization of WIC infants. Target Population and Sample Selection A random sample of 1,574 children born between January 1 and March 31, 2020, was selected to represent all children born in Tennessee in 2020 (approximately 81,188 live births) . The sample was stratified by health jurisdiction to generate regional estimates. The sample size per region depend s on the number of children born in that region and the racial demographic represented in that region. Data Collection Passive Data Collection Data pertaining to the survey sample was requested from: electronic birth records supplied by Tennessee Department of Health, Office of Vital Records and Statistics , the Tennessee Women, Infants, and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program (WIC) and TennIIS. Information from electronic birth records was used for sample selection and as a source of demographic data. The type of information obtained on each child included : Child's first, middle and last name Child's sex, race , ethnicity, and date of birth Mother's residential county Mother's first and last name Father's first and last name Mother's level of education, marital status, and age at delivery Father's level of education and age at delivery The WIC enrollment variable was determined for each child by matching each child's name and date of birth with WIC enrollment data. Children enrolled in WIC for any amount of time during the first 24 months of life were designated as \"enrolled in WIC\". If a child was only ever enrolled in WIC, the \"Program Enrollment\" variable was determined to be \"WIC Only.\" 1 The TennCare (Medicaid) enrollment variable was determined for each child by matching each child's name and date of birth with TennCare enrollment data. Children enrolled in TennCare for any amount of t ime during the first 24 months of life were designated as \"enrolled in TennCare\". If a child was only ever enrolled in TennCare , the \"Program Enrollment\" variable was determined to be \"TennCare Only.\" If a child was found to have ever been enrolled in Tenn Care and IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 15 WIC, the \"Program Enrollment\" variable was determined to be \"TennCare and WIC Enrollment.\" The \" Vaccination Source \" variable was determined based on the location where each individual vaccine was administered. If a child received vaccines exclusively in private provider offices, the child was classified as \" Private Medical Provider Only.\" If a child received vaccines exclusively in public clinics, the child was classified as \"Health Department Only.\" If a child received vaccines in both private provider offices and public clinics, the child was classified as \"Both Private Medical Provider and Health Department .\" If a vaccination source was unable to be determined, it was defined as \"Unknown Vaccination Source.\" Vaccinations given before 28 days of age were typically administered in hospital; they are considered as \"Private Medical Provider\" in provider type calculations. Active Data Collection An electronic web- based data collection system called REDCap was used to collect information for each child in the sample. The sampling frame, determined from birth records, was imported into REDCap to review immunization histories from TennIIS . TennIIS follows the recommended schedule of childhood immunizations approved by the ACIP to determine complete vaccine histories. The REDCap data collection system contains six distinct sections to be completed by the public health data collectors: Demographics (child), Demographics (paren ts), TennCare and WIC Status, Survey Eligibility and Exemption Status , Providers and Immunization History , Notes . Data collection was carried out by county and regional public health nurses. An initial immunization history check was performed by a VPDIP epidemiologist via TennIIS data to determine the up-to-date ( UTD ) status of the sample. If a child was UTD at this point, the child was noted as \"Complete, Based on Initial TennIIS Record s,\" and no longer required follow -up. If a child was not UTD at this point, the data collection process was passed to the regional staff, with the dates found in TennIIS already entered in the REDCap system. Data collectors used the following protocol: Step 1: Search for immunization records Data collectors reviewed TennIIS records or health department records for additional immunization history. If the child's immunization record was still incomplete, the data collectors proceeded to Steps 2 and 3. Step 2: Contact the parent(s) and/or guardian(s) Data collectors used contact information from the birth certificate, or any updated information found at the health department, provider's office or in TennIIS to contact the child's parent/guardian. Parents were then contacted by phone and/or by letter and asked to provide an immunization history or the location of immunization information for their child (i.e., the name of the doctor or clinic office). In some cases, representatives made home visits. If parents disclosed that they chos e not to vaccinate their children for any reason, the child was classified as \"Refused Vaccination\" and further grouped into refusal reason categories based on information received from the parent. The reason s for vaccine refusal are separated into three categories: religious, philosophical, or medical. Step 3: Contact private physician(s) Data collectors contacted private physicians by phone or fax and requested the child's immunization history. Step 4: Data checked for accuracy Using the REDCap system, data collectors completed follow up on all children by the end of the three -month data collection period. All completed records were reviewed by a VPDIP epidemiologist throughout the process. Attempts were made to resolve any unclear information before data cleaning. Data Analysis Up-to-date (UTD) immunization rates were calculated using each individual vaccine date for each participant. An immunization was classified as given prior to the 24-month birthday if the difference between the dose date and the child's date of birth was equal to or less than 24 months; this was the case even for dates that were not originally found in the child's TennIIS record. For a child to be considered UTD by 24 months, all the doses in the 4:3:1: FS:3:1:FS series had to be given within 24 months of the child's birth date or had to meet the CDC catch -up conditions by 24 months. Statewide immunization rates are calculated, as well as rates for the six major metropolitan counties and seven rural regions. County rates within the rural regions are not calculated due to the small number of children sampled in each county. Completion of on-time immunization in the 202 2 survey of Tennessee 24 -month -old children is defined as receipt of four doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, three doses of inactivated polio virus (IPV) vaccine, one dose of IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 16 measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, thr ee or four doses of Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB) vaccine (depending on brand received) or any child clinically considered complete for HIB based on the CDC's \"catch - up\" schedule, three doses of hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine, one dose of varicella (VAR) v accine and four doses of pneumococcal conjugate (PCV) vaccine or any child considered complete for PCV based on the CDC's \"catch - up\" schedule. Combined, these are known as the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series. Additionally, this survey analyzes hepatitis A vaccine (HAV), rotavirus vaccine (RTV), and seasonal influenza (Flu) vaccines. Since the sampling frame is stratified by region, not every child has the same probability of being selected for the sample. To account for this, sampling weights were calculated based o n the total number of births in each region and were applied when calculating rate estimates. Margins of error are provided for most rate estimates. The margin of error is the 95% confidence interval range, for example, 77.1 \u00b1 2.2 represents the confidence interval ( 74.6, 79.3) for the statewide UTD by 24 months estimate of 77.1 %. Ninety- five percent confidence intervals (CI) are displayed as grey bands on the graphs in this report to permit readers to visualize the statistical significance (or absence of significance) of differences in point estimates (p < 0.05) . Significance testing for differences in rates was performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS), utilizing a 2 -sample t-test for difference of means. Limitations The following describe important limitations of the study that should be considered when interpreting its findings: A. There were five limitations related to sampling: 1) Since the study sample is randomly selected from children born in Tennessee between January and March 202 0, it could not account for variations that may routinely occur in other months of the year. 2) Limiting the sample to children born in three months does not form the basis of a surveillance system capable of detecting changes i n the health care system. 3) There may be children in the eligible sample who were erroneously included in the eligible sample and listed as unable -to-locate. Examples of this type of error would be cases where a child died, was adopted, or was part of a mi litary family, but the child's ineligibility related to these circumstances never became known to the public health data collectors because the child could not be found. 4) The survey is designed to allow valid statistical comparisons of the populations in each of the 13 health department regions; however, the sample size within multi- county regions is too small for meaningful results at the county level or useful comparisons among subpopulations within a region. 5) For the seven multi -county TDH regions (No rtheast [NER], East [SCR], Mid-Cumberland [MCR], West Tennessee [WTR]) in this survey, children were chosen in different proportions from the counties that make up each region. There is no consistent pattern for choosing these participants from year to year. Results are presented as the summation of all counties in that region; therefore, use of the results of this survey for county -level estimates is not appropriate. B. Response rates fo r each region are included on the first and second pages of all regional reports. Response rate is calculated by subtracting the number of \"Unable to Locate\" children by the number of eligible participants and then dividing by the number of eligible participants. Caution should be taken when interpreting immunization rates for a region with a low response rate. The reason for this necessary caution is that the children who are unable -to-locate (UTL) could also be the least up- to-date ( UTD) . However, we cann ot use their immunization history without knowing that it is current, so they must be excluded. Table 2 (pg. 13) shows how the response rate was calculated for the state sample; this same method was used for each of the health department region samples. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 17 SECTION II Statewide Results IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 18 Immunization Rates The up- to-date (UTD) immunization rates as reported to TennIIS by 24 months, and by the end of data collection were calculated using the ACIP's 4 :3:1:FS:3:1:FS vaccination schedule and catch -up schedule. Individual antigen vaccination rates were calculated using the same ACIP guidance. The estimate for the percent UTD for the combination series and individual antigens are displayed in Table 3 along with the accompanying margin of error. Rates that decreased are shown in red in Table 3 and Figure 2. Significant differences (p<0.05) between the 2021 and 2022 rates are italicized and bolded in Table 3. Statewide, the UTD immunization rate as reported to TennIIS was 8.9%, which was lower than the 2021 rate (9.4%). The UTD immunization rate by end of data collection was 77.1%, which was higher than the 2021 rate (74.8%). Most vaccine specific rates changed significantly from the previous year. The rates for Rotavirus, Full Series, and HBV birth dose were the only vaccinations where a significant difference was not observed. The UTD immunization rates and rates by individua l antigen from 2017 to 2022 are show in Figure 2. Immunization Administration Statewide, 34,146 vaccine doses were administered to the study cohort; 32,499 (95.2%) were administered by private providers , 901 (2.6%) were administered by public health providers, and 746 (2.2%) were administered by an unconfirmed source . IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 Tennessee Department of Health | Tennessee Vaccine- Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program | March 2023 Figure 2 shows Tennessee's trend for each individual vaccine series over the six years. The red lines represent HP2020 objectives for each antigen assessed. Tennessee children have not met the HP2020 objective for DTaP, HIB, PCV, RTV , or Influenza anytime in the past six years. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 20 Progress Towards Healthy People Objectives Since 2010 , Tennessee has only meet the HP2020 objective of 80% completion of the 4 :3:1:FS:3: 1:FS series twice, once 2018 and again in 20 20. The state also failed to meet this objective for 2022 with the 4:3: 1:FS:3:1:FS series completion being 77.1 %, represented by the navy bar in Figure 3 . In 2022, Tennessee met four out of the twelve individual vaccine HP2020 objectives (Polio, MMR, Hep B, and Varicella) and one of two vaccine specific HP2030 objectives. The third HP2030 objective is to limit the percentage of children who receive zero doses of recommended vaccines by age two years to 1.3% . Which Tennessee also failed to meet with a rate of children with no vaccines at 1.6% . The HP2020 objective for HAV is based on completion of the two -dose series; however, Tennessee only measures one dose of HAV because children who receive the first dose by their second birthday must wait at least six months before receiving the second dose . As a result, the survey rate is not comparable to the HAV HP2020 objective. The overall statewide coverage estimate for the full, recommended 4 :3:1:FS:3:1:FS series is shown in Figure 3. The light blue bars represent the individual antigens that make up the 4 :3:1:FS:3 :1:FS series, the navy bar is the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series , and the dark grey bars represent the additional antigens assessed in the survey. The red lines represent HP2020 objectives for each antigen assessed and the lighter grey bands represent the 95% Confidence Intervals (CI ). IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 21 2022 Sample Population Ineligibility & Participation Refusal Of the 1,574 children originally sampled for the survey, 80 children were determined to be ineligible for the survey and 23 children had guardians refuse survey participation. Ineligibility is defined as children who moved out of the state, for whom the birth record was sealed ( e.g., through adoption or placement i n foster care), and children who had died . After these children were removed from the survey, 1,471 eligible children were retained. Unable to Locate (UTL) Of the 1,471 eligible children included in the survey, 72 had incomplete information in the Tennessee Immunization Information System (TennIIS) and could neither be located nor confirmed as having moved out of state. Overall, 4.9% (72/1471) of eligible chi ldren were unable to be located for survey participation. Due to the inability to accurately assess the immunization status of these children due to incomplete records, they were removed from the survey. Final Sample Size & Response Rate The final sample size for the survey was 1,399, 88.9% (1399/1574) of the original sampled children and 95.1% (1399/1471) of the eligible sampled children. The response rate to the 2022 immunization status survey 95.1%. Th e 2022 response rate wa s lower than previous years with 2021 hav ing a response rate of 96.3% (1439/1495). IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 22 Vaccine Refusals There were 31 (2. 1%) documented vaccine refusals reported among the final records kept for analysis (n=1399) after removal of ineligible children , parents who refused survey participation, and children who were unable to be located. (Table 4 -C). Fourteen parents claimed re ligious reasons , sixteen claimed philosophical reasons , and one claimed medical reasons . Regionally, vaccine -refusals ranged from 0. 9% to 6.5 % of the sampled populations . Eight of the 31 children whose parents refused vaccines were partially immunized (ranging from 1-21 total doses). Parents of four of the eight partially immunized children cited religious reasons and four cited philosophical reasons for refusal of vaccines. In 2022, vaccine refusals decreased from 3. 0% to 2. 1% (31/1399). The percentage of children who did not receive one or more vaccinations due to medical reasons remained consistently low (<1.0%), while religious and philosophical refusals have continued to fluctuate. In 2022, 1.0% (n=14) of refusals were religious refusals and 1.1% (n=16) were philosophical. A year over year comparison of UTD children and children whose guardians refused vaccines can be shown in F igure 4-A. Figure 4 -B is a year over year breakdown of the 2022 refusals by refusal type. Table 4 -C contains a regional breakdown of 2022 refusals by refusal type. Tennessee TCA 1200 -14-01-29 describes minimum immunization requirements for attending childcare, pre - school, and public school. The state's immunization requirements follow the current schedule published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C DC) and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). A ll 50 states have legislation requiring specified vaccines for students, including for attendance at childcare centers . IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 23 IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 24 Demographics The demographic breakdown of the survey sample alongside the UTD immunization rates by demographic groups are displayed in Table 4 -D. Significant differences (p<0.05) in UTD by 24 -month rates between demographic subgroups are italicized and bolded . NOTE: Brackets are used to indicate significantly different results between subgroups. Groups with statistically significant differences (p- value < 0.05) in UTD by 24 -month rates were: Ethnicity Siblings Vaccination Source Father Age Parent Education (Mother and Father) Marriage Status IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 25 Risk Factor Analysis Many risk factors can compound to affect a child's likelihood to attain UTD vaccination status. These risk factors include safety net program enrollment, immunization source, number of siblings, age at first vaccination , race, and many more factors that are not evaluated in this survey. It is important to note that in this section no one risk factor c an completely explain why a child may or may not be UTD. In 2022, c hildren immunized in health departments were more likely to have risk factors for failure to receive immunizations compared to children who were only immunized by private medical providers. This data can be seen in Table 5 and Table 6. Program Enrollment Of the 1,399 children included in this survey, 126 (9.0%) were enrolled in TennCare only , 224 (16.0 %) were enrolled in WIC only , 414 (29.6%) were enrolled in both programs , and 635 ( 45.4%) were not enrolled in any programs . Children were more likely to be up -to-date (UTD) if they were not enrolled in any program (81.6%) or enrolled in TennCare only (77.0%) and less likely to be UTD if they were only enrolled in WIC (69.6%) or in both TennCare and WIC (74.2%). In 2022, children who were covered by TennCare and WIC had 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series completion rates that were not significantly different (p<0.05) from their non- enrolled peers. This data ca n be seen in Table 4 -D and Figure 5. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 26 Immunization Source Of the children sampled, 1288 (92.1%) were immunized by a private medical provider, 18 (1.3%) children sampled were immunized by a health department only, 59 (4.2%) children sampled were immunized by both a private provider and a health department, and 34 (2.4%) children sampled had records that were missing an immunization sour ce. Children who received vaccines exclusively from a private medical provider were statistically significantly (p<0.05) more likely to be UTD (79.0 %) compared to children vaccinated by a health department only ( 53.6%) , by a combination of private provider and health department ( 82.0 %) or by those missing a vaccination source (7.6%). This data can be seen in Table 4 -D, Table 5, and Figure 6. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 27 Impact of Siblings on Immunization Completion Of the 1,399 children included in the survey, 5 66 (40.5 %) had no siblings, 468 (33.5 %) had one sibling, and 365 (26.1 %) had two or more siblings. As the number of siblings increased, there was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of children who were complete for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series. While 84. 8% children with no siblings were complete, only 78.2 % one sibling and 63. 6% with two or more siblings achieved series completion ( Figure 7 ). IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 28 Impact of Age at First Immunization on Immunization Completion Of the children surveyed, 94.7 % (n=1,325) began immunizations prior to 4 months of age and 80. 4% of those children were completely immunized for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series by 24 months of age, compared to only 32.5% (n= 40) of the 40 children who received immunizations after 4 months of age. This suggests that c hildren who do not receive immunization s prior to 4 months of age are at higher risk of remaining under vaccinated at age 2 years (Figure 8) . IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 29 Immunization Rates by Program Enrollment The difference in UTD immunization rate by 24 months between TennCare and WIC -enrolled children and those not enrolled in any program are shown in Table 6 -A for each health region. Statewide, there was no significant difference found between program enrollees and non- enrollees. Children enrolled in WIC had the lowest UTD by 24 months immunization rate (69.9%) compared to children not enrolled in any program (81.6%), children enrolled in TennCare only (77.0%), and children enrolled in both TennCare and WIC (74.2 %). IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 30 Statewide Results and Healthy People Comparison The Healthy People initiative is designed to guide national health promotion and disease prevention efforts to improve the health of the nation. Released by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) every decade since 1980, Healthy People identifies science - based objectives with targets to monitor progress and focus action. Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) included 12 immunization - related objectives. Implement ation across the nation began in 2010 with the expectation that the objectives would be achieved by 2020. In 2020, new HP2030 objectives, including three immunization -related objectives , were devel oped. Results of the state attainment of HP2020 and HP2030 objec tives can be see n in Table 6 -B. In Table 6 -B HP2020 attainment is denote by green fill while HP2030 attainment is denoted by bold text . IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 31 Racial Disparity The 2022 survey population included 196 non -Hispanic Black children and 1,167 Non -Hispanic W hite children. Due to small sample size, children of other races (n= 36) and Hispanic ethnicity ( n=153) were excluded from this analysis . The final sample for racial analysis consisted of 1,363 children. Non -Hispanic Black children were less likely to be fully immunized for all twelve of the recommended CDC vaccinations. This gap was larger in DTaP, Polio, 4:31:FS:3:1:FS, Influenza, and RTV compared to their Non -Hispanic White peers. Completion of the full childhood series (4 :3:1:FS:3 :1:FS) has been consistently lower for non -Hispanic Black children than non-Hispanic W hite children. The series completion rate was 3.0% lower among non-Hispanic Black children (74.5%) when compared to non -Hispanic White children (77.5%). Additionally, in 202 2, 33.2% of non -Hispanic B lack children received at least two doses of influenza vaccine compared to 50.4% of non -Hispanic White children. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 32 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Impact on Pediatric Morbidity and Mortality Children younger than 2 years old are at high risk of developing serious flu -related complications. These complications include pneumonia, dehydration, exacerbation of chronic illnesses (such as asthma), brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), and death. During the 2020 - 2021 flu seas on, only one child was reported as dying from influenza within the United States , this is the lowest reported influenza related death rate in a decade. The CDC contributes the low death rate to COVID -19 mitigation measures such as wearing face masks, stayi ng home, hand washing, school closures, reduced travel, increased ventilation of indoor spaces, and physical distancing, Additionally, a record number of influenza vaccine doses (193.8 million doses) were distributed in the U.S. during 2020 -2021 . 13 The annual seasonal influenza vaccine helps save lives and reduce severe illness. Despite its benefits, influenza vaccine remains the least administered of the recommended immunizations in Tennessee. Only 57.0% of all children surveyed in 2022 had at least one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine, 47.2% had two doses, and 20.8% received the recommended three doses of influenza vaccine prior to the second birthday. Missed influenza vaccinations increase the risk of morbidity and mo rtality among Tennesseans of all ages. Figure 11 shows the number of flu vaccines received per child. Flu vaccine is given annually to children aged six months and older; two doses should be given during a child's first influenza season to confer protection. This survey measures the proportion of childr en who have received two or more doses by their second birthday. However, an additional dose after the initial two dose series of flu vaccine is recommended for children annually until age seven to be fully covered. As seen in Figure 11 , children in Tennes see are extremely under -vaccinated for influenza. Many children who die each year from influenza failed to receive an annual influenza vaccination. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 33 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in First Year of Life Of the 1,399 children surveyed, 42.7% received their first flu vaccine between 6 months and one year of age. In 2022, there statistically significantly fewer children who received their first dose of influenza vaccine between 6 months and one year of age compared to 2021. Flu data stratified by region can be seen in Figure 13 . Chattanooga -Hamilton County Region (36.8%) and East Tennessee Region (42.6%) were health department regions where there are statistically significantly fewer children who received their first dose of influenza vaccine between 6 months and one year of age compared to 2021. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 34 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine & Racial Disparity Influenza remains the individual vaccine with the lowest completion rate and most significant racial disparity. This difference has been documented annually since the first assessment of influenza coverage rates in 2007. In 2022, 33.2% of non -Hispanic B lack received at least two doses of influenza vaccine compared to 50.4% of non-Hispanic W hite children ( Figure 1 4). The causes are likely multifactorial and account for a 17.2 % difference in completion rate non -Hispanic Black and non -Hispanic White children . Strategies to address the protection of this population are needed. ACIP recommends all children over the age of 6 months receive annual influenza vaccine. Of the 1,399 surveyed children, 42.7% received their first dose between 6 months and one year of age. Non -Hispanic White children were more likely to receive their first dose of influenza vaccine before their first birthday than non-Hispanic B lack children ( 45.2 % compared to 27.6 %, respectively) (Figure 15). IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 Tennessee Department of Health | Tennessee Vaccine- Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program | March 2023 Opportunities for Improvement Fourth DTaP Figure 16 compares the regional percentages of children immunized with three and four doses of DTaP vaccine. The complete DTaP immunization rate for Tennessee was 81.3%; however, 93.9% of children had at least three doses of DTaP. The regional differences between r eceipt of three doses of DTaP vaccine compared to receipt of four doses of DTaP vaccine ranges from 3.9% to 20.8%. For a child to be properly protected against dipht heria, tetanus, and pertussis, a fourth dose of D TaP is necessary between 15 -18 months of a ge. If all children who received three doses of D TaP received their fourth dose, Tennessee's coverage would increase by 12.6% and surpassed the HP2020 objective for D TaP immunization (90%). IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 36 CDC Catch -up vs ACIP schedule In 2019, TDH implemented analysis for the CDC's alternative \"catch -up\" vaccine schedule to account for children whose vaccinations ha d been delayed but were still complete before 24 months . Specifically, a change in logic to determine series completion was made to account for children who began HIB or PCV vaccination outside of the ACIP -recommended age but prior to 24 months. This alternative vaccina tion timing is often referred to as a \" catch -up\" schedule . In 2022, 285 (20.4%) of the 1,399 children surveyed were vaccinated according to a catch -up schedule. Of these, 108 (37.9%) were considered complete for HIB vaccine (Figure 17) . Of the 251 (17.9%) children vaccinated with PCV after the ACIP recommended age, 184 (73.3%) were considered complete for PCV vaccine (Figure 18) . IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 37 Regional Immunization Rates State -wide, the UTD immunization coverage rate by 24 months was 77.1%. This rate varied per region ranging from 64.3% to 92.3%. The five regions with the highest UTD immunization rates by 24 months are shown in green, while the five regions with the lowest UTD immunization rates by 24 months are shown in red (Figure 19 and Table 7). Response rates for each region are included on the second page of all regional reports (Section III). Caution should be taken when interpreting immunization rates for a region with a low response rate because children who were classified as unable -to-locate could also be the least UTD but must be excluded. The difference between coverage rates as reported to TennIIS alone compared to UTD at 24 mo nths of age after manual investigation can also be noted in the regional reports in Section III. This difference suggests that many providers do not report all administered vaccines to TennIIS, which is expected in the setting of a voluntary reporting system. Encouraging physician practices to voluntarily report complete immunization events and to utilize TennIIS for immunization documentation would improve the ability of the statewide immunization registry to inform providers and public healt h about immunization practices across the state. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 38 Immunization Success Measures by Region This study is conducted at the state level and allows for uniform data analysis covering all 13 health regions in Tennessee. Individual vaccine measures can indicate an individual health region's success in achieving high UTD rates by 24 months of age among their childhood population. Please refer to Table 8 for a list of these success measures and the first, second, and third- placing health regions as applicable to each measure. The top portion of the table addresses the regions who have the highest immunization coverage rates and response rates as well as one -year increases. The lower portion of the table addresses the vaccine antigen- specific coverage rates by 24 months and only includes 2022 results. Region Immunization Champions are those ranking in the top three for any of the categories . IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 39 Summary of Key Findings Below is the summary of coverage rates relative to Health People (HP) 2020 and 2030 objectives: Tennessee's statewide completion of the 4:3:1:FS:1:3:FS full series would exceed the HP2020 coverage goal of 80% if the children sampled in this survey had received an additional immunization visit in their second year of life to receive a fourth dose of DTaP vaccine. As the fourth dose may be a dministered as early as age 12 months if at least 6 months has elapsed since the third dose, a recommendation to administer the fourth dose at the 12- month visit should be considered to achieve the HP2020 coverage goal. Hepatitis B has remained above the HP2020 objective of 90% as seen in the previous decade. This is potentially due to the initiation of the vaccine series administered by hospital staff within 24 hours of birth. Tennessee did not reach 80% coverage for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS at any point in th e past decade nor did it meet the goal in 2022. Black children were less likely than white children to be completely immunized according to CDC recommendations. In 202 2, parents of 2. 1% of the surveyed children reported refusing some or all immunizations, compared to 3.0% in 2021. In 2021, 1.6 % of Tennessee children received zero doses of recommended vaccines, failing to meet the HP2030 objective of limiting the percentage of children who receive zero doses of recommended vaccines by age two years to 1.3%. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 40 Discussion Overal l, vaccination rates among children in Tennessee remain high. H owever, the threat of previously eliminated vaccine- preventable diseases across the United States demonstrates the importance of continued vigilance. Ensuring that medically eligible children can be fully vaccinated on- time and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended childhood immunization schedule is critical. The results from this report suggest that recent efforts to improve coverage rates may be succeeding. The improvement seen in 2022 did not yet return overall vaccine coverage to where it was prior to 2020 . Tennessee currently only meets four of the twelve HP2020 objectives and one of the three HP2030 targets for 24 -month -old children. While vaccination rates among children in Tennessee increased in recent years prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, the pandemic has had a considerable negative impact on the vaccination rate of children. Efforts must be made to provide vaccinations to children who have fallen behind with routine childhood vaccinations for Tennessee to minimize outbreak risk of highly infectious, vaccine -preventable, diseases. Providers are encouraged to recall patients who have missed vaccinations and provide vaccinations at every opportunity, regardless of the reason for an office visit. Efforts around immunization education, addressing vaccine hesitancy and countering vaccine misinformation, are important. Delayed vaccine s chedules and missed vaccinations increase risk for morbidity and mortality from vaccine- preventable disease for all Tennesseans. As seen in the survey, most parents in Tennessee vaccinate their children on time and according to the CDC recommendations . Of the 1, 399 children surveyed, only 2.1% (n= 31) reported objection or refusals . Religious reasons were cited by 1. 0% of parents, philosophical reasons were cited by 1.1 % of parents, and medical reasons were cited by 0.1% of parents. As Tennessee law allows only religious and medical exemptions in lieu of complete immunization as required for public school entry, philosophical objections often transition to complete vaccination or the declaration of religious exemption prior to school entry. 3 Critical Elements for Vaccination Three elements are critical to ensuring that every medically eligible child in Tennessee is fully immunized on -time and according to the CDC's recommended childhood vaccination schedu le: 1. Continued parental and community education about the safety, efficacy, and critical importance of childhood immunization and the severity of the diseases they prevent 2. Ready access to, and provision of, immunizations at every opportunity 3. Reliable and readily accessible immunization records that ensure immunizations are provided on -time while avoiding duplication 4 Key Strategies for Improving Immunization Rates Among 24 -month -old Children 1. Parental and community education and messaging around the safety, efficacy, and critical importance of childhood immunizations Parents should seek credible sources of vaccine information and the advice of their child's medical provider when seeking information about vaccines. Public health and healthcare providers should provide strong and credible messages that \"vaccines are safe, vaccines are effective, and vaccines save lives\". 2. Ready access to, and provision of, vaccinations at every opportunity Maintain the federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program to ensure that children who are covered by TennCare or otherwise lack insurance coverage for vaccines can receive them free of charge through a statewide network of healthcare providers and local departments of he alth. Expansion of this network of VFC Providers will provide more opportunities to vaccinate children. Medical providers should review vaccine records and administer missing vaccinations at every opportunity. The Tennessee Immunization Information System (TennIIS) is built to evaluate UTD status with the ACIP forecast schedule for each patient . Physicians should utilize TennIIS to identify gaps in immunizations, especially DTaP and Flu, at every opportunity. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 41 3. Reliable and readily accessible vaccination records that ensure vaccinations are provided on- time while avoiding duplication Continue to promote the Tennessee Immunization Information System, \"TennIIS\" ( www.TennesseeIIS.gov ). TennIIS is an online immunization registry that is available to all immunizing providers, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, and includes a suite of tools which may help to improve immunization rates among children and adults. Promote standards implemented in 2017 requiring clinics participating in the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program to report all immunizations administered to children under 19 years of age to TennIIS. This enables providers to use system features designed to improve patient immunization services, such as vaccine forecasting, practice -based patient reminders and immunization coverage rate reports. Remind all vaccinating providers to report all administered vaccination to TennIIS. Reporting all immunizations to an Immunization Information System (IIS) such as TennIIS improves healthcare by establishing a permanent immunization record that is available to all healthcare providers. TennIIS is linked to the electronic health record (EHR) systems of hundreds of medical facilities and pharmacies statewide, allowing for seamless electronic immunization record reporting from those systems. Promote TennIIS t o medical providers for a validated immunization certificate, which families use for daycare, school, college entry, and employment requirements. Provider participation in TennIIS is critical to build these lifelong records and to ensuring all Tennesseans are appropriately vaccinated. 4. Policy Educate decision -makers about the impact of non -medical exemptions on immunization rates. States without non - medical exemptions have higher overall immunization rates than states which allow non -medical exemptions. Provide updated provider guidance and recommendations helps to optimize each visit and ensure that children are completely protected from vaccine preventable diseases in a safe and timely schedule. 5 Recommendations to Improve Immunization Coverage in 24- month -old Children in Tennessee The following recommendations may improve on- time immunization of Tennessee children: 1. Vaccination records should be examined for completeness at every medical visit, regardless of the reason for the visit, and vaccinations should be provided at every opportunity. Given the significant reduction in vaccinations provided to children during the COVID -19 pandemic, it is critical to the health of all Tennesseans to ensure every child is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC r ecommended childhood vaccination schedule. 2. Medical providers should implement strategies that alert parents when their children are due or overdue for booster doses of DTaP, HIB and PCV. Most children who fell short of complete immunization could have achieved series completion with just one additional immunization visit prior to the second birthday. Minority children are especially vulnerable to missing immunizations. 3. Parents and providers should strictly adhere to the early infant schedule of immunizat ions at 2 -, 4-, and 6 -months. Doing so will enable providers to administer the 4th DTaP and all other needed immunizations as early as the first birthday, maximizing the number of opportunities to immunize children on time. 4. All vaccinating providers should enroll in, and report vaccinations to, TennIIS for every patient. The Tennessee Immunization Information System (TennIIS) maintains patient immunization records and special tools which may assist providers in improving the quality of their immunization s ervices. User guides and other TennIIS resources available through the training information posted at www.TennesseeIIS.gov may assist providers in recognizing opportunities to immunize their patients such as: TennIIS provides individual patient forecasting of immunizations due, based upon the patient's immunization history. TennIIS can generate patient reminders using manual, auto dialer, text, or other reminder methods. This feature assists providers in reminding patients of immunization appointments and recalling children who are due or overdue for immunizations. Medical practices may run their own practice -level immunization coverage reports based on their active patients in TennIIS. Coaching on the use of these reports is available in the training section of the TennIIS website. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 42 There are more than 8,300 private medical provider offices enrolled in TennIIS. All immunizing providers should enroll and report immunizations to TennIIS. This will allow for more accu rate shared clinical decision making and the most complete immunization record for Tennesseans. 5. All parents, especially those enrolled in WIC and TennCare, should continue to receive immunization education, immunization record review, and immunization adm inistration at every opportunity.

IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 75 Knox ville -Knox County Region Final Sample Determination The initial 2022 sample for ETR consisted of 121 children born between January and March of 2020 (Table 18-A). After removing children who were determined to be ineligible, declined participation and were unable to be reached, the final sample size for ETR was 1 08. The response rate was calculated by di viding the number of participants in the final sample by the eligible sample. Compared to the previous year, a smaller sample was used for analysis and there was a lower response rate in 2022. Immunization Rates In ETR, the up to date (UTD) immunization rate by 24 months of age was 83.3 %, which was higher than the 2021 rate ( 76.3 %) and the state average (77.1%) (Table 1 8-B). The UTD immunization rate as reported to TennIIS was 812.0 %, lower than the 2021 rate ( 13.2 %) and the state rate (8. 9%). The vaccine -specific rates demonstrate multiple significant differences when compared to the previous year and to the state overall (Table 1 8-B). Most notably Flu in ETR decreased more that 17% but Full Series 4:3:1:FS:3:1FS increased by 7 % in 2022. In Table 18-B, figures in red indicate a decrease in HBV (birth dose )and Flu and italicized and bolded figures indicate a significant difference (p<0.05) in DTaP, IPV, Hib, PCV, HAV and Full Series between 202 1 and 202 2 rates. Immunization Administration Of the 2,674 vaccines doses administered to the CHR children , 2,632 (98.4 %) were administered by private providers, 35 (1.3%) were administered by public health providers and 7 (0.3%) were administered by an unknown source. IMMUNIZATION STATUS SURVEY - 2022 76 Figure 3 0-C shows the KKR trend for each individual vaccine series over the six years.
