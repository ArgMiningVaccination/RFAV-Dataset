He specialized in Public Health in Guatemala where he obtained a Master Degree (1976). He then administered development and research programs in Saudi Arabia and Mali. He came back to Switzerland in 1988. Interested by the mental aspects of medicine, he undertook a specialization in psychiatry and opened a medical practice in Lausanne. Due to his interest for yoga which arose at the age of sixteen, he decided to formally study yoga and ayurvedic medicine. He attends a one year intensive course (1993-1994) in the famous Hindu university of Benares, in India. This university presents the unique characteristic to unite under the same administrative and scientific direction, allopathic and ayurvedic medicine. Dr Martin currently treats his patients with therapies integrating allopathic medicine, ayurvedic medicine, meditation and Yoga. He currently gives seminairs on Ayurveda and meditation.
