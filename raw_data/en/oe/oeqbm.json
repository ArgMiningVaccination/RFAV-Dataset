Vitamin D is used to treat and prevent bone disorders (such as [rickets](https://www.webmd.com/diet/vitamin-d-deficiency), [osteomalacia](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/what-is-osteomalacia)). Vitamin D is made by the body when [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-faq) is exposed to sunlight. [Sunscreen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-366/sunscreen+topical/details), protective clothing, limited exposure to sunlight, dark [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/nutrients-for-healthy-skin), and age may prevent getting enough vitamin D from the sun.Vitamin D with [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/calcium-food-calculator/default.htm) is used to treat or prevent [bone loss](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/osteopenia-early-signs-of-bone-loss) ( [osteoporosis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/understanding-osteoporosis-basics)). Vitamin D is also used with other [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) to treat low levels of calcium or phosphate caused by certain disorders (such as [hypoparathyroidism](https://www.webmd.com/women/hypoparathyroidism-rare), pseudohypoparathyroidism, [familial hypophosphatemia](https://www.webmd.com/children/hypophosphatemia-familial)). It may be used in [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information) to keep calcium levels normal and allow normal bone growth. Vitamin D drops (or other [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/lamm-supplements-diet)) are given to [breast](https://www.webmd.com/women/picture-of-the-breasts)-fed infants because breast milk usually has low levels of vitamin D.

[Vitamin D](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/video/vtamin-d-and-your-health) is best absorbed when taken after a meal but may be taken with or without food. Alfacalcidol is usually taken with food. Follow all directions on the product package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or [pharmacist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/pharmacists-they-do-more-than-fill-prescriptions). If your doctor has prescribed this [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx), take as directed by your doctor. Your dosage is based on your medical condition, amount of sun exposure, diet, age, and response to treatment. If you are using the liquid form of this medication, carefully measure the dose using a special measuring device/spoon. Do not use a household spoon because you may not get the correct dose. If you are taking the chewable tablet or wafers, chew the medication thoroughly before swallowing. Do not swallow whole wafers. If you are taking the rapidly-dissolving tablets, dry your hands before handling the medication. Place each dose on the [tongue](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/picture-of-the-tongue), allow it to dissolve completely, and then swallow it with [saliva](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/what-is-saliva) or water. You do not need to take this medication with water. Certain [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) (bile acid sequestrants such as [cholestyramine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-4803/cholestyramine+light+oral/details)/ [colestipol](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-8111-COLESTIPOL+TABLET+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=6728&drugname=colestipol+oral), [mineral oil](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-32605/mineral+oil+topical/details), [orlistat](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-17220/orlistat+oral/details)) can decrease the absorption of vitamin D. Take your doses of these medications as far as possible from your doses of vitamin D (at least 2 hours apart, longer if possible). It may be easiest to take vitamin D at [bedtime](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/childs-bedtime) if you are also taking these other medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should wait between doses and for help finding a dosing schedule that will work with all your medications.

If you are taking this medication only once a week, remember to take it on the same day each week. It may help to mark your calendar with a reminder. If your doctor has recommended that you follow a special diet (such as a diet high in [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1575/calcium+oral/details)), it is very important to follow the diet to get the most benefit from this medication and to prevent serious side effects. Do not take other [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/lamm-supplements-diet)/ [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/vitamin-expert) unless ordered by your doctor.

If you have any unusual effects, contact your doctor or [pharmacist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/pharmacists-they-do-more-than-fill-prescriptions) promptly. If your doctor has directed you to use this [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx), remember that your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.
