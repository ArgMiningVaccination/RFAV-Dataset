Whether you're allergic to pollen, dust mites, molds, animal dander, certain foods or anything else, symptoms can range from mild to severe. These might include watery or red eyes, itchiness, hives, sneezing and more. Depending on your medical history and the severity of your allergy, allergy shots can be a viable treatment as they often provide long-lasting relief. Read on for a deeper dive into what allergy shots are and how they work, so you can determine whether they might benefit you. What Are Allergy Shots? The origins of allergy shots date back to 1911, and they're an effective form of treatment for many. \"They're a form of immunotherapy, which is a way of trying to change or train your immune system so it doesn't react to your allergens or the things you're allergic to,\" says Jessica Hui, M.D., an allergy and immunology physician at National Jewish Health. Essentially, the goal of allergy shots is to help your body create a lasting tolerance to your allergens. How Do Allergy Shots Work? Allergy shots, or allergen immunotherapy, consist of the substances you're allergic to (called allergens), explains Dr. Hui. For example, if you're allergic to [ragweed pollen](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/ragweed-allergy/) and dog dander, your allergy shot will contain purified allergens associated with both of these. They involve two phases: the build-up phase and the maintenance phase. \"During the build-up phase, you receive your allergy injections one to two times per week. Your allergist will monitor you for about 30 minutes afterwards,\" says Nana Mireku, M.D., a board-certified allergist in Flower Mound, Texas. During the build-up phase, your doctor will inject you with gradually increasing doses of the allergen, building up the amount of allergen administered over time. Over time, your body becomes desensitized to those allergy triggers. Then comes the maintenance phase, which occurs once you've achieved your effective dose, which you will remain on for around 305 days, according to Dr. Mireku. Once you reach this point, there will be longer intervals between your injections, typically every four weeks. Most allergy patients receive shots over a period of three to five years. \"Allergy shots are a lot like vaccines,\" says Manan Shah, M.D., an ear nose and throat surgeon with a focus on breathing and allergy care in Lakewood, Colorado. You'll expose your body to a small dose of what you're allergic to, he says, and then, your body makes antibodies; this changes the way your immune system responds to your allergy triggers. Types of Allergy Shots There are many different types of allergy shots, as they feature custom extracts that are mixed by allergists through a process called compounding. \"Some allergy shots are extracted for environmental allergies like pollen, trees, grasses as well as dust mites, dogs, cats and even [mold](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/mold-allergy/),\" says Dr. Shah. \"Others are made for bee venoms for those who are severely allergic to bees.\" Allergy shots are a form of subcutaneous immunotherapy, but there are other forms of immunotherapy too, including sublingual immunotherapy or SLIT, which are FDA-approved tablets taken under the tongue at home. Finally, sublingual allergy drops are also available. At this time, however, allergy drops are off-label and haven't been approved by the FDA. There are also [allergy medicines](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/best-allergy-medicine/), such as decongestants and antihistamines. These can help improve common [allergy symptoms](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/seasonal-allergies/), like a stuffy or runny nose or sneezing. They might also stop the release of chemicals that lead to allergic reactions. Are Allergy Shots Effective? \"Most people who take allergy shots enjoy a decrease in their allergy symptoms,\" says Dr. Mireku, citing an effectiveness rate of up to 85%. \"So about eight out of every 10 patients who take allergy shots will experience long-term relief. It's important to note that they can take up to a year to become effective.\" Allergy shots in children may prevent the onset of new allergies and even reduce the risk of [asthma](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/asthma/), she adds. Sometimes, however, people will not benefit from allergy shots, due to an inadequate dose. In these cases, it's important to consult your allergist for further investigation. Risks and Side Effects of Allergy Shots Just like many medical treatments, allergy shots do come with some risks and side effects, including skin irritation like itching, fatigue and allergy symptoms right after receiving the shot. Anaphylaxis, which is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction, may also occur, making it important for shots to be performed in a doctor's office under the supervision of a trained physician. \"Most of the serious reactions happen within 30 minutes of the injection, so it is recommended to wait 30 minutes at the doctor's office before leaving,\" says Dr. Hui. \"Many doctors also prescribe an EpiPen for people who are on allergy shots.\" Research indicates that allergy shots do not cause infection. In one [study](http://jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(16)30081-1/fulltext), researchers took a look at more than 3,000 patient records from two large hospitals in Massachusetts [[1]](#footnote_1). These patients received over 130,000 shots over 10 years. During this period, no skin or soft tissue infections or systemic infections were cited. As a result, researchers concluded that additional restrictions on allergy shots aren't necessary. Who Should Take an Allergy Shot Instead of Allergy Medication? \"Allergy shots are a great idea for anyone who's frustrated with their allergies and doesn't want to take over-the-counter antihistamines, like [Claritin or Zyrtec](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/zyrtec-vs-claritin/) or nasal sprays for the rest of their life,\" says Dr. Shah. They might also make sense if you've tried several [allergy medications](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/best-allergy-medicine/) without seeing benefits or are chronically exposed to what you're allergic to and unable to avoid your allergens. If you have a serious condition, such as heart disease or severe [asthma](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/asthma/), however, some experts recommend you avoid allergy shots. "}
