While there is a lot of misinformation out there, we want to provide you with accurate information so that you can make informed decisions about your child's health. The Facts About Vaccines and Autism There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that vaccines cause autism. This myth originated from a 1998 study that has since been discredited and retracted by the medical journal that published it. Numerous studies have been conducted since then, and none have found a link between vaccines and autism. It is important to note that autism is a complex developmental disorder that is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While the exact cause of autism is still unknown, vaccines have been thoroughly studied and have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing serious diseases. Why Vaccines Are Important Vaccines are one of the most important public health interventions in history. They have saved countless lives and prevented the spread of deadly diseases. Vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to recognize and fight off specific viruses and bacteria. By getting vaccinated, you not only protect yourself, but you also protect those around you who may be too young or too sick to get vaccinated themselves. At Nao Medical, we offer a wide range of vaccines for children and adults, including the flu vaccine, HPV vaccine, and more.
