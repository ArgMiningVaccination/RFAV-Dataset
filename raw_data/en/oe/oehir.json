INTRODUCTION Indigenous science is a concept unfamiliar to most Canadian education systems. It is a study of natural systems that contributes to a holistic view of the environment and the role of human beings within that environment. The holistic nature of Indigenous science encompasses intellectual, physical, affective and spiritual domains of learning. Practical applications of Indigenous know ledge are balanced with deeply respectful spiritual practices leading to informed decision -m a k i n g t h a t i s i n t h e b e s t i n t e r e s t o f s e l f , others and the world around us. In undertaking this research, the project team considered the need to voice Aboriginal c ommunity wishes to incorporate cultural teachings within mainstream or other school curricula, but there was also a consideration of the need to help school systems prepare students for career choices within scientific disciplines. Canadian society, prov incial education systems, and local communities face a critical issue in relation to under -representation of Aboriginal1 Peoples in scientific -related careers. Students unable to achieve success in school science at the K -12 level, mean low participation r ates in Canada's booming economic and resource management sectors. For Aboriginal Peoples, this reflects a historic and contemporary problem of equity and social justice with the dismissal of Aboriginal cultural knowledge within school curriculum. Societal demands for sustainable development supports having a variety of scientific professionals steeped within land -based cultural foundations and equipped with the latest scientific knowledge and skills to resolve environmental challenges facing Canada and the rest of the world. Student success in school science must address the idea of learning Indigenous science in relation to Place as well as generalized science curriculum currently available to public, separate and band schools. I n 2 0 0 7 , a g r o u p o f A b o r i g i nal and non -Aboriginal scholars, teachers, administrators, and institutional representatives embarked on the creation of a project entitled Learning Indigenous Science from Place. T h e o v e r a l l g o a l o f t h e p r o j e c t w a s t o i n v e s t i g a t e t h e i n c l u s i o n o f F i r s t N a t i o n s a n d M \u00e9 t i s p e r s p e c t i v e s i n t h e S a s k a t c h e w a n s c h o o l s c i e n c e c u r r i c u l u m a s a w a y t o i m p r o v e t h e a c h i e v e m e n t l e v e l s o f A b o r i g i n a l students. The Canadian Council of Learning pro vided major funding support with in -kind support from project team members. The research commenced under the joint leadership of First Nations University of Canada and the Aboriginal Education Research Centre, University of Saskatchewan. The following page s represent a final report of this research project. As a g roup, w e kne w the r e sults of th e w ork would ha ve c ontinuity and serv e as a starting base t o c ouch further studies and action plans from the foundation of local First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities. The project team utilized a community -based action re search approach wherein information and activities is shared in an open, accountable, and transparent way. The approach was focused on knowledge gathering for the purpose of taking action in addressing pressing community issues (Stringer, 1999). The resear ch model provided a process and avenue through which community members could collectively clarify problems and formulate new visions for the future, implement and test meaningful solutions and thereby generate new knowledge. Our major intent in using the a pproach was to provide space for the perspectives of Aboriginal Peoples who have been previously marginalized from opportunities to envision, develop, and operate policies, programs, and services concealed by the products of other research processes. We ar e indebted to the Elders, teachers, pre -service teachers, university professors, 1 W e u s e t h e t e r m ' A b o r i g i n a l ' i n t h i s f i n a l r e p o r t t o r e f e r s p e c i f i c a l l y t o F i r s t N a t i o n s a n d M \u00e9 t i s c o m m u n i t i e s t h a t a r e t h e f o c u s o f t h e s t u d y .

In addition, we use the term 'Indigenous' to refer to Original peoples worldwide that are connected to place. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 7 and traditional land users who took part in the study and who so graciously shared their words of wisdom with the project team. The intended outcome of using the action resear ch approach is community change using practical solutions generated through the research process that will assist in the development of new programs or modifications to existing policies, school science curriculum, and support services for teachers. The model enables localized, pragmatic strategies to research, investigating particular issues and problems in particular communities, at varying times in the lives of individuals and groups. The purpose in this project was to provide participants with new under standings of issues they defined as being significant and the means for taking corrective action. The research process allowed people affected by the way in which school science is developed and delivered to have their voices heard and to be actively invol v e d i n research activities. The research results have the potential to provide a means for people in both professional and occupational roles to reformulate policies and practices to enable them to provide programs and services that are effective for Abori ginal learners. According to the research literature uncovered during the course of this project, recognizing science as a cultural construction opens the doorway for coming to understand there are multiple science perspectives in which Western science is only one among thousands of Indigenous Knowledge systems (Aikenhead , 2006a). Science is not value neutral, but rather, is tied to and defined by social and cultural norms. School science in Canada has been typically defined exclusively by Euro -centric West ern models, worldview, and epistemology, and has thus rejected diverse Indigenous Knowledge systems. Incorporating Aboriginal perspectives in school science is not only imperative to generating interest and relevance for Aboriginal students; it will also broaden all people's worldview and understanding of our interconnected relationship with the earth and environment. From this worldview, Indigenous epistemologies although diverse, consider knowledge as action and wisdom with elements of spirituality and e mpiricism - a holistic approach that seeks harmony with nature for survival (Aikenhead & Huntley, 1999). Hence, incorporating Aboriginal perspectives in school science has the potential to resolve social, cultural, and environmental crises that impact all humanity. Historically and still today, conventional school science serves to acculturate and even assimilate students into a Western scientific way of looking at the world to the detriment of Aboriginal Peoples' cultural identities and success within the discipline of science. According to Aikenhead (2006a), \"when school science does not nurture students' Aboriginal identities or strengthen their resiliency, most students do not see its value and are not inclined to participate or achieve in these courses\" (p. 1 ). T his finding is supported by other researchers who have studied ways of nourishing the learning spirit am o n g Aboriginal learners (Battiste, 2008). The intent of this project is to nourish the learning spirit of Aboriginal learners in school scienc e Sable, 2005; Sutherland, 2004). The issue of incorporating Aboriginal perspectives in school science is pressing. By the year 2016, close to 50% of children in Saskatchewan enteri ng kindergarten will be of Aboriginal ancestry. Provincially and nationally, educators have an obligation to strengthen students' Aboriginal identities as they learn to master and critique Western scientific empirical data and investigation without, in the process, sacrificing their own culturally constructed ways of knowing. The Canadian Council of Learning recognizes and supports this assertion in their report entitled, \"Redefining How Success is Measured in First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Learning\": Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 8 First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis have long advocated learning that affirms their own ways of knowing, cultural traditions and values. However, they also desire Western Education that can equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to participate in Canadia n society. First N a t i o n s , I n u i t , a n d M \u00e9 t i s r e c o g n i z e t h a t \" t w o w a y s o f k n o w i n g \" w i l l f o s t e r t h e n e c e s s a r y conditions for nurturing healthy, sustainable communities. (CCL, 2007a , p. 2) The Learning Indigenous Science from Place research team hopes the resul ts of this study will assist in encouraging positive systemic change to nurture Aboriginal students' scientific literacy so they can successfully walk in both worlds , Aboriginal and Euro -Canadian (Battiste, 2000). We anticipate the implications of the rese arch will nurture all learners in school science regardless of cultural background. We believe incorporating Aboriginal perspectives in school science will nurture students' and educators' understanding and appreciation of Indigenous knowledge systems tha t h a v e n o t b e e n a m a j o r p a r t o f school science curriculum in the past (Aikenhead, 2006a). This final report is not meant to be comprehensive in scope as each Aboriginal community within the province will need to be consulted before any meaningful incorpora tion of First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives can take place in school science. There are over 70 First Nations communities in Saskatchewan and six major Aboriginal cultural groups (M\u00e9tis, Cree, Dene, Saulteaux, Dakota/Nakota, Assinboine). Our project was a n ambitious one. We realized along the way that it could have easily been divided up along major cultural groups and even a separate project for the Elders and Teachers. Ideally, the results of the research project represents a vision, a beginning, and a starting base for all stakeholders touched by the issue to take meaningful action based on the information gathered and s h a r e d .

Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 9 1.1 Project Ba ckground Indigenous Knowledge in the School Science Curriculum Committee As with all things, the beginning is never truly the beginning. Although this research project commenced in 2007, there had been a long period of dialogue, talk, networking, and relat ionship building occurring within Saskatchewan and Canada in relation to Aboriginal education. Our project team wanted to build on the strengths of this movement. In 2005, the Indigenous Knowledge in the School Science Curriculum Committee w a s f o r m e d b y a group of individuals who held a common belief in the importance of Indigenous science. Membership on the Committee is diverse including, among others, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal educators , scholars, political representatives, educational administrators and senior officials responsible for science curriculum within Saskatchewan . Each volunteer member brings distinct expertise and contributes to exciting and dynamic discussion about science. The group was interested in examining ways of integrating Aborigi nal knowledge systems, perspectives, and experiences into all school science curricula in Saskatchewan's public and First Nations' schools, but the focus of this study was targeted at grade six to nine. Committee Principles The Indigenous Knowledge in the School Science Curriculum Committee was established for the following purpose: ...to foundationally place Indigenous Knowledge and animate Indigenous Science within the Science curriculum. The Committee provides advice to Saskatchewan Learning [now Ministry of Education] curriculum writers, provides supports to animate Indigenous Science, and identifies gaps and effective practices in support of Indigenous Science (IKSSCC Work Plan 2007 - 2008) . The project members recognize the potential benefits of sharing Indigenous knowledge will all students regardless of cultural background. It is important to note the Committee principles reinforce the recognition of Indigenous knowledge systems - not their validation. Committee Partners and Stakeholders Classroom succe ss (i.e., a more equitable representation of Aboriginal content and student achievement in science courses) requires more than providing teachers with status quo instructional resources. Involving prime stakeholders and partners to explore and provide an e nhanced science curriculum is imperative.

Elders and community members must be fully involved in all phases of curriculum development from visioning, planning, developing, implementing, and on -going evaluation. Appropriate consultation processes, frameworks, structures, and adequate funding must be negotiated and instituted before any kind curriculum development takes place. Anything less will constitute an imposed school science curriculum that will continue to perpetuate neo - colonialism and assimilation. This research is well positioned to mak e a difference in the way curriculum is developed in the province of Saskatchewan and beyond. The inclusive approach undertaken by the project team brought together First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities with educators, curriculum developers, policy makers an d government institutions in preliminary research to effect new perspectives and foundations for school science. Such an undertaking will no doubt forge relationships, dialogue, discourse, and partnerships that will create new understandings in the way sch ool science is taught from the foundation of Aboriginal communities. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 11 1.2 Project Description As the Learning Indigenous Science from Place project began to emerge various First Nations and M\u00e9tis individuals, government and academic institutions, and a div ersity of educators quickly became involved in the project. Monthly meetings were convened. Ideas and knowledge were exchanged. Minutes were taken to ensure continuity of action taken by team members. In February 2006, the Indigenous Knowledge in the Sch ool Science Curriculum Committee began to formulate a funding proposal to the Canadian Council on Learning. The proposal was accepted, and the Committee commenced with the r e s e a r c h i n e a r l y 2 0 0 7 . R e s e a r c h e r a c c e s s t o t h e c o m m u n i t i e s i n v o l v e d f o l l o w i n g p r o p er protocols and a p p r o v a l p r o c e s s e s .

By the fall of 2007, the team had identified and contacted potential interviewees from First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities. The interviewees included Elders, practicing teachers, pre -s e r v i c e t e a c h e r s , a n d v a r i o u s t r a d i t i o n a l l a n d u s e r s . R e s e a r c h a s s i s t a n t s w e r e h i r e d to he l p with the project, contributing their scholarly expertise and gaining personal insight into the unfolding process of community -based action research. The resulting literature review and interview analysis completed by the research team constitu tes the core data of the study. Research Questions This research project was designed to investigate how educators and education systems might take up place -based Indigenous science and apply it within the established school science curriculum. L e a r n i ng Indigenous Science from Place is based on five central questions: What is a First Nations perspective of learning Indigenous science from Place? What is a M\u00e9tis perspective of learning Indigenous science from Place? How can learning from Place help create a foundation for a science curriculum that is contextualized to place and to the people of the Place? How can the perspectives inform teachers of processes and content needed in science curriculum? What supports are needed for educators to engage in Indigeno us science? These broad research questions were used to develop a set of interview questions that were used as a guide for the interviews. The questions were not intended to uncover how we can stuff Indigenous knowledge into existing Western science units and lessons per se. Instead, we wanted to find out the possibilities, parameters, limitations, and challenges of incorporating Indigenous knowledge systems in school science curriculum from various perspectives including existing literature. The data analy sis was intended to make a contribution in developing strategies and tools that educators and education s y s t e m s c a n u s e a s a g u i d e f o r t h e i n t e g r a t i o n o f p l a c e -based Indigenous knowledge content in school science curriculum in Saskatchewan. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 12 Goals of the Study The underlying goals of the study include the following: To explore the concept of Indigenous -based science education from the perspectives and experiences of teachers, Elders and other community members in First Nations and M\u00e9tis community contexts in Saskatchewan; To highlight best approaches, processes, and content used in First Nations & M\u00e9tis contexts; To highlight barriers, challenges, and supports needed for science teachers in First Nations & M\u00e9tis c ont exts ; and to de v elop a set of st rategies and tools educators and education systems c a n u s e a s a g u i d e f o r t h e i n t e g r a t i o n o f p l a c e -based Indigenous knowledge content in science curriculum at the K -12 level. Benefits of the Study Advancements in western science play an increasingly signi ficant role in the everyday life world of Aboriginal students, but so too does the wisdom of Indigenous knowledge systems. School science curriculum framed to include the worldview and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples has many benefits. The project team initially identified the following benefits that would materialize as the study progressed: o An honouring of Indigenous knowledge systems o A sharing of worldviews o Community -based focus o Building research capacity o Creating partnerships and networks o An honourin g of Indigenous methodologies o Uncovering best practices o A guide for curriculum developers o Evidence for educational policy development o Contribution to equitable representation of First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives in science education o Examining Western an d Indigenous goals of science education Although diverse, First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities have a shared vision. Their overall goal is to move beyond a colonial past into a postcolonial present, and to forge new relationships by a mutual sharing of kno wledge perspectives for the benefit of all humanity. An enhanced school science curriculum from the foundation of First Nations and M\u00e9tis contexts reflects this postcolonial goal. 1.3 Aboriginal Identity One of most important things to all human beings is having a sense of identity. Names given by parents, surnames inherited from previous generations, spirit names revealed through ceremony, tribal affiliations, associations to circles of friends and colle agues, and membership in societies, nations and other political organizations are all cherished parts of an individual's identity. Just as you or I would be Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 13 offended if we were repeatedly identified by an incorrect name, Aboriginal individuals are sensitiv e to labels that are inaccurate, or inappropriately applied. There are different perspectives that have given rise to the identity of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada. One perspective of the identity of Aboriginal Peoples comes from the legal definitions entre nched in the Constitution Act, 1982. Other perspectives of identity come from within distinct groups of Aboriginal Peoples themselves. Constitution Act, 1982 The Constitution Act, 1982, Section 35 (2) states \"aboriginal peoples includes the Indian, Inuit a nd M\u00e9tis peoples of Canada.\" (Department of Justice, n.d.) The term Aboriginal refers collectively to Indian, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Peoples. The term Aboriginal may also be used to identity someone when their specific nation is unknown. It is important to recog nize that there is no actual Aboriginal Nation; rather, this is a generic term that helps us describe a particular person or group of persons. Since the term Aboriginal i s u s e d a s a p r o p e r n o u n , i t i s a d i s p l a y o f r e s p e c t to capitalize the noun. A similar situation is observed with the term Peoples . The term Indigenous i s n o t u s e d i n t h e C a n a d i a n C o n s t i t u t i o n ; h o w e v e r , i t i s a n o t h e r t e r m t h a t i s u s e f u l in making general references to individuals or groups of people. There are many interpretations and defini tions of Indigenous . The International Labour Organization includes this information in Section IV of Convention 169: Peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present State boundaries a n d w h o , i r r e s p e c t i v e o f t h e i r l e g a l s t a t u s , r e t a i n s o m e o r a ll o f t h e i r ow n s o c i a l , e c o n o m ic , c u l t u r a l and political institutions. (International Labour Organization, 1989) Throughout this research study you will notice that the terms Aboriginal and Indigenous are both used. The term Indigenous includes all Aboriginal Peoples of Canada, but the term Abor iginal does not include all Indigenous Peoples of the world. First Nations The Constitution Act, 1982 uses the word Indian , although most people today use the term First Nations . I t i s i m p o r t a n t t o r e c o g n i z e t h a t F i r s t N a t i o n s People s d i d n o t u s e e i t h e r t erm historically. Indian and First Nations are English terms used for convenience. Each nation originally inhabiting this land had their own name to identify themselves as a group. For example, European colonizers used the word Cree to identify Nehiyawak (spelling varies). There are 630 First Nations communities in Canada. The Assembly of First Nations represents most of the First Nations in Canada, stating, Historically the First Nations have a unique and special relationship with the Crown and the people of Canada, as manifested in treaties and other historical documents. In essence, the special relationship is one of (negotiated agreement with a view toward) peaceful coexistence based on equitable sharing of lands and resources, and ultimately on respect, recognition, and enforcement o f o u r r e s p e c t i v e r i g h t t o g o v e r n o u r s e l v e s . T h e A F N e x i s t s t o p r o m o t e t h e \" r e s t o r a t i o n a n d enhancement\" of this relationship and to ensure that it is mutually beneficial to the First Nations people. (Assembly of First Nations , n.d.) M\u00e9tis Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 14 The M\u00e9tis National Council represents M\u00e9tis People from Ontario to British Columbia. The M\u00e9tis share a common history, culture, language, kinship connection, traditional territory and way of life. It is estimated there are over 350,000 M\u00e9tis in Canada. According to the M\u00e9tis National Council , M\u00e9tis means a person who self -i d e n t i f i e s a s M \u00e9 t i s , i s o f h i s t o r i c M \u00e9 t i s N a t i o n A n c e s t r y , i s d i s t i n c t from other Aboriginal Peoples and is accepted by the M\u00e9tis Nation. (M\u00e9tis National Council, n.d.) Ther e are other groups of people in Canada who identify as M\u00e9tis but are not represented by the M\u00e9tis National Council. They also have a unique mixed European and First Nations heritage, however, apply different criteria for their membership and political repr esentation. Inuit There are approximately 45,000 Inuit in Canada. They live in 53 Arctic communities in four geographic regions: Nunatsiavut (Labrador); Nunavik (Quebec); Nunavut; and the the Northwest Territories (Inuit Tapiirit Kanatami, n.d.) . This research study does not address the unique education issues of Inuit but it is hoped that the study is reviewed in Inuit communities and is useful in supporting the concept of learning Indigenous science in relation to Place . Cultural Diversity Among Aboriginal Peoples there is a great deal of cultural and linguistic diversity. Identifying, respecting and celebrating diversity contributes to a healthy vibrant society. The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organ ization explains, ...culture should be regarded as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional f e a t u r e s o f s o c i e t y o r a s o c i a l g r o u p , a n d t h a t i t e n c o m p a s s e s , i n a d d i t i o n t o a r t a n d l i t e r a t u r e , lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs. (United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2002) The First Nations and M\u00e9tis Education Branch, Ministry of Education , Government of Saskatchewan holds the following goals for its role in pre -kind ergarten to grade twelve education: 1. All students achieve wellbeing and learning success 2. Cultural identity and diversity are affirmed in the learning program 3. Teaching and learning are guided by Indigenous Knowledge, research and best practices 4. Learning environments foster respect of self and others 5. Every school is a part of a larger learning community 6. The leadership of the provincial education system is shared through co -management and co - governance. (Government of Saskatchewan, 2007) The application of these goals to build a culturally appropriate science curriculum specific to a region requires the consideration of diverse Aboriginal cultures. Education authorities work to find common principles upon which to build appropriate policy and curriculum for schools and learners, while respecting cultural and linguistic differences. A challenge for educators is to avoid trivializing or minimizing differences among Aboriginal Peoples, as well as to understand that many important culturally specific teachings ex ist outside formal school settings.

Aikenhead (2006a), McKinley (2007) and Hammond and Brandt (2004) provide literature reviews and evidence of the increasing interest on cultural perspectives in school science. T h e r e i s a w e a l t h o f l i t e r a t ure that exists in relation to Aboriginal education in general and more specifically under the rubric of cultural studies in science education (Aikenhead, 2006). The following construction illuminates the complexity of thought that exists in what has becom e known as Indigenous science education discourse (Aikenhead, 2006a; Aikenhead & Huntley, 1997, 1999(a)(b); Cajete, 1986, 2000; MacIvor, 1995). We begin the literature review with an examination of the history of Aboriginal education. We draw attention to the policy directions that have been undertaken by the federal and provincial governments and the current challenges facing teachers as they struggle to meet the need of Aboriginal learners in school science. Our overall purpose is to trace the evolution o f advancements made in relation to the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge systems in the science curriculum. The literature review ends with a summary of promising practices that have been constructed around common themes uncovered during the course of this research project. We ask readers to turn their attention to the history of Aboriginal education in Canada in order to understand the importance of incorporating cultural and linguistic content in school science. 2.1 Historical Overview of Aboriginal Education in Canada The literature on Aboriginal education suggests that science education must be considered within the larger context of Aboriginal history, colonization, societal struggles, and cultural survival (Barman, Herbert, & McCaskill, 2005; St. Denis, 2002). Indigenous science and Indigenous science education cannot be understood within a social vacuum disconnected from spiritual, historical, political, social, and economic roots. It is important for curriculum developers and science teachers to have some basic understanding of this context as a foundation for developing effective teaching practices in specific Aboriginal contexts. Traditional Education in Aboriginal Contexts Prior to European contact, and continuing to present day, Aboriginal Peoples had their own forms of education based on holistic ways of viewing the natural world. Although different groups had their own specific ways of educating their children, there are commonalities. There is , first and foremost , a shared worldview in which Indigenous People see themselves as an integral part of the natural world. There are Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 16 however, different ways of expressing and reinforcing this shared worldview depending on the cult ure. Child -rearing practices are also similar. Educational systems among Indigenous People s tended to be non-coercive. There was a heavy emphasis on observation, teaching by example and modeling practice. Although direct instruction was important, parents often adhered to the ethic of non -interference, by allowing the child to develop naturally according to their purpose and giftedness . Teaching was non - intrusive and subtle, and reflected the cultural values required for community -w e l l b e i n g . A s i n a n y society in general, age was respected, and it was Elders who often taught lessons through storytelling and other forms of expression (Little Bear, 2000; Miller, 1996). Indigenous pedagogies included ways of transmitting knowledge through language and other sy mbolic means while respecting other cultures, perspectives and realms of being (Battiste & Henderson, 2000; Miller, 1996). Much of the education occurred within the context of the natural social setting. Although complex, Indigenous knowledge systems were not regimented or institutionalized in a formal way as t h e y a r e n o w ( G r e s k o i n B a r m a n , H e b e r t , a n d M c C a s k i l l , 1 9 8 6 ) . C h i e f J o h n S n o w o f t h e S t o n e y F i r s t Nation describes traditional education of the Nakota: There was no formal education as such, but educat i o n w a s i n t e r w o v e n i n t o t h e l i f e o f t h e t r i b a l s o c i e t y . A v e r y i m p o r t a n t r e s p o n s i b i l i t y o f t h e t r i b a l m e m b e r s w a s t o p a s s o n v a l u a b l e information to the next generation by the spoken word. Parents, grandparents, and elders told and retold stories and legen ds to the children by the campfires, in the teepees, on the hillsides, in the forest, and at special gatherings during the day and at night. It was an ongoing educational process about religion, life, hunting, and so on. Other topics were bravery, courage, kindness, s h a r i n g , s u r v i v a l , a n d f o o t t r a c k s o f a n i m a l s , s o i t w a s a v e r y e x t e n s i v e s t u d y o f m a n y t h i n g s . (Snow, 1977 , p. 6) Education \"took place informally through the acquisition of specific skills, attitudes, and knowledge needed to function in everyd ay life within the context of a spiritual worldview\" (Barman, Hebert and McCaskill in Barman, Hebert and McCaskill, 1987 , p. 3). Learning life skills needed later as adults could take place through playing games (Miller , 1996), while other types of learnin g - such as the number system - required a more formal educational setting (Sealey in Lussier and Sealey, 1980). Storytelling was also an integral aspect of education: moral lessons, values, and lessons from the natural world were often transmitted this wa y (Little Bear, 2000; Miller, 1996). For instance, science education, such as learning about Creation, flora and fauna, and different species often came through storytelling (Miller, 1996). Learning specific skills occurred within the context of doing, practicing, and participating in everyday life activities, and instruction was received implicitly or by repeated example and demonstration. Traditional Indigenous education reflected and encompassed cultural values, epistemologies, and social systems: it i s , a s M c K a y a n d M c K a y p u t i t , \" a t o t a l w a y o f l i f e \" ( M c K a y a n d McKay in Barman, Hebert and McCaskill, 1987 , p. 64). This concept of totality is reflected in a series of Holistic Lifelong Learning Models (Appendix 1 and 2 ) developed by First Nations, M\u00e9ti s and Inuit individuals from across Canada in collaboration with the Canadian Council on Learning. The respective models were endorsed by national Aboriginal organizations such as the Assembly of First Nations, the M\u00e9tis National Council and the Inuit Tapi irit Kanatami. These models are considered a good representation of how Aboriginal education might be understood. As the First Nations and M\u00e9tis models demonstrate, learning in traditional contexts intersected with all aspects of life, occurred at all stag es, and involved the entire community. This is still important in contemporary society. Learning is as much a spiritual, social, and cultural process as it is a cognitive one, and it occurs at every opportunity throughout the day and the course of one's li fet ime . Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 17 To remove the process of learning from the social, cultural, and spiritual contexts in which it occurs creates a disjuncture between the learner and community. It is these interrelated constructs and connections that must be understood in order to appropriately integrate Aboriginal principles back into the learning process after a long history of Residential School s in Canada, which is the topic of the next section. Education under Colonialism First Nations and Residential School s Ample literature suggests that Residential School s in Canada left a devastating impact on the quality of life in many Aboriginal communities. For over one hundred years, various churches supported by governments ran Residential School s for the purpose of destroying Aborigi nal cultures, spiritual beliefs, traditional values, and entire knowledge systems and ways of being. In Saskatchewan, some 20 Residential School s dotted the province's map between 1865 and 1975 (AFN, 2007a ) . T he intergenerational social and psychological i mpacts of abuse that were experienced by many students in these institutions are still felt today. The story and impact of Residential School s in Canada is well documented and exemplifies the larger narrative of colonialism, the loss of Indigenous knowledg e systems, and the relentless pursuit of the colonizers in acts of cognitive, cultural, and intellectual imperialism (AFN, 1994; Bull, 1991; Caribou . Like all assimilation policies of the 19th and 20th centuries in Canada, the Residential School system was based on racist (or racialized) premises of linear evolution that inaccurately and inappropriately deemed Indigenous People s as unprogressive a n d uncivilized (RCAP, 2.10 ) . T h e g o a l o f civilization would, according to this thinking, be achieved through an educational system based on three principles: separation, re -socialization, and assimilation (RCAP, 2.10). Children were separated from their own cultural teachers, family members, Elders and traditional knowledge keepers. They were not allowed to speak their own languages and were separated for long periods of time from their natural learning environments. A new worldview, language, belief system, a n e w w a y o f l i f e a n d n e w s k i l l s w e r e f o r c e d upon them as an attempt to re-socialize and assimilate young native students. The Residential School system had detrimental consequences for the students, their families, and following generations. The imposition of this foreign educational system and philosophy disrupted traditional systems of Indigenous education that had been in place for centuries. The intergenerational transmission of Indigenous worldviews and knowledge systems relating to the natural world wa s severed, and it is this link that communities seek to re -establish in resuming control over their education and establishing effective partnerships with existing school systems through meaningful involvement and consultation. Learning Indigenous science as a relevancy of place is one of the ways in which we can move further towards this goal. M\u00e9tis Education M\u00e9tis experiences with formal education processes have a unique history in Canada. Educational experiences among the M\u00e9tis varied. During the fur tr ade era some children were taught in traditional w a y s , l e a r n i n g s k i l l s t h a t c e n t e r e d o n t h e b u f f a l o h u n t . I n s o m e c a s e s , i f f a m i l i e s c o u l d a f f o r d i t , M \u00e9 t i s children were sent away to the Red River Settlement, the United States or Europe to attend schools (Racette, 2006). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 18 The establishment of missions and schools by churches during the 19th century provided early formal educational opportunities for the M\u00e9tis who were living in or near established settlements. In Saskatchewan, the first school was establishe d in 1840 at an Anglican mission at Cumberland House. An Oblate school was established at \u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse in 1860. By the 1880s, there were eight schools in and around St -Laurent (Racette, 2006). Prior to 1910, M\u00e9tis attended Residential School s along with First Nations People s, but this situation changed at the turn of the century. While there are numerous individual exceptions, those that were not recognized as Indians under the Indian Act were not permitted to attend Residential School s after 1910, thus placing the responsibility for M\u00e9tis education with the provincial government (Racette, 2006). B u t n e i t h e r d i d t h e M \u00e9 t i s g e n e r a l l y h a v e a c c e s s t o t h e p u b l i c s c h o o l s y s t e m : t h e r e m o t e n e s s o f s o m e M\u00e9tis communities, the incompatibility of seasonal work with the school year, and a policy which long ignored the plight of M\u00e9tis communities all contributed to a lack of education for the M\u00e9tis (Sealey and Lussier, 1980). This situation was exacerbated by the Saskatchewan government's refusal to take full responsib ility for M\u00e9tis education. Until the mid -1940s when the CCF government took power, the vast m a j o r i t y o f M \u00e9 t i s r e m a i n e d w i t h o u t a c c e s s t o p r o v i n c i a l a n d f e d e r a l s c h o o l s y s t e m s ( R C A P , 1 9 9 6 , 3.5; Barron, 1997). When education did become widely available for t h e M \u00e9 t i s i n S a s k a t c h e w a n , i t w a s d o n e with an integrationist platform as its underlying premise (Barron, 1997 , p. 31). Consequently, education was conducted through a western -centric curriculum that either ignored specific cultural needs or assumed that th e M\u00e9tis would be destined for labour jobs or an agrarian life after their formal education ended (Barron, 1997 , p. 51). Aboriginal Control of Education In the early 1970s, Aboriginal Peoples and organizations began to mobilize politically. Through their efforts, they regained the strength and political power necessary for resuming control over their lives (Kirkness & Selkirk -B o w m a n , 1 9 9 2 ) . F i r s t N a t i o n s a n d M \u00e9 t i s People s have long asserted their inherent right to control and management their own education systems including how school science is developed from the foundation of their local community foundations. I n 1 9 7 2 , a s t h e f e d e r a l g o v e r n m e n t w a s c l o s i n g Residential School s and abandoning the policy, the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) released a repor t titled Indian Control of Indian Education (ICIE) - a policy paper presented to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This proposal called first for parental control and involvement in the education of their children, a starting point t hat encompassed the role of locality and community in learning. In this way, the ICIE policy addressed concerns of First Nations parents who wanted their children to succeed while maintaining a strong cultural identity. The development of culture -based app roaches in specific community contexts to t e a c h i n g i n a l l s u b j e c t a r e a s w a s f o r w a r d e d n o t o n l y a s a v i s i o n t o a b e t t e r w a y o f l i f e , b u t a l s o a s a w a y of curbing the high drop -out rate among First Nations populations (National Indian Brotherhood, 1972). The proposal also recommended that Indigenous communities acquire jurisdiction over education, that amendments be made in the curriculum that would reflect Indigenous cultures and values, that the teaching of Indigenous languages be incorporated, that the de velopment of culturally -attuned teacher training programs be instituted, and that the necessary resources be applied to both facilities and services. The major thrust of the Indian Control on Indian Education policy led to the development of First Nations teacher education programs, band controlled schools, locally -developed curriculum, and places of higher learning in order to meet the cultural and academic needs of the communities. This landmark Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 19 p o l i c y d o c u m e n t h a s b e e n u s e d a s t h e f a c i l i t a t o r f o r F i r s t N ations communities taking control of their own education systems. The specific effects of this policy have been felt in Saskatchewan. In 1972, the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural College (now the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Center) was established to support First Nations in their capacity to deliver educational programs. Some success has also been achieved in control over schooling, particularly in the north. \u00cele -\u00e0-la-Crosse, a predominantly M\u00e9tis community, gained control o v e r i t s s c h o o l s y s t e m i n 1 9 7 6 - the s a m e y e a r t h a t t h e N o r t h e r n S c h o o l D i v i s i o n ( n o w t h e N o r t h e r n Lights School Division) became board -elected. In 1973, the James Smith, Thunderchild, and Little Pine First Nations took control over their education. Others quickly followed suit. Similar adv ances were made in post -secondary education. Three programs - the Indian Teacher Education Program (ITEP) was established in 1972 at the University of Saskatchewan, the Northern Teacher Education program (NORTEP) was established in La Ronge in 1977, and th e Saskatchewan Urban Native Teachers Education Program (SUNTEP) was established in 1980. These programs offer fully accredited Bachelor of Education programs with the goals of preparing teachers of M\u00e9tis and First Nations ancestry, and of producing teacher s who are culturally sensitive to M\u00e9tis and First Nations needs. A culturally supported First N a t i o n s e nv i r o nm e n t i n p o s t -secondary education was further expanded when, in 1976, the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College (now the First Nations University of Canada) was established. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples Report The advancements made in Aboriginal education as described previously could not have been possible without the collaborative work of native and non -native people. Despite the foundation that has been laid by the work of many educators, serious problems and challenges remain. Aboriginal students are still leaving from school in record numbers. Many will never return. One of the most informative investigations into these and other problems plaguing Aboriginal Peoples was the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP , 1996 ). The Commission recognized a widespread systemic dy s f u n ct i o n o f the relationship between Aboriginal Peoples and the state, and made recommendations based on the obvious need for critical changes. Between 1991 and 1995, RCAP took research submissions and testimonies from individuals, organizations, and comm unities - both Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal - and conducted public hearings and round tables on a host of issues relevant to Aboriginal Peoples. The Commission's extensive mandate was to \"investigate the evolution of the relationship among Aboriginal Peop les (Indian, Inuit and M\u00e9tis), the Canadian government, and Canadian society as a whole\" (RCAP, 1996 , Appendix A). Aside from major issues such as self -government, land and resources, legal status, and cultural concerns, the Commission dedicated significan t space to educational matters. In fact, investigating Aboriginal education was stipulated in the Commission's original instructions. They stated that: In particular, the Commission may investigate aboriginal control over primary and secondary education on reserves and in native communities (including issues of funding), the promotion and protection of aboriginal cultural identity in educational institutions (including institutions where aboriginal students are a minority group), the encouragement of aborig inal children to complete secondary education, and access to and funding for post -secondary education (including college, university and technical training). (RCAP, 1996 , Appendix A) These broad instructions provided the Commission with the necessary autho rity to investigate a wide scope of educational matters relevant to Aboriginal Peoples . Its report, released in 1996, comprises several hundred pages - thousands if one includes the many reports, written submissions, and hearing Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 20 transcriptions. The fundame ntal finding of RCAP was the need for the participation of Aboriginal Peoples in all areas of policy making. This point was evidenced as much in the area of education as in any other, particularly in the 173 -page chapter entitled, \"Education\" in Volume 3, \"Gathering Strength\" (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5). The report highlighted a number of systematic problems, such as the continued failure of education to ground Aboriginal youth in a strong and positive identity and the absence of Elder involvement in education. Indee d, the relationship between formal educational policy and the survival, strengthening, and inter -generational transmission of Aboriginal cultures and languages were stressed throughout the report. This relationship was articulated primarily through a cultu ral understanding of Aboriginal education. The report elaborated this understanding in the following way: Education is a lifelong, continuous process requiring stable and consistent support. First Nations people of every age group require appropriate forma l and informal opportunities for learning and for teaching. The education provided must be holistic. Education processes and institutions must address the intellectual, spiritual, emotional, and physical development of participants. (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5.2) The statement above bears the same fundamental principles as laid out in the First Nations and M\u00e9tis Holistic Lifelong Learning Models (Appendix 1 and 2) published by the Canadian Council on Learning. Learning encompasses all aspects of life and is not confi ned to formal classroom training. Education \"proceeds according to four stages of the life cycle: the child, the youth, the adult, and the elder\" (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5.2). Education is seen as a process, not an event. Accordingly, education cannot be separated from the larger social and cultural matrix from which it is defined. Based on the testimony and submissions of various Aboriginal communities and individuals, RCAP recognized two sets of relationships of interest to education. First, the relationship betw een learning a n d t h e l i f e c y c l e i s i n t e g r a l t o t h e l e a r n i n g p r o c e s s . T h e f o u r s t a g e s o f t h e l i f e c y c l e - child, youth, adult, and Elder - constitute the circle of life. The report noted, \"learning at one stage has implications for subsequent stages\" (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5.2). Fundamental to this relationship is intergenerational transmission: \"as individuals mature and perhaps attain the status of Elder, they are able to transmit to younger generations the knowledge and wisdom acquired through a lifetime of learn ing\" (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5.2). The second relationship noted in the report is the connection between learning and development. Essentially, this relationship points to the holistic nature of education, where a person's intellectual, spiritual, emotional and phy sical aspects must be addressed in education. These two sets of relationships - the life cycle and holistic learning - are intertwined. Accordingly, education must be understood as a larger, inclusive process. The absence of such an inclusive process has created a gap between Aboriginal student cultural perspectives and the realities of Western -based education. This gap has resulted in alienation for the students from their learning, their communities, and their cultures. Almost 70% of the total Aboriginal school -age population attend provincial schools, most of which give little or no consideration to specific cultural needs of these students. The RCAP r eport elaborates: Most Aboriginal students attend schools where there is no special effort to make them or their families feel part of the life of the school. Aboriginal parents say they are excluded from their children's education. There is a gap between the culture of the home and that of the school. In very few instances are Aboriginal Peoples among the representatives on school boards. (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5.1) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 21 RCAP has made a number of recommendations that would benefit the education of Indigenous People s, which are based on the premise that \" Aboriginal people rightly expect education to serve as a vehicle for cultural and economic renewal\" (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5). Repeatedly, RCAP pointed to a discontinuity between Aboriginal culture and home life with formal institutional education. The report expanded on this gap: A common concern of parents is when schooling bec omes a threat to their developing child's identity, primarily when the values and world view that prevail at school contradict or ignore the e x i s t e n c e o f a d i f f e r e n c e p e r s p e c t i v e t h e c h i l d l i v e s w i t h a t h o m e . I n t h e c a s e o f s t u d e n t s o f Aboriginal ancestry, this situation is all too common. The result can be that the child experiences serious conflict and doubt about the validity of his or her own identity. When an Aboriginal child's identity has been threatened, they will withdraw into themselves; become si lent and refuse to participate as a means of protecting themselves from criticism and rejection; attempt to abandon their previous identity and mould themselves to the culture which they perceive as m o r e v a l i d o r a c c e p t a b l e ; t h e y m a y t a k e o n n o n -productive and rejecting attitudes which generally culminate in failure or dropping out. (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5.3.2) Clearly, the failure of educational policy to incorporate Aboriginal perspectives and content in the curriculum reaches far beyond a focus on drop -out rates and the under representation of Aboriginal P e o p l e s i n s c i e n t i f i c c a r e e r s . I t h a s a d i r e c t i m p a c t i n l i v e s o f i n d i v i d u a l g r a s s r o o t s p e o p l e a n d m o r e importantly is linked to community -well-being. The Commission provided recommendations that offered a solution. Fundamental to these recommendations was the need for on -going collaboration between federal, provincial, territorial, and Aboriginal governments. The Commission recognized that the inadequac y of Aboriginal education was not an Aboriginal problem for Aboriginal Peoples to fix . T h e C o m m i s s i o n s h o w e d t h e r e i s a s h a r e d responsibility. It is only through cooperation and partnership that such inadequacies can be resolved. The recognition and prior ity of Aboriginal languages in these recommendations played a central role. RCAP also recommended the involvement of parents and communities in schools with Aboriginal students. Most importantly, RCAP recommended changes in curriculum that would \"include t he perspectives, traditions, beliefs and world view of Aboriginal peoples\" (RCAP, 1996 , 3.A). These recommendations correspond with the NIB report, and are based on principles of Aboriginal control, development, and design of education. As the Report poin ts out, the concerns raised currently about Aboriginal education are primarily the same ones that have been raised since 1972. And while there has been some progress, it has been at a snail's pace (RCAP, 1996 , 3.5). Contemporary Challenges While major adv ancements have been made in Aboriginal education since the early 1970s, much remains to be done. Nicholas (2001) shows education systems continue to perpetuate colonialism. Education must be deconstructed so barriers that prevent teachers and communities f rom incorporating Indigenous knowledge in schools and curriculum can be identified and challenged. Nicholas states that band -operated schools are often forced to accept the imposition of federal and provincial curriculum mandates, teacher certification, an d the use of the English language as a medium of instruction. In addition, they have very little funding and resources, exacerbating the challenges to developing culturally inclusive teaching methods. In science education, teachers who are heavily influenc ed by Euro -Western perspectives consider these perspectives as the only rational and objective way of uncovering truth while regarding Indigenous knowledge and methods as primitive, archaic, and irrelevant (McGregor, 2000). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 22 Despite major developments in Ab original education and the changing nature of teaching in science education, much research is needed. St. Denis (2002) argues that Aboriginal Peoples continue to leave school in greater numbers than their non -native counterparts, demonstrating that not muc h c h a n g e d statistically since the first studies were done. The literature in Aboriginal education reflects a complexity o f i s s u e s t h a t s e r v e a s i n d i c a t o r s o f t h i s f a i l u r e . I n t h e area of science education, MacI vor (1995) has identified attendance, retentio n, motivation, attitudes toward school, and integration of Aboriginal cultures and languages as being problematic at the elementary and secondary levels. In the United States, where much of the research has been conducted, Cajete (1988) revealed that junio r high was the period in which native students begin to lose interest in science. Consequently, only a handful of Aboriginal students gain entry into science -related programs and professions. Either way, it is evident that culturally appropriate curriculum will benefit Aboriginal students and lead to an increased success rate. The relationship between the importance of cultural content and the persistence of challenges for Aboriginal Peoples in education becomes more evident when viewed from this perspectiv e . T he statistics on Aboriginal education provide broad overviews and critiques of Aboriginal education in Canada. According to the RCAP, more than half of all native children (57%) drop out of school before graduation compared to 15% for non -n a t i v e s . T hes e s t a t i s t i c s f r o m t h e 1 9 9 0 s c o r r e l a t e w i t h m o r e current numbers: using a recent Auditor -G e n e r a l ' s r e p o r t , t h e S o c i e t y f o r t h e A d v a n c e m e n t o f Excellence in Education (2005) reported that 6 out of 10 Aboriginal students in Canada drop out before grade 12 and 5 9 % o f a d u l t s h a v e n o t c o m p l e t e d h i g h s c h o o l . T h e r e p o r t e s t i m a t e s i t w i l l t a k e a l m o s t 2 8 years to close the high school completion gap between Aboriginal youth and their non -native peers. The implications of these statistics are problematic for both nati ve and non -native communities given that the Aboriginal youth population is the fastest growing sector in Canada. Much of the disparity in the quality of schooling among Aboriginal communities is related to systemic problems that will require systemic solu tions. Learning Indigenous Science from Place is a project that reinforces the larger process of decolonizing education in Canada. The project is intended to assist communities in coming to understand Indian control of Indian education in relation to schoo l science. After over one hundred years of Residential School ing in Canada, Learning Indigenous science in relation to place seeks to strengthen the cultural and linguistic identity of youth. Learning Indigenous science in relation to place is also intend ed to make science relevant and meaningful for Aboriginal learners. It involves the collective effort between curriculum developers, teachers, parents, Elders, and other community stakeholders to nourish the learning spirit of all students regardless of cu ltural background. In this way, this research project seeks to uphold the principles originally set out in NIB's 1972 policy report, and again in RCAP's recommendations in 1996. It is our hope that this study will contribute towards the larger effort to decolonize education and integrate Aboriginal worldviews, epistemologies, methodologies, pedagogies, values and principles into the Saskatchewan science curriculum. 2.2 Historical Overview of Saskatchewan Learning Policy A History of Saskatchewan Learning Ac tion Plans, 1981 to Present Since 1982, the Government of Saskatchewan's departmental education authority has been guided by the recommendations and expertise of a continually evolving Aboriginal education advisory committee \u2014first the Native Curriculum Review Committee, then the Indi an and M\u00e9tis Education Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 23 Advisory Committee (IMEAC), and currently the Aboriginal Education Provincial Advisory Committee (AEPAC). The evolving committee and subsequent action plans are significant because of the work to include Aboriginal content and perspe ctives in provincial curricula. This section documents the development of provincial action plans with respect to Aboriginal education, from 1981 to the present. In addition to the action plans, this section reviews Government of Saskatchewan supporting documents, including Indian and M\u00e9tis Education Policy from Kindergarten to Grade 12 (S as k a t c he w a n Education, 1995 c), and Building Partnerships: First Nations and M\u00e9tis Peoples and the Provincial Education System (Saskatchewan Education, 2003). Lastly, this section concludes by considering the recently revised Science 10 Curriculum Guide (Saskatchewan Learning, 2005). In 1981, Saskatchewan's Education Minister mandated the Curriculum and Instruction Review Committee to review the K -12 education system. The re sult was the document Directions (Saskatchewan Education , 1984) that laid out the foundation for the Core Curriculum (Saskatchewan Education, 2000 b), a very important priority because it emphasizes the importance of and commitment to the inclusion of Abori ginal content and perspectives in all curricula. T h e C o r e C u r r i c u l u m i s r e c o g n i z e d a s a c e n t r a l f e a t u r e o f t h e p r o v i n c i a l e d u c a t i o n s y s t e m . I t i s a curriculum that creates spaces for Aboriginal voices, well beyond the Native Studies program. Integrating Aboriginal content and perspectives across the curriculum, within all subject areas is the goal for all students. ( Saskatchewan Education , 2005, p. 4) The Five-Year Action Plan for Native Curriculum Development (Saskatchewan Education , 1984) was developed by a Native Curriculum Review Committee and included a series of recommendations primarily concerned with organizational objectives such as policy development, the need for an ongoing Aboriginal education advisory committee, inclusion of the North, and the inclusion of Aboriginal content and perspectives in the curricula. The recommendations would remain intact through to the most recent edition, Action Plan, 2000 -05. This initiative reached maturity when, \"The Indian and M\u00e9tis Education Advisory Committee forwarded a revised plan in 1995 titled Indian and M\u00e9tis Action Plan \" (St. Denis, et al., 70). The Indian and M\u00e9tis Education Advisory Committee identified five areas of particular importance, including: evaluation, governance, teachers and administrators, external relationships and communication. One of the most important documents with respect to policy is the Indian and M\u00e9tis Education Policy from Kindergarten to Grade 12 (Saskatchewan Education, 1995 c). Guided by the Five Year Action Plan for Native Curriculum Development ( Saskatchewan Education, 1984) and its successors such as the Indian and M\u00e9tis Education Action Plan ( Saskatchewan Education, 1995 b), this document outlines three major curriculum objectives, which are: The inclusion of Indian and M \u00e9tis content in all core curricula for all students in the province; The development and implementation of programs for and about Indian and M\u00e9tis students, for example: Native Studies and Indian Languages programs; The development, identification and coor dinated distribution of instructional resources and locally produced materials for core and other curricula. ( p. 4) Principles and Guidelines for Indian and M\u00e9tis Curriculum Development offers recommendations for curriculum development and states: \"Improv ements to the education of Indian and M\u00e9tis students are Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 24 dependent upon the changes in the processes of development, the instructional approaches taken, and the presentation and representation of curricula and materials\" ( p. 9 ) . T h r e e a r e a s i n p a r t i c u l a r a re highlighted: Involvement of Indian and M\u00e9tis Peoples, sustainability of instructional approaches, and adequacy of curriculum. In the attempt to make curricula adequate , curricula and materials will \"concentrate on positive images\" and \"reinforce and com plement the beliefs and values of Indian, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit peoples\", as well as \"include historical and contemporary issues\", emphasize \"Indian/M\u00e9tis Studies, Indian languages, and English language development\", and \"reflect the legal, cultural, historical , political, social, economic and regional diversity of Indian, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit Peoples\" (p. 10). Perhaps the most relevant aspect with respect to curriculum development for our project is the assertion that \"knowledge within Indian and M\u00e9tis communities and institutions will be utilized in the development of Indian and M\u00e9tis content\" ( p. 9). Five years later, AEPAC produced Action Plan, 2000 -05. T h i s p o l i c y r e n e w a l m a r k e d a s h i f t i n f o c u s f r o m organizational objectives to the student and community. Reflec ting on the history of action plans, AEPAC wrote: \"Now that the groundwork and structures are in place, we would like to shift our attention to actualization of Aboriginal content and perspectives in Saskatchewan schools - all schools, and not only those t hat have a significant population of Aboriginal students\" ( Saskatchewan Education, 2000a, p. 2 emphasis added). The province defines actualization as \"effective implementation and ongoing renewal\" and notes that, \"the awareness is still lacking that all st udents in the province stand to benefit if the recommendations of [AEPAC] and its predecessors are actualized\" ( p. 2). This commitment is reinforced in the document's 12 recommendations, 5 principles, and 4 areas of change. In particular, AEPAC notes the f ollowing principal two -part goal: ( Saskatchewan Education , 2005, p. 2). Aboriginal young people with grade 12 and post secondary educations, flourishing in all professions; Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal students and young people are knowledgeable about Aboriginal Peoples and their history. ( Saskatchewan Education , 2000, p. 4) In the fall of 2003, Saskatchewan released Building Partnerships , a policy framework for Pre - kindergarten to Grade 12, outlining how the province would strengthen partnerships (such a s w i t h AEPAC) at the level of policy. The policy suggested involvement of First Nations and M\u00e9tis stakeholders in policy discussions, adequate First Nations and M\u00e9tis representation on advisory and reference committees, and the use of effective processes for seeking and receiving policy advice ( Saskatchewan Education , 2003, p. 36). In 2005, an interim report, Learning Community in Aboriginal Education 2004 -07, Priorities Report , was r e l e a s e d b y A E P A C f o r t h e p r o v i n c e . T h e r e p o r t a s s e s s e d t h e a c t i o n p l a n f or 2000 -05 and reviewed the priorities for 2005 -07. The 5 principles were reaffirmed, one of which was expanded. Six further opportunities were identified ( Saskatchewan Education , 2005, pp. 12-13). Recently, Saskatchewan Learning has undertaken the project o f s c i e n c e c u r r i c u l u m r e n e w a l , t h e f i r s t o f which to be renewed was Science 10 Curriculum Guide (Sask atchewan Learning, 2005). Not only does Science 10 offer the most recent declaration of the province's commitment to the inclusion of Indian and M\u00e9tis con tent and perspectives within curricula, it also provides the most current example of policy put into practice in the form of curriculum. In fact, this commitment has been formally enshrined in the Science 10 section, Core Curriculum Components and Initiati ves. The Core Curriculum \"includes broad Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 25 initiatives that guide the selection of teaching materials, as well as instruction, in the classroom\" ( p. 5), one of which is Indian and M\u00e9tis Content and Perspectives . The Core Curriculum reads: It is an expectati on that Indian and M\u00e9tis content and perspectives be integrated into all programs related to the education of kindergarten to grade 12 students in Saskatchewan, whether or not there are Indian and M\u00e9tis students in a particular classroom. All students bene fit from knowledge about the Indian and M\u00e9tis peoples of Saskatchewan. It is through such knowledge that misconceptions and bias can be eliminated. ( p. 6) The Saskatchewan Core Curriculum acknowledges five facets in particular with respect to including Indian and M\u00e9tis content and perspectives within science education: 1. This approach begins with understanding and respecting Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing ( p. 6); 2. A second facet of this approach capitalizes on the responsibility and authority of the teacher to adapt instruction in order to be responsive to the interests and needs of their students and local communities ( p. 6); 3. A third facet ... recognizes the need for Indian and M\u00e9tis students to experience greater success in science classes ( p. 7); 4. A fourth facet can be accomplished through the creation of cross -cultural units of study ( p. 7); 5. The final responsibility for accurate and appropriate integration ... rests with teachers ( p. 7). The curriculum notes that the \"STSE [ Science -Technology -Society -Env i ro nm e n t ] emphasis of the science curricula provides teachers with many opportunities to begin this process\" ( p. 7), which are supported by the document, Diverse Voices: Selecting Equitable Resources for Indian and M\u00e9tis Education (Saskatchewan Education , 1992). O v e r t h e c o u r s e o f t h e l a s t t h r e e d e c a d e s , t h e e v o l v i n g a d v i s o r y c o m m i t t e e c u r r e n t l y k n o w n a s t h e Aboriginal Education Provincial Advisory Committee has guided the inclusion of Indian and M\u00e9tis content and perspectives within Saskatchewan's educati on policy. The developments have been documented in the recommendations and objectives captured in the advisory committees' action plans. This is an ongoing process that has matured from initial considerations aimed at developing organizational objectives to the current focus of policy actualization. This process is supported by the continuing development of policy, various partnerships, and academic ties. The recently revised Saskatchewan Science 10 Curriculum Guide (Saskatchewan Learning, 2005) describes the goal of inclusive policy: \"The purpose of Science 10 curriculum is to help all students, regardless of gender or cultural background, develop scientific literacy\" ( p. 1). The inclusion of Indian and M\u00e9tis content and perspectives is motivated by the re cognition of two aspects: most significantly, \"the need for Indian and M\u00e9tis students to experience greater success in science classes ( p. 7); secondly, \"All students benefit from knowledge about the Indian and M\u00e9tis peoples of Saskatchewan\". However, the means required to achieve this desirable goal are only just being put into place. The curriculum places a considerable emphasis on the teacher to facilitate the inclusion of Indian and M\u00e9tis content and perspectives: Science 10 \"capitalizes on the responsi bility and authority of teachers to adapt instruction in order to be responsive to the interests and needs of their students and local communities, while still respecting the foundational and related learning objectives\" ( p. 6). Furthermore: \"The final Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 26 responsibility for accurate and appropriate integration ... rests with the teachers\" ( p. 7). Thus, it will be of critical importance for all levels of Saskatchewan education systems and Aboriginal communities to assist teachers' personal and professional develo pment in discovering ways of successful integration of First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives in Science 10 curriculum. Teachers cannot bear this burden alone. The current shortage, or absence, of specific curricular units, objectives, lessons and supportin g resources for Science 10 with a First Nations and/or M\u00e9tis perspective will mean a need for additional research and development in this area. While Saskatchewan provides a leading example at the level of inclusive educational policy, it still has a consi derable way to go in order to parallel such achievements at the level of curricula, educational resource and professional development . 2.3 The Concept of Indigenous Science Place as an Aspect of Learning Indigenous Science In order for a science curriculum to be effectively adapted to suit Aboriginal perspectives, learning from Place must be an integral part of the experience. Understanding what Place means from an Indigenous perspective is a concept necessary to understand ing and learning Indigenous scientific knowledge and processes. Aside from the more literal meaning of geography, house, town, residence, or other physical and tangible space, Place also includes less tangible characteristics. Place - or sense of Place - also suggests the concepts, memories, histories, ideas, emotions, relationships, identities (both individual and community) and objects associated with a particular physical space. Cajete explains that Place is integral to Indigenous cultures: Indigenous p eople are a people of Place, and the nature of Place is embedded in their language. The physical, cognitive, and emotional orientation of a people is a kind of map they carry in their heads and transfer from generation to generation. This map is multi -dime nsional and reflects the spiritual as well as the mythic geography of a people (Cajete, 2000b , p. 74). Place can be aesthetic, ceremonial, economic, familial, historical, political, spiritual, or scientific. Edward S. Casey captures the complexity of Place in the following way: Rather than being one definite sort of thing - for example, physical, spiritual, cultural, social - a given place takes on the qualities of its occupants, reflecting these qualities in its own constitution and description and expres sing them in its occurrence as an event: Places not only are, they happen . (Casey in Feld and Basso, 1996 , p. 27) This quote suggests that Place is a co mple x c oncep t t hat is difficult t o ar ticulate. Par t of this proble m is a result of the ubiquity of Place . A s C l i f f o r d G e e r t z t e l l s u s , \" I t i s d i f f i c u l t t o s e e w h a t i s a l w a y s t h e r e . W h o e v e r d i s c o v e r e d w a t e r , i t w a s n o t a f i s h \" ( G e e r t z i n F e l d a n d B a s s o , 1 9 9 6 , p. 259). Place is often assumed and rarely defined. Although challenging, exploring the concept of pl ac e is crucial in understanding the Place of local knowledge in school science. Indigenous articulations, perspectives, and local concepts are important b e c a u s e t h e r e h a s b e e n a s h i f t f r o m l i v i n g i n o r a l l i t e r a t e s o c i e t i e s t o l i v i n g i n a c o n t e m p o r a r y w r i t t e n literate society. The challenges in articulation are linked to a difference in knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge systems are normally expressed orally, experientially and symbolically; consequently, relaying that knowledge through a western mode l has limitations (Battiste, 2002; Aikenhead and Ogawa, 2007). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 27 An additional difficulty in articulating the concept of Place and its role in Indigenous knowledge systems is language. Articulation of the concept of Place in Indigenous languages is often viewed as fundamental t o i t s a c c u r a t e a r t i c u l a t i o n ( B a s s o , 1 9 9 6 ; B a t t i s t e , 2 0 0 2 ; L i t t l e B e a r , 2 0 0 0 ; H a r r i s , 2 0 0 2 ) . A c c o r d i n g t o Battiste (2002), the survival of Indigenous languages is by far the most significant factor in the survival of Indigenous knowle dge. This is because Indigenous languages have symbolic, verbal, and unconscious elements that act to structure and order Indigenous knowledge and worldview. Thus, the understanding of the concept of Place has lost meaning in a dual translation: from Indig enous languages to English, and from oral to written traditions. In addition, the contextuality of Place renders it inseparable from the land, culture, society, locality, worldview, philosophy, and spirituality. To extract it for the sake of defining it th us takes away its inherent interconnectedness to other aspects of life. As Aikenhead and Ogawa note, R e a d i n g a n a r t i c l e i s n o t a n a d e q u a t e e x p e r i e n c e i n c o m i n g t o k n o w h o w t o l i v e i n n a t u r e . W a y s of living in nature is action -oriented (verb -based); it cann ot be given, accumulated, banked, and assessed by paper and pencil examinations. It must be experienced in the context of living in a particular place in nature, in the pursuit of wisdom, and in the context of multiple relationships. (Aikenhead and Ogawa, 2007 , p. 21) Michell (2005) makes a similar point about Woodlands Cree way of life, \"which cannot be learned entirely from the written word; it must be lived and experienced\" ( p. 32). Place is understandably, then, a c o n c e p t t h a t i s d i f f i c u l t t o d e f i n e w i t hin the space of this written report. Nonetheless, some attempts have been made to articulate Indigenous concepts of Place in English -language literature, and it helps build an understanding of the concept. According to the literature, there are five centr al dimensions of Place that are common among various Indigenous groups as follows. Dimensions of Place 1) First, Place is multidimensional . It entails both physical and emotional characteristics and refers to m o r e t h a n j u s t a g e o g r a p h i c s p a c e . T h u s , i t e n c o m p a s s e s a l l a s p e c t s o f l i f e . Place indicates a physical element or Place dependence (Stokols and Shumaker, 1981) and an emotional elemen t or identity (Proshansky, 1978; Proshansky, Fabian, & Kaminoff, 1983; Korpela, 1989). Eric Riggs describes the all -encompassing character of Place: Geography is not only a matter of location, distance, and elevation, but is additionally permeated with meaning and cultural significance. Indeed the worldview and cosmology of many indigenous cultures is indistinguishable and inseparable from the physical geography. (Riggs, 2004 , p. 303) Place is \"created by the setting combined with what a person brin gs to it\" (Steele, 1981 , p. 9 ) . I n other words, Place is the interaction between location and resident (Cajete, 2000b). Edward S. Casey distinguishes between S p ac e and Place: Space is the tangible, mappable, measurable while Place includes \"locations wher e one chooses to stay or return\" (Cruikshank, 2005 , p. 6 7 ) . T he multidimensionality of P l ace , then, can be understood to have a dual characteristic: the spiritual and the physical. These two aspects encompass a wide range of perspectives that cannot be sep arated into parts (Cajete, 2000b). 2) Second, Place is a relational (or relationship -based). This notion of Place as a relationship is evident in many definitions and studies about Indigenous People s and their connection to the land, and thus might be conside red a fundamental and shared aspect of sense of Place in an Indigenous context (Carlson, 2001; Cajete, 2000b). Indeed the principle of interrelatedness is central to Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 28 Indigenous epistemologies (Colorado, 1988). Vine Deloria Jr. captures both the aspects of relationship and multidimensionality b y Indian metaphysics, which he defines as \"the realization that the world, and all its possible experiences, constituted a social reality, a fabric of life in which everything had the possibility of intimate knowing re lationships because, ultimately, everything was related\" (Deloria and Wildcat, 2001 , p. 2). This epistemological framework entails two fundamental and related concepts: power and Place. While power refers to spiritual power or life force , Place refers to a \"familiarity with the personality of objects and entities of the natural world\" (Deloria and Wildcat, 2001 , p. 2 ) . I n o t h e r w o r d s , Place is a spiritual relationship with the tangible world that connects other aspects of life. 3) Third, Place is experiential ( A i k e n h e a d a n d O g a w a , 2 0 0 7 ; M i c h e l l , 2 0 0 5 ; C a j e t e , 2 0 0 0 b ; C a s e y i n Feld and Basso, 1996): it is the experiences that an individual has on their land - in their Place - that gives Place its meaning. Indeed, much Indigenous knowledge is created through exper ience (Scot t in N ader, 19 9 6). This includes b oth the re marka ble and th e unre mark able; it is life li ved e ve r y day (Basso in Feld and Basso, 1996). To learn Indigenous science, learners must actively participate in the natural world (Michell, 2007), a proces s that can be transferred to formal, curriculum -b a se d science learning (Kawagley, 1995; Kawagley and Barnheardt, 1999). Cajete cites the lack of practicality and its experiential approach as one of the major inhibitors of Aboriginal students' success in th e classroom (Cajete, 1988). In addition, Pauline Chinn notes, \"that Science studies connecting science and society provide opportunities for personally meaningful, experiential, inquiry and Place -based learning fundamental to scientific and environmental l iteracy\" (Chinn, 2007 , p. 1248). Eric Riggs reiterates the impact of this approach, arguing that field -based methods to teaching science result in higher success rates (Riggs, 2004). Such a hands -on approach to learning provides a tactile and tangible connection between knowledge and life; it is what makes learning meaningful and practical. Thus, Indigenous knowledge and learning become contextual geographically, socially, culturally, spiritually, an d physically (Battiste, 2002). Indeed, it is this contextuality and sense of Place that makes learning Indigenous knowledge experiential. 4) Fourth, Place is local . P l ace is site -specific and locality is central to its understanding. In Canada, Indigenous c ultural diversity is captured in 53 different First Nation languages belonging to eleven different language families (MacIvor, 1995). As Cajete (2000b) states, \"native people interacted with the places in which they lived for such a long time that their la ndscapes became reflections of their very souls\" (p. 183). People, then, become inseparable from the land they inhabit, and P l ace becomes as integral to Indigenous identities as culture is. A few examples illustrate this concept. Adelson (2000), who has do ne research among Cree People in northern Quebec, asserts the \"history of the people and the history of the land do not simply correspond to each other - they are one and the same\" (p. 29). Similarly N\u00eeh\u00eethew\u00e2k Ith\u00een\u00eewak like other Indigenous societies aro und the world consider themselves an intricate part of nature and have developed a way of life that reflects the boreal forest of northern Canada (Michell, 2005; Brightman, 1989, 2002; Siggens, 2005). N\u00eeh\u00eethew\u00e2k and the Places they occupy shape and form t he worldview, culture, language, e p i s t e m o l o g y , w a y s o f k n o w i n g , k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m s , v a l u e s , a n d t e a c h e r p r a c t i c e s i n s c i e n c e education (Michell, 2005). While this project thus recognizes the commonality of certain concepts specific to Indigenous cultures, i t also continues to respect and emphasize the centrality of locality to each of those groups. The concept of Place is as unique, individual, and local as the people who create it. Ac cording to P o mer oy ( 19 94) , l ocaliz ati on of s cience curriculu m is bas ed on the argument that students will see science learning as relevant , if they can situate it in the context of their lives. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 29 5) Fifth, and most essential, Place is land -based . Althoug h First N ations and M\u00e9tis People s come from diverse cultural contexts, there is a shared worldview in which humans are intricately connected to the land (Kawagley & Barnhardt, 1999; Knudtson & Suzuki, 1992; Michell, 2005). Leroy Little Bear elaborates: In Plains Indian philosophy, certain events, patterns, cycles, and happenings t ake place in certain places. From a human point of view, patterns, cycles, and happenings are readily observable on l a n d : a n i m a l m i g r a t i o n s , c y c l e s o f p l a n t l i f e , s e a s o n s , a n d s o o n . T h e c o s m o s i s a l s o o b s e r v a b l e , and patterns are detected from a particula r spatial location within the territory of a particular tribe. (Little Bear, 2000 , p. 78) Land is a central aspect of group identity among Indigenous cultures, and thus, so is the sense of Place that is tied to the land. It is the relationship between the land and the people who inhabit it, the connection people have to the land, and the role of Place in the history, culture, and community. Appreciating the connection to and relationship with the land that Indigenous People s h a v e i s essential to understand ing the concept of Place and its role in Indigenous knowledge. As Marie Battiste states, Indigenous knowledge is also inherently tied to land, not to land in general but to particular landscapes, landforms, and biomes where ceremonies are properly held, stories properly recited, medicines properly gathered, and transfers of knowledge properly authenticated. Ensuring the complete and accurate transmission of knowledge and authority from generation to generation depends not only on maintaining ceremonies, w hich Canadian law treats as art rather than science, but also on maintaining the integrity of the land itself. (Battiste, 2002 , p. 13) RCAP reiterated this view: Land touches every aspect of life: conceptual and spiritual views; securing food, shelter and clothing; cycles of economic activities including the division of labour; forms of social organization such as recreational and ceremonial events; and systems of governance and management. (RCAP, 1996 , 2.2.4.3.2) Hence, land or Place cannot be viewed in is olation of other cultural aspects. Knowledge, economy, society, and spirituality are all interconnected. In the context of Indigenous science, Place m i g h t be better and more simply understood or defined, then, as the product of the relationship with and connection to the land. Michell (2007), discusses science education among the Woodlands Cree and elaborates on this notion: The fresh air, the sights and sounds of nature always leave me deeply connected and whole. For me, it wasn't just the physical aesthe tic beauty of it all nor the momentary awe experienced when one is walking through a forest. It is a deep sense of spiritual connectedness that is hard to describe in human words and most likely would be misunderstood and perhaps even discarded by a person who thinks from a secular and positivist Western science perspective. Being out on the land allowed me to become aware that I was connected to something much more greater than myself. For people of N\u00eeh\u00eeth\u00e2w\u00e2k heritage, the concept of experience is cultura lly defined and goes beyond human interactions to embrace an essence of what I come to know as an interconnected spiritually imbued relatedness. (p. 7) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 30 Place in Education With this view of Place , then, its role in science education becomes evident. Learnin g from Place refers to \"the learning of traditional knowledge, processes and practices from living in a particular place\" (CCL, 2007a). An enhanced science curriculum recognizes Indigenous knowledge as a total knowledge system that describes and explains n ature in culturally powerful ways. This knowledge resides in Aboriginal languages. Its validity is delimited by its geographic setting of those who hold it. Indigenous Knowledge systems are Place -based knowledge systems (Michell, 2005). Place -based education is a method that includes experiential learning in local natural and social settings. It is includes a trans -disciplinary and cross -cultural synthesis of Place -related knowledge and pedagogy, and service learning or other forms of com munity outreach (Gruenewald, 2003a, 2003b; Sobel, 2004). Place -based teaching is conscious of, and empowers the senses of Place of students and teachers; and it promotes local ecological and cultural sustainability (Sobel, 2004; MacIvor, 1995; Tuhiwai Smit h, 2002). 2.4 The Concept of Indigenous Science Education Indigenous Knowledge, Worldviews, and Epistemologies To the question, what is Indigenous knowledge? Marie Battiste and S\u00e1k\u00e9j Henderson (2000) reply, \"No short answer exists\" ( p. 3 5 ) . I n f a c t , t h e y w arn against the Eurocentric temptation to classify or categorize Indigenous knowledge , thereby restricting it to a fixed definition. This warning arises because k n o w l e d g e , a s a s o c i o -cultural linguistic artefact, cannot be directly (literally) translated: \"Eurocentric structures and methods of logical entailment and causality ... derive from a noun -centered language system, and they are ineffective in verb -centered Indigenous language systems\" (Battiste and Henderson, 2000, p. 40). Therefore, complications ma y arise when attempting to understand Indigenous knowledge from a Eurocentric (Western) point of view. Specifically, Battiste and Henderson (2000) identify that (1) Indigenous knowledge does not fit into the Eurocentric concept of culture ; (2) it is not a uniform concept among all Indigenous People s ; a n d ( 3 ) i t cannot be separated from its bearer and codified into a definition ( pp. 35-36). Part of the reason why Indigenous knowledge resists the Western tendency to define is because it cann ot be reduced to distinct categories. Battiste and Henderson (2000) explain: \"No separation of science, art, religion, philosophy, or aesthetics exist in Indigenous thought; such categories do not exist\" ( p. 40). Similarly, Indigenous science cannot be sub sumed as a category of Indigenous knowledge . In Western knowledge, the study of nature (small 'n') is reserved for science; Indigenous knowledge makes no distinction because Nature (big 'N') is the source of knowledge. In fact, Battiste and Henderson (2000 ) assert, \"The best way to understand Indigenous knowledge is to be open to accepting different realities (however one uses this term)\" ( p. 40). Michell (2007), for example uses the terms Indigenous knowledge and Indigenous science in an interchangeable w ay. With these considerations in mind, the attempt here will be to understand Indigenous knowledge and not classify it. Indigenous perspectives are embedded within Indigenous worldviews. An Indigenous worldview provides the filter from which Place -based ep istemologies, methodologies, and pedagogies can be articulated. Although Aboriginal Peoples come from diverse cultural contexts, there is a shared worldview in which humans are intricately connected to the natural 1992). This sentiment is captured by Lakota thinker V i n e D e l o r i a , J r . , w h o o b s e r v e d t h a t t h e r e a r e t w o g r e a t t r u t h s a b o u t I n d i g e n o u s People : First, Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 31 Indigenous nations share a certain unanimity in their views on th e natural world and on the behaviour of humans in that world. Second, the diversity of ecologies or living lodges has resulted in distinct nations with diverse worldviews (Henderson, 2000, pp. 259-260). While Aboriginal worldviews in Canada are similar in that they are Place -based , t h e y a r e , b y t h e v e r y s a m e t o k e n , a s diverse a s t h e p l a c e s f r o m which they emanate: \"Indigenous peoples' worldviews are cognitive maps of particular ecosystems\" (Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 4 0). Puebl o sch olar Gr eg ory Caj ete ( 1994) explains the unanimity among Indigenous worldviews as being rooted in Nature: \"Indian people traditionally understood the human psyche and the roots of human meaning as grounded in the same order that they perceived in Nature. They experienced Nature a s a p a r t o f t h e m s e l v e s a n d t h e m s e l v e s a s p a r t o f i t . T h e y u n d e r s t o o d t h e m s e l v e s l i t e r a l l y a s b o r n o f t h e E a r t h o f t h e i r P l a c e \" ( p. 83). Therefore, in order to understand Indigenous worldviews, one must understand how Indigenous worldviews perceive Nature and the ecological order. Because Indigenous People s have experienced particular ecosystems for millennia, they are privy to the ecological patterns of constant flux and connectedness inherent in Nature. Moreover, these patterns are reflected in their wor ldview: \"Aboriginal worldviews are empirical relationships with local ecosystems, and ... by living in an ecological space for millennia, Aboriginal people have established a worldview that sees the orde r of life as a s tate of flux\" (Hende rson, 2 00 0, p. 259) . S\u00e1k\u00e9j Henderson (2000) identifies two important ways in which Aboriginal worldviews understand ecosystems: \"First, they understand the ecosystems as an eternal system tolerant of flux and refined by endless renewals and realignments. Second, they unders tand that each ecosystem encapsulates and enfolds many forces or parts, none of which can enfold or encapsulate the whole. The forces express nature instead of creating it\" ( p. 260). Thus, Indigenous worldviews reflect these two aspects of ecological order : Nature exhibits a harmonious and relational order that is subject to constant change or flux. A w o r l d v i e w t h a t r e c o g n i z e s a n d r e f l e c t s N a t u r e ' s c o n s t a n t f l u x \" l e a d s t o a h o l i s t i c a n d c y c l i c a l v i e w o f the world\" (Little Bear, 2000, p. 78). Leroy Little Be ar (2000) explains: \"If everything is constantly moving a n d c h a n g i n g , t h e n o n e h a s t o l o o k a t t h e w h o l e t o b e g i n t o s e e p a t t e r n s \" ( p. 78). All life is an intrinsic p a r t o f N a t u r e ' s p a t t e r n .

All things are animate, imbued with spirit, and in constant motion\" ( p. 77). It follows from this understanding that \"If everything is animate, then everything has spirit and knowledge. If everything has s pirit and knowledge, then all are like me. If all are like me, then a l l a r e m y r e l a t i o n s \" ( p. 78). This sentiment is embodied in the Lakota phrase, \"Mitakuye Oyasin\", meaning, \"We are all related\", which, Cajete (1994) notes, \"is a guiding principle of Ind ian spiritual e c o l o g y r e f l e c t e d b y e v e r y t r i b e i n t h e i r p e r c e p t i o n o f N a t u r e . I t i s a d e e p l y s p i r i t u a l , e c o l o g i c a l a n d epistemological principle of profound significance\" ( p. 74). The implications of such a profound principle are significant. Reflecting th e ecological connectedness of Nature, \"the Aboriginal worldview asserts that all life is sacred and that all life forms are connected\" (Henderson, 2000, p. 259). Because all life is related, the e c o l o g i c a l i m p e r a t i v e ( i f i t c a n b e r e f e r r e d t o a s s u c h ) i s o n e o f h a r m o n y : \" M o s t A b o r i g i n a l w o r l d v i e w s are founded on the belief that all life forms were created to adapt to ecological change\" (Henderson, 2000, p. 260). All life being equal, humans must similarly adapt to the constant flux of Nature's order: \"Indigenous cosmologies generally describe the universe as chaotic, in the strict mathematical sense of a s y s t e m d e f i n e d b y r a n d o m a s w e l l a s n o n -random forces. E verything is expected to change, in both predictable and unpredictable ways, thus requiring human vigilance and adaptation\" (Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 46). Indigenous knowledge does not only embody the framework of Indigenous Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 32 worldview from which it c ame, but it embodies the implied responsibilities that humans have towards the natural world. Indigenous epistemologies are Place -based and include a variety of knowledge sources. For Indigenous People , worldwide, the land is the ultimate source of knowled ge (Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 41). M o r e s p e c i f i c a l l y , \" a l l k n o w l e d g e f l o w s f r o m t h e s a m e s o u r c e : t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p s b e t w e e n a g l o b a l f l u x that needs to be renewed, the people's kinship with the other living creatures that share the land, and the peopl e's kinship with the spirit world\" (Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 41). As such, Indigenous knowledge is \"the expression of the vibrant relationships between the people, their ecosystems, and the other living beings and spirits that share their lands\" (Bat tiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 42). Erica Irene D a e s ( 1 9 9 4 ) s t r e s s e s t h a t t h e l a n d o r e c o l o g y p l a y s t h e r o l e o f t h e I n d i g e n o u s k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m ' s \"central and indispensable classroom\" (para. 9; in Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 41). Place , h o w e v e r , i s n o t o n l y t h e s o u r c e o f k n o w l e d g e , i t i s a l s o t h e a u t h o r i t y . B e c a u s e t h e v a l i d i t y o f Indigenous knowledge is delimited by its geographic and ecological setting for those who hold it, it is called Place -based knowledge (Battiste & Henderson, 2000; Hampton, 1995; Ka writes: \"The power of Aboriginal science [Indigenous k n o w l e d g e ] r e s t s w i t h i t s v a l i d i t y f o r a p a r t i c u l a r p l a c e \" ( p. 293). Because Indigenous knowledge is specific to a particular P l ac e , it is not easily transferable to different contexts. For Indigenous People s, knowledge is as dynamic as the very Place it reflects: \"Indigenous knowledge is not static but, like the shifting dynamics of particular ecologies, changes over time\" (Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 48). As such, Indigenous knowledge \"is more than mere ecological awareness; it is a living relationship with a specific environment that is not conceived of as either universal or conventional\" (Henderson, 2000, p. 260; emphasis added). Battiste (2002) summarizes Indigenous knowledge as it has been described thus far: Indigenous knowledge thus embodies a web of relationships within a specific ecological context; contains linguistic categories, rules, and relationships unique to each kno wledge system; has localized content and meaning; has established customs with respect to acquiring and sharing of knowledge (not all Indigenous peoples equally recognize their responsibilities); and implies responsibilities for possessing various kinds of knowledge. ( p. 14) The term Indigenous knowledge i s m e a n t t o c o n v e y \" a c o m p l e t e k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m w i t h i t s o w n concepts of epistemology, philosophy, and scientific and logical validity\" (Erica Irene Dais in Battiste and Henderson, 2000, p. 41). It contains linguistic categories, established customs, and responsibilities for the holders of knowledge. Indigenous knowledge is Place -based in the sense that the land and the communities are both the source and the authority of the knowledge. Because there are div erse ecologies, there are diverse systems of knowledge that flow from these places. Indigenous knowledge is both local (to a Place ) and diverse . Having experienced Nature for millennia, Indigenous knowledge systems embrace the constant flux and connectedne ss of diverse ecological orders. Indigenous knowledge is concerned with adapting all life, holistically, to the constant flux of ecosystems. As such, Indigenous knowledge can be described as a living relationship with Nature. For this reason, Indigenous knowledge is social and relational . Because Indigenous worldviews and epistemologies share a radically different conception of Nature, they offer the possibility of a radically different conception of science: \"Indigenous epistemology is guided by Indigenous worldview frameworks that provide a lens for different perceptions of scientific knowledge and ways of thinking, and acting on complex problems and natural reality\" (Michell, 2007, p. 78). In the next section, we explore the definition of science and the importance of including Indigenous science within this definition. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 33 Defining Science and Indigenous Science The definition of science can be problematic when incorporating Indigenous knowledge systems in school science. With an increasing multi -cultural diversity in Canada, one must ask the question, is science multicultural or does it represent the Eurocentric -Western worldview? The term science is problematic because of its political history and neo -colonizing potential. Citing MacLeod & Collins (1981), Aikenhead (2006a) explains: The political history of the word science in England privileges a very narrow meaning (the canonical Western science content taught in universities), which today can act in a neo - colonizing way. The word science was deliberatel y chosen in 1831 when some natural philosophers founded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and thereby professionalized natural philosophy into a new social institution, which they called science for very political reasons. ( p. 5) Accor ding to Harding (2006), \"the term [ science ] i s a W e s t e r n o n e a n d c a n s e e m t o c o m m i t y e t o n e m o r e c a s e o f E u r o c e n t r i s m w h e n [ o n e ] i n s i s t [ s ] o n u s i n g i t t o c h a r a c t e r i z e k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m s n o t s o conceptualized by their makers\" ( p. 11). Because Indigenous know ledge is inseparable from the culture t o w h i c h i t b e l o n g s , s o m e a u t h o r s p r e f e r t h e t e r m Indigenous knowledge to Indigenous science (Semali & Kincheloe, 1999; Aikenh ead, 2006b, p. 9 ) . O t h e r s u s e t h e t w o t e r m s i n t e r c h a n g e a b l y ( M i c h e l l , 2 0 0 7 ) . In the interest of social equity, Aikenhead (2006b) uses the term I ndigenous science because it seems more equivalent to the term Western science (p. 9). Conversely, when referring to school science, Aikenhead (2006b) uses \"the term Western science to draw attention to t he fact that the scientific enterprise associated with traditional school science evolved within Euro -American cultural settings\" ( p. 10). To teach science from a Eurocentric perspective that assumes universal validity constitutes neocolonialism (a process equivalent to saying there is only one science and it is modern western science). One proposed solution to the problem of the Eurocentric (and thus neo/colonial) connotations of science is to expand the definition of science to include Indigenous Knowledg e systems (i.e. Indigenous sciences). Harding (2006) uses the term science \"to mean any systematic empirical study of ourselves and the world around us\" ( p. 10). Such a broad definition, however, is not to be confused for scientific relativism, Harding war n s : \" T o r e g a r d a l l o f t h e s e d i f f e r e n t k n o w l e d g e ( o r p r a c t i c e ) s y s t e m s a s s c i e n c e s i s n o t t o regard them as equally accurate, comprehensive, or useful with respect to any particular questions we might ask\" ( p. 11). Aikenhead (2006a) offers a broader and inc lusive definition of science f r o m a s o c i o - cultural perspective in the following way: \"science is a rational, empirically based description - explanation of nature. This concept includes, among others, the Eurocentric cultural perspective (Western science) an d Aboriginal cultural perspectives (Indigenous knowledge) held by First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples in Canada\" ( p. 3). Ogawa (1995) reinforces this perspective and argues that, \"every culture has its own science and refers to this notion of science in a g i v e n c u l t u r e a s i t s Indigenous science \" (Michell, 2007, p. 33). Indigenous knowledge systems are identified by such phrases as Native science (Cajete, 2000), Aboriginal science (Christie, 1991), Maori science (McKinley, 1996), Yupiaq science (Kawagley, 1995) and ethno or ethnic science ( O v a n d o , 1 9 9 8 ) . C a j e t e ( 1 9 8 6 ) a n d O v a n d o ( 1 9 8 8 ) u s e t h e t e r m s native science and ethnoscience to refer to a traditional form of Indigenous -based science education which includes \"the methods, thought processes, mind sets, values, concepts and experiences by which Native American groups understand, reflect and obtain empirical knowledge about the natural world\" (c.f. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 34 Pomeroy, 1994, p. 66). Cajete (1986, 2000) \"asserts that the ethnoscience of each Indigenous people is uniqu e in that it reflects adaptation to a certain Place \" (Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 40). Michell (20 07 ) has expl ored the w o rk of Caj ete ( 19 86, 2 0 00) a nd explains tha t the ter m ethnoscience is based on the assumption that each cultural group differs in the ir knowledge of and experiences with the natural world: \"In essence, ethno -science represents the perceptions, interpretations and applications of inquiry characteristic of a particular cultural group. The study of ethno -science is about coming to understa n d how particular cultural groups perceive, learn and act in relationship to their particular environments\" (p. 37). However, it can be difficult to escape the Western privileging of science . Citing Ogawa (1995), Michell (2007) notes, \"The use of the terms Ethno -science and Ethnic are problematic. The terms privilege Western science because they do not accept Euro -Western science as ethnic based ; w h i c h i t i s a t l e a s t f r o m a m u l t i -science perspective\" ( p. 37). This sets up an ethnic -no n- ethnic binary for sci e n c e , i n w h i c h i t i s a s s u m e d t h a t W e s t e r n s c i e n c e , d e t a c h e d f r o m c u l t u r e a n d ethnicity, is objective and Indigenous science, coloured by culture, is subjective. Harding (2006) reminds us \"Binary making ... has been a persistent practice of the imperializing modern West\" ( p. 12). While recognizing Indigenous science as science can be problematic, it can also be beneficial. Harding (2006) identifies some of the benefits in levelling the playing field and keeping both eyes open when comparing different knowledge systems recognized as scientific. These include recognizing how each knowledge might be better suited for certain contexts or problems ( p. 11), recognizing the strengths and limitations o f e a c h k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m , a n d r e -imagining how to improve the relatio ns between knowledge systems and their economic, social, political, and cultural projects ( p. 22). Similarly, Aikenhead (2006b) writes, \"such comparisons harbor hidden Eurocentric assumptions about non -European knowledge systems, but nevertheless, dichotom o u s c o m p a r i s o n s c a n s e r v e a s a f i r s t s t e p i n a j o u r n e y t o w a r d w i s d o m \" ( pp. 112-113). Related to the strategy of expanding the definition of science to include Indigenous science is the effort to integrate the two systems of knowledge. Comparing Indigenous Science and Western Science The similarities and differences between Indigenous and Western science have received a great deal of attention in the literature (Aikenhead, 1997, 2001; ANSC, 1999; M c K i n l e y e t a l . , 1 9 9 2 ; S n i v e l y & C o r s i g l i a , 2 0 0 1 ; S t e p h e n s , 2 0 0 0 ) . M i c h e l l ( 2 0 0 7 ) a r g u e s t h e r e i s a n e e d to explore, delineate, and articulate \"these similarities and differences in sp ecific First Nations contexts for curriculum development purposes\" ( p. 62). While there are similarities and commonalities Indigenous Peoples did not develop along parallel lines. One of the commonalities Indigenous Peoples s h a r e i s a w o r l d v i e w o f i n t e r c o nnectedness. Each Place however will have different expressions of their worldviews, epistemologies, methodologies, and pedagogies in relation to school science. Because of the diverse cultural contexts, the interpretation of nature is also diverse and th us the knowledge/science content of each system is not easily translatable. Kawagley (1990) explains that Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal people \"use the same method and thinking processes to seek answers to the same questions. However , the different value c oncepts, perspectives, and philosophy determine how they interpret the empirical data and how they relate to the natural world\" (p. 14). For more examples of comparisons see Appendix 3. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 35 Aikenhead (2006) cautions that dichotomous comparisons may harbor hidd en Euro -centric assumptions about Indigenous knowledge systems. Binary opposites can lead to erroneous and stereotypical assumptions about which knowledge is better than the other. Rather, these knowledge systems are recognized in post -colonial discourse a s ways of thinking or ways of knowing that are incommensurate and equally valid while acknowledging each group's heterogeneity (Aikenhead, 2007, in press). From an Indigenous perspective, we are all related, and each knowledge base has an equal place withi n t h e metaphoric wheel of life. The following comparisons between Western science and Indigenous science have been constructed f r o m e x i s t i n g l i t e r a t u r e . W e b e l i e v e i t i s n e c e s s a r y f o r p e o p l e t o s e e t h e u n i q u e n e s s o f e a c h knowledge system as the first step towards understanding and celebrating cultural difference. Comparing knowledge systems is a way of illuminating and rejecting the positivist Western science p a r a d i g m a s t h e s o l e m o d e l f o r s e e k i n g t r u t h . M o r e i m p o r t a n t l y , t h e c o m p a r i s o n s s e r v e a s a p o i n t o f clarity that positivist Western science thinkers may want to think about. As with most dichotomous comparisons, they can be challenged as partly accurate and useful. WESTERN SCIENCE CONCEPTS Science is a Subset of Euro -Western Culture People are Separate from the World Around The m What Counts as Science - Is What Can be Measured Focus on Physical World - Absence of the Sacred Scientific Method - Compartmentalized Knowledge Fragmented Worldview - Linear - Hierarchical Mechanistic - Reductionist - Rational Impersonal Mathematical idealized - De-Contextualized Exploitative - Materialistic - Ideological - Elitist.

The ir website identifies integrative science as an effort to bring together Indigenous and W e s t e r n s c i e n t i f i c k n o w l e d g e a n d w a y s o f k n o w i n g t o c r e a t e l i v i n g k n o w l e d g e f o r t h e 2 1st century. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 36 Integration represents a popular contemporary pedagogical approach to teach science to Aboriginal students, and to a lesser degree, to non -Aboriginal students. Aikenhead (2002) notes, \"The issue of bridging the two knowledge systems (Western science and Aboriginal science) for the benefit of Aboriginal students is not new (Maddock, 1981; Pomeroy, 1994). One propose d bridge lies within the field of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) (Johnson, 1992, 288). T E K c a m e i n t o w i d e s p r e a d u s e i n s c h o l a r l y c i r c l e s i n t h e 1 9 8 0 s ( S e e a l s o J o h n s o n , 1 9 9 2 ; I n g l i s 1 9 9 3 ; Lukey, 1995; Johannes, 1989, 1993; Williams & Baines, 1993). It is important to note the concept of TEK was constructed by Western academics (Aikenhead, 2002, p. 2 8 9 ) . G i v e n i t s h e r i t a g e , T E K m a y b e attractive to Western scientists and academics because of the apparent compatibility with Western stan dards of science and applicability to the Western academic scheme of organizing knowledge into disciplines. Battiste and Henderson (2000) explain how \"The Traditional Ecological Knowledge of Indigenous peoples is scientific, in the sense that it is empiric al, experimental, and systematic\" ( p. 44). McGregor (1994, 1995(a)(b); 1999; 2000) uses the term Traditional Ecological Knowledge to refer to a branch of Indigenous knowledge literature that is usually connected to the disciplines of biology and the enviro nment. However, \"There is no universal agreed upon definition of Traditional Ecological Knowledge\" (Michell, 2007, p. 3 4 ) . T h e p r a c t i c e o f T E K m a y b e m o r e r e v e a l i n g o f t h e p r o b l e m s t h a t come with integrating different knowledge systems. Aikenhead (2002) ci tes McGregor (2000), who found that interest in TEK usually originates outside Aboriginal communities, resulting in non -Aboriginal scientists determining the agenda, which perpetuates the colonial exploitation of Indigenous knowledge (p. 289). Elsewhere, Nadasdy (1999) studied several cases where Aboriginal holders of TEK participated with government scientists in resource management and environmental impact assessment studies. Nadasdy's study revealed that \"TEK was used by government scientists to avoid a two -way integration of the two knowledge systems and to reinforce a Western cultural bias that controlled the decision making over local land and animal issues\" (Aikenhead, 2002, p. 289). Given the systemic and hegemonic power relationships inherent in s uch processes as integration, \"McGregor (2000) concludes that we should not integrate or bridge Western and Aboriginal sciences, as TEK attempts to do \"(Aikenhead, 2002, p. 289). Instead, we should actively support a post -colonial model she calls co-existe nce, w h i c h promotes functioning of both systems side by side . Battiste (2000), MacIvor, (1995), Sainte -Marie (2000) and Urion (1999) embrace the concept of co-existence . Other models that balance two cultures include two-way learning (Ritchie & Butler, 199 0), cr o s s -cultural learning (Aikenhead, 1997, 2006a), and bi- cultural instruction (Cajete, 1999; Kawagley, 1995, 2000). The matter of cross -cultural science education, however, is not a simple matter. Ogawa (1995) warns that Indigenous science i s m o r e t h a n j u s t a s i n g l e k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m c o m p a r a b l e t o W e s t e r n s c i e n c e . Instead, it is \"a body of stratified and amalgamated knowledge and cosmology\" ( p. 1). For this reason, \"A s i m p l e [ c u r r i c u l a r ] t r a n s f o r m a t i o n f r o m o n e s y s t e m t o a n o t h e r i s n o t o f t e n f e a s i b l e ( M cKinley, 2005). According to Aikenhead (2006b) \"integration can fail depending on the context\" ( p. 123). Therefore, it would be a mistake to attempt to simply translate contemporary curricular objectives, (derived as they are) from the Western worldview t o an Indigenous worldview and language system. Whether the two knowledge systems are compatible depends on the context. This means great care should be taken when attempting to make a cross -cultural science curriculum. In the case of Rekindling Traditions (Aikenhead, 2002), there was success incorporating Western science into an Indigenous science curriculum. Aikenhead explains the process: \"After the unit is firmly Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 37 grounded in an Aboriginal framework (accomplished in one to three lessons), the next move is to introduce students to relevant Western science content from the Saskatchewan science curriculum\" ( p. 295). The units were successful because Western science did not displace Indigenous science ; instead, Western science enhanced Indigenous science : \"Wes tern science can powerfully clarify one small aspect of Aboriginal science\" and when it \"did not replace Aboriginal science, it enriched an aspect of it\" ( p. 295). However, there is literature that recommends keeping both knowledge systems separate. Garrou tte (1999) published a paper entitled American Indian Science Education: The Second Step which provides a synthesis of the contrasting assumptions in Western scientific and American traditional thought systems and the importance of keeping these two models of inquiry separate when designing Indigenous -based science curriculum. Clearly, there is no simple formula for cross -cultural science education. For these reasons outlined here (and more), \"Creating a balance between two worldviews is the great challenge facing modern educators\" (Battiste, 2000a, p. 202). Environmental Movements and Science Education Part of the inspiration for the Learning Indigenous Science from Place research project has emerged from work being done in national and international forums such as the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the declaration by the United Nations Educational and Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in declaring the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development and the need for o ngoing inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in resolving global environmental issues which affect all of us. In an effort to stimulate discussion and action on sustainable development globally, UNESCO declared, The goal of the United Nations Decade of Educ ation for Sustainable Development (2005 -2014, DESD), for which UNESCO is the lead agency, is to integrate the principles, values, and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning. This educational effort will encourage changes in behaviour that will create a more sustainable future in terms of environmental integrity, economic viability, and a just society for present and future generations. (United Nations Eduational, Scientific an d Cultural Organization, n.d.) There are few Aboriginal individuals active in these important international forums indicating an underlying issue of the public education community's inability to inspire and impart Aboriginal students with the skills to add ress global biological diversity issues from an Indigenous perspective. Currently, in Canada, academic science education is a process based in Western Eurocentric philosophies and ideologies that are not conducive to the preservation of traditional knowled ge. In order for Indigenous Peoples to engage in global environmental issues it is important to examine the need for traditional knowledge and perspectives, as well as the educational infrastructure that must be in place to support the perpetuation of that knowledge. Without supporting educational infrastructure, Aboriginal Peoples are left in a void between the forces that acknowledge the importance of traditional knowledge in addressing biological diversity issues, and an education system that does not pr omote the generation of traditional knowledge, innovations and practices. An opportunity is at hand to encourage Canadian educational systems to support Aboriginal -b a s ed ontology, epistemologies, and pedagogical practices. Researching and creating better p aradigms within which human being can thrive and the environment can be conserved is a challenge of being able to see the value in local traditions, innovations and practices and incorporate them into our contemporary lives. In order to promote Indigenous science education, non -Indigenous education systems must Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 38 increase their understanding of Aboriginal worldviews, epistemologies, pedagogies, and new Indigenous education systems must be supported as equitable and beneficial processes. Aboriginal Epistemolog y In describing the difference between Aboriginal epistemology and Western epistemology, Ermine (1995) has said, Those people who seek knowledge on the physical plane objectively find their answers through e x p l o r a t i o n o f t h e o u t e r s p a c e , s o l e l y o n t h e c o r p oreal level. Those who seek to understand the reality of existence and harmony with the environment by turning inward have a different incorporeal knowledge paradigm that might be termed 'Aboriginal epistemology'...The inner space is that universe of bein g within each person that is synonymous with the soul, the spirit, the self, or the being. (p. 103) Indigenous Peoples do not seek understanding, nor convey cultural teachings within the group through objective processes. Indigenous knowledge systems are t h e s u m t o t a l o f d i v e r s e s t r e a m s o f k n o w l e d g e gathered over time, accepted by the community and synthesized into collective knowledge as necessary for survival. Traditional teachings are provided for the learner to integrate intangible elements of self with in the comprehension process. It is a process of cultural breathing. Knowledge is drawn in, internalized and expressed by individuals and by collectives. The cyclical process is repeated as naturally as one draws breath. Individual and collective kinship p atterns, experiences, relationships, interpretations of community practices, spirituality and history are all important factors that contribute to cultural epistemology. In order to maintain equilibrium within the world, complex systems of reciprocity foun d within traditional knowledge must be understood and practiced by the teacher and the learner. One's actions impact upon one's environment, resulting in a tremendous responsibility carried by the individual, and the community, that must be considered care fully before carrying out a particular action. This responsibility is not only to the physical world or others in the community, but it is also a responsibility to the spiritual world. Aboriginal philosophy of Plains Indians holds that all things are anima te, have spirit, are in constant motion, that interrelationships between entities are of paramount importance and that referential space is more important than time (Little Bear , 2000, p. 77) . This philosophy provides the foundation for values and customs such as the acceptance of wholeness or totality, strength, independence and respect, non -interference for others' wholeness, totality and knowledge, sharing, humour, honesty and kindness. These values function to maintain the relationships that hold creati on together (Little Bear , 2000, p. 79-80). Teachings of respect are complex and require contextual knowledge and reflection. Respect for one's self, respect for one's fellow human beings, respect for the earth and respect for the spiritual realm are all inherent within the concept. Teaching and learning the complexiti es of respect transcend a lifetime. I t i s a n e v e r -ending process of living to achieve different levels and layers of understanding. Learning is not a linear process. One acquires spiritual and intellectual growth through dynamic interaction with other bei ngs sharing their environment, often by cyclical or repetitive experience. Aboriginal Peoples need to remain in contact with their cultural environments, and retain contact with traditional teachers, in order to ingrain, experience and internalize traditio nal teachings. Continuity of Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 39 contact with cultural teachers contributes to the retention and synthesis of traditional knowledge critical for the holistic development of Aboriginal children. Researchers, teachers and learners working to have traditional kno wledge respected for what it is and how it exists must do so in a manner consistent with the nature of traditional knowledge in its holism and sacredness. Internalizing traditional knowledge facilitates the revitalization of self, the collective and existe nce of the natural world. Theories of Ecological Education Theories of ecological education provide opportunities to consider a context for educational foundations supporting the future of human survival. Examining the intricate and complex relationships i nherent in the natural world can help humans understand our own roles within these, and all other, relationships. Theory places firsthand knowledge in diverse contexts, deepens insights, and provides for critical reflection. Insights from the multiple p ractices and theories of environmental justice, indigenous knowledges, feminism and ecofeminism, critical pedagogy, environmental thought, deep ecology, bioregionalism and the other educations...all have much to offer environmental education, just as envir onmental education can enrich the theory and practice of each. While not wishing to minimize the important differences and tensions between these movements and educations, each contributes to a diversity of voices, each is grounded in specific communities and experiences, and each combats injustice and works towards more inclusive politics and social change. (Russell, Bell, & Fawcett, 2000, p. 209) Developing an intimate knowledge of the environment sustaining us can help us personally to discover a sense of Place and, with it, all the responsibilities we hold in ensuring the continued health of a particular place. For some, development of having a sense of Place begins in childhood with exposure to the natural world in which a sense of wonder is inspired. For others, development of a sense of wonder a n d r e s p e c t m a y c o m e l a t e r i n l i f e i n o t h e r f o r m s . F o r a l l , d e v e l o p m e n t o f t h e r e a l i z a t i o n o f o u r inextricable inte rconnectedness with the natural world is essential to its appreciation and the action necessary for preserving ecological integrity. Educators versed in ecological theory must play key roles in inspiring colleagues and students to integrate ecological awar eness into curricula. The goal of ecological education is transform our selves from passive witnesses of environmental destruction to involved active participants in actualizing attitude and lifestyle changes necessary for our human survival. Smith and Wil liams (1999) challenge readers to rethink contemporary cultural assumptions about our relationships with nature and to seek out ecologically sustainable lifestyles through education. The amount of literature and media regarding environmental crises raises awareness, but can also serve to generate feelings of helplessness and fear preventing people from becoming active problem -so lve rs. Rather, Smith and Williams encourage exploration of practical activities across curriculum and age groups to discover possi ble directions that might be pursued to develop a more ecologically sustainable culture. They share the following Principles of Ecological Education : Development of personal affinity with the earth through practical experiences out -of-doors and through the practice of an ethic of care; Grounding learning in a sense of place through the study of knowledge possessed by local elders and the investigation of surrounding natural and human communities; Induction of students into an experience of community that co unters the press toward individualism that is dominant in contemporary social and economic experiences; Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 40 Acquisition of practical skills needed to regenerate human and natural environments; Introduction to occupational alternatives that contribute to the pr eservation of local cultures and the natural environment; Preparation for work as activists able to negotiate local, regional, and national governmental structures in an effort to adopt policies that support social justice and ecological sustainability; Critique of cultural assumptions upon which modern industrial civilization has been built, exploring in particular how they have contributed to the exploitation of the natural world and human populations. (Smith & Williams, 1999, pp. 6-7) Smith and William's ( 1 9 9 9 ) w o r k d r a w s o n i d e a s a n d m o d e l s p r e s e n t e d b y a v a r i e t y o f e d u c a t o r s t o encourage a re -conceptualization of the relationship between education and the environment, and the purpose of education itself. Recognizing the role education currently plays in our ability to participate in a competitive global market, Smith and Williams acknowledge curriculum must be implemented with a balanced perspective, allowing students to consider all sides of controversial issues, including \"bringing ecological interdepe ndence and an ethic of care in from the margin to the center of the debate\" ( Sm i th & Williams, 1999, p. 16) . R u s s e l l , B e l l a n d F a w c e t t ( 2 0 0 0 ) r e v i e w e d s e v e r a l f o r m s o f e n v i r o n m e n t a l e d u c a t i o n p r o g r a m s a c r o s s Canada. Some of the approaches adopted include h olistic models identified in Saskatchewan and Ontario that are supportive of interdisciplinary responses to complex environmental issues. The integration process involves grouping subjects such as English, drama, physical education, leadership, e n v i r o nm e nt al science and geography together. Additionally, secondary students can teach elementary students or undertake apprenticeships in jobs with an environmental focus. Integrated programs such as these promote \"critical aspects of environmental education: grou nding learning in authentic, \"real world\" experiences; demonstrating subject areas; fostering student responsibility; increasing student -teacher contact; and improving relations among students\" (Russell, Bell, & Fawcett, 2000, p. 200) . Inclus ion of traditional Aboriginal philosophies and practices encourages students to explore relationships between land and culture, sense of Place , e a r t h a n d c o s m o s , m u l t i -cultural perspectives and concepts of the sacredness of nature. Other schools throughout Canada identify as Green Schools and are moving beyond traditional environmentalism to include development, equity, health, peace and rights studies. Green Schools provide an opportunity to engage those within the school as well as members of the broader community. Russell, Bell and Fawcett (2000) acknowledge that comprehensive participation is the exception rather than the rule in environmental education. Generally, the weight of providing strong environmental education programming falls on one or two com mitted teachers. Departure of these educators can mean the collapse of environmental programming. Increased environmental education w i t h i n t e a c h e r t r a i n i n g p r o g r a m s i s n e c e s s a r y t o s t i m u l a t e g r o w t h o f s c h o o l -based environmental education (p. 201) . In exami ning human -environment relationships, Russell, Bell and Fawcett (2000) describe one of the most contentious definitions of equating environment with resources . People living in modern, industrialized societies generally imagine humanity to be different fro m, and superior to, all other life resulting in the notion that the environment is to be controlled and used solely for our benefit. Alternatively, Indigenous worldviews hold a radically different premise that humans are part of, not Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 41 separate from, environ mental processes. Russell, Bell and Fawcett (2000) believe Indigenous perspectives hold more promise for educators who struggle with resourcist assumptions and are seeking to encourage an understanding that dilemmas we face have deep cultural roots in mode rn industrial society's profound alienation from the \"more -than -human world\" (p. 204) . O r r ( 1 9 9 2 ) d i r e c t l y a d d r e s s e s t h e f o r m a t i o n o f a t t i t u d e s , e c o l o g i c a l l i t e r a c y a n d f o r m a l e d u c a t i o n processes which shape our mental landscapes, language and observationa l abilities. Ecological literacy h a s b e c o m e d i f f i c u l t f o r u s a s a r e s u l t o f l i v i n g i n a n a g e o f i n c r e a s i n g s p e c i a l i z a t i o n p r o m o t e d b y a largely indoor education. The need to look at the roots of our ailments, not just the symptoms will contribute to cultiv ating a sense of Place and building a competent public who recognize that our lives depend on educating to live sustainably (pp. 86 -88). Orr (1992) holds the position that ...i t i s a m i s t a k e t o t h i n k t h a t a l l w e n e e d i s b e t t e r t e c h n o l o g y , n o t a n e c o l o g i c a l ly literate and caring public willing to help reduce the scale of problems by reducing its demands on the environment and to accept (even demand) public policies that require sacrifices. It all comes down to whether the public understands the relation betw een its well -being and th e health of the natural systems (p. 90) . In order to rethink education substance and process, Orr provides the following foundations of ecological literacy that will contribute to education for sustainable living: All education is environmental education; Environmental issues are complex and cannot be understood through a single discipline or department; For inhabitants, education occurs in part as a dialogue with a place and has the characteristics of good conversation; The way ed ucation occurs is as important as its content; Experience in the natural world is both an essential part of understanding the environment, and conducive to good thinking; Education relevant to the challenge of building a sustainable society will enhance th e learner's competence with natural systems. (Orr, 1992) The guiding foundations provided by Orr (1992) provide a framework for recognizing what is taught and not taught in schools, how our attitudes are shaped by the roles we see ourselves in, the need to combine different perspectives and knowledges to more fully understand systems and to move away from dictatorial attitudes in our interactions with the natural world. \"The concept of sustainability implies a radical change in the institutions and patterns t h a t w e h a v e c o m e t o a c c e p t a s n o r m a l \" (p. 94 ) . Challenging attitudes of limitless consumption requires seeking out developed theories and practices promoting ecological literacy. One of the leading scholars in Indigenous education is Dr. Gregory Cajete, a T e w a I n d i a n f r o m N e w Mexico. His book Look to the Mountain: An Ecology of Indigenous Education provides a personal synthesis and translation of tribal educational principles for contemporary education. Cajete explores traditional universal concepts found in various Indigenous cultures such as wholeness, self -knowledge, Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 42 spiritual development and the wisdom needed to accept our interconnectedness with the earth and cosmos. Cajete believes \"a contemporary application of Indian education must creatively integ rate the orientation of economic survival and ecological sustainability if it is to serve the needs of Indian people living in contemporary times\" (Cajete, 1994, p. 216) . Drawing on stories, song, art and philosophies of Indigenous cultures, Cajete's work culminates in a model of Indigenous Stages of Developmental Learning. At the centre of the model is the goal of \"finding the center completedness\" which results from a p rofound transformation of self (Cajete, 1994, p. 211) . The stages of transformative education are embedded in a context of respect for the spirit of the child, moving through basic education, societal education / survival skills, myth / ritual / ceremony, integration with tribal culture, visioning, individuation, enlightenment / wisdom, and finally, transformational understanding. Cajete's work is complex and comprehensive. It is more than a study of Indigenous knowledge. It is a theoretical framework for l ifelong learning processes supporting traditional values and practices. Achieving personal transformation and centeredness involves the exploration of a variety of approaches to learning. Educators must be willing to engage themselves in holistic teaching and learning processes in order to provide an Indigenous context of education. Cajete provides several characteristics that exemplify the transformational nature of Indigenous education. Briefly summarized, they include: Learning happens of its own accor d, if the individual has learned how to relate with his/her inner Center and the natural world; Experiences of significant hardship were a necessary part of an individual's education, and that such circumstances provided ideal moments for creative teaching ; Empathy and affection were key elements in learning. Also, direct subjective experience combined with affective reflection were essential elements of right education; An innate respect for the uniqueness of each person created the understanding that each person was their own teacher in their process of individuation. Indigenous education integrated the notion that there are many ways to learn, many ways to educate, many kinds of learners, many kinds of teachers, each honored for their uniqueness and their contribution to education; Each learning situation is unique and innately tied to the creative capacity of the learner. When this connection to creative learning and illumination is thwarted, frustration and rigidity follow. Learning therefore, had to be connected to the life process of each individual. The idea of life -long learning was a natural consideration; Teaching and learning are a collaborative contract between the teacher and learner. In this sense the teacher was not always human but could be a n animal, a plant, or other natural entity or force; Learners need to see, feel and visualize a teaching through their own and other people's perspectives. Therefore, telling and retelling a story from various perspectives and at various stages of life en riched learning, emphasized key thoughts, and mirrored ideas, attitudes, or perspectives back to learners for impact; There are basic developmental orientations involved with learning through which we must pass toward more complete understanding; Life itse lf is the greatest teacher and that each must accept the hard realities of life with those Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 43 that are joyous and pleasing; Learning through reflection and sharing experience in community allows us to understand our learning in the context of greater wholes. In a group there are as many ways of seeing, hearing, feeling, and understanding as there are members. (Cajete, Look to the mountain: an ecology of indigenous education, 1994, pp. 212 -214) In Igniting the Sparkle: An Indigenous Science Education Model , Caj e t e t a k e s a f u r t h e r s t e p b y s h a r i n g a culturally responsive science curriculum he has been teaching at the Institute of Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico for twenty -five years. This curriculum integrates Native American traditional values, teaching princ iples and concepts of nature with those of Western science (Cajete, 1999, p. 9) . Cajete cites Peat (1996) in coming to a description of Indigenous science, in that, ... It is a broad category that includes everything from metaphysics to philosophy to various practical technologies practiced by Indigenous peoples both past and present. At its most inclusive definition Indigenous science may be said to include practically all of human invention before the advent of Cartesian -mechanistic science. These include areas such as astronomy, healing, agriculture, study of plants, animals and natural phenomena. Yet Indigenous science extends beyond these areas to also include a foc us on spirituality, community, creativity, appropriate technology which sustains environments and other essential aspects of human life. (Cajete, 1999, p. 81) Further, Cajete goes on to say, Indigenous science includes exploration of basic questions such a s the nature of language, thought and perception, the movement of time, the nature of human feeling, the nature of human knowing, the nature of proper human relationship to the cosmos and a host of other questions about natural reality. Indigenous science is the collective inheritance of human experience with the natural world. It is a map of reality drawn from the experiences of thousands of human generations which gave rise to a diversity of technologies for hunting, fishing, gathering, making art, buil ding, communicating, visioning, healing and being. (Cajete, 1999, p. 81) These theoretical frameworks and perspectives offered by various authors provide a just a snapshot of views on ecological education. Diverse approaches and manifestations are possible given basic frameworks. Local adaptations to relevant community -based knowledge systems will enrich educational experiences for students and educators alike. Common to all theories is the idea that building practical curricula for ecological education inv olves getting out of the classroom into nature, and extending the support network of the educator to include other community members knowledgeable about local traditions. Similarly, in the Aboriginal communities, opportunities for inclusion of traditional knowledge holders to interact with formal educators will result in a broadening of experiences for students, stronger relationships between community members and schools, and an expanded base of experience for educators. Within school systems, educators, a dministrators and other key people need only consider the alternative to not building an ecologically aware and active public to find motivation to begin or expand their efforts in ecological education. In the next section, a summary of promising practices is provided for educators. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 44 2.5 Promising Practices: A Summary of the literature This literature review presents the main themes found in studies that offer promising practices and/or recommendations that support First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit student ach ievement and positive learning outcomes in school science. While there are many studies that examine Aboriginal education in Canada, few offer practices and recommendations that have proven to be successful in schools. Although the historical and ongoing e xperiences of racialized students are similar in terms of experiencing exclusion, segregation, and poor classroom instruction in schools, the educational needs of, and within, each group are often very different. However, Indigenous Peoples in all colonize d territories, internationally and within Canada, share common experiences in relation to cultural loss. They also have a shared vision in restoring once flourishing Indigenous knowledge systems through the vehicle of school science education. According t o the literature, there are important cultural and linguistic considerations that can be used to guide the development of curriculum unit plans, lessons, activities, materials, and resources. All students regardless of cultural background have the potentia l to benefit from Indigenous knowledge ways shared by Indigenous Peoples who have interacted with the Canadian landscape for centuries. Indigenous knowledge systems are an inseparable part of the diverse cultural heritage of Canada that should be maintain ed and passed on for the benefit of all humanity. Although literature pertaining to instructional approaches is cited below, parallel articulations of Indigenous -based science education among Canada's diverse Aboriginal Peoples remains virtually non -existe nt and undocumented. School science curriculum research and development is needed from the foundation of Aboriginal communities. One of the major reasons why Aboriginal students struggle in school science is because curriculum content is imported and the p resentation of units and lessons are still predominantly Euro -western based. Indigenous knowledge is not respected or , i f i n c l u d e d a t a l l , i s u s u a l l y a t o k e n a s p e c t o f p r o g r a m s and courses. Many teachers are fearful of overstepping their boundaries. Cultur al content is usually an add-on with no real goal of reinforcing the holistic worldview of Indigenous Peoples . Worst, First Nations culture is taught in isolat ion from other subject areas. Culture camps are treated as separate events with no direct connect ion to science for example. Overall, there is no real and meaningful balance of perspectives in school science. Aboriginal students do not see the application of school science as being relevant to their situations, experiences, and community contexts. The y do not see the connection between their culture and science. They do not see the contemporary importance of their Indigenous knowledge as making a potential contribution to the survival of the entire human race. Yet, if we only look deeper within our com munities we have so many practical examples of traditional knowledge that personify an intimate understanding of the natural world. More often than not, school science occurs in stuffy classrooms completely detached from the land. The teacher stands in fr ont of the students as the expert or authority figure. Students are seated in rows, military style. Teaching and learning occurs from the top down. Students are seen as being devoid of bringing any prior knowledge and understanding of science especially fr om an Indigenous perspective. In many situations, they are often forced to memorize formulas, technical vocabulary and fragmented pieces of knowledge that they cannot place within the larger cultural life context. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 45 Getting through the curriculum and satisfy ing Western standards becomes a priority for teachers. This type of learning and instruction violates the wholeness of life leading to alienation and incomplete learning for many students. Today, mainstream schools and universities continue to present scie nce as if it wer e a to tally separat e e ntity fr o m arts , humani ties, and social scienc es, when really it is only a part o f the whole. The human and spiritual elements are missing from school science learning. Cultural advisor and scholar, Joseph Couture stat es, all ways are good if they are done in the right way . Whether one is Cree, Dene, Inuit, Mohawk, or any other Indigenous group, there are common threads and holistic life philosophy based on relationships with self/family/community/nation/ nature/ cosmo s, trust and respect, stories and legends, dance and song, ritual and ceremony (Couture, 2000, p. 163). It is these commonalities that need to be shared as a foundation for teaching school science. K a w a g l e y ( 1 9 9 0 ) w h o h a s d o n e r e s e a r c h o n t h e I n d i g e n o u s s c ience of Alaskan People s argues that Indigenous and non -Indigenous students use the same method and thinking processes to seek answers to the same questions. However, different value concepts, perspectives, and philosophy determine how they interpret the empirical data, and how they relate to the natural world (p. 14). MacIvor (1995) states Indigenous societies have rich and diverse approaches to educating and passing on knowledge of the natural world. Some common approaches include: experiential learning; sharing circles, storytelling; drawing, painting, singing, drumming, making models, Elder guidance; observation; apprenticeship; ritual & ceremony; dreaming & unsupervised participation; intergenerational teaching. Cajete (1986 ) found that Native American methods of teaching and learning include: experiential learning (learning by doing and seeing), storytelling (learning by acting listening, imagination, and coding), ritual/ceremony (learning through initiation, connecting to t he spirit), dreaming (learning through the unconscious and imagery), the tutor (learning through apprenticeship, informal and formal), and artistic creation (learning through creative synthesis). These methods of teaching and learning are not unique to Ind igenous science education. However, they definitely resonate with environmental related education and outdoor education. Garroutte (1999) examined various Indigenous -based science programs published in the Winds of Change Journal, within a ten -year period (1986 to 1996). The findings revealed that most writers did not pay attention to the radical differences between the central ontological and epistemological themes underpinning Western and Indigenous science. Most writers who shared assumptions of the basi c sameness of the two models offered the following strategies for incorporating Indigenous content into science curriculum: Introduction of Elders or special tutors; attention to learning styles; using classroom examples familiar to Indian children; tinker ing with practices and presentation of material; encouraging students to study harder; and concentration on environmental or technological issues relevant to reservation communities. However, these are not unique strategies that are only available to Indig e n o us s t u d e n t s . G a r r o u t t e s t a t e s , i t i s \" b u s i n e s s a s u s u a l i n t h e s c i e n c e c l a s s r o o m s o l o n g a s s e l e c t e d i t e m s from traditional teachings or practices are permitted to co -exist alongside accepted scientific dogma\" (p. 103). Indigenous science knowledge is b asically inserted into the existing Western scientific framework that has a criterion by which the world and everything in it is judged and evaluated. Garroutte argues it is possible to teach science keeping the two models of inquiry distinct without havin g t o c o e r c e o n e s e t o f k n o w l e d g e c l a i m s t o f i t t h e o t h e r . S t i l l , t h e r e a r e c o m m o n a l i t i e s t h a t e x i s t w h i c h c a n b e u s e d a s a starting base for teaching science that is relevant for all students regardless of cultural background. It is Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 46 important to teach stud ents the existence of different models of inquiry of which Western science is only one way of perceiving and explaining the world. G a r r o u t t e ( 1 9 9 9 ) p r o v i d e s a c l a s s i c e x a m p l e o f a s c i e n c e p r o g r a m w i t h A l a s k a n a t i v e s t u d e n t s t h a t k e e p the two models of inqu iry separate and equal: The 1993 class investigated rocks from the island [on which the Indian children live], conducted geochemical sampling for trace metal contamination, investigating radiation again, and built positive thinking skills through various e xercises. The class observed the splitting of walrus hide to be used in making a skin boat. The elders [who participated in the program] talked about reading ice conditions, weather, the ocean currents and the rules for hunting. (p. 107) Garroutte states that implementing Indigenous based approaches to science education is difficult and co mplex. It is difficult t o fin d the rig ht mix of tea chers, and to co me up wi th a con sensus in co m munities about what parts of traditional knowledge should be taught and h ow and who should teach them. She recommends that each tribe and community will have to come up with programs specific to their contexts and traditions. In order for transformation to occur in the way science is taught in these contexts, there is a need to redefine the definition of science to include Indigenous ways of knowing. This will require a multifaceted approach to research from within each community by focusing on diverse perspectives that include Elders, teachers, students, cultural support worke rs, hunters, trappers, women, and other traditional land users. Aikenhead (2006) suggests long term \"consensus making research and development\", a type of action research on a grand scale accompanied by implementation within a large educational jurisdictio n where the status quo of science education is discussed and renegotiated (p. 132). Rowland and Adkins (2003) made several recommendations to improve science education for Native Americans in the United States. These recommendations include: changes in cur riculum and teaching strategies such as the use of cooperative learning approaches; experiential learning; active hands -o n learning; integrating science with other subjects; making connections to the world of the learner; and paying special attention to te aching the language of Western science. Other recommendations include making connections to the student's Indigenous cultural knowledge of science by: focusing on Indigenous science contributions made by native people; viewing science broadly to include In digenous ways of knowing the world and their cultural basis; connecting with Indigenous native science by relating science education to topic and themes important to Indigenous Peoples ; exploring differences between Indigenous science and Western science; and centering Indigenous science education on the study of the environment and relating that study to Indigenous beliefs that connect them to the earth ( H i n e s 2 0 0 3 , p . 1 0 4 ) . T h e s e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s a r e c r i t i c a l t o s c i e n c e e d u c a t i o n a s t h e y m o v e a w a y f r o m focusing too much on the memorization of facts and figures towards relevance and connection to the student's socio -cultural life world. Michell (2007) undertook a narrative study with native and non -native teachers in northern Saskatchewan. The following is a summary of thematic patterns found within the narratives provided by teachers that can be used as examples of school science practice, and more importantly, as possible research sites and curriculum directions; Science Units that are guided by the mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical development of students within the context of their families, communities, and wider social world; Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 47 Science curriculum and lessons that revolve around Cree people and their traditional seasonal cycle; Science lessons and activities that connect students with the land and environment; Science lessons and activities that connect students with community Elders; Science curriculum that involves English, Scientific English, and Cree language; Science curriculum that involves tr aditional Cree values; Science lessons and activities that connect students to their everyday life; Science lessons and activities that connect students with community resource people both native and non -native; Science lessons and activities that connect students with role models of Cree heritage; Science curriculum that involves the history and evolution of Western science as well as the similarities and differences in relation to Cree worldview and knowledge systems; Science curriculum that involve field trips, cultural camps, and excursions to fish camps, trap lines, and other gathering places that will allow students to observe and engage with nature; and then share their knowledge using traditional and contemporary modes of communication; Science curri culum that involves classifications of plants, animals, and fish using multiple language concepts such as English, Linnaean Latin, and Cree; Science curriculum that is focused on the integration of science with other subjects such as environmental educatio n, outdoor education, biology, chemistry, english, native studies, Cree language, and computer science. Science lessons and activities that allow students to do research in their own communities; for example, by exploring Indigenous Knowledge within their Cree culture that has allowed people to live in a sustainable manner for centuries; Science lessons and activities that revolve around the impact of resource extraction activities in northern Cree communities such as mining, logging, and fishing; Science l essons and activities that revolve around learning Western science that extends one's understanding of Cree ways of knowing and the traditional tools and technologies used for survival. The above are broad suggestions and examples of practice. Community -based, participatory, and action research projects with adequate funding are needed to support teachers and university researchers in the development of localized curriculum and alternate performance assessment indicators in Cree contexts. However, Aikenhead (2006) reminds curriculum developers the idiosyncratic nature of materials produced through action research that inhibits transferability to other contexts. Teaching release time needs to be negotiated so science teachers are free to participate in short -term and long -term curriculum development projects. There is also a need to develop culturally sensitive Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 48 ways of storing, disseminating, and sharing Indigenous -based science curriculum and assessments so teachers can put more energy into implementation (P omeroy, 1994). A Summary of Common Themes in the Literature D e s p i t e t h e g r e a t c u l t u r a l d i v e r s i t y , t h e r e a r e c o m m o n t h e m e s t h a t e m e r g e a c r o s s t h e l i t e r a t u r e i n relation to curricular possibilities in Aboriginal contexts. The literature shows that current re search that examines effective urban practices for Aboriginal students is limited. Therefore, several of the studies e x a m i n e d i n t h i s r e v i e w a r e t a k e n f r o m r u r a l p r o j e c t s t h a t h a v e p r o v e d t o b e s u c c e s s f u l . S i m i l a r l y , several studies and practices reviewed have been taken from international contexts (Australia, New Zealand, United States). Primary themes that emerge in the literature suggest that effective school practices include the following: Holistic Knowledge and Spirituality Indigenous Knowledge of Local Populations Student Engagement Strong Community and Parent Relationships Effective Teacher Education and Pedagogy Some promising practices are mentioned through out this literature review. Appendix 4 contains a Promising Practices in Indigenous Scien ce Education list, which includes selected examples along with brief descriptions of the practices. Holistic Knowledge and Spirituality Several studies emphasize the need to resist the deficit model of Aboriginal education by designing educational practice s that are guided by spirituality, traditional values, and principles of balance and respect. Curriculum development involves the entire community and most especially the Elders (Riecken, Tanaka, & Scott, 2006, 29; Goulet, 2001). Doige (2003) highlights th e importance of spirituality in effective educational practices for Aboriginal students in the following way. \"A synthesis of what these educators have to say is condensed in three principles that need to influence curriculum and p e d a g o g y : ( a ) t o a c c e p t a n d thus validate Aboriginal epistemology as a basis for learning; (b) to create a relational, safe learning environment that values students; and (c) to promote authentic dialogue\" ( p. 149). A spiritual orientation to the natural world is a central concept of Indigenous science education. Indigenous Knowledge of Local Populations School curriculum, practices, and programs that value and incorporate local Indigenous knowledge have proven to be successful in increasing Aboriginal student success and academic achievement (Pattniak, 2004). Ignas (2004) explains, \"contemporary educational research is clear: improvements in educational outcomes are connected to valuing Indigenous and minority students' cultural context and their communities' local level knowledge\" (p. 49). The literature suggests curriculum that reflects both western and Indigenous knowledge is integral to the success of all Canadian students. Barnhardt and Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 49 K a w a g l e y ( 2 0 0 5 ) e x p l a i n , \" O u r c h a l l e n g e n o w i s t o d e v i s e a s y s t e m o f e d u c a t i o n f o r a l l p e o p l e that respects the epistemological and pedagogical foundations provided by Indigenous as well as Western cultural traditions\" (p. 10). Cross -cultural science embraces both traditions. However, \"Cross -cultural science projects have typically produced guide lines describing Indigenous knowledge, but they have not conducted research into how science teachers follow those guidelines to develop material subsequently used in their classrooms\" (Aikenhead, 2006b, p. 58). As such, this work still needs to be done. Best Practices in relation to Indigenous knowledge and local populations include: Forests for the Future social studies and science curriculum project (BC) Aboriginal Knowledge and Science Education Research Project (BC) Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative (AK) According to the literature, incorporating Indigenous knowledge systems in science curriculum has proven to be successful in increasing student success rates in several programs within Canada and the United States (Snively & Williams, 2006; Ignas, 2004; Barnhardt, 2005). Student Engagement through Technology and Mentoring W h i l e s o m e c h a n g e s m a y t a k e s e v e r a l y e a r s t o a c c o m p l i s h , t h e r e a r e p r a c t i c e s t h a t t e a c h e r s c a n u s e i n the classroom that promote Indigenous knowledge through student engagement. Hands -on-learning activities and practical skills such as engaging in mini -research projects are key. The use of digital cameras in Aboriginal student education emerged as one strategy in the literature (Snively & Williams, 2006; Riecken et al., 2006). Teachers u tilize this method in an effort to connect youth with Elders through small research projects that involve interviewing Elders and community members. Students provide visual images to complement their documentation and interpretations of local knowledge and history. Because of their direct relevance, these programs have proven to be successful in engaging youth in school science. School and university partnerships are also instrumental in enhancing the achievement levels of Aboriginal students. Traditional Pathways to Health is a research project developed through collaborative efforts between University of Victoria researchers, and Aboriginal teachers and students from two school districts. The project enables Aboriginal youth at three high schools in Victo ria to use digital video to highlight, \"their own positive activities, culture, and traditions as important dimensions of their liv es that help t o k eep the m well \" (Rie cken, e t al., 2 00 6, p. 35 ). The foll o wing are thr ee e xampl es of schools that have utilize d and found the project to be successful: Career and Personal Planning (CAPP) at Victoria High School (BC) has a course option for Aboriginal students with an emphasis on making connections with Elders and other Aboriginal role models ( p. 34). The Westshor e Center for Learning and Training (BC) has developed a separate First Nations graduation program with a strong cultural focus that engages adult and youth learners with Aboriginal artists, poets, dancers, and writers ( p. 34). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 50 In First Nations Leadership 1 1 a t E s q u i m a l t H i g h ( B C ) , t h e p h i l o s o p h y o f t h e c o u r s e i s t h e belief that First Nations values and beliefs are essential to the understanding of self and others as leaders ( p. 34). The student engagement theme includes mentoring, apprenticeship, and one -on-one teacher/student opportunities. Mentoring for example has been successfully employed in the areas of Aboriginal women's health (Banister & Begoray, 2006). Other models include, success coaches (Costas, 2006) and Pre-service teachers' working with stud ents (McCluskey, Baker & McCluskey, 2005). Strong Community and Parent Relationships The literature stresses the importance of building respectful and inclusive relationships with Aboriginal communities and parents (Cadwallader, 2004). Studies show that pa rental involvement is an important contributor to student success (Friedel, 1999, p. 140). Incorporating Aboriginal knowledge systems in school science requires on -going consultation with Elders, traditional lands users, and parents who possess diverse ski lls related to their heritage. Parental involvement in Aboriginal communities varies and in many situations, parents who went through the Residential School system may be reluctant to participate in school activities. Developing ways to involve parents in c r e a t i v e w a y s i s t h e k e y t o f o s t e r i n g a n i n t e r e s t i n s c i e n c e a m o n g y o u t h . O n e such promising practice is the Three Stars and a Wish writing project that was implemented in Winnipeg to engage Aboriginal parents and students who resisted becoming involved in t h e s c h o o l a s a r e s u l t o f negative experiences (Katz and McCluskey, 2003). Effective Teacher Education and Pedagogy Numerous studies (Ignas, 2004; Riecken et al., 2006; & Kanu, 2005) emphasize the importance of educating pre -service teachers and providing opportunities for on -going professional development in relation to incorporating Indigenous knowledge systems if schools are to address the needs of Aboriginal students and increase academic achievement levels. Rowland & Adkins (2003) reviewed the literat ure about science education for Native American students. They found two themes for fostering success and achievement ( pp. 104-109). The first theme is to increase and improve science instruction. This includes: Using Group or cooperative learning approac hes which have been found to be effective (Swisher & Deyhle, 1992; Gilliland, -on learning approaches to teaching (Gilliland, 1992a; ORBIS associates, no date). Integrating scienc e with other subjects and disciplines (Ovando, 1992; Gilliland, 1992b). The second theme includes infusing Indigenous knowledge systems in school science. This includes: Focusing on diverse Indigenous knowledge and skills related to survival in particular places that people occupied (Williamson, 1994; Cajete, 1994; Gilliland, 1992b; Ovando, 1992). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 51 Assisting students to Identify, delineate, highlight, and celebrate similarities and differences that exist between Indigenous and Western science (Simonelli, 19 94; Kawagley & Barnhardt, 2002, 2006a, 2006b). Collaboratively working with communities and traditional land users in relation to incorporating a land -based ethic into school science (Cajete, 1994 ; Gilliland, 1992b; Caduto & Bruchac, 1989). In addition to the above examples, the literature on cultural studies in science education provides further strategies and examples of effective teacher education in school science. Cross -cultural border theory is a new way of thinking about school science. According to this theory, students both native and non-native experience school science as a cross -cultural event. Aikenhead (2006) explains: \"Science teachers can help students negotiate difficult border cros sings, but this help is normally absent in science classrooms because teachers are unaware that cultural borders exists for their students (Contreras & Lee, 1990; McKinley et al., 2004; Phelan et al., 1991)\" ( p. 120). Furthermore, most science teachers are unaware of the cultural nature of the school science they teach (Aikenhead & Huntley, 1997; Aikenhead & 2005). According to cross -cultural border theory, the worldview of Aboriginal students and Western science are different. When worldviews come into contact with each other, students face a cross -cultural experience (Aikenhead, 2002, p. 289; Cajete, 1999; Maddock, 1981; Sutherland, 1998). Some educators advocate the co -existence and integration of the two knowledge sy stems in school science (Aikenhead, In Australia and Aotearoa/New Zealand, models of co-existence are often called two-way learning (Ritchie & B u t l e r , 1 9 9 0 ) , a n d i n t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s t h e y a r e c a l l e d bi-cultural instruction (Cajete, 1999; Kawagley, 1995, 2000). The term cultural broker has been used to describe the theory in which teachers facilitate student border crossings into and out of school science (Aikenhead, 1997; Mitchie, 2004; Stairs, 1993/94). Aikenhead (2006) in which culture brokers act: \"They acknowledg e that a border exists, they motivate students to cross it, they employ language of both the students' culture and the culture of Western science, they explicitly keep track of which culture comprises the context at the moment, and they help students resol ve cultural conflicts that may arise (Aikenhead, 1997; 2002)\" ( p. 121). Cultural brokers motivate students by developing authentic relationships, by understanding the specific history of the students' culture, and by maintaining high expectations (McKinley et al., 2004; Aikenhead, 2006, p. 121). The role of cultural brok er is very similar to multicultural pedagogy (Erickson, 2004; Hines, 2003). Rowland & Adkins (2003) refer to \"Ovando (1992) [who] pointed out that the multidisciplinary teaching of science concepts is especially compatible with the ways many Native America n cultures organize knowledge\" ( p. 105). One warning about effective teacher education and pedagogy concerns the specificity of culture. Effective teaching practices are not necessarily transferable. Aikenhead (2002) explains: \"There is a great diversity in cultures from community to community across the north. This means that teaching materials developed in one community are not necessarily transferable to another community. Teaching materials must fit into the meaningful cultural context of the local com munity; otherwise, many students will find the science curriculum inaccessible (Cajete, 1999; Stairs, 1994)\" ( p. 2 9 0 ) . I n o t h e r w o r d s , e f f e c t i v e Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 52 teaching and pedagogy of Indigenous science must reflect the diversity of both Indigenous People s a n d Indigenou s knowledge. Conclusion Aboriginal student success and retention rates remain lower than that of non -Aboriginal students throughout Canada (Gallagher -Hayashi, 2004). To create meaningful education for Aboriginal students much work needs to be done. Gallagh er-Hayashi explains, Clearly, we are not making a place for these students, a place where they feel welcomed, rather than like strangers. There is no one clear reason why these students are falling behind. Certainly the effects of the Residential School system, low socio -e c on o m i c f a c t o rs a n d s o c i e t a l r a c i s m h av e a l l p l a y e d a p a r t . J u s t a s t h e r e i s n o e a s y a n s w e r a s t o t h e c a u s e , t h e r e i s n o e a s y a n s w e r f o r a solution - but as educators it is incumbent upon us to search for that solution until it is found. (p. 20) Educational recommendations and needs identified by Aboriginal communities need to be incorporated within mainstream urban schools. This literature review identifies several examples of effective practices and recommendations. There are other exam ples in development, or thriving across Canada indicating a need for a broader collaboration of science educators and Aboriginal communities. Additional research is needed specifically for the purpose of obtaining Aboriginal Peoples perspectives in school science. There is a definite need to train pre -service and practicing teachers on how to successfully integrate Indigenous perspectives into their normal teaching practices. The examples provided offer educators a starting base from which they can modify their own practices as each community and school will be different. Finally, it would be beneficial to have a virtual forum where strategies science teachers use could be shared and evaluated over time to determine if they lead to a an increase in Aborigin al student success rates in science education. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 53 3. RESEARCH METHODO LOGY AND METHODS In this section, the research methodology and methods used to gather the data for this study are outlined. This includes a rationale for the methodology used, a descrip t i o n o f t h e r e s e a r c h s i t e , t h e participants involved, the snowball sampling method, interviews, convention for citations, ethical considerations, and the data analysis approach used for the findings. 3.1 Community -Based Action Research Approach This resear ch project is qualitative in nature. It is based on a community -based action research approach. The action research model draws upon a collaborative approach to investigation that seeks to engage participants, that is traditional land users and teachers, a s equal and full participants in the research process. The approach reinforces the application of practical knowledge to community -d e f i ne d issues and problems in a way that provides long -term improvement in the quality of life of a group of people (Fletche r, 2003). Action Research addresses pressing community issues because it is community - based, action -based, and focused on knowledge gathering (Stringer, 1999). The Action Research approach is appropriate in that the questions asked are not provided by some distant scholarly interests but arise among those who will benefit most from the research. Much research has been done in First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities where communities have asked, \"What is the benefit?\" This research is not based on further advanc ing an empiricist science paradigm but is directed toward the needs and interests of an established community of individuals, groups, institutions and governments who are interested in being involved in making science relevant to Aboriginal students and in forming others of the knowledge inherent in Indigenous ways of knowing. It is directed where it will have greatest relevance: in the schools, among teachers, in the curriculum, and in cooperation and collaboration with First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities f or the ultimate benefit of the learners, both Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal. It is grounded in the deeply felt concern of the community members to make science context and praxis a meaningful development of skills, knowledge, values, and applications in mu ltiple realities, not just for those belonging to one way of thinking. Action research provides an opportunity to view validity from another perspective. Community involvement and input is thus central to this project. In every school, classroom, and commu nity across Saskatchewan, stories, events and experiences have the potential to inform and create tools, strategies, curriculum content, partnering protocols and processes that would assist other teachers immensely. Both First Nations and M\u00e9tis Holistic Le arning Models (Appendix 1 and 2) emphasize the link between learning and community, and the value of each member's input. Knowledge already exists: we need only to have these publicly shared. 3.2 Methods Used The main methods used to collect data for this study include audio -interviews with individuals and groups as well as key documents and literature related to Indigenous science education. 3.3 Research Site The research site for this study was limited to the province of Saskatchewan. The project team concentrated on First Nations and M\u00e9tis schools and community contexts. Several trips were made into the communities throughout the research process for both consultation and actual interviewing. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 54 Sometimes the trips took several days due to geographical dista nce between the communities. Access to research sites included phone contacts and letters to School Divisions, local Chief and Councils, Local Community Councils, and principals of participating schools. In some situations, approval for access to the commu nities took longer than anticipated. Some organizations only meet at certain times of the year. We wanted to be respectful in terms of letting people know what we were doing within their communities. We found out very quickly researcher patience is critic a l i n t h e s e c o n t e x t s . I t i s t h e Place that ultimately determines the timing and pace of your study. Once permission was granted to access the research site(s) and ethics clearance was obtained from the University of Regina, we proceeded with the study. 3.4 Research Participants The research participants included First Nations and M\u00e9tis teachers, Elders and traditional land users. Geographical distance between communities, budgetary constrains, gravel roads, and all the unexpected perils related to travel in Saskatchewan highways especially the northern part of the province required the project team to try and get a diverse sample of participants. We did not have the privilege of doing a long -term in -depth study to fully flush out what it means to be teaching Indigenous -based science education from each community. To the project team, this study was about relationship building, the first step in the research process in these contexts. At times, we felt very awkward asking questions at the beginning of the inte rviews, as we did not go through the relationship - building phase. Still there was an element of relatedness with these participants that is hard to explain and which allowed them to share with us so openly. We wanted to keep on interviewing but the costs o f going back and forth to these communities can become quite energy draining. Follow -up conversations included in -person interviews, phone calls, and email exchanges. 3.5 Snowball Sampling Method The snowball sampling method was used to locate research par ticipants. According to Berg (2001), \"the basic strategy of snowballing involves first identifying several people with relevant characteristics and interviewing them. These subjects are then asked for the names of other people who possess the same attribut e s a s t h e y d o \" ( p . 3 3 ) . I t w a s c o m m o n f o r t h e p a r t i c i p a n t s i n t h i s s t u d y t o p r o v i d e t h e p r o j e c t team with names of other people who might be interested in participating in the study. 3.6 Interviews The principal source of data for the project was a set of semi -structured conversational interviews with both individuals and focus group participants. In conversational interviews, the researcher and participants are co -participants and co -constructors of knowledge in the research process (Kvale, 1996). In the e arly part of the research process, we constructed and piloted a set of interview questions based on the broad research questions guiding the study. We arrived at two sets of interview questions, one set for Elders and traditional land users and another set for teachers and pre -service teachers. At the end of the data collection phase, we ended up with several hundred pages of interview transcriptions. We found that even though we had an interview guide, there were times when the conversations went Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 55 off topi c to other school and community concerns other than school science. These talks provided a picture of the overall context of our research sites. Throughout the interviews, we concentrated on key questions with prompts during the interview process in order to solicit feedback and clarity of the responses in relation to emerging themes. Central to conversation interviews is the notion of reflexivity in reference to both spoken and written texts. According to Clandinin and Connelly (2000), the purpose of conv ersational interviews is to engage in reflective and probing conversations so that a clearer identification of the practical principles guiding teachers can be formulated. They state, \"Indeed, there is probing in conversation, in -depth probing, but it is d one in situation of mutual trust, listening, and caring for the experience described by the other\" (p. 109). Although the project team used a set of semi -structured focus questions, we were able to ask other questions that were not in the guide as a normal part of responding to the conversations. Copies of the transcriptions were sent to each participant for verification and accuracy of statements. We made sure that we provided opportunities for the Elders to respond back to the transcriptions to ensure acc uracy of statements made. O u r r o l e a s r e s e a r c h e r s w a s t o c a r e f u l l y o b s e r v e a n d c o n s c i o u s l y r e c o r d a s m a n y d e t a i l s a s p o s s i b l e i n relation to the perspectives, experiences and lives of the participants. According to Pelto and Pelto (1978, as quoted in Hampt on, 1993), \" when the researcher has observed and participated in the event and has command over a considerable portion of the relevant information he or she is in a position to vastly improve the data by systematic checking with key people\" (p. 272). 3.7 Convention for Citations Citations of transcripts in the text of the final report include the coded name of the participant, the sequence of the interview (whether it was interview 1 or 2), and the page number (e.g. KG, 2, 32). Citation of Field notes inc lude: the coded name of the participant, followed by the words 'Field Notes', and then the date of the recorded field note (e.g. VG, Field Notes, October 19, 2006). 3.8 Ethical Considerations This research study began with obtaining approval from the Unive r s i t y o f R e g i n a e t h i c s r e v i e w b o a r d . Each interview participant was required to sign a consent form prior to the actual interview. The researchers took time to go through the consent form with each participant to ensure they understood the study was all a bout and what their role would be. The project team also had a letter for each participant that outlines the parameters, expectations, and purposes of the research so that they were well informed. A condensed biography of the researchers was included in th e package as an aid for participants to understand who the researchers were and the purpose of the study. Every effort was taken to follow cultural protocols appropriate to Aboriginal c o n t e x t s . B y f o l l o w i n g t h e s e s t e p s , w e w e r e f o r t u n a t e t h a t n o n e o f t h e p articipants withdrew from the study after signing the consent forms. Although anonymity is not always guaranteed in research, interviews were audio -recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using strict confidentiality measures in order to protect the privacy an d anonymity of the interviewees. The option to use a pseudonym was given to all participants. The actual full names of Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 56 teachers, schools, and communities are not identified in the final text. In small communities where everyone knows each other, people nat urally want to find out who you are and what you are doing. In our conversations, we did not identify the names of the participants who we were interviewing only the kind of research that we were doing. 3.9 The Ethics of Conducting Research in Aboriginal Communities O u r p r o j e c t t e a m w a n t e d t o e n s u r e t h a t w e c o n d u c t e d o u r r e s e a r c h i n a w a y t h a t w a s r e s p e c t f u l t o t h e people and communities we approached. We took the initiative to educate ourselves by reviewing key documents in relation to the ethics of condu cting research in Aboriginal communities. A m o n g t h e s e k e y d o c u m e n t s i s t h e T r i -Council Policy Statement (TCPS), which includes the Canadian institutes of Health Research, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council, and the Natural Sciences and Engi neering Research Council. This policy pays particular attention to research involving Aboriginal Peoples. Another key document is The First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey (RHS) by the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) which includes a Code of Re search Ethics w i t h f o u r fundamental principles that include: ownership, control, access, and possession. These are collectively known as the 'OCAP' principles (Schnarch, 2004). A s i d e f r o m T C P S ' s b a s i c t e n e t o f r e s p e c t i n g h u m a n d i g n i t y , t h e p o l i c y a l s o r e c o gnizes that \"Aboriginal Peoples have a unique interest in ensuring accurate and informed research concerning their heritage, customs, and community\" (TCPS, 2005 , 6.2). Aboriginal Peoples have not always been treated with respect and sensitivity by research ers, and their Indigenous Heritage has been expropriated. According to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples Report (1996): In the past, research concerning Aboriginal peoples has usually been initiated outside the Aboriginal community and carried out by non -Aboriginal personnel. Aboriginal people have had almost no opportunity to correct misinformation or to challenge ethnocentric and racist interpretations. Consequently, the existing body of research, which normally provides a reference point for ne w research, must be open to reassessment (RCAP, 1996 , 5.E). There are countless examples over a long history of the misappropriation of Indigenous culture and knowledge systems. More recently, Indigenous scientific knowledge and other Indigenous intellect ual property has come under threat as they gain credibility among westerners. Brian Schnarch's article (2004) describes these issues in detail and thus serves as a useful starting point for understanding these issues. In accordance with these policies and concerns, our research project Learning Indigenous Science from Place seeks to treat Aboriginal communities with sensitivity and to respect the ownership of their knowledge and other Indigenous Heritage. It is equally important that, as teachers and other members of the educational profession seek to include Indigenous knowledge into a science curriculum, that special attention be accorded to the ownership and copyright of that knowledge (TCPS, 2005). The principles contained within these key documents appl y equally to teachers and schools developing curriculum, lesson plans or course materials that include Indigenous Knowledge Systems. Such individuals and institutions should consider themselves researchers for the purposes of collecting information and abi de by the ethical principles that accompany responsible research. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 57 Intellectual Property Rights and Indigenous Heritage The concern about what amounts to intellectual property rights has been expressed extensively in the literature (see especially Battiste, 1998; Battiste and Henderson, 2000; Tuhiwai Smith, 2002). In many Indigenous societies - including those in Saskatchewan - stories, traditional knowledge, and information have 'owners'. Getting the approval and permission of these individuals or groups wh en repeating, disseminating, copying, or teaching this information is necessary, as is acknowledging and citing those sources just as one would cite or reference a published source. It is important that teachers and others in the educational sector conside r and abide by these principles when integrating Indigenous knowledge into science curriculum. Researchers need to be mindful of the intellectual property rights of Indigenous Peoples w h e n conducting research in Aboriginal contexts. Copyright and ownership of Indigenous knowledge must be acknowledged and negotiated before any research is initiated. This includes research for the purposes of developing curriculum and resource materials used for teaching. Indigenous Heritage refers to the intellectual and cul tural property of Indigenous People s (Battiste and Henderson, 2000). It is also sometimes referred to as Indigenous Knowledge, cultural property, or intellectual property. The term Indigenous Heritage refers to all of these without falsely separating the physical from the spiritual, the tangible from the intangible, or the concrete from the abstract. It is also the term adopted by the United Nations in their Draft Principles and Guidelines on the Protection of the Heritage of Indigenous People (Battiste an d Henderson, 2000; Wiessner and Battiste, 2000). Indigenous Heritage m a y c o m e i n t h e f o r m o f s t o r i e s , a r t w o r k , d e s i g n s , s y m b o l s , t r a d i t i o n a l m e d i c i n a l practices, or knowledge about the land. The United Nations Principles and Guidelines on the Protection of the Heritage of Indigenous People defines it in more detail: The heritage of Indigenous peoples includes all moveable cultural property as defined by the relevant conventions of UNESCO; all kinds of literary and artistic creation such as music, dance, song, ceremonies, symbols and designs, narratives and poetry and all forms of documentation of and by Indigenous peoples; all kinds of scientific, agricultural, technical, medicinal, biodiversity - related and ecological knowledge, including innovations base d upon that knowledge, cultigens, remedies, medicines and the use of flora and fauna; human remains; immoveable cultural property such as sacred sites of cultural, natural and historical significance and burials (United Nations, 2000 , sec. 13). It is essen tial that, like any other copyrighted information, this knowledge be used only with consent of the appropriate community representatives or permission of the individual who owns it. In their Guidelines for Health Research Involving Aboriginal Peoples, The Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) explains: Protection of Indigenous knowledge refers to appropriate sharing of knowledge in a way that understands that some knowledge is sacred, that is, involving the Creator, Land, and the Ancestors. This must be interpreted in a manner appropriate to the particular context and community. For example, one community or region may prohibit the sharing of knowledge related to plants; it should not be assumed that the same prohibition will apply to all regions or research contexts (CIHR, 2005 , 3.6). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 58 The International Society of Ethnobiology's Code of Ethics provides a principle, the Principle of Acknowledgement and Due Credit , which emphasizes the importance of referencing sources, including those from Indigenous Peoples : This principle recognises that Indigenous peoples, traditional societies and local communities must be acknowledged in accordance with their preference and given due credit in all agreed publications and other forms of dissemination for their tangib le and intangible contributions to research activities. Co -authorship should be considered when appropriate. Acknowledgement and due credit to Indigenous peoples, traditional societies and local communities extend equally to secondary or downstream uses an d applications and researchers will act in good faith to ensure the connections to original sources of knowledge and resources are maintained in the public record (ISE, 2004 , sec. 16). One of the major ethical concerns in research is the use of sacred and spiritual knowledge ways of Indigenous Peoples : Although sacred knowledge is often held collectively by an Aboriginal community, sacred knowledge may, in some cases, be considered to be held by certain designated individuals and not necessarily the communi ty. For example, some Elders may be keepers of sacred knowledge. Another example of specialized authority occurs when a sacred society (rather than an individual Elder) or a clan is given the responsibility of keeping traditional knowledge. For example, th e Blackfoot rely on the \"sacred bundles\" as the source of authority on important spiritual and cultural matters and the band councils would never presume to interfere with the decisions of a society that is responsible for a sacred bundle and its knowledge . In such cases, a thorough review of values and beliefs will help to clarify for the researcher, the community, and the individual Elder the best way to proceed (CIHR, 2005 , sec 1.5.2). It is important that researchers follow and abide by the protocols an d customs, which vary from nation to nation, community to community. It is the responsibility of researchers to find out what the appropriate steps are in accessing, gathering, and using information held sacred by communities. Protocols are basically cons idered a right way of doing things . F o r e x a m p l e , i t i s a c o m m o n p r o t o c o l t o offer Tobacco to Elders for their knowledge. It reinforces the underlying ethic of reciprocity inherent in a worldview of interconnectedness. Researchers need to give back in a mut ual way. When research is conducted in a community, something is taken from these contexts - in the form of information, stories, and experiences. Michell (2008) explains this concept further: A s a C r e e p e r s o n , I u n d e r s t o o d t h e r e w e r e p r o p e r w a y s o f g a t h e r ing knowledge according to my cultural teachings. I understood that research often involves taking something from nature. When you take something from nature, balance is disrupted. And when balance is disrupted, t h e r e i s a n e e d f o r t h e r e s t o r a t i o n o f h a r m o n y . I u n d e r s t o o d f r o m m y C r e e w o r l d v i e w t h a t e v e r y aspect of creation is related and that certain protocols are used which respect this interconnectedness and balance ( p. 4). In order to correct this balance, the researcher must offer something back to the individual or community. This might include a gift of tobacco, assistance with chores or household duties, including help with expenses. Reciprocity in community -based resear ch always includes sharing of research outcomes with those involved in the study. It should also include the researcher maintaining good relations long -term with those involved in the study. The exact nature of reciprocity will depend on the cultural expec tations and norms of those whom one is conducting research with. In all situations, however, this constitutes a contribution to the individual or community and seeks to redress the Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 59 imbalance that research creates. It also acknowledges and respects the inte rconnectedness and interdependence that exists in the world (Michell, 2007 , p. 8). This concern and respect for Aboriginal communities and the knowledge that comes from these contexts is a principle that is used to guide responsible and ethical research. T he First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey (RHS) by the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) details these concerns in its Code of Research Ethics in four fundamental principles: ownership, control, access, and possession known collectively as 'OCAP' (Schnarch, 2004). These principles are described as follows: Ownership : The notion of ownership refers to the relationship of a First Nations community to its cultural knowledge/data/information. The principle states that a community or group owns informa tion collectively in the same way that an individual owns his or her personal information. It is distinct from stewardship or possession (see below). Control : T h e a s p i r a t i o n s a n d r i g h t s o f F i r s t N a t i o n s t o m a i n t a i n a n d r e g a i n c o n t r o l o f a l l a s p e c t s of thei r lives and institutions include research and information. The principle of \"control\" asserts that First Nations, their communities and representative bodies are within their rights in seeking to control research and information management processes which impact them. This includes all stages of research projects, and more broadly, research policy, resources, review processes, formulation of conceptual frameworks, data management, and so on. Access : F i r s t N a t i o n s p e o p l e m u s t h a v e a c c e s s t o i n f o r m a t i o n a n d d ata about themselves and their communities, regardless of where these are currently held. The principle also refers to the right of First Nations communities and organizations to manage and make decisions regarding access to their collective information. Possession : While \"ownership\" identifies the relationship between a people and their data in principle, the idea of \"possession\" or \"stewardship\" is more literal. Although not a condition of ownership, possession (of data) is a mechanism by which ownership can be asserted and protected. When data owned by one party are in the possession of another, there is a risk of breach or misuse. This is particularly important when trust is lacking between the owner and possessor. (AFN, 2007b) The four principles above provide a guideline for the ethical collection and use of Indigenous Knowledge Systems and any other form of cultural expression. Although created for First Nations contexts, these principles are applicable to all Aboriginal Peoples and communities, includ ing M\u00e9tis and Inuit People s (Schnarch, 2004 , p. 1). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 60 4. DATA ANALYSIS The data analysis approach the project team employed was based on the broad research questions posed. In the analysis, the project team focused on the overall research project goal whi c h w a s t o investigate how educators and education systems might take up Place -based Indigenous science and apply it within the established school science curriculum. More specifically, the analysis is based on answering five central questions: What is a Fi rst Nations perspective of learning Indigenous science from Place ? What is a M\u00e9tis perspective of learning Indigenous science from Place ? How can learning from Pl ace help create a foundation for a science curriculum that is contextualized to Place a nd t o t he people of the P l ace ? How can the perspectives inform teachers of processes and content needed in science curriculum? What supports are needed for educators to engage in Indigenous science? In order to answer the research questions, our project team used the Clue Structure approach to data analysis. The Clue structure method of analyzing the transcript data includes paying attention to and describing the knowledge that emerges from the transcripts as categories that have already been empirically or philos ophically established in the literature (Munby, Orpwood & Russel, 1980; Roberts & Russell, 1975). The Clue Structure approach was used to link the data with the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models that were previously developed by Aboriginal Peoples across C anada. According to Alasuutari (1995), qualitative analysis of interview transcriptions require \"paying attention to what is essential in the view of the theoretical framework and the particular questions asked, although even in the same study the material can be perceived from several angles\" (p. 13). The data were analyzed with a search for common patterns and themes as they resonated with the literature and distinct elements found in the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models for First Nations and M \u00e9 t is. T he analysis consisted of a triangulation of data that include the literature review, promising practices, responses from the participants, and the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models. 4.1 Holistic Lifelong Learning Models The Holistic Lifelong Learning Models w ere used as a guide in the analysis of the findings. The models were initially developed and articulated by First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit P eo pl e s across Canada. The group consisted of education professionals, community practitioners, researchers and analy s t s i n collaboration with the Aboriginal Learning Knowledge Centre and the Canadian Council of Learning. The models depict the \"link between lifelong learning and community well -being, and can be used as a framework for measuring success in lifelong learni ng for First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit peoples\" (CCL, 2007b). The symbols depicted in the models represent a broad framework of complex understandings related to how Aboriginal education is viewed in a holistic way. Each part of the three models represents an aspect Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 61 of learning, life, the community, the individual, and their interconnectedness. The First Nations and M\u00e9tis Models contain a majority of similar thematic concepts, although the physical construct of each Model reflects unique understandings of h ow learning is influenced. For example, thematic differences include learning about Health Care as one of the key concept of M\u00e9tis learning, while Clan and Ceremonies are identified as unique to First Nations learning. The First Nations model also includes an emphasis on the four dimensions of learning: spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical. These can be used to guide curriculum unit plans in school science. First Nations Holistic Lifelong Learning Model The First Nations Holistic Lifelong Learning Model, depicted by a living tree, represents the relationship between learning and community. The use of this image is meant to represent the importance that learning has in honouring and protecting the earth. It draws on the tenet that life is comprised o f relationships: everything is connected in a circular, holistic, and cumulative way; learners are part of these processes and cycles. According to this view, learning is lifelong and experiential. In accordance with this model, learning is a product of th e relationship with the land. This model depicts the multi - dimensional and multi -faceted approach to learning in First Nations communities.

RESEARCH FINDING S The following research findings are based on themati c categories that resonate with the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models for First Nations and M\u00e9tis using the Clue Structure approach to analysis. Additional information that falls outside the specific thematic areas, or gap information, is also included. 5.1 Learning Indigenous Science from Place: First Nations Perspectives SELF We are all connected and we have to live in harmony with each other (VW, 1. 1). Self as an extension of the Natural World Cultivating a Holistic Worldview Different Worldviews and In terpretations of the Natural World Interrelatedness, Interconnectedness, Interdependence Focusing on Roles & Responsibilities in Creation Relationships within the Natural World A common thread that weaved through the interviews was an understanding that the self is an extension of the land. Participants felt it was important for students to understand the spiritual orientation First Nations People h a v e i n r e l a t i o n t o t h e w o r l d a r ound them. According to the participants, although First Nations People are diverse they have a shared worldview in which they see themselves as being interdependent with the rest of creation (TC, 1. 1; KG, 1.1; VW, 1.1). Cultivating a sense of interconnec tedness with the environment begins with learning and understanding that the self is an extension of all other entities that depend on one another for survival. All humans are part of the l a n d a n d t h e l a n d i s a p a r t o f u s b e c a u s e t h e C r e a t o r ' s s p i r i t f l o w s through all things. One participant expressed the concept of worldview in the following way, I n m a n y F i r s t N a t i o n s w o r l d v i e w s , w e l o o k a t c r e a t i o n a s b e i n g a s a c r e d e v e n t .

Because that s p i r i t o r e n e r g y i s t r a n s f e r a b l e , w e c a n g e t e n e r g y f r o m e a c h o t h e r .

However, we also have a reciprocal responsi bility. Our responsibility is to make sure that the tree will be able to continue to be able to live in the environment, which needs to be able to do those things and do them properly. We thank the tree for giving us food and shelter. (KG, 1. 2) The partic ipant continued to explain that everything in creation has a role and responsibility to play. It is by understanding these roles and responsibilities that we come to understand who we are and our Place in the universe. First Nations classification systems a r e e x p r e s s e d i n d i f f e r e n t w a y s b a s e d o n t h i s philosophical understanding. The participant explains this concept in the following way, Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 63 I f t h e r e i s a h i e r a r c h y w e [ h u m a n s ] a r e a t t h e b o t t o m o f t h a t l i s t . A l l t h e r e s t o f c r e a t i o n is doing what the Creator wants it do. We are the only ones because we have ability to think and reason that also gives us the ability to scheme and to rationalize and to lie to o u r s e l v e s a n d t o b e l i e v e t h a t w e n e e d a l l o f t h e s e o t h e r t h i n g s f o r u s t o r e m a i n i n balance. We have to d o t h a t b e c a u s e w e a r e p a r t o f t h a t c r e a t i o n a n d w e h a v e t o b e able to d o our par t t o ma k e sure that all of Cr eati on has the res ourc es availabl e t o do it s basic function the way the Creator meant it to do. (KG, 1. 2) First Nations worldviews reinforce a se nse of kinship and relationship through the way other entities in Creation are personified as human relatives. Animals for example are treated as if they were a person's close st relati ve tha t g ives u p its life so w e humans can live. Respe ct for this relati onship is demonstrated by the use of protocols as shared in the following quote, W e l o o k a t t h e w i n d f o r i n s t a n c e a s a n e n t i t y o n t o i t s e l f , w e l o o k a t t h e c l o u d s , w e l o o k a t t h e s p i r i t s , w e l o o k a t t h e a n i m a l s a s o u r r e l a t i v e s . W h e n w e h u n t a n i m a l s , w e h a v e a s w e a t o r e n g a g e i n p r a y e r . I n o u r b e l i e f s y s t e m , t h e a n i m a l a l r e a d y k n o w s t h a t t h e y w i l l be g iving up th eir li ves for our sur vival. We are the spirit, wh en w e kill the animal we ar e p a r t o f t h a t s p i r i t . T h e s p i r i t r e m a i n s w i t h u s . W e l i v e i n a w o r l d o f spirits that affect a great deal with what we do and what we think whether we like it or not. (KG, 1. 5) The participants made it clear there are different worldviews that lead to different perspectives of the natural world. Science teachers and students n e e d t o e n g a g e i n c r i t i c a l d i a l o g u e i n o r d e r t o m a k e worldview distinctions that underpin different knowledge systems. One participant expressed this sentiment in the following way, I t h i n k i t i s r e a l l y i m p o r t a n t t h a t w e a l l r e c o g n i z e w h e r e w e a r e c o m i n g f rom in terms of our understanding. There are many inexperienced people that talk about or hear about Indian practices and beliefs. We all socialize and we have different experiences and we see different things, but there are times when we come up against i nformation for which we do not have the knowledge or experiential base and it means that we can't p r o c e s s t h e i n f o r m a t i o n t h a t w e g e t o r w e p r o c e s s a n d i t c o m e s f r o m a d i f f e r e n t perspective and it's the wrong perspective. (KG, 1. 3) The participants recogn ize the challenges science teachers face in relation to incorporating First Nations w o r l d v i e w s a n d p e r s p e c t i v e s . T h e f i r s t s t e p t e a c h e r s c a n t a k e i s t o m o d e l a n o p e n m i n d i n r e l a t i o n t o honouring different knowledge perspectives in their science classrooms . O ne p a r t i c i p a n t s po ke a bo ut this in the following way, If you don't understand why Indians do a particular thing, I would ask teachers not to reject it as either impossible but rather to pursue it and simply say, 'I don't understand that', 'I don't under s t a n d w h y ' , a n d s o ' L e t ' s t a l k a b o u t i t , l e t ' s d i s c u s s i t , g i v e m e s o m e examples, or whatever', and I am sure at some point you would improve your understanding. But don't make judgments. (KG, 1.3) Connecting and developing relationships with First Nation s Elders and other members of the community is one common way that teachers and students can learn about First Nations knowledge systems in a life long way. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 64 ELDER INVOLVEMENT There are many Elders some are gifted in education, while others can speak to anything and tell you in a traditional and cultural way. Some are gifted in different ceremonies. So you have to judge which area the Elder is knowledgeable in. You have to speak to them individually in order to find out where they are at and what they can help and talk about. We were totally immersed and surrounded in a scientific way with all we know in a traditional way but you have to really think about it because we may not know it is scientific yet, but it has already happened, said, and done. (VG, 1 .4) Elder involvement in curriculum development Organizing a Pool of Elders Diversity of Elder Knowledge & Skills Respecting Female & Male Elder Perspectives in Balance Working with Elder Helpers Using Protocols when Accessing Elders Building Relationship s with Elders Identifying Themes for Elders to Consider A common theme expressed by participants was the importance of Elder involvement in school science. In traditional times, Elders played a central role in passing on First Nations knowledge systems and perspectives. Elders can fulfill this responsibility by taking part in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of science curriculum that incorporates First Nations perspectives. One participant said, \"I think [the Elders] should go hand and hand with the teachers. I think there should be Elders that go to these schools and talk not only to the students but also to the teachers. They should have Elders talking to them because they don't know us and our people\" (IP, 1. 1). The participants alluded to the importance of science teachers modeling and fostering a sense of respect for Elders and their knowledge perspectives among youth. T h e p r o t o c o l w a s t o a l w a y s m a i n t a i n r e s p e c t f o r E l d e r s . T h a t w a s h o w w e w e r e b r o u g h t up as children. Respect t h e E l d e r s . L i s t e n t o w h a t t h e y h a v e t o s a y . L i s t e n a n d d o n ' t laugh at him. Don't make fun of them. Having respect for your Elders was the number one teaching. Today, we don't have that. Somewhere along the way, it disappeared. We now have young people laug h i n g a t o l d p e o p l e . N o r e s p e c t w h a t s o e v e r . W e l o s t t h a t . (TC, 1. 10) Elders in First N a tions c om munities are hig hly r espec t ed for th e r ole the y pla y in passing on Firs t N a tions culture, languages, values, ceremonies, songs, dances, and knowledge systems. W hen one of these Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 65 Elders passes on, life long wisdom and knowledge goes with them. One participant pointed out the urgency of connecting with First Nations Elders in the following way. W h e n a n E l d e r p a s s e s o n , i t i s l i k e a l i b r a r y c l o s i n g b e c a u s e t h e k n o w ledge that person has goes along with them. That is why young people like you pump these old people for information, get as much information from them as you can so you can lose it later. T h e r e i s n o t h i n g s a y i n g t h a t y o u c a n n o t u s e t h a t k n o w l e d g e . I t i s g i ven to you to use. There ar e so m e Elders that I know who do n ot l oo k at it that w ay. Th ey think thei r song s and everything else is theirs. They don't share, but that's not the way to be because you have to share your information. (IP, 1. 2) There are First Nations ways of knowing that are private and cannot be openly shared with others. However, one strategy is to identify and organize a pool of First Nations Elders and other knowledge keepers who possess a diversity of knowledge and skill sets. This resou r c e l i s t c a n t h e n b e u s e d t o l e a r n school science concepts from different perspectives. I am sa ying that ther e sh ou ld be a po ol of Elders. Gath er na mes of Elder s and ha v e the m a v a i l a b l e f o r t h e s c h o o l s . S o m e t i m e s y o u w i l l g e t a n E l d e r t h a t g i v e s a l l h i s / h er time, they will stay around that school to help out. It is important to let teachers and students k n o w h o w w e l i v e a n d a l l o f t h i n g s w e d o . A l o t o f o u r y o u n g p e o p l e l i v e i n t h e c i t y , a r e born in the city, and raised in the city and they don't know anyt hing about the way we live. (IP, 1. 1) I n t h e p a s t s e v e r a l d e c a d e s , m a n y F i r s t N a t i o n s People have migrated from their reserve communities into rural and urban settings in search of better life circumstances. With these geographical moves, they leave behin d their connection to the land, their cultural support systems and most notably the Elders. First Nations youth that live in cities require these connections for cultural continuity. Elders and other community members are gifted in unique and blended ways , based on the places from which they originate. First Nations knowledge systems are rooted in multiple domains. One participant spoke about the diversity of knowledge systems that many Elders possess. Elders have their own specialties. Some are historians i n t h e i r o w n r i g h t . S o m e h a v e a particular understanding of the language, and teachings that underpin place names. Some people are pipe carriers. Some people are medicine men and healers. Many have an understanding of the history of their particular group , where they come from, why they are where they are. There are some who are good at finding medicines, what they are used for, how to assess people with what kind of medicine they need. And there are o t h e r s p e c i a l t i e s a s w e l l . T h e s e h a v e t o d o w i t h f o o d g a thering, trapping, and hunting. All of these are particular applications of knowledge depending on where their groups are situated. These are all survival techniques that have been defined to varying extents by different groups. (KG, 1.1) Although teachers may have predetermined objectives to meet in relation to incorporating Western science concepts, the same cannot be said for incorporating First Nations perspectives. Each community and Place will determine what knowledge is appropriate for school scienc e content. Elders also need to be involved in their own way and so consultation and relationship building is important. Sometimes Elders may suggest activities and the context in which the learning will take place. When the question was asked about Elder i nvolvement, one participant had this to say, Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 66 They should, but in their own way. Very often Elders are called in to do disciplinary kind o f t h i n g s a n d t h a t ' s n o t r e a l l y w h a t t h e y r e a l l y w a n t t o d o . W h a t t h e y r e a l l y w a n t t h e children and grandchildren to be is to do things like learn their language and their relationships within that community, who they're related to and the kind of respect that they should show each other and their history. Those are the kind of things that Elders seem most interested in te aching young children. (KG, 1.1) One participant talked about the importance of incorporating both male and female perspectives in school science. First Nations women have their own knowledge ways that must be honoured and respected alongside Western scien ce perspectives. The participant highlighted the importance of including gender balance in school science perspectives in the following way, I think they should be approaching Elders both the females and males because the w o m e n t o o h a v e a l o t o f k n o w l e d g e. They've obtained a lot of knowledge from their mothers and grandmothers. They were taught properly. The women were very much involved in the development of children, their families, communities, and their entire tribe. They would often gather together t o d e c i d e w h a t w a s b e s t f o r t h e i r t r i b e . ( T C , 1.10) One participant suggested the inclusion of Elder Helpers i n s c h o o l s c i e n c e b e c a u s e t h e y w o r k v e r y closely with Elders and are themselves unique in their knowledge ways. \"They are our future Elders. That's t h a t w a y w e l o o k a t i t . S o m e p e o p l e s a y , ' h o w d o y o u b e c o m e a n E l d e r ? ' T h a t ' s t h e w a y y o u g e t to be an Elder and learn the ways of Elders by working with them. Then you get the knowledge from there and that knowledge can be given to anybody\" (IP, 1. 2). Science teachers and students must be aware there are proper protocols when approaching Elders for their knowledge. Protocols are expressed in different ways depending on the culture. However, a common theme that runs through First Nations cultures is the u nderstanding that there are proper protocols involved when interacting with any aspect of the natural world. Many of the participants t a l k e d a b o u t o f f e r i n g E l d e r s a p o u c h o f T o b a c c o a n d a s m a l l g i f t . T h e a c t o f o f f e r i n g T o b a c c o r e i n f o r c e s the ethic of reci procity in First Nations contexts. While there are many of ways of demonstrating t he idea of giving back for something that is taken, one participant said, \"Tobacco is the number one protocol\" (WL, 1. 2). Elders were quick to point out their knowledge pers p e c t i v e s a r e n o t f o r s a l e a n d m a k i n g m o n e y f r o m their cultural teachings is strictly taboo. However, they live in a contemporary society in which their expenses must never be overlooked. For example if they drive from their home communities or camps to par ticipate in school activities, they need coverage for their gas expenses. Elders need to be compensated well and appreciated for the knowledge they are sharing with others and \"that way the E l d e r d o e s n o t f e e l t h e y a r e b e i n g t a k e n f o r g r a n t e d \" ( W L , 1 . 2 ) . One participant said sometimes Elders h a v e t o t r a v e l f r o m t h e i r r e s e r v e s a n d s o t h e y n e e d m o n e y f o r g a s a s w e l l a s t h e i r m e a l s a n d s o m e t i m e s accommodation. Many Elders have to look after their families and grandchildren with very limited resources and some times with no supplemental income. When we take them away from their families, we take them away from feeding their families. One Elder in the study had this to say, \"Why give me a blanket? I can't eat that\" (VW, 1. 11). One participant talked about right ways o f w o r k i n g w i t h E l d e r s . H e s a i d , \" T h e r e a r e r i g h t w a y s o f t a l k i n g to anybody including Elders\". Teachers and students who are planning to approach Elders need to do so Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 67 with great respect using \"words and perspectives that give the impression that the Elders are being respected\" (WL, 1. 2). The participants pointed out the importance of being genuine and establishing a relationship with Elders as the first step. Learning First Nations knowledge perspectives has a heavy emphasis on process. The answers m a y n o t a l w a y s c o m e a l l a t o n c e . O n e p a r t i c i p a n t s t r e s s e d t h e i m p o r t a n c e o f v i s i t i n g E l d e r s s e v e r a l t i m e s b e f o r e a s k i n g t h e m a b o u t t r a d i t i o n a l k n o w l e d g e ( V G , 1 , 5 ) . She said, I t d o e s n o t t a k e o n e v i s i t w i t h i n s t a n t a n s w e r s . Y o u h a v e t o g i v e E l d e r s a n i d e a of what y o u w a n t f r o m t h e m . F o r e x a m p l e , y o u h e l p e d m e p r e p a r e f o r t h i s i n t e r v i e w b y g i v i n g me the topic and questions ahead of time. I gave them a lot of thought and prayed about the questions because I was going to speak about traditional ways. And some of t h e s e w a y s a r e v e r y s a c r e d a n d i n o r d e r t o r e s p e c t t h a t , I p r a y e d a n d u n d e r s t o o d t h a t i t would be okay because it is going to help children. (VG, 1. 5) Sometimes when an Elder is interviewed they expect the Elders to give them the answers right then an d t h e r e . I t s h o u l d n o t b e t h i s w a y . I t t a k e s a b o u t f o u r v i s i t s . O f f e r Tobacco, get to know each other and maybe the second visit tell them what you want a n d h o w i t w i l l b e u s e d f o r s c h o o l . T h e y w i l l a l s o f i n d o u t w h e t h e r t h a t i s t h e E l d e r w h o can speak in your classroom. Maybe the third visit will be the interview. Sometimes E l d e r s k n o w l e d g e d o e s n o t c o m e r i g h t a w a y ... a n d s o y o u h a v e t o g i v e t h e m t h e t i m e , room, and space to think. Also, the more they see you, there will be a trust relationship and an underst anding that you are a nice person and easy to talk to. And always rem emb er ne ver t o hurry up an Elde r. Make sure you t ake the ti me t o g e t to kn o w th e m and build trust then they will speak openly to you. So that is the way to approach an Elder. (VG, 1. 5) One of the ways to approach Elders for their perspectives in school science is to identify themes that are closely aligned with the curriculum units and objectives. This may require approaching several Elders or other knowledge keepers in the community. On e participant had this to say, I think a science teacher has to interview Elders on different themes. Once these themes are identified, then offer the Elder Tobacco and ask them what they think about what you are going to teach. That would help the teacher realize which Elder understands. They will tell you whether they know something or not. Then the teacher can always go to another Elder. In the process of doing that, the science teacher should bring with them Tobacco and a little gift thanking them for trying to help. And seek out another Elder that is knowledgeable and understanding. (VG, 1. 4) Elder teachings bring a spiritual orientation to the natural world, a dimension that is missing from most Western science perspectives that depend on notions of objectivity, disconnectedness, and emotional distance. Being alienated from others and the natu ral world is something that is unheard of in many First Nation cultures, as all must live in harmony for the health and wellbeing of future generations. SPIRITUAL I think if it's taught both ways to the children, they will be able to understand our traditional way plus the mainstream way of science. And I think it will hold their interest. You really have to think about and understand traditional ways Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 68 and your cul ture. It sort of keeps you safe because you know it is coming from a sacred perspective. When I was young my grandparents used to talk about these things and how we should rely on that. (KG, 1. 2) Spirituality as a Way of Life Spirituality and Ceremonie s as a Source of Knowledge Consulting with Ceremonial keepers Seasonal Ceremonies Honouring Renewal of Earth Clearing & Preparing the Mind through Ceremony Honouring Private Knowledge Honouring Women's Protocols Spirituality is a way of life for First Nati ons People and as such is an inseparable part of school science. It is important that teachers and students explore the difference between spirituality and religion, as these are two different concepts that often cause a lot of confusion. Quite often when teachers hear about Aboriginal content, they automatically assume spiritual ceremonies. Spirituality as a way of life is more than engaging in healing practices, it is about learning a total philosophy of life long health and well being. Nevertheless, in o rder to incorporate spirituality in school science, teachers need to consult with Elders that are gifted with traditional ceremonial knowledge. One participant spoke about First Nations spirituality as being inseparable from languages. He said, \"If you are t h e s p i r i t u a l t y p e , i t i s i m p o r t a n t t o k n o w t h e l a n g u a g e \" . F r o m h i s p e r s p e c t i v e , p e o p l e h a v e drifted away from spirituality and many Elders with this knowledge are passing on without being able to share what they know using their own languages. He said \"w hat is wrong with spirituality in our lives? Y o u h a v e a s p i r i t a n d I h a v e a s p i r i t , w h a t i s w r o n g w i t h t h a t ? A r e w e a f r a i d ? O t h e r w i s e i t w o n ' t b e complete without that spiritual aspect\" (WL, 1. 3). He went on to talk about the loss of spirituality in many F i r s t N a t i o n c o m m u n i t i e s i n t h e f o l l o w i n g w a y \" ... w e a r e l u c k y t o h a v e s o m e c e r e m o n i a l p e o p l e and I could call them Elders because they know lots regarding the spiritual world and ceremonies. Not every community does, some have been converted to European rel igions. I said some, not all\" (WL, 1. 4) All of the participants spoke passionately about First Nations spirituality and ceremonies as a way of life and most importantly as fundamental sources of knowledge. In many First Nations belief systems, the physica l world and the spirit world are not separate as they are in Western science. One participant said, \"We say that ceremonies belong to the people, which means that when the people come with that energy, which is the spirit that I talked about earlier, we br i n g t h a t t o a c e r e m o n y , a n d i t r e -energizes t h a t c e r e m o n y , s o i t c a n b e d o n e a n o t h e r t i m e \" ( K G , 1 . 3 ) . H e w e n t o n t o e x p l a i n , \" W h e n w e a r e t a l k i n g about ways of knowing, we say that we are not only getting messages from natural things, but we also say that the people who have gone into the spirit world are able to help us, guide us, and give us w i s d o m i f w e b e s e e c h t h e m i n t h e p r o p e r w a y \" ( K G , 1 . 4 ) . W i t h t h i s t e a c h i n g i n m i n d , i t r a i s e s t h e question of whether or not traditional knowledge is ever lost or w h e t h e r o r n o t i t r e m a i n s t o b e rediscovered through the use of proper protocols and ceremonies. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 69 Teaching and incorporating First Nations perspectives in school science requires mental as well as spiritual preparation. One participant talked about prepari ng to teach and how he does this through spirituality and prayer. He shared this way of preparing to teach in the following way, Before I teach, I pray. I pray that I will be given the right words, thought patterns, so that people will understand and that I will not offend anyone and that I will be able to transfer knowledge in a way that is efficient and meaningful. I put my life in the hands of so me one el se, a hig h p owe r. I have a g reat d eal of fait h in that. And if y ou ask wh at I a m doing next Tuesday, I d o n ' t k n o w . I d o n ' t k n o w w h e r e I w i l l g o . I f o l l o w m y p i p e . Spirituality is the essence of our connectedness. We get energy from other places, the spirit places, other people, and we recognize that there are things that affect our lives that we have very little control. (KG, 1. 5) Another participant talked about the importance of clearing the mind through prayer, smudging, and engaging in ceremony as a way to prepare to receive traditional knowledge. She said that \"each part of our body is sacred and tha t there are ceremonies that we do for the mind to help students understand. Y o u h a v e t o k e e p i n m i n d t h a t w e d o o u r p r a y e r s a n d c e r e m o n i e s t o g o a l o n g w i t h w h a t e v e r w e a r e doing and learning. Sometimes when we lack that we get lost and don't have guidance \" ( V G , 1 . 5 ) . S h e shared her own learning experiences in the following way: I totally respect the way my grandmother passed on her wisdom and knowledge with me. I used to sit with her on the floor and she would smudge me all over, pray, and smudge herse lf. She used to say, 'the reason I did that my grandchild is when we pray together, you need to get all of the negative thoughts out of your mind, maybe you got u p i n a g r o u c h y m o o d , o r a r e a n g r y , o r y o u s a i d s o m e t h i n g t o s o m e o n e i n a f o u l m o o d that you we re in. Or maybe you are thinking of something bad, or did something last night. So we smudge, pray, and ask our grandfathers to forgive you for all those negative things you've done, said, or thought about'. She said that way my mind was c l e a r a n d I w a s a b le to absorb more of her teachings that stayed with me in my mind and my heart. That is the way we prepared to learn our traditional way or method. (VG, 1. 3) She continued sharing her grandmother's words of wisdom \"...my grandmother used to say you cannot le a r n b y t h i n k i n g n e g a t i v e t h i n g s , o r c a r r y n e g a t i v i t y i n y o u r h e a r t . L e a r n i n g d o e s n o t w o r k t h a t w a y . You have to be very positive mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. That way you go to school happy. That was her way of helping me learn our tradition al way of life and language\" (VG, 1. 3). One participant talked about the importance of focusing on seasonal ceremonies and teaching students a b o u t r e n e w a l i n t h e n a t u r a l w o r l d . F o r e x a m p l e , i n t h e s p r i n g , m a n y F i r s t N a t i o n s People engage in ceremonies rel ated to growth and renewal of the earth. She said focusing on the growth of plants is s i m i l a r t o f o c u s i n g o n b e a n s t h a t c h i l d r e n g r o w i n s i d e t h e c l a s s r o o m . H o w e v e r , s h e s a i d , f r om o ur traditional [Dakota] perspective, we look at it differently [with emphas is]. F o r e x a m p l e , i n t h e s p r i n g - time, prayers and ceremonies are performed that acknowledge new growth and renewal of Mother Earth. In addition, people put up a feast and \"we pray for the continued health and growth of spring plants. To me that is traditi onal science and we assist in the growth of the plants, herbs, whatever, it's the new growth of things in the spring -time\" (VG, 1. 1). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 70 All of the participants spoke about different types of First Nations knowledge some of which are private and cannot be s hared. One participant spoke about private knowledge in the following way, There is more in -depth knowledge than what I am sharing with you here. I cannot speak about it, because it is too sacred. I have learned, heard, and seen them, but they are mine to k e e p , s o I d o n o t s p e a k a b o u t t h a t . Y o u h a v e t o l e a r n t o r e s p e c t t h a t \" a n d \" t h e other thing is that we get our knowledge by not writing it down, but by hearing and l i s t e n i n g . A l w a y s a s k t h e E l d e r i f y o u c a n w r i t e i t d o w n o r i f y o u w a n t t o u s e t h e knowledg e in a certain way...be prepared as some Elders will so no. (VG, 1. 7) One participant brought up the importance of learning to respect women's protocols around ceremonies and the use of ceremonial tools during moon time . According to one belief, the proper protocol during one's monthly menstrual cycle is to stay away from ceremonial and hunting tools and not step over them. Women go through a natural cleansing cycle in their bodies and are deemed to c a r r y a l o t o f e n e r g i e s d u r i n g t h i s t i m e . W h i l e t h e r e a r e m any teachings surrounding this topic depending on cultural traditions, one participant explained it as a sign of respect in the quote below, That's how much respect they had for the various things that they used for their survival, spiritual lodges, prayer s, songs, drums, their rattles and everything else they used. They looked after them really good. They never left anything on the ground. They h u n g u p e v e r y t h i n g o n t h e w a l l o r t i e d t h e m t o a t r e e s o t h a t n o o n e w o u l d s t e p o v e r them. Even hunting tools lik e guns, bow and arrows that the hunter used for hunting. (TC, 1. 3 -4) It was clear from the responses of the participants that teachers must strive to connect school science to the multiple knowledge domains inherent in the traditional life style of First Nations People as a way to make learning more relevant and meaningful for all learners. CULTURE AND TRADITIONS Traditional Cultural Life Style (Trapping, Hunting, Fishing, Gathering) First Nations Knowledge Systems have Validity Mid Wives and their Medicinal Knowledge Ways Preservation of First Nations Knowledge Systems Intellectual Property Rights Ways of Using First Nations Knowledge Importance of using Traditional Protocols Student -led research projects on First Nations Knowledge Storytelling as a way of passing on First Nations Knowledge Hunting Stories Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 71 Incorporating Humo ur in the Science Classroom Incorporating Feasts in the Science Classroom Oral Speaking Skills Sharing Cultural Experiences Traditional Cultural Lifestyle of First Nations People One of the common strategies identified by the participants is to develop sch ool science curriculum that revolves around the traditional cultural lifestyle of First Nations People . I t is imp ortant t o c onnec t sch o ol science with a bit of history and the sustainable ways First Nations People used to survive. First Nations People used different types of technologies that revolved around traditional seasonal cycles usually in rhythm with animal and plant cycles of a certain place. Out of these cycles of existence, they developed a worldview in which they saw themselves as intricate par t of nature. One participant introduced himself as a person of Saulteaux heritage whose people migrated West during the fur trade era. He said, they were originally a tribe of Ojibway People who broke away in order to escape the increasing encroachment of European settlers. They wanted \"to be free as possible so they could continue their lifestyle of hunting, fishing, trapping, and gathering berries. That was their lifestyle. That is how they made a living and they were very close to nature\" (TC, 1. 1). First Nations Knowledge Systems Have Validity One participant talked about First Nations Knowledge systems as having their own content validity based on long -term survival in particular places they occupy. He recommends that science teachers embrace and fos ter a sense of open mindedness in relation to incorporating different perspectives in school science. He said, Teachers and students need to understand and unlearn that Western Science is the only w a y t o l o o k a t t h e e n v i r o n m e n t . F r o m a F i r s t N a t i o n s p o i n t o f v i e w , t h e w a y w e l o o k a t the environment around us is very different we know that. And I think we are not asking Western science teachers to embrace our belief system, but at least to acknowledge that there are other ways of knowing, other than what the y a r e u s e d t o . F i r s t N a t i o n s knowledge ways are a product of a valid human experience in a relatively similar e n v i r o n m e n t t h a t h a s b e e n d e v e l o p e d o v e r a l o n g p e r i o d o f t i m e a n d f o r t h i s r e a s o n , i t i s v a l i d i n i t s o w n r i g h t . V a l i d i t y h a s t o d o w i t h t h e f a c t that First Nations People are still here today. We have survived using our own knowledge systems. (KG, 1. 2) The idea is to foster a respect for different knowledge perspectives in school science and thereby creating cultural bridges that have the potent ial to enhance learning in students regardless of cultural background. The ability to blend these multiple perspectives in new and creative ways for the health and wellbeing of all people rests with the new generation of learners. Mid Wives and Their Medicinal Knowledge Ways Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 72 One of the participants talked about the importance of incorporating the knowledge of traditional mid - w i v e s i n s c h o o l s c i e n c e . W o m e n h a v e t h e i r o w n w a y s o f k n o w i n g . O n e o f t h e s e s t r e a m s o f k n o w l e d g e has to do with the role and resp onsibilities associated with traditional mid -wifery. He said, There was no such thing as hospitals in those days. Everybody had newborns at home. They had mid wives. The grandmother would be the one to deliver the child. The Grandmother would be the one to teach the daughter so that when she would come of age she would be the one to deliver. There were certain things that they used to deliver babies and how to make the baby c o m e o u t e a r l i e r . T h e y h a d m e d i c i n e f o r a l l t h a t . T h e y w o u l d g i v e t h e p r e g n a n t w o m a n some liquid to drink so the individual would not suffer too much from pain. They had ways and means of easing the birth of a child. (TC, 1. 3) Traditional mid -wives had knowledge of herbs, plants, nutrition, gynecology, and obstetrics. They counselled wom en about pre -natal care, natural childbirth, breastfeeding, and healthy ways of nurturing children. In order to incorporate this knowledge base, teachers must consult very closely with female members of the community especially female Elders who have speci al knowledge about Women's ways of knowing. Preservation of Indigenous Knowledge Many of the participants talked about the importance of preserving First Nations knowledge systems by researching, documenting, and recording the perspectives of Elders. One participant had this to say, A l o t o f t i m e s y o u w i l l g e t a n E l d e r t h a t d o e s n o t w a n t y o u t o r e c o r d n o t h i n g d o n ' t w a n t y o u t o w r i t e a n y t h i n g d o w n . B u t w h e n y o u w r i t e i t d o w n , i t i s t h e r e . Y o u h a v e i t . I f y o u don't write it down, then we will forget. It is gone with the Elder when he passes on. So much knowledge has been lost. Even medicine people have lost a lot of their knowledge. We used to have medicine to heal our own people. Nowadays they don't know enough to be able to heal one another. (IP, 1. 2) Each community will need to develop research protocols and frameworks appropriate to their culture and community context. More importantly, the duty to consult and issues of intellectual property rights must be dealt with before any research takes place on th e traditional territories of First Nations People . Intellectual Property Rights and First Nations Knowledge One of the participants highlighted the importance of teaching students intellectual property rights and patents in relation to sharing First Nation s knowledge systems. He shared the following story, I will tell you about passing on stuff. We had a meeting one time a couple of years ago in Saskatoon. That time, they called as many Elders as they could. I was included in that group. They told us not to reveal any of our medicines because they said that there are so many people that want to get these medicines and use a patent on them and so n o b o d y e l s e c a n u s e i t a f t e r . T h e r e w a s o n e t h a t t h e y t a l k e d a b o u t w h o t r i e d t o p a t e n t t h e S w e a t l o d g e . A n d i t i s t h o s e t h i n g s t h a t a r e r e a l l y s c a r y w h e n t h e y d o t h a t . B u t apparently that is what people do so we have to be careful whom you are passing on t h a t s t u f f o n t o . O u r p e o p l e p a s s i t o n t o o u r p e o p l e a s m u c h a s t h e y c a n . W h a t e v e r I know is open to everybody. B ut when you get something like that, then it's kind of touchy. (IP, 1. 3) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 73 The issue of intellectual property rights in relation to First Nations cultural knowledge is the focus of increasing attention among communities who share a history with intellectual piracy under colonial oppression. The history of Western science is not immune to the violation of ethics that underpin First Nations ways of gathering and sharing information. Ways of Using First Nations Knowledge One of participant cautions science teac hers that they teach only that information which they feel comfortable. It is important that teachers do not go any further than what Elders teach them. The idea is to focus on the core content passed on by Elders. The things Elders have given them are fr ee to use, but not to go any further than what they have been told. I think that way they'll be able to do their teaching in a good way. But when you start going to Elders and pumping them for information, we have people that will do anything for money. So metimes they'll give some of their black secrets with them and scientists start working on that. You shouldn't be bothering that kind of stuff. Just teach the stuff that Elders tell you. (IP, 1. 8) There are proper ways of passing on different types of kno wledge. Some are practical day -to-day survival skills and some are only shared at different times of the year for certain reasons. Many Trickster stories for example are shared only in the wintertime when people spend a lot of time indoors usually in the e vening when the mind begins to enter the dream world. Teaching and learning First Nations knowledge systems is a life long endeavour that must be lived and experienced for prolonged periods of time in a particular place. One participant spoke about the imp ortance of young people learning directly from the Elders to bring some balance in their development and experiences. He said there is so much focus on book learning and the mental dimension in the curriculum. Elders in the community are often forgotten in the learning process and are often used for token prayer duties. It is not uncommon then that many will not share with others. He states\"...We have all these books and that's what our young people are learning. They don't learn anything from the Indian peop l e . M y g o s h , i f b o o k s w e r e w r i t t e n b y o u r E l d e r s , w e w o u l d have lots of information for them but some Elders withhold what they have and won't tell anybody\" (IP, 1. 8). Student -Led Research Projects on First Nations Knowledge One participant recommended th at students be given opportunities to engage in guided research projects that connect them with their own Elders. Through these interactions, youth will learn valuable knowledge and proper ways of thinking, behaving, and making decisions based on a worldvi ew of interdependence and respect. I feel that students should go out and get that information because there is nothing written down. So when a student wants to write something about herbs or something like that, they need to go and see an Elder. And they need to make it right by giving them Tobacco and talking to them in the right way. Same thing with these science people, they need to take the time to go and see the Elders in a good way. Otherwise twenty years from now we'll still be in the same boat we'r e in now. (IP, 1. 8) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 74 Building research capacity is a central focus in many First Nations communities especially in the areas of health and education. Exposing science students to both qualitative and quantitative as well as First Nations methodologies help s to fulfill a major aspect of learning to do research in post -colonial contexts. Storytelling as A Way of Passing on First Nations Knowledge Many of the participants talked about incorporating stories and storytelling as a way of passing on First Nations Knowledge. Storytelling is a traditional methodology in many First Nations contexts. The stories themselves are knowledge repositories as the languages and words that are used to convey them contain complex cultural teachings. Elders and Medicine people po ssess diverse knowledge perspectives i n F i r s t N a t i o n c o m m u n i t i e s . N o t a l l o f t h e m w o r k w i t h p l a n t s . S o m e a r e i n v o l v e d i n c e r e m o n i e s . S o m e are pipe carriers. Some of them work with the mind and stories. One participant has this to say about storytellers, Storytellers are like doctors themselves because you listen to that person tell that story and you start to feel comfortable. It puts you in a different world altogether when you finish listening to the storyteller. Storytelling is a form of medicine. It's a gift that has been give to some people. When a person tells these stories, there is laughter. One person I know is Don Burnstick. He can talk to you, teach you, and also make you laugh. W e h a d h i m i n S a s k a t o o n a t C e d a r L o d g e . H e c a m e t h e r e , n o t a s a c o m e dian. He came as a doctor, a lecturer. He had a way of talking to people. And those kids, you could hear a pin drop. He would tell a funny story every once in awhile. There are those people who have that gift. To bring people in and out of reality and that 's the kind of people you need and there's not very many of those people. There used to be a lot, but now it's dying off. (IP, 1. 5) Hunting stories offer one avenue that science teachers can use in school science. Hunting stories contain valuable First Na tions knowledge pertaining to conservation and sustainable ways of being and doing things. Trappers and other traditional land users have a considerable amount of knowledge in relation to the natural world and in particular the habitats and animals they hu nt for existence. The person that is a hunter knows the animal that is being hunted and that is the way he i s a b l e t o d o w h a t h e d o e s . A t r a p p e r k n o w s t h e a r e a t h a t h e w a n t s t o t r a p . A f t e r a h u n t e r h a s m a d e a k i l l , t h e y l i k e t o g o b a c k a n d t a l k a b o u t i t b e c a u s e i t g i v e s t h e m t h a t s a m e f e e l i n g . E v e r y t i m e h e t e l l s t h a t s t o r y , t h e f e e l i n g s c o m e b a c k t o h i m . T h a t i s w h a t he is offering to the people. He teaches respect for the animal by leaving Tobacco and s o m e t i m e s a c l o t h . T h i s i s f o r t h e a n i m a l t h a t h a s g i v e n i t s b o d y t o t h i s m a n s o h e c a n survive. (IP, 1. 6) According to this participant, hunting stories are expressed in different ways. For example hunting stories can come in the form of traditional song and dance all of which reinforce close relationships w i t h the natural world. The participant offered the following example. Y o u w i l l s e e a t a P o w W o w e v e n t w h e n t h e y a r e d a n c i n g . W h e n t h e y d o t h e S n e a k U p dance. You know that guy is hunting and we have all kinds of ways of telling those stories. Those are t he kind of things people are interested in, you know they get that feeling from listening to a hunter telling how he done it. There are so many things. I o f t e n u s e d t o l i s t e n t o m y d a d t a l k . H e w a s a h u n t e r . I u s e d t o l i s t e n a n d I l e a r n e d h o w Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 75 to hunt by ju st listening to him. He taught me how to trap and all of these things that we don't use anymore. (IP, p. 6) While stories are a fundamental source of knowledge in First Nations families and communities, another domain of knowledge is from the realm of drea ms, intuition, creativity, and vision. Dreams as a Source of Knowledge One of the participants introduced the importance of dreams and dreaming as a fundamental source of knowledge in First Nations cultures. In traditional times, young adolescents would be g o o u t i n t o a n isolated natural setting to undergo a period of guided fasting, prayer, and vision questing. From these experiences, young people learned their lifelong role and responsibilities. He explained this type of knowledge in the quote below. Drea ms to us are like a window into a different world and we can get many things. We can develop ways to be interactive in our dreams and that is where the information comes from. Many of us have dreams and say somebody was there, but they didn't speak to us. For us, when we have a dream about somebody, could be anybody that has gone into the spirit world, we say that person wants to tell us something, or teach us something, but when they come in our dreams and don't say anything, don't share anything, and don' t show anything, it means that we ourselves are not ready to receive whatever messages they have. (KG, 1. 4) Visualization and art activities that involve symbols can be incorporated to help students express their dreams and connections to animals, plants, and other aspects of the natural world. Students can also explore and conduct research in relation to scientists who have made scientific discoveries based on what appeared in their dreams or the insights gained after having had flashes of intuition. Inco rporating Humour in the Science Classroom One participant brought up the importance of striking a balance between serious academic learning and the use of humour and fun in school science. He explained that many teachers do not always understand there are different ways of passing on knowledge including the use of humour. He said, \" S o m e e l d e r s l i k e t o h a v e f u n \" . H o w e v e r , h e c a u t i o n e d , \" Y o u c a n h a v e f u n , b u t m a k e s u r e i t i s k e p t a t a n a f f e c t i o n a t e l e v e l \" . H i s a d v i c e t o t e a c h e r s i s t o \" i n c l u d e h u m o u r a s a n i ntricate part of the i n t r o d u c t i o n \" a n d g o e s o n t o s a y \" ... n o w t h a t w e ' v e h a d a l a u g h o r t w o , n o w I a m r e a l l y g o i n g t o t a l k about it in a non -condescending way\" (WL, 1. 2). Teachers role model the value of humility when they incorporate humour in science acti vities. Humour and fun are important in building relationships with students. He said, \"Never down -grade your humanness. You are human and so don't hide behind the cloak for trying to be proper or don't be afraid of being laughed at. The kids will respect you. It has to do with respect and how you earn the respect of the children or your peers\" (WL, 1. 6). Incorporating Feasts in School Science One participant talked about incorporating feasts as one avenue in learning about First Nations culture and traditional values. Traditional values are used to guide all thinking, behaviour, and decision making Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 76 in First Nations contexts. Traditional values are also the basis of all relationships. He said \"have a feast in the gym and have band members mingle with the students. I find that feasts are good. All teachers, especially non -native teachers need to know about the culture in this way\" (WL, 1. 4). Ther e are many traditional teachings that are reinforced in a feast. Elders are also given an opportunity to fulfill their responsibilities by passing on what they know to young people in these community events. He explained, \"Maybe they will hear it [the teac hings] ...a hundred a times...before it means something but as long as they are having fun and someone is paying attention to them that matters\". While he shared the importance of using feasts, there was an element of seriousness to his advice that had to do with reinforcing the value of equality, kinship relationships and community building by sharing food with others \"...that's the main one where there is food...Elders, parents, teachers and children gathering t o g e t h e r . A b o u t t h r e e y e a r s a g o , t h e C h i e f o f F S I N c a m e a n d a t e l i k e a r e g u l a r I n d i a n [ L a u g h s ] . I t i s v e r y important\". The following statement sums up his perspective: \"It is vitally important to the community to be a community\". (WL, 1. 4) At the school science level, teachers and community members can als o set up field trips to hunting sites w h e r e t h e y w i l l l e a r n h o w t h e f e a s t i s a n i n t r i c a t e p a r t o f t h e w h o l e h u n t i n g c y c l e b e g i n n i n g w i t h t h e dreaming, the knowledge of animal habitats and ways of honouring the animal after it has been killed and finally th e rituals involved in the actual feast where consumption links the animal with the human in an never -ending cycle of transformation and change. Oral Speaking Skills in the Science Classroom One participant talked about the importance of incorporating and r einforcing oral speaking skills in s c h o o l s c i e n c e . I n t r a d i t i o n a l t i m e s , F i r s t N a t i o n s k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m s w e r e p a s s e d o n o r a l l y . M a n y F i r s t N a t i o n s p e o p l e w e r e g i f t e d o r a t o r s . H e s a i d , \" l o n g a g o w e h a d v e r y g o o d o r a t o r s t h a t g o t u p a n d s p o k e . Let's say you weren't well spoken so you would call one of those speakers to convene\" and that \"there were always one or two people that had that role and got up and spoke to the people\" (WL, 1. 5). Young people listened and observed these role models, and many became s killed speakers themselves. He continued to share the history of traditional orators in the following way, \"I think when I look back on i t , t h e y w e r e m o r e g i f t e d t h a n t o d a y b e c a u s e t h e r e w a s a v e r y s e r i o u s n e e d f o r t h e i r k i n d o f s k i l l s whereas today we hav e newsletters, radio, and televisions\" (WL, 1. 5). Many traditional orators served to unify the community by the way they talked and shared. He explained, \"When you go to a f u n e r a l ... y o u h a v e s o m e o n e t h a t c a n s p e a k i n t h o s e w a y s . T h e y f e e l p a r t o f t h e w h o l e process. Nobody speaks and everyone is quiet. People who feel disconnected can be unified by a good speaker...that is a g ift in itself \" ( WL, 1. 5 ). And once the e ven t is ov er an d they ha ve exer cised th eir role, traditi onal or ato rs \"resume their place\" as reg ular community members. Learning to speak about the results of a science research project in a public forum can teach valuable skills related to the dissemination of knowledge. Students can learn creative ways of presenting First Nations knowledge systems u s i n g c o m p l e x s y m b o l s t h a t a r e l i n k e d t o t h e n a t u r a l w o r l d . O t h e r w a y s include presentations at local, province or nation wide science fairs that focus on First Nations knowledge systems and Western science. Sharing Cultural Experiences Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 77 All participants t a l k e d a b o u t t h e n e e d t o s h a r e c u l t u r a l e x p e r i e n c e s i n s c h o o l s c i e n c e a s a w a y t o promote respect, tolerance, and compassion for one another's perspectives. It is important to teach students that people may not always agree with one another based on their w orldview orientations. What may seem logical from one worldview may seem illogical in another worldview. One participant talked about the importance of science teachers sharing their own cultural background experiences and knowledge with students as a way to breakdown cultural barriers (WL, 1. 1.). Exploring and learning about the local knowledge of First Nation communities can expand to include the knowledge systems of other Indigenous groups at the national and international levels. Through cross - cultura l research activities, students will enhance their scientific literacy skills by learning the perspectives of diverse relatives that share the natural world. NATURAL WORLD In traditional times, we had to live with nature. You had to respect it because you are part of the land. Humans are only a little speck. We will never be greater than all these other things. Western science does not respect anything. They take the herbs and take the logs, and a lot of times without our consent. They are just there to m ake money. We grieve over these losses because they are disappearing rapidly now more than ever. That's why the weather is changing.

Some are rooted in the natural world. In the following passage, one participant links certain type s o f k n o w l e d g e w i t h particular practices tied to certain places of origin. Science teachers should be approaching those people within the community that have expertise or knowledge about something whether this is about trapping, food gathering, and somebod y who is a good hunter. All of these people have knowledge within that area in which they live, and how they connect with it, how they live in harmony within that area and recognize that parts of that area are sacred for that particular productivity for di fferent items or reasons, and bear in mind that these people live within that land as their Mother and they know. And there is a particular feeling that happens when you look at the land as your Mother. You have this view in your mind as you are walking in the bush or sitting on a hill and just feeling that energy that comes with that. So there is that kind of interaction that science teachers should know about and incorporate. This w i l l n o t t a k e a n y t h i n g a w a y f r o m W e s t e r n s c i e n c e , i t i s g o i n g t o i n c r e a s e a nd improve the abilit y of thos e y oung p eople wh o li ve in and appreciate wh y they liv e in that area o f the world. (KG, 1. 3) The participant explained that First Nations ways of knowing are tied to geographical differences with particular relationships with certain animals. These can be used for curriculum purposes as a starting base in exploring the diversity of life in particular ecosystems. Some people live next to lakes, mountains, plains, northern tundra, etc. All of these places mean different things t o p e o p l e t h a t l i v e i n t h a t p a r t i c u l a r a r e a . F i r s t N a t i o n s p e o p l e a l s o h a v e s p e c i f i c c u l t u r a l s y m b o l s a n d h e r o e s t i e d t o t h e s e p l a c e s . F o r e x a m p l e in Dakota culture, the buffalo and eagle are the main messengers in terms of carrying beseechments to the Cre ator and back. And for the Dene in the north, the wolf and caribou, and for the West Coast people, they often talk about the raven. In the prairies, we don't have a particular relationship to the Giraffe, Elephant, or Lion because we are not familiar with t h e m . T h e s e a r e t h e e x p e r i e n c e s o f F i r s t N a t i o n s People within these environments within which they live. This is how they interpret all of that which is in these environments. (KG, 1. 6) Stories of key animals and plants that occupy a particular place can be used to enhance school science learning while reinforcing the cultural heritage of First Nations People . Focus On Plants and Animals According To Place Another participant talked about the importance of linking school science with traditional knowledge related to plants and animals that occupy a particular place. First Nations People interacted with certain places for long periods of time. Their observati ons of the natural world were key to their survival. Students can be taught to sharpen their observational skills through prolonged periods of interaction Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 79 with the land. He said it took years to master a lot of the knowledge and people never wrote anything down. They studied the plants. They had to study the plants because that's where they got their medicines. They studied the animals. If they killed an animal, they believed the Creator granted it to them. They just didn't kill it and butcher it. They used to have some sort of meditation. They would pray and thank the Creator and animal for giving itself to s u s t a i n t h e i r f a m i l i e s . T h e r e w e r e p r o c e d u r e s a s t o h o w t h i s w a s d o n e . I f t h e y k i l l e d a moose, a deer, or an elk, there were certain procedures that the y went through after they had skinned it. (TC, 1. 2) He went on to explain that First Nations People made use of everything that was born out of Mother Earth. Nothing was wasted. Conservation skills were fostered and cultivated from a very young age. He said, \"They call it Mother Earth which provides us with all our needs in order for us to live in this world. They used the various trees to sustain their livelihood. Take the maple trees for example. They used to t a p t h e m a p l e t r e e s i n t h e e a r l y s p r i n g s o t h ey could make their maple sugar. Maple sugar was used for very important feasts and lodges\" (TC, 1. 2). Traditional Medicines and School Science One participant pointed out the importance of using Traditional Medicines with extreme caution and care. He sha red his experience with using Traditional medicine for his diabetes in the following way, I am a diabetic and when I took it, my blood sugar went right down to about four point something and I was shaking. So I am worried about giving that information out . H o w e v e r , i f t h a t m e d i c i n e w a s r e f i n e d a n d m a d e s o t h a t s o m e o n e c o u l d u s e i t a l i t t l e a t a time, then I think it would be good. You see, in the Indian world, our nation, that is something that is really needed. But when it comes down to say, knowing how t o u s e i t , if someone passes on knowledge on how to use it, then no one will get into trouble. T h a t i s s o m e o f t h e k i n d o f s t u f f t h a t i s r e a l l y t o u c h y . A n d s o I w o u l d l i k e t o g i v e t h a t t o science, so they could use it for our use. (IP, 1. 3) Science teacher s can guide dialogue and exploration about contemporary threats to traditional plants and medicines. One of the biggest threats to traditional medicines has been the use of chemicals in the farming industry for example. He said, \"I would like science to kn ow what we have out there. I would like them to know because more and more chemicals are being used by some farmers and by doing this, they ar e killing off the med icines. A lo t of the medicin es w e used ov er fift y y ears ag o, that we us ed t o g o out and pick are not there anymore because of the sprays and stuff like that\" (IP, 1. 4). A c c e s s t o l a n d i s a n i m p o r t a n t i s s u e f o r F i r s t N a t i o n s People . Medicines grow in certain places. In traditional times and still today, people had to travel great distances when ga thering and harvesting medicines. He said there are a lot of medicines that grow in northern areas where people need access across imposed boundaries. They should make parts of them where Indian people have access to go get medicines. I think this would be o n e o f t h e m a i n t h i n g s t o d o . I d o n ' t k n o w i f i t i s h a p p e n i n g n o w . I know every year we go out to Chief's Mountain on the other side of the border and the m e d i c i n e s t h a t w e g o p i c k o v e r t h e r e . M y g o d i t ' s s o m e t h i n g e l s e . T h e r e i s s o m u c h Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 80 medicine. It's ju s t a m a z i n g . I o f t e n s a y t h a t e v e r y p l a n t t h a t g r o w s o n t h e m o u n t a i n i s a medicine. Even just being there, the feeling that you get. It's a wonderful feeling. I don't know science. We are dealing with something Indian people do not really know too much abou t. (IP, 1. 5) Many of the participants expressed the importance teaching young people the validity of traditional medicines and their continued importance in contemporary times. Young people need to experience and see for themselves traditional medicines i n action. One participant shared a story about his grandson and how he demonstrated the value of traditional healing through direct experience. The young people have to know that Elders have medicine that can help you out. A lot of times when you are suff ering from stress, you are depressed, and all of these things, we have medicines to help your mind and body. Those are the kind of things young people have to know. I recall one day. I was outside. I have a little shed where I keep my m e d i c i n e s . I w a s d o c toring a person there. I have medicine in my mouth when I work. I had finished and my grandson came and said 'where is the Tylenol? I have such a headache' and I said, 'you don't need Tylenol, just sit there'. And I blew his head and he said, 'what did you do Grandpa, I don't have a headache anymore'. I showed him the medicine I used works. I really changed his mind. He really believes in that stuff now. You kno w he can s mudg e up. N ow he puts his hear t in to i t and s o this is g o od. Th ose ar e the kind of thin gs when you are teaching will help. (IP, 1. 5) O n e s t r a t e g y t h a t s c i e n c e t e a c h e r s c a n u s e i s t o s h a r e s t o r i e s o f t r a d i t i o n a l m e d i c i n e s a s a n i m p o r t a n t way to generate interest among young people. For example, one of the participants talked about venereal d i s e a s e s i n t h e 1 9 2 0 s a n d 1 9 3 0 s . H e s a i d , \" T h e r e w e r e n o c u r e s f o r t h e s e d i s e a s e s . P e n i c i l l i n had not been discovered yet. But I remember my grandmother taught me that medicine. I can cure some of these diseases. Science did not know anything about Penicill in instead they locked some of these people in a sanatorium where they would waste away. The old Indian people knew those things\" (IP, 1. 12). Traditional Relationships with the Environment One participant spoke about fostering relationships with the land and environment by setting up learning experiences that will allow students to emotionally bond with the natural world. He said, The land is one of our Mothers. It serves us. It nourishes us. That is where we get our nourishment from and a lot of people d o not realize that. The other thing is that people do not honour M o t h e r E a r t h l i k e w e s h o u l d . W e m a k e p a v e m e n t a l l o v e r t h e p l a c e a n d w e n e v e r w a l k b a r e f e e t o n t h e g r a s s . W e n e v e r t a k e o f f o u r s h o e s a n d w a l k a r o u n d o n M o t h e r E a r t h b a r e f e e t t o e n j o y t h a t f e e l i n g t h a t w e g e t f r o m t h e r e . O r l a y o n y o u r b a c k t o l o o k a t t h e c l o u d s . T o b e i n ' A w e ' w i t h t h e w a y t h e C r e a t o r h a s m a d e M o t h e r E a r t h . T h e r e a r e n o t v e r y m a n y p e o p l e t h a t d o t h a t a n y m o r e . S o t h a t i s w h a t y o u h a v e t o d o . We have to honour Mother Earth. R ight now, it is deplorable how they are treating her just for a few bucks. (IP, 1. 7) Similarly another participant expressed the importance of teaching science students how First Nations people traditi onally r elated to the land in the f oll owin g way. \"I t hink they should learn their relationship t o t h e l a n d a n d d i f f e r e n t p a r t s o f t h e l a n d t h a t a r e s i g n i f i c a n t f o r d i f f e r e n t p u r p o s e s . T h e r e a r e s a c r e d Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 81 sites, and places where medicine sits, places that should be revered and also, places for beseechment and of ferings\" (KG, 1. 1). Traditional Ethics and Ethical Conduct In School Science Many of the participants spoke about the importance of adhering to traditional ethics and ethical conduct in relation to the treatment of other entities in the natural world. One participant shared her concerns about ethics by using the dissection of animals in laboratory experiments as an example. A lot of times, high school students, First Nations and non -First Nations are taking Biolog y class es and the y tel l me tha t the y hav e t o diss ect a fr og or sna ke and it's not ou r way as First Nations People . We could teach our students to look at diagrams to explain everything in detail, but you never, ever with your hands start to destroy it or anything l i k e t h a t . T h e r e w a s o n e B i o l o g y t e acher that said the animals were pickled and prepared for dissection. But it's not our way and we should never, ever do that. In a spiritual way, these creatures are put on Mother Earth and we should never do that to them. We walk with great respect for th e w i n g e d , a n i m a l s , a n d t h o s e t h a t c r a w l o n t h e g r o u n d . S o a s F i r s t N a t i o n s People , I think we got no business doing that to them. But yet today in Biology class, I understand they have to do that. (VG, 1. 2) One way of acknowledging the spirit of the anima ls used in scientific experiments is to use proper cultural protocols such as offering Tobacco or smudging the laboratory and glass bottles containing the a n i m a l b o d y p a r t s . A n o t h e r w a y i s f o r t h e s t u d e n t s t o a p p r o a c h E l d e r s d i r e c t l y f o r a d v i c e . O n e partic ipant recommends that, ...the student take Tobacco and offer it to an Elder and explain that they have to do this in order t o l i v e i n t h e w h i t e m a n ' s w o r l d t o g e t t h e i r e d u c a t i o n . I t h i n k a s E l d e r s , w e w o u l d b e p r e p a r e d t o p r a y a n d s m u d g e w i t h t h e m t o a s k t h e grandfathers to help the individual. They'll have to have a ceremony, praying to these reptiles, amphibians, and whatever, because we believe they have a spirit and they'll make offerings to the spirit and the keepers of the ground. That would help the students. (VG, 1. 2) Incorporating Environmental Issues One participant talked about the need to focus on environmental issues related to resource extraction activities that are taking place in the traditional territories of First Nations People . H e s a i d , \"you know a m a n o n c e s a i d t h a t w e a r e t h e o n l y o n e s t h a t w i l l d i r t y i t u p a n d l i v e i n i t a n d t h a t ' s w h a t w e a r e d o i n g . W e a r e w r e a k i n g h a v o c o n M o t h e r E a r t h , a n d a l l o f t h e f i l t h a n d s t u f f , w e l i v e r i g h t a m o n g s t i t . I d o n ' t k n o w i f t h a t w i l l e v e r c h a n g e . I think we have gone too far\" (IP, 1. 7). He encourages teachers to provide space where students can explore the impact of mining for example. I o f t e n t a l k a b o u t m i n e s a n d w h a t t h e y d o t o t h e l a n d . T h i s i s w h e r e w e g e t o u r l i v i n g from and they are depletin g the water. Now they are talking about building a Tars Sands i n d u s t r y i n S a s k a t c h e w a n . I f o r g e t h o w m a n y g a l l o n s o f w a t e r t h e y u s e t o m a k e o n e quart of oil. Once they put the water through, it can longer be used. We are just playing w i t h t h e t h i n g s w e g e t f r o m M o t h e r E a r t h . I t i s r e a l l y b a d . I s p o k e o n e t i m e a t a c h u r c h meeting about what people were doing to Mother Earth and I said, what are we going to leave our children and great grandchildren? (IP, 1. 7) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 82 T e a c h e r s c a n u s e h o t t o p i c i s s u e s i n r e l a t i o n t o mining for example by introducing debates on the Uranium mining industry in Saskatchewan. One of the worst discoveries is uranium. When they discovered it they starting messing around with it. The stuff they don't use anymore is just as dangerous. We wor ked at this one lake and they brought some Elders in. The uranium was only eighteen inches below the ground. They asked why it is that the animals that feed on the grass above this uranium, nothing happens to them. The Elders told them they haven't disturb ed it. They live right beside the uranium. But as soon as you start disturbing it, then the thing w i l l c o m e a l i v e a n d t h a t ' s w h a t t h e y ' r e d e a l i n g w i t h n o w . S u r e i t ' s a n o t h e r f o r m o f energy that we have, but you have to watch out how you use that energy. (I P, 1. 8) A n o t h e r h o t t o p i c a r e a i s r e s e a r c h i n g F i r s t N a t i o n s p e r s p e c t i v e s a n d s t o r i e s i n r e l a t i o n t o G l o b a l Warming. Many First Nations People live very close to the land and any changes that occur out of the usual patterns are noticed right away. The participant shared the following story on changes that have occurred as a result of global warming as an example. I r e m e m b e r l o n g a g o w h e n i t g o t cold. The popular trees would just split. That is how c o l d i t w a s . W e l i v e d i n a l i t t l e m u d h o u s e . T h e r e w a s n o f u r n a c e , j u s t a b i g h e a t e r a n d that was it. We enj oy ed e v ery bit of it. N o wadays, our winters ar e not s ev ere an y mor e. I remember them old sleigh s just creaking on that snow. But it doesn't do that anymore because Mother Earth is getting warm with Global Warming. I often talk about the polar caps melting and as they are melting, the diseases that were trapped in that ice for so many thousands of ye a r s a r e g e t t i n g r e l e a s e d . A n d n o w w e a r e g e t t i n g a l l k i n d s o f diseases and they are having a heck of a time inoculating people. I think if you hear these kind of things from an Indian person it will mean more to the students than they would if they heard i t from someone that has never lived in the community. (IP, 1. 7) Science Camps and 'On the Land' Experiential Activities A common theme that weaved throughout all of the interviews is the importance of connecting youth with the land through experiential ex cursions. Participants recommend that science teachers take students out on the land by using Science Camps and other types of Field Trips as an avenue to engage in experiential activities. In traditional times, learning First Nations Knowledge systems was usually done through engagement with the environment. Hands -on learning activities, thematic learning stations, and community resource people are key ingredients in planning science camps with a cultural emphasis. Take them out in the wilderness where th ere is medicines and all kinds of plants. Take them out th ere with a c ou ple of Elder s, on e mal e and one fe mal e. H ave the Elde rs teach about plants and what they can be used for. There are certain plants that you cannot tell anybod y. But a lot of the stuff you have out there can be used. There is medicine for s o r e e y e s a n d e v e n f o r c l e a n s i n g o n e s e l f b y u s i n g s a g e . E v e n t h e b a r k o f a t r e e c a n b e u s e d f o r m e d i c i n e . S o m e o f t h e s e t r a p p e r s i n t h e n o r t h , t h e y ' l l g o o u t f o r a b o u t f i v e o r six months at a time, and when a guy gets sick out in the bush, he can't go and see a doctor, so naturally the herbs are there and that trapper has knowledge of that. That's the way these things are. (IP, 1. 9) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 83 First Nations People do not separate knowledge in separate disciplines like Western Science and so the importance of integrating multiple subject areas when taking students on Field Trips. Students learn Western science concepts in addition to valuable knowledge of the natural world directly from First Nations People who act as resource people. Observations of the Natural World First Nations People often learned about the natural world through observation. Teachers can set up opportunities where students can learn active listening, observation, and traditional values such as patience and humility from the natural world. One participant shared the importance of having students observe the tiniest of the insects such as ants because they have something to teach us about life and values. I u s e d t o d e l i b e r a t e l y m a k e a n e f f o r t t o l o ok for anthills when I was out attending ceremonies. People used to think I was crazy. But I like watching ants. They are so organized and they never squabble. I can sit for hours and just watch the ants work. Same thing with bees, they just know what they are doing. I think they are better than humans sometimes. The ants carry tiny white rocks into their nest, and these can be used for rattles in our ceremonies. (VW, 1. 2) First Nations People often use ceremonies to become connected with the natural world as well as to seek knowledge and wisdom from the spirit world. There are stories of people being able to communicate with the animals through the vision quest ceremony for example. \"We learned from the animals. The animals had a lot to teach us. You beca me aware of your surroundings. You appreciate the silence\" (VW, 1. 3). Today , i t d oesn' t ha ve t o b e a vision quest. Y ou can just g o out int o the bush and sit. Y ou become aware of everything. Your senses open up, your smell, your hearing, and things y o u n e v e r n o t i c e d b e f o r e , t h i n g s w e t a k e f o r g r a n t e d . Y o u d o n ' t n e e d t o g o o n a v i s i o n quest to learn from nature, just go out on the land, like on the prairies. You will probably learn something. (VW, p. 3) Many of the participants talked about connecting stud e n t s t o t h e l a n d s t a r t i n g f r o m t h e e a r l y a g e s within families, within the school system, and through community -wide events. One participant expressed this sentiment in the following way. T h e y l e a r n a t a v e r y y o u n g a g e . I f y o u d o n ' t t e a c h t h e m a t h o m e a n d especially if you l i v e i n t h e c i t y , t h e y w i l l h a v e n o c o n n e c t i o n t o t h e l a n d w h a t s o e v e r . Y o u n e e d t o t a k e the kids out once in awhile, whether it is cold, raining, or whatever. They will tell you all kinds of exciting things in one day that they didn't kno w before. You see the expression on their faces. (VW, 1. 3) I t i s i m p o r t a n t t o t e a c h s t u d e n t s W e s t e r n s c i e n c e a s w e l l a s t h e v a l u e o f r e s p e c t f o r t h e n a t u r a l w o r l d . By coming to understand that everything has a purpose, student will learn not to harm the e nvironment. The Four Elements: Water, Wind, Fire, Earth Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 84 One participant shared the importance of exploring the four elements of water, wind, fire and earth, as they are understood in Western science. First Nations believe in these four elements, with one addition, and that is the spirit that flows through all life. First Nations People used these five elements to heal themselves for example through the Sweat lodge ceremony. First Nations People also personified their connection to each of these four elemen ts. She said, \"in our D a k o t a w a y , w e h a v e a w a t e r t h i n g , w e d o a l o t o f c e r e m o n i e s a n d p r a y e r s t o t h e w a t e r s ... i t i s a s a c r e d thing...we pray and make offerings to the water spirit to keep the water pure for us living on Mother E a r t h t o u s e \" ( V G , 1 . 1 ) . T h e p a rticipant continued to explain the personification of the elements using the wind as an example. And the wind, a lot of times the environment cannot control the wind, it comes, and in o u r s a c r e d , t r a d i t i o n a l w a y , w e c a l l i t a s a c r e d s p i r i t . W e p r a y t o c a l m the winds when they are r eally sta rting to ... and we watch ...wh en it sta rts to d o damag e and beg i nning to destroy us then we have a spiritual ceremony and pray to the wind spirit to hold the wind back. (VG, 1. 1) She continued her teachings of the four element s using fire as an example and ending with earth. Fire is another very sacred thing to our people; we should not be fooling around with it o r p l a y i n g w i t h f i r e b e c a u s e w e r e a l i z e t h a t f i r e c a n b e v e r y d a n g e r o u s . I n t h a t , t h e f i r e , we say in our tradition al w ay that when a l oved one i s g one to the spirit world, we mak e a f i r e f o r t h e i r t r a v e l , t o g u i d e a n d h e l p t h e m t o g e t w h e r e t h e y n e e d t o g o i n a v e r y spiritual, sacred way\". \"Those are the four elements of nature and of course Mother Earth comes in bec ause she is the provider for all of our needs as individuals, or as people living on Mother Earth. (VG, 1. 1) From the foundational building blocks of the basic elements of life, students can expand their knowledge base of the natural world by exploring th e traditional seasonal cycles of First Nations People . Traditional Seasonal Cycles, Weather Patterns, Astronomy One participant talked about focusing on seasonal cycles, weather patterns, and astronomy in school science. In traditional times, First Nations People used knowledge of the stars to navigate between camps as well as through land and river systems. In addition, understanding weather patterns of a certain place was critical to what may be expected when people travelled. The Elders of the past, our forefathers studied everything, the moon, the sun, the sky, the clouds. They studied various forms and happenings. If there was going to be a change in the weather, they would forecast just by looking at how the sun traveled. They studied that, and they k new something was going to happen. There was a certain sign in the clouds or the sky and even at sunset. They knew what kind of day it was going to be. (TC, 1. 1) Traditional astronomical knowledge was used to engage in seasonal activities at certain times o f t he year using particular technologies for survival. Astronomy was strongly linked to the spiritual orientation First Nations People have in relation to the natural world. One participant explains the connection between astronomy and spirituality in th e following way: Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 85 F r o m a t r a d i t i o n a l p e r s p e c t i v e , a n d a s a n E l d e r , e v e r y t h i n g t h a t w e d o i s f r o m a traditional perspective, there is always a bit of science in it, but we don't look at it that way. An example is the study of the stars. Many, many years ago First Nations People lived by the stars and where certain stars were at certain times of the year. The Big Dipper, the Little Dipper, and the Milky Way were a very sacred, spiritual way of saying that when we leave Mother Earth, that is our road we travel to the Spirit World. Today, I g u e s s y o u c a n c o m b i n e t h a t w i t h t h e s t u d y o f s t a r s , o r a s y o u c a l l i t a s t r o n o m y . ( V G , 1 . 1) Prehistoric Animal Stories One participant shared her experiences working side -by-side with science teachers who were focusing on p r e h i s t o r i c a n i m a l s .

The following is an excerpt of what she remembers. Our people knew about prehistoric animals, the big winged ones. One of them did something wrong so the Creator made them shrink which became the birds we have t o d a y . T h e y d i d n ' t f o l l o w t h e t r a d i t i o n a l w a y .

S o t h o s e w e re the stories I told the students when they studied Dinosaurs. There was a great punishment for these sacred things that roamed the earth and they all vanished. In our way, they say w h e r e v e r t h e y f e l l t h a t i s w h e r e t h e y a r e t o d a y .

When you dig them up and take them out, there will be all kinds of illnesses, changes, and Mother Earth can no long protect u s . I n t h e m i d s t o f a l l t h a t , w e a r e g o i n g t o b e s u f f e r i n g . T h e s e w e r e t h i n g s t h a t w e r e said many years ago and today, they have all fallen into place. (VG , 1. 6) Science teachers can introduce different perspectives on the rise and fall of prehistoric animals based on their own theories as well as stories shared by First Nations People . LANGUAGES First Nations People have their own words for the trees, gra sses, water, moon, stars, sun, and other aspects of the natural world. Because all these are sacred, the language is also sacred. (VG, 1. 3) First Nations languages are inseparable from School Science Identifying, Naming, Classifying - eg. Traditional Pla nts Using Key Words, Phrases, Concepts in FN Languages First Nations languages and Place names First Nations Languages in School Science Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 86 Many of the participants spoke about First Nations languages as being inseparable from school science. H o w e v e r , i n m a n y contexts, First Nations languages are taught as a separate subject de -contextualized from real life situations. In school science, First Nations languages are especially important in identifying, naming, and classifying animals and plants of a particular place. I g u e s s t h e r o l e t h a t l a n g u a g e p l a y s i s i n t h e n a m i n g o f t h e p l a n t s . I h a d a y o u n g f e l l o w c o m e t o m y o f f i c e t h i s m o r n i n g a n d I k n e w t h e n a m e o f t h e p l a n t s i n C r e e . H o w e v e r , I did not know the name of them using the scientific language. If students k no w t he n am e of the plants in the Cree language, then they will know what the Elders are talking about. (IP, 1. 9) The participant went on to state that First Nations languages are important in the naming of plants as well as when one is explaining how t o mix them. It's not so much that you know all of these plants. It is about knowing how to mix them. I t ' s t h e m i x t u r e t h a t w i l l g i v e y o u t h e d o c t o r i n g . I f y o u k n o w h o w t o m i x t h e m , t h e n y o u have something. Then science could have that knowledge. Science already has a lot of our medicines, but they are not in the Cree name, or Saulteaux, or Dakota, or whatever. A lot of time people talk about bad medicine. It's the way you mix that medicine, the p r a y e r s t h a t y o u p u t i n t h e r e . A l o t o f p e o p l e s a y t h e r e i s bad medicine, but it's not like that. Th e Cr eat or n ev er put anything on earth that is b ad. It's the wa y we ma ke it. That' s when it's bad. (IP, 1. 10) T h e o v e r a l l s e n t i m e n t e x p r e s s e d b y m a n y o f t h e p a r t i c i p a n t s i s t h a t F i r s t N a t i o n s l a n g u a g e s a r e a n insepar able aspect of passing on knowledge in First Nations cultures. More importantly, First Nations languages and words contain complex knowledge concepts related to the natural world. T h e l a n g u a g e i s t h e m e m o r y o f t h e p e o p l e a n d i t h a s a l l o f t h e t h i n g s t h a t are important to the people. The integrity of any culture is really based in the language. It has tribal memory, and tribal history. The language is extremely important. If we analyze how we say things, we have a whole different way of thinking. For exampl e i n m y D a k o t a language, we have a word for child , which translates to a child carrying sacredness . Now i f y o u t h i n k o f a n y s o c i e t y t h a t c a n c o m e u p w i t h a w o r d l i k e t h a t f o r a c h i l d , t h e n t h e r e is something in the thinking of that particular word which incorporates their experiences, observations, and the development of faculties that we all have that may be dormant. (KG, 1. 4) One participant recommends that teachers use key words, phrases, and concepts in the First Nations language first followed by vo cabulary in the English language (VG, 1. 3). Another participant spoke about how so much of the history is embedded in the language. She gave an example of place names in the traditional territories of First Nations People . S o m e o f t h e s e Places are traditi onal ceremonial sites that have been replaced by pavement and highways. It is important to teach students about how their world has been re -named through the process of colonization and why it is important to begin the process of reclaiming our own concept s and stories of those P l ace s . Furthermore, there are different knowledge systems that are expressed in different ways. One participant explains this in the following way. She said, \"I found out in the Dakota culture, there is a women's language. There is a way that women communicate that is different than men\" (VW, 1, 9). The Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 87 ability to express and use these multiple perspectives for the social and collective well -being was the overall goal of traditional education among First Nations People . SOCIAL AND C OLLECTIVE WELL -BEING Everything was for their families and they loved their children. That was one of the teachings with the various tribes that when you started having children, they were told that those children were not theirs, but on loan to them to l ook after with love and care as well as to provide for them to the best of your ability. That's why they went trapping, hunting, and gathering berries. That's why everything they did they always prayed. (TC, 1. 2) Collective Wellbeing as the Goal of School Science Spirituality, Sustainability, & Balance Traditional First Nations Values and School Science Respect as a Core Value - Guides Behaviour, Decisions, & Sustainable Ways of Being Promoting Elder and Youth Relationships The overall goal of school science from First Nations perspectives is the social, political, economic and collective wellbeing of community members guided by a set of traditional values that have sustained them for centuries. Living healthy is about living in balance guided by a se t of traditional values. School science curriculum units and activities must revolve around the mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical development of students while learning about healthy relationships within their families and communities. According t o one participant, \"Spirituality and sustainability went hand in hand. For example, some people were given certain ceremonial knowledge and so this meant they were also given the privilege and authority to put up that Sundance Lodge so they could pray for life, for good clean health, and for the sustainability of the children\" (TC, 1. 3). The same participant shared the following story when he was asked the question in relation to how First Nations People survived before the Whiteman came. The Creator provi ded everything for the Indian people. The Creator told them, 'I will be up there. I will look after my Indians, and I will provide them whatever they need'. If they needed something for sickness, the Creator provided them with the knowledge. That is where a l l t h e v a r i o u s p l a n t s c a m e i n . F o r e x a m p l e , w e h a v e m e d i c i n e s f o r t h e back, heart, and the brain. That is why we still see many of our people practicing and t h i s i s g o o d . B u t t h e n a g a i n , w e l o s t a l o t t o o . A l o t o f o u r p e o p l e f o r g o t b e c a u s e somewhere alon g the line they became distracted. We were put in Residential School s.

(TC, 1. 5 -6) Traditional First Nations Values and School Science Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 88 Many of the participants spoke about infusing traditional values in school science. One participant said traditional values like respect are learned from grandparents, the culture, and the places in which p e o p l e o r i g i n a t e . H e w e n t o n t o state, \"You need to know where you come from, and that's one of t h i n g s t h a t y o u h a v e t o k n o w \" ( I P , 1 . 1 0 ) . H e s a i d t e a c h e r s s p e n d a l o t o f t i m e w i t h c h i l d r e n a n d s o p l a y an important role in passing on values that are important in the communities. The thin g t h a t y o u d o , w h e n y o u s e n d a c h i l d t o s c h o o l i s t h a t y o u a r e l e a v i n g i t u p t o that teacher to be able to put all of things that we talk about, the values into that child. The thing that is taught to that child at that early age is the thing that he is go i ng to do when he grows up. That's why a long, long time ago, the old people would all of a sudden say that they want their grandson to come and live with them. We will teach him all of these things, the values. That kid will grow up to be like an old per son. They will know all of these things. You see, when you send that child to school, that teacher is a babysitter, a mentor, they're everything, and if you have Elders in there talking, then you have balance intervention. (IP, 1. 11) One participant allud e d t o t h e n o t i o n t h a t a p e r s o n w i t h t r a d i t i o n a l F i r s t N a t i o n s v a l u e s m a y f i n d working as a scientist to be problematic. I guess an Indian person, or if a person had knowledge or our ways when they were young, they wouldn't make a good scientist because a scientist has to work with little animals, injecting them with different kinds of stuff and making animals sick and seeing how it works. If we have our values, we would never do these things. We would never put something in an animal like that. It's dishea r t e n i n g , b u t I g u e s s t h e y s a v e a l o t o f lives, those little animals, the scientists use. (IP, 1. 11) Traditional values reinforce First Nations worldviews. One fundamental value that kept coming up in the interviews is the need to reinforce respect for the natural world. One participant had this to say, I t h i n k i t i s i m p o r t a n t t o t e a c h r e s p e c t f o r e v e r y t h i n g w e a r e p a r t o f , o u r C r e a t i o n . E v e r y t h i n g h a s a r o l e to play. Everything that we do affects something somewhere. Everything that happens has an effect on something else. As people, we affect things by what we do, what we say, our actions, even what we t h i n k . W e h a v e t o r e s p e c t e v e r y t h i n g a n d e v e r y b o d y f o r w h a t t h e y a r e .

W e h a v e t h e a b i l i t y t o d o different kind of things. So respect and understanding of these things are important. (KG, 1. 4) T h e v a l u e o f r e s p e c t i s t i e d t o s u r v i v a l a n d c o o p e r a t i o n , w h i c h a r e s t i l l i m p o r t a n t t o d a y a s t h e y w e r e i n ancient times. He went on to explain, \"The object of the exercise was survival of the group which means you could not reject anyone or throw anybody away because you needed everybody and the kind of uniqueness or individual ability to do things\" (KG, 1. 4 ). One participant explained that First Nations worldview, the concept of interrelatedness, and traditional values are inseparable aspects of school science. He explained this link in the following way. Everything is related. Everything that they did was related to the family, community, and t r i b e . T h a t i s h o w t h e y l o o k e d a t e v e r y t h i n g . T h e y h a d r e s p e c t f o r e v e r y t h i n g . I t w a s l i k e that when they started using animals like dogs. They thanked the Creator for allowing them to have those animals so they could use them for their sustainability. They loved Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 89 animals. It was the same with horses. They were precious, sacred, and they didn't abuse them. It was believed that these animals agreed that they would come and be servants to work for the Indian people. Some o f t h e E l d e r s u s e d t o s a y t h a t t h e h o r s e g a v e u p i t s spirit so they could come and help the Indian in all their ways of living. (TC, 1. 4) Traditional values were used as a guide for all behaviour, decisions, and sustainable ways of being. Elders often ta u g h t y o u n g p e o p l e t o h a v e r e s p e c t f o r a l l a n i m a l s b e c a u s e t h e y w e r e t h e r e f o r o u r u s e and in turn we humans would become a part of them. They are there for a purpose and they're there so we can eat. They have given themselves up so that we can feed our chi ldren. That is why when we used to make a f e a s t , w e s t i l l h a v e f e a s t s , a n d w e h a v e E l d e r s t h a t p r a y t h a n k i n g t h e a n i m a l f o r g i v i n g i t s e l f u p s o w e c o u l d h a v e t h i s f e a s t a n d s o w e c a n t h a n k t h e C r e a t o r . T h e y d i d n ' t w a s t e t h e a n i m a l \" ( T C , 1 . 5 ) . \" ... I f t h e y w ere adopt the traditional values that we once had, we w o u l d h a v e b e t t e r c o m m u n i t i e s t h e n w h a t w e h a v e n o w . T h e r e i s n o r e s p e c t r i g h t n o w . There is no respect for tradition, spirituality, and anything pure. Even the leadership we have, there is no respect f or them. The leadership has no respect for their community as well. The old Indians forecasted this. (TC, 1. 10) Many of the participants spoke about the importance of connecting youth with Elders so they can learn their culture and traditional value syste m . R e s p e c t f o r s e l f a n d o t h e r s i n t h e c o m m u n i t y i s c e n t r a l t o health and well -being. In his closing statement one of the participants had this to say. They should find ways and means of gradually enticing these young people to come b a c k . L e t ' s g e t b a c k o n the right track. We're all off track right now. The Indian communities are all of track even our leadership. They're all off track. The leadership is too busy trying to fix them selves. They're not really concerned with wanting to fix what h a s t o b e f i x e d in the community. They ignore, but they see it, and they don't want to do anything about it. They need to focus on the youth, because they are our future. That is my philosophy is that we have things going on for our young people through sports, recreatio n, social development and everything because we've lost that now. (TC, 1. 11) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 90 5.2 Learning Indigenous Science from Place: A M\u00e9tis Perspective Self Researcher's Prologue The following constitutes a summary of a series of interviews with individuals from North West Saskatchewan. In respect of participant cultures, I wish to acknowledge that of the nine interview participants, six were M\u00e9tis, two were First Nations and one was non -Aboriginal. It did not seem appropriate to remove the latter three sets of data from my analysis, but rather to acknowledge them as fellow nort hern residents with compatible views. As a M\u00e9tis woman, and former biology teacher, I was excited and honoured to be able to speak with residents from this area for the Learning Indigenous Science from Place research project. I had lived in North West Sas katchewan at one time and hold a deep respect for the people and the place. In research, there is a historic attitude that the researcher should strive for 'objectivity', remaining unattached to the research and the researched. I hold no such position. I feel a tremendous accountability to the people who participated in this study, to the M\u00e9tis community and to all Aboriginal Peoples. After spending many hours analyzing the interviews and my field notes, I realized how much I had not comprehended during the actual dialogues. The words on the pages seemed to grow in intensity and power over time. Voices of participants echoed through time helping me see important messages embedded in the text. I can only say a very humble 'thank you' to those who share d a part of themselves for this important work. In this spirit, I offer my best interpretation of what I heard in the hope that our collective effort will help make a ripple of change in how we think about science education and what we do in future years f or the sake of this planet and all the living things on it. Yvonne Vizina 2008 Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 91 I would love to see my kids spend more time in the culture, especially now, my grandchildren. I would love to see them go canoeing and, you know, even doing science, do it out there, so they could get to feel who they are, what they are, where they come from. (NWS5, l.156) ... we signed a contract out of ethics... It's your ethical process in order to make peace with yourself and your boss and even your Creator. (NWS8, l.96) They have to connect with the environment they're on. I know for a fact we will have some people who they' ll make a connection to the Elders, some of them won't, and that's reality. But the ones that do, the ones that do kind appreciate the science ...want to learn about science, all you have to do is open your windows, there it is. They're surrounded. But, at th e same time in order for them to appreciate the science that they have and everything else, you know, I keep coming back to this. They got to have a strong spiritual self. So, you got to believe in something else. (NWS9, l.180) Participants spoke about th e r o l e o f s e l f i n r e l a t i o n t o a l l o t h e r t o p i c s d i s c u s s e d t h r o u g h o u t t h e i n t e r v i e w s .

Participants spoke about experiential learning that provided opportunities to learn practical skills, developing personal relationships and spiritual understanding, carrying out of protocols as a measure of respect, caring for others and functioning as a part of cultural community. One participant described the jo y experienced by Elders in seeing youth having fun and being respectful to tea chers while prac ticin g traditi onal har ves ting ac ti vities out on the land. He s aid it was an experi ence he would never forget, and doubted that any of the students would ever forg et either. (NWS9, l.60) Participants talked about the impacts of loss of culture and language on community members. It is their hope that systemic change might bring their grandchildren into closer contact with traditional not the teachers, it's not the administration, it's not the school divisions that are suffering, it's our kids losing out on all that knowledge that our Elders are able to pass on. And, yes, we are requir ed to use the Elders once in a while, but not the way they should be used ... (NWS9, l.60) One of the things that I always see is ok, they say, well this is what science is, there it is, it's in the book, there is resources, etc., etc. But, they always, alwa ys more likely nine out of ten times forget to ask the people that are living in the area. There is so much information. There's so much, you know, there are so many people that could actually help them make it, make their life easier as a science teacher or anybody else, yeah. (NWS9, l.124) With Indian Studies, why aren't the white people coming to learn more about Indian Studies? That's the same question they're asking regarding our people, Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 92 they say why aren't people coming to the science? (NWS5, l.176) My kids are going to be all right, they're going to have jobs, they're going to have families, they're going to raise their families. They're going to be fine as human beings, but there's a part of them they'll never have which I have ...to know how it is to feel to be able to grow up around your family, or to grow up around things that make you whole as an Aboriginal person, a M\u00e9tis or First Nation. (NWS5, l.176) I would say maybe it's safe for me to be here because there's no bad people come around to you. You're in a hidden place. Just like birds, when they build a nest in the bushes mostly behind the leaves so we can't see them. They're protected, nobody's going to hurt them. That's how I feel when I'm in the bush. (NWS4, l.233) Participant discussion concerning people spanned a wide range of topics. Participants primarily talked about Elders and youth in relation to the interview questions. There was a general sense that Elders resident in a specific area may make themselves accessible to schools if re spectful protocol is observed and trusting relationships are developed (NWS3, l.86). Some Elders may not have the confidence to put t h e m s e l v e s f o r w a r d t o a s s i s t t e a c h e r s , b u t o v e r t i m e t h a t m a y c h a n g e ( N W S 5 , l . 5 9 ) . P a r t i c i p a n t s commented that Elders have t remendous amounts of information that they are usually willing to share with young people. This information is not written down but is only accessible through oral tradition (NWS3, l.82). Two participants commented that youth who have land -based experience s and knowledge achieve greater success in school on subjects related to science. These same students have an opportunity to be p r o u d o f t h e i r a b i l i t i e s o r e v e n b e r o l e m o d e l s i n f i e l d e x p e r i e n c e s ( N W S 9 , l . 1 4 6 ; N W S 7 , l . 3 0 0 ) . I t w a s generally acknowledged by participants that youth are disconnected from learning traditional knowledge or from having any significant land -b a s e d e x p e r i e n c e s b e c a u s e t h e s e a r e n o t p a r t o f s c h o o l curriculum. Identity was an important concept discussed in relation to learning Indig enous science. Two participants commented that the artistic parts of culture such as music and dance are important, but it is the connection to the land and knowledge of the land that is deeply important and meaningful to M\u00e9tis (NWS3, l.134; NWS8, l.48). O ne participant c om men te d that f or many kids, i t is li ke th ey are ' star ving fo r i d e n t i t y ' , l o o k i n g f o r a ' w a y o f b e i n g a l i v e ' a s a r e s u l t o f u r b a n l i f e s t y l e ( N W S 7 , l . 6 1 ) . A n o t h e r p a r t i c i p a n t commented that our increasingly diverse mixed -blood heritages expo se us to connections to many nations. It is difficult to discover what you connect to and feel comfortable with if the information and t e a c h i n g s o f y o u r o w n c u l t u r a l h i s t o r y a r e n o t a v a i l a b l e t o y o u . I t b e c o m e s a s e a r c h f o r i d e n t i t y t h a t i s fulfilled throu gh spiritual and ancestral teachings (NWS6, l.90). Participants felt that there should be no problem with learning what is currently taught in school as well as M\u00e9tis cultural land -based traditions (NWS4, l.261; NWS9, l.56). Participants acknowledged that the Residential School legacy of cultural oppression and concealment or shame of Aboriginal identity were still active barriers within education and discussed within all the interview dialogues. No participant dismissed the importance of traditional spiritual beliefs as relevant and important in understanding Indigenous science. Some participants explained part of their understanding o f spirituality was based on medicine wheel Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 93 teachings. Some participants explained part of their understanding of spirituality came directly from the land, but that it was acknowledged and accessed through protocols appropriate to their place. Some particip ants explained parts of their spiritual beliefs were based in Christianity and parts in traditional First Nations beliefs. One participant commented that in order for an educator to include spirituality in teaching, they must also practice those beliefs. O therwise, students will not take the spiritual teachings seriously or simply ignore them. Similarly, education authorities must fully accept that spirituality is part of cultural knowledge, including land -based knowledge. The spiritual component cannot be l e f t o u t o f what is being taught to young people. Spirituality is connected to everything just as science is connected to everything. It would be senseless to ignore this truth, and more seriously, ignoring spiritual connections within science would not al low the development of the whole person as they are learning (NWS9, l.100, l.104). All participants commented that many barriers exist preventing the inclusion of traditional spiritual beliefs within the context of school curriculum. A participant commente d that teachers need to learn Indigenous science skills and knowledge along side of students. In some cases, it would be preferable to have teachers trained in advance especially if it involves field trips (NWS8, l.158). Participants commented that school systems and decision -m a ke r s w ho lacked understanding about the spiritual nature of Indigenous knowledge would be barriers to supporting teachers and students in this regard. In other cases, finances dictate the ability to include land -based knowledge (NWS3 , l . 1 1 4 ; N W S 9 , l . 6 0 ; N W S 6 , l . 1 1 9 ) . P a r t i c i p a n t s c o m m e n t e d t h a t i t i s important for Aboriginal leadership and community members to voice their feelings that they want traditional knowledge included in school curriculum. Teaching through cultural traditions is a meaningful method of providing education. Much of the current curriculum is not relevant to Aboriginal students so it is very difficult for the students to connect to the curriculum and be successful learners. It was felt that traditional knowledge i s complete in itself and other kinds of science knowledge could compliment b u t s h o u l d n o t r e p l a c e t r a d i t i o n a l k n o w l e d g e s p e c i f i c t o p l a c e ( N W S 3 , l . 1 1 4 , l . 1 4 6 ; N W S 8 , l . 2 7 ; l . 5 2 ; NWS9, l.56). The concept of Place was described geographically as the area of y our home, community or political j u r i s d i c t i o n ( N W S 5 , l . 5 3 ) . I t w a s a l s o d e s c r i b e d a s w h e r e y o u a r e w h e n y o u f e e l s a f e , a t e a s e o r comfortable with your surroundings. One participant described the northern boreal forest as a place where he felt protected (N WS4, l.233, l.253). Others described having a strong sense of place where the language is alive, the traditional way of living is alive and people actively practice culture and traditions of land -b a s e d a c t i v i t i e s ( N W S 7 , l . 5 7 ) . C o n v e r s e l y , i t w a s f e l t t h a t people themselves deteriorate when they live in areas where the land is also not healthy and thriving. Urban environments force unnatural time scheduling, rigid flow of human activity, feel chaotic and generate a different energy than natural e n v i r o nm e nt s . Urban energy is not calmed, not soothing and is disruptive to feeling good (NWS6, l.32). Land You know, I can't jig, I can't play the fiddle, but I know a lot of stuff about how I'm here now, in terms of how to live off the lands, you know as a M\u00e9tis. (NWS3, l.134) It's really important. I don't know why they didn't do that anymore, they should have kept on doing it. It doesn't have to be just a [one] person that they take these kids out, it could be other people who takes the kids out for different thing s to learn different things, different ways, how to survive in the wild, like Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 94 fishing, trapping, building a cabin, or doing some hides, prepare hides, there's all kinds of different things that you can do out in the wild, out in the bush. And you have to take the kids right at the spot where you're doing that otherwise they won't know what you're talking about ... (NWS4, l.197) Participant discussion regarding the relationship of land to M\u00e9tis People was very diverse and complex. One participant explained th e importance of ethical interaction with the land. He described the need to carry out actions ethically, working for the best interests of all - not just you. He felt that the best way to do this is to ensure your actions are in line with those of the Crea t o r . B y w o r k i n g i n t h i s w a y , w e w o u l d not see disastrous situations with oil spills or land decimated from mining or forestry operations. He explained that we have a responsibility to maintain connections to the land that already exist to help you live, no t just exploit resources (NWS8, l.116). Another participant expanded on the need to work ethically by explaining that in traditional thought, every little thing has spirit. This includes water, trees and everything else we use. Recognizing the spiritual na ture of the land helps people understand how to interact with the land, including the application of traditional protocols such as tobacco offerings, and allows them to form a holistic worldview (NWS9, l.108). One participant described the enthusiasm of yo ung people to learn about other cultures. He believes that science education should be structured to accommodate this type of natural curiousity. This would be possible by initiating a course of learning that begins with place, knowing self and place, then expanding out to incorporate diverse geographical areas in Saskatchewan like the flat lands outside the boreal forest area, learning in the four directions of north, south, east and west, and expanding to learn provincially and beyond. The indicators of l earning that show meaningful understanding need to be linked to traditional value systems and skills such as cooperative living, traditional bush knowledge, respecting Elders and each other, survival skills, medicine plant knowledge, diverse ecosystems, protocols of place, respecting animal behaviour and cycles, spiritual ceremonies, traditional hunting, fishing and harvesting skills, traditional food processing skills, sharing and awareness of others needs (NWS9, l.108). This participant also felt that you ng people need to hear, see and experience that learning science is exciting and fulfilling. The study of science can easily be linked to cultural traditions and only a s mall part of th e study of scien ce ne eds to be learned fr om a b o ok. Mos t of i t can be l ea r n e d from real life experiences in the environment around them (NWS9, l.56). I t w a s f e l t t h a t E l d e r s h a v e t h e m o s t i m p o r t a n t f o r m s o f k n o w l e d g e n e e d e d b y y o u n g p e o p l e . T h e knowledge that Elders have about how to live and survive off the land has been pa ss e d do w n f ro m generation to generation. Even today, traditional knowledge has to be learned by experience over a long period of time, it cannot really be notated in a book because of its complexity and shifting nature. One participant provided an example i n k n o w i n g w h e n i t i s s a f e t o c r o s s t h e i c e o n a l o c a l l a k e . T h i s knowledge is impossible to write down because the answer is dependent on multiple factors that may t a k e y e a r s t o i d e n t i f y a n d c o n s i d e r w h e n m a k i n g t h e d e c i s i o n t o c r o s s t h e i c e . T h i s i s a b o ut respecting the Earth and what one learns from it (NWS9, l.15). The concept of land was not necessarily restricted to land per se . When participants began talking about land they also included discussion about water, sun, moon, clouds, rain and fire the challenge faced by educators in creating a science curriculum that could f a c i l i t a t e d i v e r s e g e o g r a p h i c a r e a s a n d c u l t u r e s . I t w a s f e l t t h a t t h e r e w o u l d b e a n e e d t o b e very creative and ensure that all students had an opportunity to learn about their own place as well as the Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 95 places of others. This might be accomplished through visual aids or video to overcome distance issues (NWS9, l.39). One participant commented that in spite of the fact that people appear different and speak different languages that it does not mean we can't work together. If we can successfully work together in partnerships, we enhance the well being of this province, of M\u00e9tis and the First Nations (NWS5, l.188). Languages and Traditions A culture is not only the language and all these other things, you know. Everything that you do, even how you talk to your Aboriginal brothers and sisters and your non -Aboriginal brothers and sisters, is part of the culture. You know, everything, how you look at the world around you, how you look at these things. (NWS8, l.108) ...science is not confi ned into one little spot of the province or one place, you know, we have to use science right across the whole province, t he whole country, the whole world. (NWS8, l.43) All the participants acknowledged the importance of language as an integral part of cultural identity. One participant explained that as a result of shame or desire to fit in with the non -Aboriginal populati on sometimes an individual will hide the fact that they can speak an Aboriginal language. This participant felt it illustrated how empty of self -worth an individual is if they are reduced to deliberately hiding their language. He explained that it became a responsibility of other Aboriginal language speakers to use their language at every opportunity, even if there was just one other speaker present (NWS3, l.150). Some participants acknowledged their mother tongue as Michif, but said they just call it Cree ( NW S3, l.158; NWS1, l.15, l.89; NWS2, l.73). One participant explained that during most of his life, the language w a s a l w a y s r e f e r r e d t o a s C r e e a n d i t h a s o n l y b e e n i n r e c e n t t i m e s t h a t p e o p l e h a v e c o m e t o c a l l t h e C r e e m i x e d w i t h F r e n c h a s M i c h i f ( N W S 3 , l.158). Other participants only ever referred to their language as Cree, and in some cases referred to them selves as Indian (NWS5, l.59; NWS4, l.128). This is important t o n o t e , a s i t d r a w s a t t e n t i o n t o t h e c o m m o n b o n d M \u00e9 t i s i n d i v i d u a l s f e e l w i t h C r e e People and l a n g u a g e . H o w e v e r , t h e l a c k o f c o m f o r t , f a m i l i a r i t y o r k n o w l e d g e t o b e a b l e t o i d e n t i f y o n e ' s o w n mother tongue may indicate the historic and continued oppression of M\u00e9tis culture and language. One participant indicated that it is up to M\u00e9tis People to retain the culture, language, past and current traditions. This is challenging and also needs to take into account the need to thrive in today's economy. In his view, ec ono mic sur vi val m eant the sur vival of y our famil y and to ok prec edent o ver al l other things (NWS5, l.59). Participants also noted that being proud of your culture and language and using it within society makes you personally, and the language, and the culture more proud and powerful (NWS3, l . 1 6 0 ; N W S 5 , l . 5 9 ) . O n e p a r t i c i p a n t f e l t t hat knowing their language would provide them with important bilingual skills for the future. He also felt that knowing multiple languages, as many from previous generations did, would be better than only having two languages. He felt that the white -man way of only having one language was insufficient to improved learning, relationship building, and teaching others (NWS4, l.128, l.137, l.149, l.157). Participants agreed that learning an Aboriginal language must begin at home at an early age (NWS3, l.168, NW S5, l.156, NWS1, l.106). They felt that culture, values and Aboriginal languages should be part of all social programming and curriculum; to experience otherwise was to experience cultural Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 96 deprivation in the same manner that Residential School s and foster homes encouraged cultural abandonment (NWS5, l.59, NWS4, l.177, NWS3, l.146). One participant also commented that trying to learn the thought [language and traditions] could begin with short periods of time in school, but must be continued outside the scho ol in the home and out on the land otherwise it would not be successful (NWS4, l.177). Participants recognized that there is a need to have Aboriginal language speakers as teachers and support persons (NWS2, l.97, NWS5, l.59). Discussion of cultural tradit ions was holistic and dynamic. Participants talked about traditions as being r o o t e d i n t h e n e e d t o s u r v i v e ( N W S 3 , l . 4 3 ; N W S 8 , l . 4 8 ) . I n t i m e s p a s t , t r a d i t i o n a l k n o w l e d g e w a s t h e means by which individuals coped with the hardships of their environment, deve loped value systems of sharing and helping each other, and taught next generations of people how to live in a similar way. One participant spoke about the extensive knowledge of Elders from the region. In one instance, these Elders were consulted in a seri es of interviews for regional environmental planning and the result was so successful that the project was used as a model for planning in other areas. The Elders spoke only from m e m o r y . T h e y d i d n o t u s e a n y w r i t t e n r e f e r e n c e s . Y e t , t h e E l d e r s w e r e a b l e t o accurately recall nesting sites of birds, historic burial sites of Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal persons in the north, who trapped in what areas, what furs were abundant in specific areas, the routes of creeks and impact on larger water bodies, best metho ds of transportation and travel routes (NWS3, l.45). One participant acknowledged that although he lives in the north and does know some things about traditional life, he felt that what he knew did not even a fraction of what Elders from one generation bac k knew and understood about the land (NWS8, l.146). One participant expressed the importance of re -introducing traditional knowledge to adult and young generations of M\u00e9tis to ensure it continues to be used, and is not lost (NWS3, l.102). One participant n oted that kids who avoid school, but attend at times when there are outdoor activities s h o u l d b e a m e s s a g e t o u s ( N W S 3 , l . 6 1 ) . T h e s e s t u d e n t s m a y n o t b e s u c c e s s f u l a t a c a d e m i c s o r b o o k learning but they may have exceptional skills from living on the land w ith their grandparents and thrive w h e n t h e y h a v e t h e o p p o r t u n i t y t o b e l e a d e r s i n t h i s r e g a r d ( N W S 8 , l . 1 4 6 ) . S o m e k i d s a r e n o t comfortable in the outdoors and want to have their technology along with them. This is not necessarily a bad thing but should be limited and could be negotiated with students and parents (NWS8, l.88). It is important to find ways that young people can have fun in the outdoors, and that it is not a negative experience. Young people will figure out the best way of solving problems and having fun doing it. These positive experiences create good memories carried throughout life (NWS3, l.102, NWS8, l.60, l . 1 4 6 , l . 1 9 2 ; N W S 7 , l . 2 7 ) . S o m e o f t h e p a r t i c i p a n t s f e l t t h a t s o m e o f t h e m a t h a n d h i s t o r y c o n t e n t currently taught in schools was simp ly inappropriate in that it replaced local knowledge that should have had priority (NWS3, l.114; NWS8, l.52). Participants talked extensively about barriers to the integration of language and culture within society. They identified the transition away fro m t r a d i t i o n a l w a y s o f k n o w i n g a s a r e s u l t o f s u c h t h i n g s a s t h e telephone, highways, power, other forms of technology and western education (NWS3, l.102; NWS8, l.52). No participant indicated that they would rather live without these things, but recognized t he adverse impact they had on M\u00e9tis language and traditions. Rather, participants talked about the need to continue to move forward, and, with the support of Aboriginal leadership and the broader Aboriginal communities, to insist on having M\u00e9tis language and traditions incorporated into mainstream p r o g r a m m i n g ( N W S 5 , l . 5 9 ; N W S 3 , l . 1 0 2 ) . I n o r d e r t o a c c o m p l i s h t h i s , o n e p a r t i c i p a n t e x p l a i n e d t h a t i t i s necessary to have school superintendents and teachers who are willing and able to do this. Racism from educated people was felt to be one of the biggest barriers to inclusion of Aboriginal traditional cultures (NWS3, l.114). Other barriers identified included educating highest level decision -makers within Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 97 education about the importance of including traditional knowledge, and similarly, undoing past oppression and convincing many Aboriginal Peoples also that sustaining their culture into the future is important. Political activity by Aboriginal leadership was seen as an important facet of making change. Social Environment We started this thing by signing a consent form and the idea of the consent is that you know you're being responsible to us and ... to your leaders. When they put the tobacco down they're just taking all the paperwork out of it and being responsi ble to who's most important, our Creator, and never mind all the paper and legal mumbo jumbo. You have to be responsible to the Creator. And, if it's sincere, then you're doing it right. But if you're putting tobacco down and you're not really caring about the things that you're taking from the earth, you'll know it and you'll carry that weight with you. It's kinda like a, I would imagine, it's a social stigma you would carry with you personally. You can't escape anything you do in this world. (NWS8, l.92) They have to know what was here or what is here now, and it has to be into the school 's curriculum, M\u00e9tis, we are here. (NWS3, l.146) The social environment of teachers, learners, communities and nations was described throughout participant interviews. K nowing the social environment, or place, was an important factor in knowing how to proceed with teaching and learning. One participant talked about the Canadian social environment with increasing numbers of diverse peoples emigrating from other countries, the rapid increase of the M\u00e9tis population, and the need to ensure that school curriculum is helping all learners to know about this country from the perspective of the M\u00e9tis (NWS3, l.146). One participant commented working for personal economic financial development, as opposed to personal social development, is insufficient for human beings. Deeper nourishment is required otherwise a person will never feel satisfied with their life (NWS8, l.176). One participant commented that all social programming nee d s t o t a k e i n t o a c c o u n t M \u00e9 t i s c u l t u r e a n d values. The interrelatedness of social development, economic development and well -being can be difficult for individuals to navigate. Often, individuals will distance themselves from Elder's teachings because they find them incompatible with economic or academic environments. Even Elders themselves will often be reluctant to participate in social programming, feeling that their knowledge is not valued since it has been neglected by society over such a long period of time. Yet, if we can overcome restrictive policy that limits Aboriginal Peoples participation, integration within systems can occur and we can succeed in learning from each other (NWS5, l.59). There was recognition that school budgets create unnatural bar riers between Elders and young people. Teachers wishing to invite Elders to help them teach in a variety of subject areas through storytelling and developing a sense of place within the learners may find themselves unable to have Elders come in because sc h o o l s h a v e n o t b u d g e t e d f o r t h i s ( N W S 6 , l . 1 7 6 ) . I n a s i m i l a r r e g a r d , o n e p a r t i c i p a n t commented that even though there are numerous Aboriginal teachers graduating from post -secondary education they are not able to find employment in urban centres where the majority of Aboriginal youth reside. Increasing numbers of Aboriginal youth engaging in destructive social behaviour, including gang membership, is related to the absence of fostering healthy cultural identity. This participant inferred Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 98 resulting negative media backlash against the Aboriginal community did not take into consideration barriers experienced by Aboriginal educators in finding employment in urban settings (NWS7, l.61). Physical Environment Well, what I really think is it should be appreciation o f the environment that you're in. Now, that could apply to the beautiful north here or the environment that is surrounded in the south. But, irregardless where you are, we tend to adjust ourselves to the environment that you're in. And that, I think , is one of the big things that we should, that Aboriginal science should , be at. Because, you know, we could talk about a lot of things, a lot of topics. But at the same time we have to give the students, we have to give the people , a chance to adjust to the env ironment that they're in and take advantage of using the people that have been here for generations and generations. (NWS9, l.124) These are the things that I know. Wake up in the morning and make some tea and in the camp fire outside, it doesn't have to be inside. These are the things that I love doing, that I like doing, that's me. But, if you take people from that environment, through whatever it means, education, Residential School , whatever. We've lost because if you look back, if they have introduced and respected our culture, we wouldn't have lost it. I haven't lost it but my kids have to a certain degree. (NWS5, l.176) Participants talked about the need for individuals to adapt to whatever physical or geographical environment they were living in by learning from Elder generations resident in that particular area (N WS9, l.12 4; N WS 8, l. 62, l .180 ). T w o parti cipants talk ed about th e i mpor tance o f kno wing h ow to mak e transitions between northern and urban environments to ensure personal survival. These t ransitions include adapting to a fast urban pace of life and being aware of issues related to personal safety resulting from being among large groups of people and unfamiliar terrain (NWS3, l.27; NWS4, l.213, l.225). One participant described how important observational skills are in northern living when living in close proximity to the bush and wildlife. Consequently, developing observational skills can contribute to the development of spirituality, especially if science and other teachers are enjoying fac ilitating student interaction with the natural world (NWS9, l.166). It was also acknowledged that curriculum is not necessarily transferable among different geographical locations. The specific environment one is in will dictate what topics are relevant. B ut, this participant also described the concept of science as transcending physical life, and the study of life needing to acknowledge that. He believed it is important for educators and resource people to help young people understand there are other posit ive forces they can learn about, the importance and value of Elder's knowledge, and to view their whole environment and understand what is available to them. As well, educators have a responsibility and accountability to community members to ensure what t hey are teaching is meaningful and relevant (NWS9, l.180, l.192). Economic Environment Never mind personal social development, it's always about personal economic financial development, and that, as a person and a human being, that's not enough. You can't be happy living like that, you'll always be struggling to find something more. (NWS8, l.176) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 99 I want to be a part of something in social development, economic development, the well being of our people, the well being of community, family. So, it's important not to be closed in, it's important to be open and to grow... It's not that we want to let go of our identity, it's just that we're saying we want to work with people that are developing ... there's so many different things happening and yet we fall short of being a part of or benefiting from what's going on ... (NWS5, l.53) Participants acknowledged the importance of being able to make a living in order to support themselves and their remained a sense of understanding the need to retain a sense of balance with traditional value systems. One participant talked about commercial harvesting practices bei ng an important traditional practice of h i s p a r e n t ' s l i v e s . H e w a s a b l e t o p a r t i c i p a t e i n t h i s p r a c t i c e g r o w i n g u p ( N W S 3 , l . 4 3 ) . L e a r n i n g t h e traditional practices of commercial harvesting instilled values and knowledge were carried on into his adult life, even though he did not make a living doing the same kinds of activities that his father did. One participant described the unpreparedness of young people to make informed decisions about their future participation in mineral resource development as a dir ect result of short -comings in curriculum. The participant felt that school curriculum did not provide adequate opportunity to develop personal and cultural value systems. For this reason actions ultimately lead to environmental damage and individuals aim lessly seeking, and not finding, fulfillment through western type lifestyles (NWS8, l.176). Another participant described the grief felt as a result of living in northern Saskatchewan and not being a b l e t o b e o u t o n t h e l a n d b e c a u s e h e c o u l d n o t a f f o r d t h e items needed to survive on the land. This participant felt a great connection to the land and wanted to include traditional practices within his life b u t f e l t p o w e r l e s s t o o v e r c o m e t h e e c o n o m i c b a r r i e r . A s a r e s u l t , a l c o h o l b e c a m e a d e s t r u c t i v e f o r c e i n hi s l i f e f o r s o m e t i m e ( N W S 7 , l . 8 0 ) . O n e o f t h e p a r t i c i p a n t s d e s c r i b e d a s i m i l a r s i t u a t i o n o f t h e e c o n o m i c barrier to traditional land use, but was able to access family support to overcome this barrier. She described how she developed a real sense of who s he was by spending time on the land with her father (NWS6, l.82). Two of the participants described the school economic environment as a barrier to learning traditional knowledge. Often there is insufficient funding to access equipment or to compensate Eld ers appropriately (NWS7, l.188; NWS6, l.119). Beyond school concerns, one participant described how traditional knowledge is taken from Elders by resource developers in consultation processes, but there is no reciprocal value returned to the Elders once th e resource is developed (NWS7, l.190). Yet, it was understood that many Elders are supporting their children and grandchildren financially and no longer have a means of generating any revenue from the land. The Elders often participate in consultations and workshops as a means of supporting themselves (NWS6, l.210; NWS7, l.218). One participant commented that participation in the economy was extremely important for individuals, communities, and for M\u00e9tis People . Participation in economic development activit ies would ensure personal survival for individuals and maximize opportunities for future generations of M\u00e9tis that otherwise might be missed. This participant acknowledged that identity and traditional value systems are important, but different, factors in holistic personal development and holistic systemic or community development. He felt that holistic personal development was about healing and self -wo r t h whereas holistic systemic or community development was about social development and the integration of various sectors such as economic, education, recreation and justice systems (NWS5, l.91). Political Environment Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 100 ...we are important and we want to be in the curriculum . (NWS3, l.146) The idea of teaching and learning within a political environment was discussed as an important facet of education. Participant commented that M\u00e9tis leadership and political rights provided an important way of demonstrating pride in your cultural identity. They felt that pressure from Aboriginal leadership and communities is needed to let others know that Aboriginal knowledge and culture are important and A b o r i g i n a l P e o p l e s w a n t i t p u t i n t o c u r r i c u l u m , b o o k s a n d s y s t e m s ( N W S 1 , l . 2 2 8 ; N W S 3 , l . 1 1 4 , l . 1 4 6 , l.150, l.160). One participant expressed his concern that too often research studies were undertaken in northern Saskatchewan and never accomplished anything useful beyond just being another study . These past experiences over fifty years created a sense of ap prehension in sharing opinions or knowledge by local community members (NWS9, l.19). Spirituality You know, I enjoy the environment. Now, if we can get our teachers, our science people, doesn't matter kind of, what subject your teaching, get them in that kind of environment where they enjoy going out to the bush, doing all these things, you know. Man, the kids are going to pick up on it and all that whole thing I just talked about, that's spirituality. Its how you perceive to see yourself in that situation , how you want to see yourself in your place ... (NWS9, l.166) Our society is becoming very materialistic and very greedy. There's no spiritual sense for the majority of people that exist on our planet today. The spiritual side is slowly depleting from the re al sense of spirituality ...But you know, this is it, we lack spiritually, it's lacking in the schools. There's no sense of spirituality in this school, maybe a little tiny portion, but we need to teach our kids, like I say, as soon as they hit the school, ab out their own spirituality. (NWS1, l.192) The interview participants referred to spiritual beliefs as an integral part of living a balanced and harmonious life. Some of the participants talked about spirituality as being based in medicine wheel teachings ( N W S 5 , l . 6 7 ; N W S 1 , l . 1 9 2 ; N W S 9 , l . 1 0 0 ) . O n e p a r t i c i p a n t t a l k e d a b o u t s p i r i t u a l i t y a s a n intangible quality emerging from a connection with the land itself. There is a need to begin with even a small belief by the teacher that by going out onto the land, obs erving the land and using a holistic approach to teaching and learning they can be successful in their teaching. Teachers need to believe in their students and the things that students are capable of doing. This participant felt that if a teacher does not want to integrate land -based experiences a negative feeling is generated and it will impact the teacher, learners and also the Elders involved (NWS9, l.166). One participant held both Christian and traditional spiritual beliefs. This participant described a process of continuous learning and application of both belief systems, sometimes switching among belief systems and sometimes combining the belief s y s t e m s t o i l l u s t r a t e a p o i n t w i t h i n t h e i n t e r v i e w ( N W S 1 , l . 1 9 2 ) . T h i s p a r t i c i p a n t a l s o c o m m e n t e d o n being mocked by colleagues for openly displaying spirituality (NWS1, l.410). Another participant commented on the policy decision -makers only making a superficial effort to include spiritual beliefs in formal education (NWS9, l.104). There was no consensus on wh o should teach spirituality or where it should be taught. Some participants felt that it was inappropriate for teachers to attempt this (NWS9, l.104); others felt that it should be integrated into the school (NWS1, l.192). Participant comments showed that there is a general apprehension or uncertainty about including spirituality in education, yet all agreed that it is a key part of living in connection with culture and tradition. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 101 Health You can't learn everything from the book. The teachers are there to te ach kids, they use books, but when you go out there in the bush it's totally different what you tell in the books and what you tell if they see that thing. It's different. (NWS4, l.426) The land to me is rich with everything and if you don't have that th an you see them just crumbling as people. (NWS6, l.32) The participants talked about health care as originating with the health of the earth, learning how to use traditional medicines, living in a respectful way and passing on knowledge so that others can b e he a l t hy also. Participants expressed a wish for stereotypes to be broken down regarding teaching and learning traditional cultural practices within science education (NWS7, l.236; NWS8, l.88; NWS9, l.100). One participant shared stories about two Abori ginal women who were midwives in northern Saskatchewan. These women provided health care to hundreds of women in the region, delivering babies, providing traditional medicines and teaching correct use of medicines. There was also a willingness to teach th e medicinal plant knowledge to others if proper protocols were respected and trusting relationships were developed. There was an understanding that some of the medicines were extremely dangerous, or lethal, and so only certain people would prove to have th e skills necessary to work with medicinal plants (NWS3, l.86). Participants commented that it is important to have many different forms of life and to understand biodiversity and knowledge diversity. Being too reliant upon one type of knowledge is simila r to not honouring the diversity within ecosystems (NWS8, l.72; NWS9, l.180). Participants talked about their fear of pollution. One participant mentioned that northern Saskatchewan is becoming polluted and feared that polluted medicines would affect the E lders and children using them (NWS6, l.11; NWS8, l.76). Follo wing pro to cols was d e em ed t o be a corne rst one of h ealth care. F or m ost p articipants, the first st ep in any protocol is to demonstrate respect (NWS3, l.82). It was also mentioned that when young people are taken out into the field to learn about medicines they need to understand that only the Elders should actually touch the plants as teachings are being shared (NWS8, l.88). If someone such as a teacher does not know about traditional spiritual te achings, approaching the situation respectfully will take them in the right direction. Including the opportunity for young people to learn spiritual beliefs is a n i m p o r t a n t p a r t o f d e v e l o p i n g a h o l i s t i c s c i e n c e e d u c a t i o n . H o w e v e r , t h e t e a c h e r m u s t a l s o p r a ctice w h a t t h e y a r e t e a c h i n g k i d s . I f t h e t e a c h e r i s n o t f o l l o w i n g w h a t t h e y a r e t e a c h i n g t h e y w o n ' t f e e l g o o d about themselves, and the kids will see that and not learn what is being taught (NWS9, l.176). Health and healing were talked about as directly related to identity and respecting cultural practices. Participants described a healthy life as one that was connected to the Creator, the earth, your own spirituality, absence of blaming others, peacefulness and respectful interaction with other nation s encountered throughout life (NWS1, l.192, l.394; NWS7, l.82). One participant commented that it is important to respect protocols but also to be considerate of all nations. Two participants spoke specifically about medicine wheel teachings and how they f acilitate human development throughout life. This was considered to be essential to building a healthy life in learning about self, where you come from, what has happened in the past, establishing personal boundaries, how to build a perspective to Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 102 feeling good about yourself and building respect and trust (NWS5, l.67; NWS1, l.394). Other participants talked about learning how to have a healthy life by being out on the land learning medicines and traditional skills (NWS4, l.342, l.402; NWS6, l.32, NWS7, l.23 6). One participant commented that young children should participate full time in traditional activities for a whole year in order to establish a base for future participation in cultural activities (NWS5, l.176). Balance One element that's missing to balance their lives is spirituality. It's not there. So how can they know what's right and wrong, if they don't have no sense of spirituality? Even us as individuals, if I don't have God in my life ...I wouldn't be balanced. I'd be off balance because there' s some element that's missing. Because you have to look at yourself on your physical, emotional, spiritual and mental. If you can't balance your life that way, there's something wrong, you don't survive. (NWS1, l.204) A lot of people have different persp ectives of medicine. The medicine wheel has these different colors. But each community has their different colors. But a medicine to me is when you have a headache, you take a pill. A medicine wheel in regards to what you want is a medicine to be able to c orrect you or work with you, to understand you, what hurts you and why is it that you can't get away from this hurt. (NWS5, l.67) Throughout the interviews with M\u00e9tis participants, the importance of having a balanced life was spoken about both directly and indirectly. Since the dialogue was focused on the education of M\u00e9tis youth, participants began with responding in that regard but extended their comments to include youth and adults generally. Participants expressed a wish that their children and grandchi ldren would have balanced lives (NWS5, l.69; NWS4, l.253 -2 5 9 ; N W S 1 , l . 2 1 6 ) . T h e d y n a m i c s o f l i v i n g a b a l a n c e d l i f e emerged in a number of different ways. One participant felt that respecting the choices youth make is v e r y i m p o r t a n t , e v e n i f t h o s e c h o i c e s l ead them away from the fragile threads parents are able to provide to culture and tradition. The premise of the medicine wheel teachings infers choice but one has to find it themselves. It is difficult for young people and adults to have the things contemp orary life offers and remain connected to traditions (NWS5, l.69). One participant felt that M\u00e9tis youth need to be exposed to traditional teaching of life on the land by others in the community. This would provide a model that would encourage them to stay in their local northern community and not get involved with people who would have a negative influence on them. This participant felt that this was really the only way that M\u00e9tis youth should be taught (NWS4, l.253). One participant felt that the absence of spirituality in the lives of youth was the most disruptive factor in having a balanced life. The participant felt that having a balanced life meant inclusion of the domains of the medicine wheel teachings including mental, physical, spiritual and emotio nal aspects of self -development. Respecting this balance would ensure personal survival (NWS1, l.204). Harmony Over hundreds and hundreds of years, a lot of our people, not only here in this region, but all over the north ...wherever Indigenous people are they lived in harmony with their environment that they were in. The funny thing about it, if I Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 103 was to go ask the Elders around here about it ...like when do you ...cross the ice, all those other things, all those factors coming in, they would sit there and laugh at me. Because, over the years they've learned this is passed on from generation to generation ; how to live and survive off the land , the things that they have to do for them in order for them to go from one season to the other . It's just something that we know . It's not things that's written down, you know '3:45 on a Friday - this is a good time to cross the ice '. All those things. They have that respect with the earth, with Mother Nature and environment . So they know and it has been taught to them over the years . (NWS9, l.15) I don't personally believe that people in the north are really being considered with respect to education or science, because they [youth] can't make the connections that are provided or presented in curriculum to their everyday lif e. (NWS8, l.27) Understanding the concept of harmony was spoken about by interview participants as a matter of demonstrating an understanding and respect for the environment, protocols and traditions practiced by previous generations of local people. One p articipant explained how taking young people out onto the land provides the opportunity for them to learn traditional teachings from local Elders of the protocols of offering tobacco, the life cycles of animals, harvesting knowledge and other things indivi dual learners may wonder about during the course of the experience on the land (NWS9, l.88). One participant explained that trust and respect are part of protocol and that Elders will observe you in order to decide whether you have gained their confidence and trust. Only after a trust relationship is formed the Elders may teach you what they know about certain things. If the Elder is uncertain, they may ask someone else about you, or ask someone to find out more about you (NWS3, l.82 -86). This infers that t he protocol of trust -building extends beyond the people directly within the teacher -learner relationship to include others within the spheres of the teacher's life and the learner's life. Other participants talked about v a r i o u s f o r m s o f r e s p e c t t h a t h a v e b een absent from the education system and society in general. One participant commented that it is important for teachers to show respect for all nations of people by thinking critically about how they assess students. The teacher needs to know where the st udent came from and something about the student's culture in order not to make inappropriate assessments about the student's abilities (NWS5, l.67 -91). The same participant commented that if the system can enhance the confidence of Aboriginal Peoples, there will be a greater respect for the system by Aboriginal P e o p l e s ( N W S 5 , l . 1 6 8 ) . A l l o f t h e i n t e r v i e w p a r t i c i p a n t s t a l k e d a b o u t t h e c u r r e n t g e n e r a t i o n o f y o u t h lacking the traditional knowledge which wo uld contribute to harmonious relationships with others and with the natural world. Participants structured their stories and comments around traditional teachings they learned from grandparents, and acknowledged that many adults and most youth no longer li ve t h e s e t e a c h i n g s , o r e v e n k n o w t h e t e a c h i n g s , a s a r e s u l t o f t h e d i s c o n n e c t i o n f r o m f i r s t -hand experiences on the land and to the traditional teachers. Values If you do assessment based on a culture, the values, the identity, you have a totally different curriculum. (NWS5, l.91) ...that whole idea is nothing new to the people in northern Saskatchewan or for the Aboriginal People for that matter. Because we had ... to use that for a long, Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 104 long time, since as far back as anybody can remember and anything is recorded. The final outcome is, you know, going back into the whole idea about traditional values and those kinds of things. Those had to be used in order for you, and the things and the process of getting there is what they call the indicators now. (NWS9, l . 88) The participants did not attempt to define the concept of values. Rather, throughout the course of the interview process, participants described stories, personal experiences and their own understanding of lifelong learning in relation to place, cult ure and traditions. Each participant had a unique set of experiences that formed their own value system, but also acknowledged throughout their stories where contemporary life created divergences from traditional M\u00e9tis life on a trapline, use of original l anguages, social and economic well -being of individuals and families, and respect for Elders, traditional medicinal k n o w l e d g e , a n i m a l s a n d h a r v e s t i n g p r a c t i c e s ( N W S 5 , l . 4 7 , l . 5 5 ; N W S 3 , l . 8 6 , l . 1 3 4 ; N W S 7 , l . 1 2 , N W S 4 , l.128). In this regard, the participants spoke from common understandings of cultural practices even though they were from different communities, were different ages, genders, and had no knowledge of what other participants said. One participant questioned how much M\u00e9tis culture and values unive rsities are carrying to be able to teach university students, including Aboriginal university students (NWS5, l.59). Additional Concepts of Importance to M\u00e9tis Teaching Throughout the interviews, participants talked about teaching as a means of cultural retention and transmission. For example, Elders teach, teachers teach, parents teach, we teach each other, etc. and by teaching others we learn also (NWS5, l.115; NWS3, l.152). When we lose the parental ability to teach through traditional activities it is a s acrifice f or childr en's opp ortunity f or c areer (N WS5, l. 15 6). L earning through teaching is a concept that is not necessarily explicitly depicted on the M\u00e9tis Holistic Lifelong Learning Model. Pedagogy There's a continuum of teaching/ learning, where learning with the most impact is doing is out there doing camps or doing other experiential things with Elders and traditional land users. I f y o u c a n ' t d o that, t he next best thing is to have Elders in to teach directly through their storie s. If you can't have that then telling stories that you've heard from Elders . Finally, if you can't do that, then you're sort of just stuck with book stuff (NWS8, l.150). It is also important to recognize that if you are out on the land, trying to teach to o many learners at once will be unsuccessful. The learners need to be close to the teacher and to what is being shown otherwise they will not get the full information and lose interest (NWS4, l.201). Traditional Activities There are many science concepts a nd technical skills that can be learned from traditional activities. For example, canoeing, hunting, camping and fishing are activities that most young people would enjoy. Educators could identify the physics, chemistry, biological, geological or other sc ience concepts or skills that students could learn. Methods of learning should be fun as well as educational. Methods of Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 105 learning should be appropriate to culture and place. For example, construction of a M\u00e9tis -style sled could be used in l.134; NWS4, l.60; l.92; NWS8, l.62). Intergenerational Learning Elders could also be teaching adults together with the young people learning traditional skills or knowledge. Many adults do not have the language or traditional knowledg e (NWS3, l.152). Story T h e u s e o f s t o r y i s v e r y i m p o r t a n t a s a t e a c h i n g t o o l . T e a c h e r s t o r i e s , E l d e r s t o r i e s a n d s t u d e n t s t o r i e s are all important. Stories can be funny but teach very serious lessons about your own culture, the cultures of others and cultu re-clashes (NWS9, l.166). Attention should be paid to the use of metaphor in stor y. In one st or y t old, the rol e of m other within a fa mily unit is sh own as a met aphor f or m other ear th. If mother is not happy everyone suffers. If mother is happy everyone is happy (NWS9, l.192). Oral Tradition Stories were told about the remarkable memory that traditional land users had. Detailed descriptions of events, places, transportation routes and historical information were all held in memory. Even years later, traditi onal land users are able to recall the information (NWS3, l.49). Adapting Technology One participant felt that contemporary technology should be used to preserve traditional knowledge. Elders could be video taped demonstrating something so new generations of people could learn some things (NWS9, l.68). One participant felt that parents need to spend more time with their children to intervene and regulate the types of programming viewed by their children (NWS4, l.285). Assessment & Self -Reflection Traditio nal forms of assessment were based on readiness of the child as determined by the parents or o t h e r r e l a t i v e s . T h e c h i l d a l s o h a d a r o l e i n a s s e s s m e n t i n k n o w i n g t h e i r o w n s k i l l l e v e l o r l i m i t a t i o n s i n relation to practical tasks. For example, using a fire a r m a t a y o u n g a g e w a s a n a p p r o p r i a t e w a y t o l e a r n hunting skills. Safety skills were learned along side of the practical activity (NWS3, l.67, l.69). Teaching traditional activities would provide a means of encouraging successful learning of other subject s as well s u c h a s m a t h a n d l a n g u a g e a r t s ( N W S 9 , l . 1 4 6 ; N W S 6 , l . 1 2 7 ; N W S 7 , l . 2 7 2 ) . C u r r e n t l y , w ith tests and indicators, educators require instant evaluation. With learning traditional knowledge, it spans lifetimes and so the whole scale is different. A per son goes through phases of learning not specifically time related, but readiness related . There is no shame in being older and learning something that somebody younger might know. It's wherever you are. Some people talk about that as place . For example you're at a certain place in your life where you're ready to learn this or that and maybe a year earlier you weren't ready (NWS9, l.146) . Assessment also requires consideration of how the learner's family is structured and how it has evolved (NWS5, l.140). Multiple Ways of Knowing Understanding a variety of systems and the benefits and consequences of each is an important part of making good decisions. For example, heavy reliance on western science in mining or harvesting may Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 106 result in depletion of resources that we cannot recover from. This is a way of understanding stress on systems and what happens when they break down (NWS8, l.72). Another way of thinking about this concept is how women and men use available knowledge. One participant expressed t hat his wife felt it w a s v e r y i m p o r t a n t f o r w o m e n t o h a v e t h e s a m e s k i l l s t h a t m e n h a v e i n o r d e r t o e n s u r e t h e s u r v i v a l o f their families. In the event of the death of a husband, or at times of being alone, a woman has to be able to fend for herself and he r children (NWS4, l.277, l.326). Goals of Science Some participants suggested we need to ask what the goals of science are and whose science has what goals. They believe that since the word s cience is a western word, it drags you in that direction. Further, it was felt that k ey goals of western science are military application, commercialization, profit generation, industry, consumerism, capitalism. Some participants described t h e g o a l s o f a n Indigenous science as about c onnecting the generations and learning your culture and history (NWS8, l.112; NWS9, l.124). Another participant described science as the family, a sense of belonging , su r v iv a l , k no w i n g w ho you are, what you are, where you come from (NWS5, l.127). Curriculum Although goals of science c urriculum can remain common, we need additional research into how holistic Aboriginal science curriculum can be customized to place. We need to consider w hat happens when it's implemented in urban centre s, the north or in rural Saskatchewan . There needs to be m o r e d i a l o g ue about the concept of learning from place. Subsequently, we need to consider how a customized curriculum can be shared with other learners outside the area so they can learn those things too. Kids need to love learning about science from a rich and exciting curriculum. Educators who love science s h o u l d b e r o l e m o d e l s i n t h i s r e g a r d f o r s t u d e n t s ( N W S 9 , l . 8 8 , l . 9 0 , l . 1 4 6 ) . Inappropriate or irrelevant curriculum that ultimately contributes to student failure does not serve anyone's needs. For example, trying to evaluate students on curriculum that is not northern specific is frustrating and time -consuming for the teacher and does not facilitate reaching objectives of curriculum, evaluation or students (NWS8, l.176). Time Teachers are bound by time factors and cannot always include the kinds of traditional teachings they w o u l d l i k e t o i n c l u d e . C o l l e c t i n g r e s o u r c e s o v e r a f e w y e a r s b e c o m e s a c r i t i c a l e l e m e n t i n t e a c h i n g i n areas where there are limited resources available (NWS9, l.192). Students also need adequate time to observe and practice what they have learned. If teachers are impatient the learner will lose interest and g i v e u p . A s w e l l , i f a l e a r n e r i s n o t i n t e r e s t e d t h e y w i l l b e c o m e a d i s t r a c t i o n t o t h o s e w h o d o w a n t t o learn (NWS4, l.108; l.116). Teaching and learning a language is also influenced by time. Including it in curriculum once weekly is not enough. A person cannot learn that way (NWS4, l.173). Recovering from Grief and Loss Rec ove ry is par t of health, but stori es of g rief and l o ss, including the loss of traditional knowledge within families, was of significant impact that participants took time to describe the permeation of those e x p e r i e n c e s t h r o u g h o u t t h e i r l i v e s ( N W S 1 , l . 7 ; N W S 3 , l . 6 9 ; N W S 5 , l . 9 1 , l . 1 1 5 ; N W S 7 , l . 7 2 ; N W S 9 , l . 1 4 6 ). Recognizing the source of pain is important in making choices for the future, connecting to cultural Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 107 sources of healing and motivation to change aspects of your life through reconciliation (NWS5, l.184; NWS4, l.52). Humour There were wonderful moment s of humour shared during some of the interviews. Although it is extremely difficult to cite a situation where the interviewer and participant(s) erupted into laughter over the double meaning of a response, good -natured teasing, uncertainty of responses, a good rant or other exchanges, the act of sharing laughter brings a richness and warmth to the discussion that brings it to life. The use of humour was not something talked about specifically, but it was a part of all participant interviews. In talking abo ut childhood pastimes, one participant commented, \" A h , w e u s e d t o h a v e a b i g tv, oh a big one. My dad bought it for twenty -two muskrats \" (NWS4, l.293; l.480). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 108 5.3 Learning Indigenous Science from Place: Pre -Service Teacher Perspectives LACK OF RESOURCES AND MATERIALS One of the most common challenges identified by participants in implementing First Nations content in school science is the lack of community -based resources, materials, and general information. T h e r e a r e a l o t o f t e a c h e r s w h o a r e n o n -Abori ginal and so I think they struggle with this because t h e y d o n ' t h a v e a l o t o f k n o w l e d g e i n t h a t a r e a . T he r e a re n o r e s o u r c e s a n d t e x t b o o k s . Y ou c o u l d c a l l i n a n E l d e r , b u t t h a t i s n o t a l w a y s e a s y t o d o . S o i t w o u l d b e v e r y g o o d t o d o c u m e n t t h e teachings an d practices so that it is available to all teachers. (H, S, 1. 1) While taking the kids out on the land is important, schools need the equipment for the teachers to be a b l e t o d o t h i s . \" I t i s r e a l l y h a r d t o f i n d t h e r e s o u r c e s . L e t ' s s a y I a m f r o m t h e n o r th and I want to teach i n t h e o l d w a y s w i t h a n i m a l s o r w h a t e v e r . Y o u n e e d t h e r e s o u r c e s l i k e b o a t s a n d c a n o e s . W h e r e w o u l d you get the money to buy these? Someone needs to be in charge of that\" (M, S, 1. 2). This participant w e n t o n t o s t a t e , \" T h e r e i s a need for books. Especially when you are incorporating storytelling in your lessons. I notice that a lot of the books and stories are from years ago and we need a lot more than what we have\" (M, S, 1. 3). ELDER INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOL SCIENCE A common strateg y shared by the participants is the importance of Elders perspectives in school science. \"One of the supports, that teachers need is more stories from Elders. There are so many Elders out t h e r e w h o h a v e n ' t h a d a v o i c e . I f w e e a c h g e t a s t o r y f r o m a n E l d e r about something that we actually learned growing up that we didn't realize we were taught. It would be nice to bring that out\" (M, S, 1. 3). She said, \"If you don't feel comfortable teaching a particular aspect of Indigenous knowledge, then one strategy is to bring in an Elder\" (M, S, 1. 12). SPIRITUALITY IN SCHOOL SCIENCE Spirituality is an inseparable aspect of Indigenous cultures. While Indigenous knowledge systems are d i v e r s e a n d c o m p l e x , i t i s d i f f i c u l t f o r t e a c h e r s t o i n c o r p o r a t e t h o s e a s p e c t s t h a t have a heavy emphasis on spirituality. \"I think a lot of Aboriginal teachings have a spiritual component. It's a real difficult area to get into especially in the Catholic schools where they have their own beliefs on Christianity. And in the Public school system, just how do you incorporate that without offending anyone who has different b e l i e f s \" ( H , S , 1 . 2 ) . O n e o f t h e f e a r s m a n y t e a c h e r s f a c e i s t h e i s s u e o f n o n -native people passing on Indigenous knowledge. Some community members may also struggle with this issue particularly if teachers are not from that particular culture ( H, S, 1. 11). INCORPORATING A BALANCE OF ACADEMIC AND FUN ACTIVITIES Learning standard Western science has often been perceived as a serious academic pursuit with a lot of rigorous m ental learning. Rigorous mental learning was also very important for Indigenous Peoples , b ut there was always balance with fun, humour, and laughter. In contemporary times, many students are often turned away from going into sciences because there is no fu n in memorizing a lifeless body of facts Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 109 and where there is too much emphasis on rote memory learning. In this story, one of the participants talked about being in a conference where they were required to develop a fun activity in science. One of the pro f e s s i o n a l s w h o w a s i n t h e r o o m h a d a t e m p e r t a n t r u m i n t h e r o o m . T h a t p e r s o n said, 'I don't know why you people insist that science is fun, science is not fun, science is hard work and you never get anywhere if you just think you are have there to have fun '. And so she had this meltdown in the room and she packed up her stuff and walked out. That's too bad I thought, because science can be fun. (M, S, 1. 12) EXPERIENTIAL STRATEGIES -'OUT -ON-THE-LAND' EXCURSIONS One key strategy identified by the participan ts is to facilitate experiences where students can have sustained content with the natural world. This can be achieved by taking students to traditional trap lines, fish camps, and other significant places where they can learn about how people interacted w it h the environment. One participant said, The formal method of in -classroom teaching comes from the Western world thought. Most textbooks are written from a male perspective. However, traditional knowledge comes from being outdoors and interacting with t h e e n v i r o n m e n t i n a n i n f o r m a l w a y . T e a c h e r s n e e d a l o t o f background information as well as knowledge of these locations where teaching can take place. Students can experience first hand about trapping, fishing, and where the animals are. It is difficult to bring some of those type of things into the classroom. (R, S, 1. 2) Despite the fact that preserving and passing on First Nations cultures and languages is an important part of self -determination efforts in communities, many schools in Saskatchewan continue to offer cultural and language programs as options rather than a m andatory aspect of overall teaching. One participant stated, Some schools up north offer Cree programs and students have a choice whether or not they want to take these courses. In the Cree language program for example, students learn about the background of certain places. This should be mandatory. It's weird because some communities live right next door to a river or places where people hunt and fish. There are a lot young people who do not know anything about this knowledge and so much of it is being l o s t . T h i s i s a p a r t o f science too, and this is their history. (M, S, 1. 2) One of the participants shared the following about providing opportunities for students to bond with the natural world, G o i n g o n a n a t u r e w a l k j u s t k i n d o f s l o w e d d o w n l i f e f o r a m oment and we just stopped and listened to the different sounds of nature and smelled all the different smells. All your senses just got wrapped up in it. And so I think it is important to do that with your students because they learn to develop a relation ship with nature. They develop a respect for nature. I think this is key because of all the pollution. We have a big job ahead of us in fixing our environment with what we have done to it. (H, S, 1. 5) Other participants talked about using Outdoor educatio n as an avenue to learn school science and a respect for the land. I think going out on Outdoor Education field trips and taking the time to do a cultural camp would very beneficial and I would like to incorporate that in my teaching when I am out there t eaching in the future. It would be good if we had Ghost River Rediscovery Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 110 Program here in Saskatchewan. Just to allow youth the opportunity to rediscover the past way of living. (H, S, 1. 7) I t h i n k i t i s i m p o r t a n t a s e d u c a t o r s t o t e a c h a l l p e o p l e r e s p e c t f o r t h e l a n d b e c a u s e I t h i n k w e a r e a l l a t f a u l t . W h a t w e a r e d o i n g t h a t ' s d e s t r u c t i v e t o t h e l a n d . W e a l l n e e d t o t a k e o w n e r s h i p a n d responsibility, not only as Aboriginal people, but all of us humans. (J, S, 1. 14) TEACHING SCHOOL SCIENCE THROUGH OTHER SUBJECT AREAS One common strategy identified by the participants is to use other subject areas as a vehicle to teach school science. In her story, one participant talked about her experiences in a Physical Education m e t h o d s c l a s s t h a t s h e t o o k . E v e r y o n e c h o s e a n a c t i v i t y i n t h e g y m . H o w e v e r , s h e w a n t e d t o d o something in the outdoors and so she took her students out on the land. The actual walking and hiking was the physical aspect of the lesson. In addition, she incorporated traditional plants in her lesso n where students learned to identify what grew in the area. Students were also able to plant trees and at the end of the walk they learned how to build a fire (M, S, 1. 3). SHARING KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER INDIGENOUS CULTURES Incorporating the perspectives of ot her Indigenous cultures around the world has the potential to expand and enhance the scientific knowledge base of students. One of the participants stated, W e l i v e i n s u c h a m a t e r i a l i s t i c w o r l d r i g h t n o w w h e r e e v e r y b o d y i s a l w a y s i n s u c h a r u s h . W e need t o bring back that simplicity. I think it is important to show videos on how other cultural groups of people throughout the world live. You know like Africa and other tribal groups. Students can learn about how they lived off the land. It is important for s tudents to understand that they are connected to other people around the world. Creator did not create everything for us. We need to get back to that way of thinking, living, and knowing. (H, S, 1. 4) TRADITIONAL PLANTS AND MEDICINES A common strategy ide ntified by the participants is to focus on traditional plants and medicines. One of the teachers talked about her experiences in developing a Learning Centre on Aboriginal Uses of Medicinal Plants. She used common plants like dandelions and different types of herbal teas that students could relate to. Because there was relevance in what they were learning, the students were very interesting in learning more (V, S, 1. 4). Another participant stated, \"I am interested in learning and teaching traditional medic ines. My grandmother was a Medicine Woman and my kid's grandfather was also a Medicine Man. I remember using bear grease. My son also had eczema and my mother made cream out of spruce gum. I am interested in teaching children how to look for different bush roots\" (J, S, 1. 6). TRADITIONAL SEASONAL CYCLES AND CULTURAL EVENTS Cultural events based on the traditional seasonal cycles are an important avenue where students can learn about Indigenous knowledge and traditional technologies used for survival. One o f the participants shared the following, \"Fall goose hunts and spring trapping excursions were natural seasonal activities that people engaged in long time ago. Some schools hold weeklong cultural events where students can also learn basket making, beading , storytelling, and feasts (M, S, 1. 7). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 111 This same participant stated the following, \"I learned how to make dry meat at a cultural camp. A friend of mind from one of the northern communities taught me. Where else would I learn how to do that? You have to go up north. I used to have a neighbour ... who smoked fish in his smoke house\" (M, S, 1. 8). TRAPPERS AND FISHERMEN IN SCHOOL SCIENCE Trappers and fishermen were identified as valuable resource people that can be brought into the science classroom to speak t o s t u d e n t s . T h e y h a v e a r i c h k n o w l e d g e b a s e b e c a u s e t h e y h a v e t o k n o w a little about everything to survive off the land. People that you can invite to the school are fishermen and trappers. They can explain to us what kind of traps they use or the kinds of animals they hunt. They are like Elders showing trapping or w h a t t h e y d o o n a d a y -to-d a y b a s i s o n t h e t r a p l i n e , h o w t h e y t r a v e l , h o w t h e y c a t c h a b e a v e r . I t would be good to teach the whole process of trapping beaver right down to the drying and stretc hing of the pelt. (N, S, 1. 8) TRADITIONAL STORIES OF THE NATURAL WORLD The way in which Aboriginal knowledge is sequenced in the overall science lesson is an important consideration to make. For example, stories are one method that science teachers can us e right at the beginning of the day to introduce for example the worldview s of Indigenous Peoples and their relationships with the natural world. Learning Western scientific concepts would then follow. Students learn these stories still have validity today as they explore the underlying hidden messages and core teachings. One of the participants in the interview reflected on the importance of teachers having confidence in the way they work with stories in the classroom. \"She was really confident in those legends. She could share with students how rocks are perceived as being alive. For me, I would be too worried that my students would not give those legends any value. They would think I was wacky. So I think the way she did it, the confidence in what she was teaching was really important and it made a big difference\" (H, S, 1. 11). EVALUATION AND ABORIGINAL CONTENT Fear of science in general was identified as one of the barriers that students often face and so there is a need to re -instil a sense of natural c uriosity and interaction with the natural world using Aboriginal methods. In the following passage, the participant struggles with incorporating Aboriginal knowledge and links this challenge with questions about evaluation that end up linking back to how s cience is defined ('from place' -author emphasis). I d o n ' t t h i n k t h e r e h a s b e e n a l o t o f s u c c e s s i n s c i e n c e i n g e n e r a l . I t h i n k p e o p l e h a v e a f e a r o f science as they do with math. It is sort of a male dominated thing. Anyone that is naturally curious about s o m e t h i n g a n d t h e y f i n d o u t i t i s s c i e n c e , t h e y j u s t b a c k a w a y f r o m i t . Incorporating Aboriginal knowledge is about natural curiosity and interaction with the world. H o w d o y o u a s s e s s t h a t ? Y o u c a n o n l y l o o k a t , h o w d o y o u a s s e s s t h e c h a n g e i n a p e r s o n ' s eyes w h e n t h e y d i s c ov e r s om e t h i ng f o r t h e f i r s t t im e o r c a t c h t h e i r f i rs t f is h , o r y o u k n o w , h o w d o y o u put that on paper? How do you bring that into the classroom? That's where we need the definition of science I guess. (C, S, 1. 10) Constructivist and critical approaches to teaching science were mentioned as a possible doorway for science teachers to bring Indigenous knowledge systems. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 112 She uses constructivism in her science classroom which is really good. You provide opportunities for students to construct their own meaning of what they are learning in science. It takes the m a l e n e s s o u t o f s c i e n c e . S t u d e n t s a r e a l l o w e d t o d i s c o v e r o n t h e i r o w n w h a t i t m e a n s a n d s o I guess you just have people reflect and write about they learned. Tha t i s j u s t a s e f f e c t i v e a s anything else. (H, S, 1. 11) ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION Environmental contamination is an important area of focus for school science. One of the participants talked about concentrating on water for example. The participant said, N o o n e o w n s t h e r i v e r . I c a n p a d d l e u p s t r e a m a n d d o w n s t r e a m a n d I a m o n t h e e d g e o f t h e world. What bothers me is what is being dumped into that river. We need to also know learn about environmental laws. I know when I am drinking water out of this riv e r n e x t t o m y c o m m u n i t y t h a t I a m d r i n k i n g o u t o f t h e S a s k a t c h e w a n R i v e r h e r e ... I k n o w I a m n o t g o i n g t o g o and dump something into it that is going to pollute it and it will also head down stream and hit someone else's drinking supply. It really angers m e because people just don't seem to think beyond their living rooms and televisions. They are sitting there unconnected to the land and r e a l l y d o n ' t r e a l i z e w h a t t h e y a r e d o i n g , h o w i t ' s m a n i f e s t e d a s a c o r p o r a t e e n t i t y . I w i l l n e v e r know. The more techno l o g y w e h a v e , t h e f a r t h e r a w a y w e g e t f r o m n a t u r e a n d f r o m r e a l i z i n g our own footsteps and the impact we have. (M, S, 1. 13) One of the participants shared an activity that they did on land use. The river was used as an example. Students were divided up into groups. They were each given a sheet of paper. \"We all had a little section of th e riv er tha t w e c ould d o wha te ver we want ed wi t hin our littl e g r oup. So me of us b eautified it , s o me of us industrialized it; it was a perfect model of what is actually oc curring in the world. We put the river together. Each piece of paper represented a plot along the river, like a river lot\" (M, S, 1. 14). RECYCLING AND SCHOOL SCIENCE Community -wide recycling and ways of conserving energy were mentioned as important topics to cover in school science. One of the participants talked about the lack of recycling programs in many communities. U p n o r t h t h e r e i s n o t a l o t t h a t y o u c a n d o f o r r e c y c l i n g . E v e r y t h i n g g o e s t o t h e d u m p . T h e r e a r e no recycling facilities in the north. W hat do you do and how do you teach that? My cousin from northern Manitoba came to visit me last summer. She would take a half hour shower and she would wash the dishes while the water was running. I asked her if they practiced conserving water, and she sai d n o . T h e y d o n ' t h a v e a c l u e w h a t i s g o i n g o n e v e n i f t h e y s e e i t o n T . V . T h e y think it is only for the white and not for Aboriginal people. (H, S, 1. 5) Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 113 5.4 Learning Indigenous Science from Place: Teacher Perspectives LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF FIRST NATIONS PERSPECTIVES I think some teachers don't have the knowledge or are afraid to approach science from a First Nations perspective. They don't know the protocols. They don't want to try. They don't know how to approach elders. However, I find that schools are always asking. (S, SPS, 1. 1) L a c k o f k n o w l e d g e o f F i r s t N a t i o n s p e r s p e c t i v e s w a s c i t e d a s a b i g p r o b l e m f o r m a n y t e a c h e r s . O n e participant stated the following, I am always surprised when teachers are required to teach First Nations content, they are always concerned with protocol and they are concerned about not being able to teach it properly. However, we never seem to be too concerned when we are teaching Chinese content, African content, and whole bunch of other different cultures. It just seems th a t w h e n i t c o m e s t o F i r s t N a t i o n s c o n t e n t t h a t a l l o f s u d d e n t h e r e i s a d i s c o m f o r t l e v e l . A n d t h a t s o r t o f b o t h e r s m e . ( M , SPS, 1. 1) Teachers with First Nations heritage also struggle with incorporating cultural content. Quite often people overlook the d iversity that exists within First Nations communities and expect all First Nations teachers to be c u l t ur a l e x pe r t s . One of the participants shared the following I w a s n o t r a i s e d w i t h a l o t o f c u l t u r e a n d h i s t o r y . T h e f i r s t t i m e I w a s r e a l l y e x p o s e d t o i t , was during my internship. I was asked to teach this big huge unit on heritage and about First Nations a n d M \u00e9 t i s P e o p l e . A n d r e a l l y , t h a t i n i t s ' s e l f w a s k i n d o f a n a c t o f r a c i s m . B u t I d i d g e t t h r o u g h i t in my internship and I did a really good job of it and then I started learning more. (M, SPS, 1. 1) The participant went on to state, \"I think a lot of people are racist and they don't realize that they are b e i n g r a c i s t . I h a d t h i s o n e p e r s o n a s k m e i f I h a d a n y moccasin thread .

Similarl y anoth er participant validated this response in the fo llowing way, I ' v e b e e n t h r o u g h t h a t t o o . I t a l m o s t s e e m s l i k e , w h e n o t h e r p e o p l e r e a l i z e y o u a r e a C r e e p e r s o n , o r y o u a r e a C r e e t e a c h e r , o r a C r e e c u l t u r a l t e a c h e r , y o u a r e s u p p o s e t o h a v e a l l o f t h a t knowledge. Like you are supposed to carry around you r suitcase of Cree culture and knowledge. T h e y c o m e u p t o y o u a n d a s k y o u a l l s o r t s o f c r a z y t h i n g s . I h a d a t e a c h e r w h o c a m e u p a n d s a i d , ' I n e e d t o p r e s e n t t h is T o b a c c o c a n y o u c o m e a n d p r e s e n t it f o r m e ? ' A n d I s a i d ' n o ' . ' I f y o u h a v e Tobacco, you can present it yourself'. It is just respectful to do it yourself because you are the one requesting help from the Elder. (S,SPS, 1. 5) LACK OF RESOURCES AND MATERIALS O n e o f t h e c o m m o n r e s p o n s e s f r o m t h e p a r t i c i p a n t s w a s a l a c k o f r e s o u r c e s a n d m a t e r i a l s i n r elation to incorporating First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives in school science. T h e b i g g e s t b a r r i e r i n m y f i r s t y e a r o f t e a c h i n g w a s t h e l a c k o f r e s o u r c e s . T h e y w e r e s p r e a d o u t all over the place. Our school had nothing. Even our culture teacher, she wa s expected to do the c u l t u r e p r o g r a m f o r t h e f i r s t t i m e .

S o t h i s w a s o n e o f m y b i g g e s t b a r r i e r s . E v e n m y i n v o l v e m e n t w i t h ... grade six we were required to integrate Indige nous knowledge in the science curriculum. The b i g g e s t c h a l l e n g e w a s t h a t w e a l l h a d t o d o t h i n g s f r o m s c r a t c h . T h e r e w e r e n o t a w h o l e l o t o f resources out there. We were also not given a list of resources. (M, SPS, 1. 2) One participant talked about creat i n g a d i g i t a l r e p o s i t o r y w h e r e m a t e r i a l s a n d r e s o u r c e s c a n b e s t o r e d for easy access by teachers. \"Basically the idea is to bring together the information, have a place to store it, and it is alw ays being ed ited and alw ays being chan g ed. If y ou are no t c o m for t able with what is th ere, y o u c a n h a v e p l a c e w h e r e y o u c a n w o r k o n i t s o m e m o r e . Y o u c a n s e e w h a t o t h e r t e a c h e r s a r e d o i n g ( L , SPS, 1. 17). The participant spoke about the need to create a guide called Aboriginal content delivery for dummies where teachers can learn about frequently asked questions. Or it could be a showcase for 'everything that you wanted to know about Indians but were afraid to ask' or 'everything that you wanted to know about elders' (L, SPS, 1. 18). ELDER INVOLVEMENT IN C URRICULUM DEVELOPMENT It always leads back to the Elders that have Indigenous knowledge. And it doesn't have to be Elders; it can be people who have been brought up by Elders. (S, SPS, 1. 16) All of the participants talked about the importance of Elder i nvolvement in the development of science curriculum. One of the participants describes her experiences in a developmental science program. Each teacher in a group was required to pick a unit they would concentrate on during the year. They were required to learn about the protocols in approaching Elders in the community. \"First of all, we sat down with the Elders and talked with them about two or three times. And then we brainstormed as a group. And then we went out and tried to integrate it\" (M, SPS, 1. 2) . PARENTAL RESISTANCE TO ABORIGINAL CONTENT Even though science teachers are required to incorporate First Nations and M\u00e9tis content, they are o f t e n r e q u i r e d t o d e f e n d w h a t t h e y t e a c h i n t h e c l a s s r o o m . T h i s t a k e s a l o t o f e n e r g y a n d t i m e a w a y from teachers who could better spend their energies implementing and testing out new ideas that will enhance the scientific consciousness of students. I picked space and the students just loved the activities that we did. But before I taught it, and after I taught it, t h e p a r e n t s w e r e c o m i n g i n a n d a s k i n g , ' w h a t a r e y o u d o i n g ? W h a t a r e y o u teaching, what does this have to with our student culture, why are you teaching First Nations this and that?' I am tired of having to defend incorporating First Nations content in th e classroom. I t h i n k i f i t c o m e s f r o m t h e t o p d o w n , i t m a k e s a d i f f e r e n c e . I l o o k t o t h e p r o v i n c i a l M i n i s t r y t o send me the rationale and philosophy and why we are doing what we are doing and then I just give that to the parents. (M, SPS, 1. 2) While there i s r e s i s t a n c e f r o m s o m e p a r e n t s , t h e r e a r e a l s o m a n y o t h e r p a r e n t s w h o a r e n o n -Aboriginal w h o b e l i e v e F i r s t N a t i o n s a n d M \u00e9 t i s c o n t e n t i s i m p o r t a n t . \" T h e r e a r e a l o t o f p e o p l e w h o a p p r e c i a t e i t . I had one of these parents she was my psychologist years ago. She thought it was just great and there was a lot of appreciative parents, like parents who are teachers as well. But then there was a lot of other parents that were just on the other side of the coin\" (M, SPS, 1. 3). One participant shared a story about Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 115 how Ge rman pe ople ar e fa scinated with Ab orig inal culture (S, SPS, 1. 2 1). Par ent al resistanc e is linked t o a general lack of understanding of Aboriginal history and culture. \"Even in First Nations communities, t h e r e i s d e n i a l o f t h e i m p a c t o f Residential S chool s and how traditional knowledge ways were lost through these institutions\" (S, SPS, 1. 3). One participant talked about parents wanting to know how their children were being evaluated. \"My main issue in incorporating Indigenous knowledge last year was that parents and children wanted to know how they were being evaluated. They wanted something concrete. They wanted to see an actual measurement\" (M, SPS, 1. 23). SYSTEMIC CHANGES TO SUPPORT ABORIGINAL CONTENT Participants in the focus group identified a general lack of systemic support in relation to incorporating Aboriginal content. Not only are there a low number of Aboriginal educators working in the provincial education ministry, there is also a critical need for more Aboriginal science teachers. The turnover rate of Aboriginal consultants is high and there is no consistency in delivery of content. Even when there are supports like cultural teachers, these people often get shifted around where they are moved from classroom to classroom and school to sc hool. \"I think First Nations teachers in our division have been v e r y p r o a c t i v e t o n o e n d a n d w i t h n o t a l o t o f r e s u l t s . O u r s y s t e m h a s n o t r e a l l y d o n e a l o t t o m a k e s u r e that First Nations People are being successful. There is no hiring policy to hire more First Nations People \" ( M , S P S , 1 . 6 ) . \" W e e v e n s h a r e a l l o f o u r m a t e r i a l . I w a s s o e x h a u s t e d t h a t I a p p l i e d f o r l e a v e because I felt like the program was not being taken seriously\" (S, SPS, 1. 6). Another participant talked about the need to work closely with a local cultural centre in the province. \"We ne ed t o dev elop relati onships s o that we are no t trying t o do it oursel ve s bu t w ork wi th th e ar ms o f the FSIN [Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations] that have been commissioned. This is their job. We don't need to reinvent it. We just need to increase their capacity as well\" (J, SPS, 1. 19). RELEVANCE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES O n e o f t h e c o m m o n s t r a t e g i e s i d e n t i f i e d b y t h e p a r t i c i p a n t s i s t o f o c u s o n r e l e v a n c e . T h e i d e a i s f o r teachers to make connections between science and the communities and cultures of First Nations and M\u00e9tis learners. One of the participants stated, You have to make it relevant for them. Use anecdotes and stories about Aboriginal cultures. Bring in talks about traditional medicines. Study adaptation and succession where you can pull in talks about relationships with animals and plants. The minute you make a connection with their culture, they listen more, and then they have things to say. They ask questions and that's the big thing wi th us is developing questioning skills. Since most of my students are going into the s c i e n t i f i c f i e l d s , o u r m a i n g o a l i s t r y t o c r e a t e a l i f e l o n g i n t e r e s t i n s c i e n c e a n d h o p e f u l l y w h e n they have their own children, they will be able to pass on the passion . But you need to be interested in collecting that knowledge on your subject matter yourself. So, even if the resources are out there, you have to be interested in finding it and not just having it on a piece of paper, like not just having the unit, you ha v e t o k n o w i t . A n d t h a t ' s d i f f i c u l t f o r m e , b e c a u s e I h a v e t o l o o k a t a w h o l e r a n g e o f u n i t s a n d I h a v e t o f i n d a b o d y o f k n o w l e d g e t h a t I c a n p u l l o u t w h e n kids ask questions. So it is about developing a broad body of personal academic knowledge. (L, SPS, 1. 4) ABORIGINAL LANGUAGES Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 116 Aboriginal People have names for everything in the universe including the land, animals, and plants. (S, SPS, 1. 11) One of the issues identified by the participants was the diversity of First Nations languages spoken by student s i n t h e p u b l i c s c h o o l s y s t e m a n d t h e g e n e r a l l a c k o f m a t e r i a l s a n d r e s o u r c e s t h a t r e f l e c t t h i s diversity. \"In our school one of the problems that we keep on coming up against is that that majority of materials are Cree centered. We seem to be getting more and more kids who grew up in Dene speaking areas\" (L, SPS, 1, p. 7). Another participant talked about learning the language in order to reach s t u d e n t s . \" I h a d t o k i n d o f l e a r n a l i t t l e b i t o f D e n e t o i n c o r p o r a t e i t .

I a m t e a c h i n g t h e m how to respect another person's language\" (S, SPS, 1. 7). Another participant talked about the limited i m p a c t o f l a n g u a g e i m m e r s i o n p r o g r a m s . A l o t o f t i m e s t h e s e p r o g r a m s a r e l o c a t e d f a r f r o m t h e c e n t r a l area of the city where there is a majority of First Nations language speakers.

This same participant talked about the importance of First Nations language immersion programs for parents as many have lost their languages through the Residential School system. INCORPORATING ABORIGINAL PERSPECTIVES IN SCHOOL SCIENCE You nee d to think what is around you. How people lived long time ago. (S, SPS, 1. 13) It is important to know about natural time, and the same with seasonal time. There was a time of the season where you can hunt. There is a time where the animals were bearing t heir young. And there is a time when they are getting fat. So they knew when to go out and hunt. (S, SPS, 1. 15) I think teamwork is important. Elders, teachers, parents, and children should be involved in planning a curriculum. I think they call it a gen erative classroom. It's like creating a garment where everyone is involved and collaborating. We come together. We can add other team members as we see fit. We learn from each other and we learn the interests of the students and what works for them. (S, S PS, 1. 17) There is the core curriculum that you have to teach and there is the adaptation. There is room to adapt any kind of Aboriginal content and I think more teachers need to know that. Yeah, it's your job to incorporate wherever you can and it is also your job to educate yourself on what you don't know. (S, SPS, 1. 26) One participant shared the follow strategy in relation to incorporating Aboriginal perspectives in school science. I n m y g r a d e s i x c l a s s r o o m r o o m w e d i d a s p a c e u n i t . W e t a l k e d a b o u t the moon and the moon c y c l e s .

In bringing together this study as members of the research team, we knew we faced a daunting task not only in developing research questions and interview questions that could provide meaningful data to begin this exploration of Learning Indigenous science in relation to Place , but in presenting the findings to a diverse audience of scholars, education administrator s and technicians, teachers and Aboriginal community members in a way that was helpful to their lives within their unique particular contexts. The research team recognized early in discussions dating back to 2005 that the largely unexplored scholarly area of Indigenous science , coupled with increasing pressure on educators to include Aboriginal content in all school subject areas , might result in greater than normal expectations placed on this research to produce recipe formulas for inclusion of Indigenous science concepts in school curriculum. As researchers, we found it necessary to resist the temptation to try to respond with absolutes in a positivistic manner, but to remain true to the dynamic changing holistic nature of Indigenous science. Using the Cl ue Structure system of analysis provided a means of examining participant commentary within the frameworks of the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models put forward by First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities in 2007. Information on the Models can be found in Sectio n 4.1 Holistic Lifelong Learning Models of this report. Although the Models were drafted about learning in general, the research team saw this as an opportunity to test how the outcomes of interviews about Indigenous science might appear in relation to the Models. If the messages of holistic learning, as depicted on the Models, were the beginning of a tangible illustration of the important features of learning, we believed the results of the Indigenous science study might be able to be mapped in the same ma nner.

The research team found the themes depicted in the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models did indeed emerge from within the interview data specifically concerning learning Indigenous science in relation to Place even though the participants were not prov ided with the Models for the interviews. The research team also found that a number of other concepts came out of the interview data that could be considered for future iterations of the Models as new primary concepts, or as data that supports existing con cepts on secondary or tertiary levels as sub -concepts or indicators. Future research on the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models would be necessary to bring a detailed analysis to that consideration. The research team also recognized that there are very signi ficant sensitivities around analyzing data that is tested against cultural worldviews as expressed by members of the cultural communities themselves i n t h e c r e a t i o n o f t h e H o l i s t i c L i f e l o n g L e a r n i n g M o d e l s .

R a t h e r , w o r l d v i e w s e x i s t a n d as researchers we try to understand the parts and the whole, and in this case perhaps, how we might better understand Aboriginal perspectives of in relation to provincially developed and delivered science curriculum. The literature selected to help contextualize this research brings forward a picture of the history of Aboriginal education in Canada, the contemporary status of Aboriginal education in Saskatchewan, a n overview of the concept of Indigenous science and some of the discourse regarding Indigenous science education. The literature review, Holistic Lifelong Learning Models and interview data provide a triangulation of evidence that can help educators and educational authorities build new perspectives of science education that are culturally sensitive, culturally relevant and inclusive of the areas of learning expressed as integral parts of First Nations and M\u00e9tis learning experiences. Aboriginal teachers a nd pre -service teachers participating in this study provided valuable insight into the challenges they, and all teachers, face in integrating First Nations and M\u00e9tis content into curriculum in general. The responses fielded from the service and pre -service t e a c h e r s d o n o t f i t i n t o t h e c o n c e p t s illustrated on the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models. In this case, interview questions focused on an inquiry different from that used for other Aboriginal community members. As expected, the data reveals that most of the service and pre -service teachers feel that they personally do not have the traditional knowledge required to adequately integrate Indigenous science into curriculum in a meaningful way. Perspectives shared by the teachers and pre -service teachers bri ng a sense of what the impediments to integration of Indigenous science are, where they are occurring and where they are likely to continue to occur. The interview data shows that without a concerted systemic effort ranging from community participation to government policy the status quo is unlikely to change . 5.6 Summary of Research Findings and Conclusions The purpose of this research study was to investigate how educators and education systems might take up place -based Indigenous science and apply it wit hin the established school science curriculum. To do Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 119 this, five central questions were developed by members of the Indigenous Knowledge in the School Science Curriculum Committee in the construction of a collaborative research proposal. The following is a summary list of research findings based on key thematic categories that emerged from the study. These findings are compared with the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models for First Nations and M\u00e9tis using the Clue Structure approach to analysis described in Se ction 4 Data Analysis. More specifically, the summary list of the findings emerging from the interviews and focus groups are p r o v i d e d f o r F i r s t N a t i o n s , M \u00e9 t i s , p r e -service teachers and service teacher participant groups. The findings are presented first ac cording to themes illustrated on the relevant Holistic Lifelong Learning Models ( Appendix 1 and 2 ).

Despite decades of policies calling for cultural and language content inclusion in all subject areas in Canada's reserve schools, the responses of participants in this study clearly shows that incorporating First Nations perspectives in schoo l science remains a unique challenge for educators in Saskatchewan. Throughout the interviews, the overall responses captured a real need for more in depth research at the grassroots community level. This study involved a sparse, but indeed a good represen tative sample of a moving glimpse that captures what schools are doing, to meet the needs of First Nations students in science education. The goal of this research was not about coming up with a universal one-size fits all approach to incorporating First N ations culture content as this is something that is highly contested by many scholars who work with Indigenous populations around the world. F i r s t N a t i o n s p e r s p e c t i v e s e m e r g e f r o m a p a r t i c u l a r p l a c e t h a t g i v e s v o i c e a n d f o r m t o a p a r t i c u l a r culture, worldv i e w , l a n g u a g e , v a l u e s , b e l i e f s , a n d k n o w l e d g e s y s t e m s . I n S a s k a t c h e w a n , t h e r e a r e f i v e major First Nations cultural groups that include the Cree, Dene, Saulteaux, Dakota, and Assiniboine. It became clear in this study that geographical distance, time, and t r a v e l t o 7 0 p l u s r e s e r v e c o m m u n i t i e s within the province is a daunting task that could easily be relegated to a multi -year research project. Although there were participants from these groups, more community -based research is needed to fully capture the e ssence of their perspectives in relation to cultural and linguistic content inclusion in school science. From this research we highlight the incredible advances that have been made in the area of First Nations education since the Indian Control of Indian E ducation policy was introduced in the early 1970s. Indeed many provinces and school divisions advocate and support the visions of First Nations communities in ensuring their perspectives are foundational to any curriculum that is developed in their traditi onal territories. This study is meant to build on the strengths of this momentum. After listening to all of the participants, the research team felt that further dialogue is needed within the province about science education in First Nations schools. More importantly and without a question, adequate resources are needed to enhance, develop, and implement broad educational frameworks that will allow for the development of science curriculum that is line with each community context based on their unique cultu ral traditions. The results of the study offer broad ideas, key focus areas, suggestions, examples, and recommendations that are meant to guide science teachers, university teacher education programs, policy makers, school administrators, and others who ar e responsible for curriculum in First Nations populations. The research team commends those people who came forward to participate and most especially the E l d e r s w h o p r o v i d e d t h e i r w o r d s o f w i s d o m a n d k n o w l e d g e e x p e r t i s e .

It must be noted that some of the learning that took place during the process of the individual and group interviews deserves a passing comment as it can never be captured in wor ds. The research team was enriched in profound ways and at many levels. We strongly Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 122 believe this study is a landmark contribution to the literature base on Indigenous science education with a focus on First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives in Saskatchewan. What is a M\u00e9tis perspective [of learning Indigenous science from place] for the purposes of curriculum development in Saskatchewan? M\u00e9tis describe teaching and learning Indigenous science as a process; a holistic endeavour experienced in close concert with the land with traditional land users and Elders who can impart cultural values, knowledge, and language particular to a place. M\u00e9tis believe science studied in isolation from natural surroundings provides only limited information; rather it should be that which constitutes how we know a particular place, as well as the world around us , and make decisions about our personal relationships with, and responsibilities to, the natural world from a cultural perspective. The idea of teaching or learning science as something separate from the rest of life is inadequate. Indigenous knowledge, and Indigenous science, is holistic in nature encompassing the fullness of human knowledge, belief, and experience. The literature review in this report outlining the history of Aboriginal education in Canada irrefutably illustrates the unfortunate attitude toward Indigenous knowledge held by public governing authorities in Canada . Within the past few generations, we have seen the widespread implementation of Residential School s, and punitive actions against M\u00e9tis and First Nations Peoples when they resist ed oppressive government policies. Now, as then, Indigenous knowledge, and subsequently indigenous science, is seen by most members of the public as something quaint and interest ing, but certainly not something that is g o i n g t o h e l p y o u g e t a h e a d i n t h i s w o r l d , m a k e m o n e y o r b u i l d a r e s p e c t a b l e c a r e e r in a contemporary labour market . T h e b u r d e n t o r e c o v e r f r o m d e c i s i o n s o f t h e p a s t i s g o i n g t o t a k e a c o l l e c t i v e e f f o r t f r o m all mem bers of society today, Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal alike. Saskatchewan's 1995 Indian and M\u00e9tis Action Plan indicated a need to address forms of evaluation, governance, teachers and administrators, external relationships and communication. The RCAP report produced in 1996 describe d in detail the dysfunction of relationships between Aboriginal Peoples and the state, but also describe d practical strategies to begin a process of inclusive policy -m aking. Specifically, RCAP outlined the need to address issues of Aboriginal identity, inclusion of Elders, and long -term methods of developing intergenerational means of transmitting culture and language. There is significant research and documentation describing systemic changes that education require s to adequately represent First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives in Saskatchewan education systems. What remains to be done is actualizing these perspectives for learners in the form of enhanced curriculum and supporting resources. Throughout the M\u00e9tis community participant interviews, the concept of identity emerged a number of times as a root without which other areas of learning cannot flourish. Whether acknowledging specifically M\u00e9tis identity, ancestral Cree or Dene roots, or ge nerally giving equitable acknowledgement to all Aboriginal Nations, interview participants felt strongly that children in schools are not given the opportunity to learn ancestral knowledge about the land in a way that is culturally authentic. In the absenc e of access to their own ancestral knowledge in schools, M\u00e9tis children lose their sense of identity today to much the same extent the literature illustrates the historic impact of Residential School s on generations of Aboriginal Peoples' identities. Parti cipants felt issues forcing concealment of Aboriginal identity, politicization of curriculum, and economic and labour force needs are all contributing forces against inclusion of Indigenous science in school curriculum. Most interview participants were not hing short of astonished to be asked for their views on the matter of Indigenous Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 123 science at all. Participants felt that there would be no meaningful inclusion of Indigenous science in school curriculum until the historical and contemporary mitigating facto rs mentioned previously are acknowledged and addressed within school systems. Participants felt only then might there be an opportunity to share M\u00e9tis traditional teachings with children, educators and other community members. Addressing social, political or spiritual issues within the context of a discussion about 'science' was not problematic for M\u00e9tis interview participants. These topics emerged as natural parts of their responses to questions and within the stories shared. The interview discussions abou t Indigenous science were predominantly discussions about process and context, rather than an effort to identify a set of facts or traditional practices dismembered from the larger cultural context within which that knowledge resides. Earning the trust of traditional knowledge -holder s was seen to be paramount. Indeed, overcoming t he impact of certain emotional conditions on learning, such as dealing with personal and community grief and loss, were seen to be important and natural parts of Indigenous scienc e education. M\u00e9tis interview participants acknowledged that Indigenous science must be learned through land -based experiences in collaboration with experienced traditional land users. Interview participants often described the extensive traditional knowled ge held by their mentors and recognized that acquiring a comparable scope of knowledge would have required long -term consistent interaction with these mentors. The current disconnection between learner and land, learner and community, and learner and cultu re will be challenging to create meaningful, holistic Indigenous science education. Saskatchewan's Ministry of Education has laid the groundwork through policy for inclusion of First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives in all facets of education, including scie nce education. This is a good start. However, perhaps more than any other targeted subject area, science education faces greater challenges because it is farther behind in curriculum and resource development that can facilitate M\u00e9tis perspectives. Some of thes e challenges are described by pre -service teachers, service teachers, and M\u00e9tis interview participants. The challenges are not insurmountable, but will require innovative thinking, an in -depth understanding of M\u00e9tis perspectives of science, and a willi ngness to challenge the status quo and improve science curriculum currently delivered in Saskatchewan education systems. At governance and administrative levels provincially and within schools, a focused effort can be made to develop new forms of programmi ng that is supportive of culturally appropriate forms of assessment, such as those described in the interview summaries, reports supplementing the Holistic Lifelong Learning Models and the contents of the RCAP report describing traditional forms of educati on. These would include such things as inclusion of holistic views of education and the natural world, the understanding that we are an integral part of the natural world, non -coercive education, opportunities for learning through observation, teaching by example, non -interference in the learning process, learning in natural settings, and non -regimented / institutionalized programming. Concepts such as bravery, courage, kindness, sharing, survival, knowing animal behaviour, moral lessons and values constitu te important qualities learned through traditional forms of Aboriginal education. How can learning from place help to create a foundation for a science curriculum that is contextualized to place and to the people of the place? Aboriginal Peoples in Sask atchewan are a people of Place. Despite the cultural diversity, it is the land that is considered the first teacher, the first philosopher, the ultimate giver of life and nourishment. Every aspect of Aboriginal Peoples' cultures is about fostering and rein forcing a spiritual worldview orientation and strong connection to the land through the use of traditional value systems that guide all Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 124 thinking, behaviour, and life decisions. Aboriginal knowledge systems are deeply rooted within the soil of which the met aphoric trees in the Holistic Models derive their nutrients from and, as such, have much to contribute in the current efforts to develop school science with a focus on the environment and sustainable ways of being. In order to develop school science with a holistic focus grounded in earth -based philosophies, it must be relevant and meaningful for all students that share and live out their lives from the foundation of Place and from each Aboriginal community of a particular Place. Underneath every city, town , and village lies the traditional territories of Aboriginal Peoples who lived out their lives in particular ways using particular knowledge systems to survive. Learning, understanding, and celebrating the perspectives of the original People s w ho ha v e lo n g occupied this sacred landscape called Canada will enrich all students and teachers regardless of cultural background. Section 2.4 Theories of Ecological Education explains, \"developing an intimate knowledge of the environment sustaining us can help us per sonally to discover a sense of place and, with it, all the responsibilities we hold in ensuring the continued health of a particular place\" (p. 44). During the course of this study, interview participants described the need for learners to forge a connect ion to the natural world to avoid making choices that will result in irreparable h a r m to t he e nv i r o nm e n t . Learning Indigenous science in relation to Place makes good sense not only for Aboriginal learners, but all Canadian learners. Contextualizing school science from a foundation of Place requires Aboriginal community involvement in the visioning, planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of curriculum. Each community will require an educational infrastructure supporting the development and ar ticulation of Place-b a se d ontologies, epistemologies, methodologies, and pedagogies that underlie school science practice. All participants in this study indicate a great need for more supportive resources, up -to date examples, and the documentation and sh a r i n g o f b e s t p r a c t i c e s t h a t w i l l a l l o w t e a c h e r s t o i n v e s t t h e i r e n e r g i e s i n teaching and connecting with students. The development of printed materials in line with Saskatchewan c u l t u r a l c o n t e x t s i s a s t e p i n t h e r i g h t d i r e c t i o n . H o w e v e r , i t i s t h e Place - the communities and the individuals who comprise those communities who are the ultimate sources of information about traditional knowledge systems that complement, animate, and bring to life to any curriculum or resource that is offered in school science . How can these perspectives and learning from place inform teachers of the processes and content needed in science curriculum? The results of the Learning Indigenous Science from Place research project will help teachers understand the historical context of the separation of Aboriginal Peoples from cultural knowledge systems and how rebuilding science education within a holistic framework can support the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge. Rethinking how contemporary science education is delivered can lead t o l e a r n e r s w h o a r e more personally engaged in the material, build broader foundations for understanding material and are able to enjoy the process of discovery. Across Canada, provincial governments and First Nations governments are working diligentl y to create policies and practices supportive of Aboriginal content and perspectives in school curriculum. Foundational research emerging from Aboriginal governments, post -secondary institutions, Royal Commissions, provincial/territorial/federal governme nts and others have provided evidence demonstrating the importance of appropriate school content for Aboriginal Peoples based on cultural identity and values. Researchers have also provided evidence illustrating issues and challenges artificially created as a result of school systems devoid of cultural content and supports as well as the Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 125 impact of those systems which have actively worked to destroy Aboriginal cultural identity. While there r e m a i n s a g r e a t d e a l o f i m p r o v e m e n t w o r k t o d o i n s c h o o l s y s t e m s , much has been accomplished such as the creation of more culturally sensitive administrative structures, institutional support of Aboriginal educator training, revision of curriculum to be more inclusive and encouraging Aboriginal content and resource use w ithin classrooms. Teachers, in turn, find themselves personally and professionally charged with the enormous task of integrating Indigenous science into school curriculum. To begin to develop an effective pedagogy inclusive of First Nations and M\u00e9tis pers pectives in school science curriculum, teachers need to understand and build their own awareness of the history of First Nations and M\u00e9tis Peoples. Teachers need to learn from the perspectives of First Nations and M\u00e9tis Peoples as well as from Western Eurocentric perspectives. Learning from place, then, can become meaningful to educators when there is a greater understanding of history in general and the impacts historical events have had on Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal groups of people in specific place s. It is important to understand historical contexts to increase teacher knowledge professionally and to assist in setting appropriate and achievable goals for inclusion of First Nations and M\u00e9tis perspectives in school science curriculum. An important insight educators will gain in becoming appropriately informed on historical contexts, is t h a t t h e c a l l f o r i n c l u s i o n o f F i r s t N a t i o n s a n d M \u00e9 t i s p e r s p e c t i v e s i n e d u c a t i o n o r i g i n a t e d w i t h F i r s t N a t i o n s a n d M \u00e9 t i s c o m m u n i t i e s . A c y c l i c a l p a t t e r n o f ' c a l l ' a n d ' r e s p o n s e ' i s s e e n t o m o v e f r o m Aboriginal communities through governments, school administrations, teachers, and learners. For teachers, armed with at least some background knowledge and understanding of historical contexts, a r e t u r n t o F i r s t N a t i o n s a nd M\u00e9tis community members for support should be seen as a natural and complete rotation of the cycle. As identified in the literature review and the interview data, place has multiple meanings. Learning from place means educators and learners should be l earning multiple perspectives about multiple topics. Given this daunting task, it is essential for teachers to start by knowing general information about the larger historical and philosophical frameworks of their inquiry before moving into the more detai l e d content. In essence, there is no one -size-fits-all soluti on to th e questi on. This does n ot m ean that ther e a r e n o s o l u t i o n s ; i t s i m p l y m e a n s t h a t t e a c h e r s c a n d r a w o n i n f o r m a t i o n c o m i n g f r o m t h e h i s t o r i c a l a n d philosophical contexts of Aboriginal edu cation, information provided by their administrations and the expertise of local resource persons such as traditional land users and Elders. For example, if place is defined as including all of Canada's land base it will provide a different set of conten t than if i t is define d a s r e g i o n a l a r e a , l o c a l a r e a , r i v e r s y s t e m o r o t h e r g e o g r a p h i c a r e a . D i v e r s e m e a n i n g s o f p l a c e p r o v i d e teachers with a variety of options for content. F o r t e a c h e r s a n d l e a r n e r s , e x p o s u r e t o t r a d i t i o n a l k n o w l e d g e w i l l c o m e a t v a r y i n g degrees and from a variety of learning opportunities. Teachers with little or no background in Aboriginal education should position themselves as learners along with students. Having the skills and supports to arrange learning opportunities from Aborig inal resource people is a strength that teachers can bring to planning and achieving goals they set for the integration of traditional knowledge into curriculum. Just as teachers can build their own background knowledge from reading or attending professio nal development workshops before embarking on development of processes and content for integration of traditional knowledge in science curriculum, teachers can assist students to build background knowledge that will help them interact directly with traditi onal land users and Elders. Teachers should not try to position themselves as experts in the area of traditional knowledge or simulate spiritual activities, but rather, Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 126 guide the learning experience as a combination of school -based learning linked with co mmunity -b a s e d knowledge. Assessment processes need to evolve from purely quantitative data collection and associated rubrics to qualitative processes which take into account holistic learning. It will not be easy. In fact, this may be one of the most challenging tasks facing teachers. It will be important to draw on research supporting assessment of Aboriginal learners and form advisory networks of educators skilled in contemporary and traditional ideologies of assessment to implement new measures tha t support success in science education. Achieving assessment with a balanced approach can be done with research, collaboration and community involvement. Having teachers and education systems ask questions related to what the purpose of science is and ho w it can improve our lives based on a holistic paradigm is essential to the process. Limiting assessment to goals based only on compartmentalized knowledge does not provide learners with the broad -based thinking and experiences they will need in the futur e. Building relationships with Aboriginal community members is an important step teachers need to take in Learning Indigenous science in relation to Place . Understanding basic information relating to Aboriginal identity will assist in this regard. Referr ing respectfully to First Nations People, specific Nations' original names, M\u00e9tis People, Inuit People or collectively as Aboriginal Peoples will lead to recognition that there are distinct cultures and languages. Diversity also exists within groups of Pe ople. Language dialects may vary from region to region just as cultural practices and protocols to access traditional knowledge will vary from region to region and even among individuals. Knowing some standards will be helpful for t e a c h e r s , b u t i t i s a l w ays wise to ask the person(s) you are building a relationship with what their expectations are, or seek advice from another resource person beforehand if possible. It is important for teachers to know that not all Aboriginal individuals will have all the a nswers to their questions. Aboriginal communities are based on collective strength with a variety of individuals having skills and abilities that vary from other individuals. Traditionally, young people would learn from the adults and Elders within their community building their own expertise based on inherent gifts they were born with, acquired by rites of passage, or from shared experiences. Aboriginal children who are not exposed to traditional teachings have been removed from these cycles of learning . Indeed, parents or care -givers of children may also be included in the learning experiences creating a supportive learning experience. Teachers can help facilitate reconnection to culture through effective relationship -building with a variety of Aborig inal resource persons. The literature review of this document provides an orientation to the complexity of the concept of place. The multi -dimensional, relational, experiential, local, and land -based aspects of place give particular contexts that have bot h unique and common elements. Spirituality provides connectivity and is important to understanding both philosophical and pragmatic elements. Spiritual teachings should only ever be obtained from Aboriginal persons acknowledged within their particular co mmunity as having the right to impart these teachings. Place ebbs and flows; it is dynamic and organic, rooted in the cultural traditions of a particular People. For example, identity is intimately connected to place and might be thought of as the fertil e s o i l f r o m w h i c h l i v i n g t h i n g s g r o w , t h r i v e a n d r e g e n e r a t e . W h i l e s e e d s m a y b l o w t o n e w a r e a s , t h e y m a y n o t t h r i v e i f i t i s t o o d i f f e r e n t f r o m t h e o r i g i n a l s o u r c e , o r t h e y m a y form new communities that begin as fragile groups and can be strengthened give n the right conditions. The source community will continue to thrive unless it becomes so thin that it can no longer sustain itself. Reconnecting young Aboriginal learners, and all learners, to traditional knowledge will assist in helping understand our living connections to place and the people of a place. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 127 One of the most important things that a teacher will need to include in achieving meaningful inclusion of traditional knowledge in science education is to provide land -based experiences together with Aboriginal traditional land users and Elders. Being able to provide these kinds of experiences will take most teachers some time to build their own capacity to do so. Since traditional knowledge is holistic and considers all knowledge and action linked, s pecific science concepts can already be considered as existing within a holistic paradigm. The challenge will be for teachers to learn how these concepts relate to traditional teachings. Whether the topic at hand is studying the night sky, electricity, m agnetic force or genetics, providing learners with multiple ways of knowing will support divergent thinking, sustainable choices, ethical behaviour and success in science experiences. Sharing resources, outlines and guides that are locally developed will be essential. The electronic age provides many opportunities to collaborate and share lesson plans, unit plans or just ideas -in- development regarding Indigenous science. Establishing a website for sharing is a good recommended start, although it is imp ortant to ensure that inappropriate content is not put into circulation. This may r e q u i r e a r e s o u r c e p e r s o n ( s ) t o m o n i t o r p o s t i n g s . A m u l t i -level system which has publically posted material as well as material vetted through formal processes may be advis able. Traditional land users and Elders are not always readily available and teachers will be faced with the challenge of not having access to these resource people they require on demand. It will be imperative for teachers, schools and s y s t e m s t o p l a n c ollaboratively for effective access to traditional land users and Elders. Some teachers may have already proven themselves effective at accessing traditional land users and Elders. These t e a c h e r s o r s i m i l a r l y s k i l l e d c o m m u n i t y m e m b e r s m a y b e k e y p e o p l e t o include in larger planning processes, professional development activities and facilitation of group outings for land -b a s e d experiences. What supports or processes are needed for educators and systems to engage authentically in Indigenous science? Buildin g on knowledge of the past i s a k e y c o n c e p t i n I n d i g e n o u s s c i e n c e . I t i s a l s o a k e y c o n c e p t i n education in general. History, social studies, music, math and all subject areas, including science, build on knowledge and experiences of the past. Business systems that have good corporate memory thrive and avoid errors of the past. School systems must also evolve and build successes by learning from past mistakes. Historic attempts to eliminate cultural aspects of humanity in education have shown that superficial successes in that regard have only served to disguise trauma and much deeper social wounds of those subjected to the experiences. Yet, there remains resistance from non -Aboriginal, and even some Aboriginal individuals, who believe in maintaining the status quo supporting commercial purposes of science and science education. Post -secondary institutions, especially teacher education programs offered in universities, need to be offering teacher education programming in Aboriginal languages for tea chers to develop these skills. Language programming offered in k -12 school systems will only be effective when it becomes an integral part of the education process. Having curriculum materials, including science curriculum materials, developed in Aborigi nal languages will support fluency and intergenerational language learning. Building a science curriculum that is supportive of Learning Indigenous science in relation to Place will not be successful without the support of school administrations, Aborigina l and non -Aboriginal communities, curriculum developers and teachers themselves. Educating teachers about their own attitudes and behaviour will be difficult, and sometimes unpleasant, but h a s be en part of the teaching process currently shouldered by Aboriginal teachers. Professional development for all teachers would Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 128 help to increase the knowledge base of teachers lacking a background in anti -racist education, Aboriginal education, cultures and hi stories. Demonstrating the importance of holistic thinking in science education based on research, evidence and best practices is necessary to provide the ideological support needed for all groups. Further d eveloping educational policy and legislation supporting Indigenous ways of knowing will provide a framework for supporting content and activities that comprise part of all education rather than add -on activities that are minimalist or serve to reinforce stereotypes of Aboriginal Peoples. This requires a willingness of governing authorities to provide adequate financial and human resources supporting policy and legislation as well as capacity -building in teacher and local communities to implement plans. It also requires openness by school systems to exp l o r e i s s u e s o f l o c a l r e l e v a n c e a n d importance to Aboriginal Peoples. Education systems can support the formation of groups of Aboriginal teachers to address teaching certain issues of concern to First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities. Similarly, there is a need to respect the political Aboriginal organizations and work in harmony with their systems and affiliated educational and cultural organizations, building on capacity which already exists including knowledge, processes and established protocols. Teach ers expressed a need for support to explore roots of science and roots of religion, how the spiritual practices and beliefs of another culture is expressed as their science and a means of using observation to make meaning in their lives, and the beliefs th a t g u i d e h o w A b o r i g i n a l P e o p l e s l i v e . T e a c h e r s a l s o b e l i e v e t h e r e i s a n e e d t o l e a r n f r o m w h a t other provinces are doing successfully and ultimately create teacher exchange programs so new ways of thinking can be shared. Resources and materials emerged as a critical need expressed by educators for use in guiding the integration of Indigenous knowledge in science curriculum. To accomplish this, there would need to be support to have Elders and other Indigenous knowledge holders assist teachers with tradit ional teaching of science, protocols and the traditional process es of learning. Forging respectful and trusting relationships with Elders takes time. While some Elders are experienced in working within a school environment or with large numbers of stude nts, others are not. Trappers and fishermen, for example, may have extensive knowledge of life on the land, but inexperienced in working with schools. As well, t h e d i v e r s i t y w i t h i n A b o r i g i n a l N a t i o n s , s u c h a s C r e e , D a k o t a , D e n e , o r M \u00e9 t i s m e a n s a g r e a t e r need to learn from individuals who can share what they know. As a support to school systems and individual educators, having cultural liaison personnel available to go out and meet with traditional land users or Elders is necessary to take the time needed to honour traditional protocols properly and effectively. Any development of resources and materials requires financial support. Acquiring traditional resources, such as canoes or other technology will also require an investment in the human capacity -building to ensure safe ty. Cultural ca mps can be a g r eat benefi t to t eachers and l earners. A variet y of acti vities can be done, relationships developed and fun experiences out on the land can be used to teach and learn Indigenous science. Hosting camps in places where traditional activities are still practiced will serve to provide real experiences, and perhaps, encourage the development of camps in other places. These larger events can help to raise the comfort level of participants in engaging in act ivities outside the classroom, while drawing on collective strengths of the group. Electronic technology, such as the I n t e r n e t , c a n l i n k l e a r n e r s t o r e m o t e s i t e s t o t a l k w i t h t r a d i t i o n a l l a n d u s e r s f r o m o t h e r r e g i o n s o f Canada. Videos can supplement lear ning experiences. Teachers believe developing a process that begins with professional development and learning directly from the Elders, having teachers write units and practice in the classroom, coming back together to Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 129 demonstrate what was done; compiling the new units and materials and completing the cycle with knowledge exchange among teachers will effectively replace ad hoc processes that currently exist. New evaluation processes appropriate for Indigenous science can be built based on established rese a r c h a nd collective effort of multiple educators rather than leaving teachers to try to do this in isolation. Collaboration in such a focused manner also provides an opportunity to develop safe and respectful spaces, sometimes known as 'ethical spaces' wh ere Aboriginal community members can interact with e d u c a t o r s w i t h i n s c h o o l s y s t e m s i n o r d e r t o l e a r n f r o m e a c h o t h e r . A n o t h e r k e y r e s u l t o f t h i s p r o c e s s r e s i d e s i n t h e c r e a t i o n o f r e s o u r c e s a n d m a t e r i a l s t h a t c a n b e s h a r e d a m o n g e d u c a t o r s . T e a c h e r s f e l t the development of a web portal where resources could be posted was suggested as the most efficient m e t h o d o f s h a r i n g .

School systems need to have adequate numbers of people working in central positions to coordinate material and resources needed by teachers to include Aboriginal content. Proactive planning will help ensure i ndividuals who are employed in these roles do not become overwhelmed and inadvertently end up creating bottlenecks within the process. School librarians and other support personnel need to be included in professional development activities related to Abor iginal education in order to assist teachers effectively with locating appropriate resources. To engage authentically in Indigenous science teachers need to be interested in what they are doing in order to teach it effectively. Encouraging colleagues t o incorporate Aboriginal content and enjoy the p r o c e s s i s i m p o r t a n t . F o r m a t i o n o f g e n e r a t i v e c u r r i c u l u m a n d g e n e r a t i v e c l a s s r o o m s w a s a g o a l indicated by teachers interviewed. Teachers need to know about the history of many people in order to incorpora te into their teaching; not just the Aboriginal Peoples in Canada, but all people. Some teachers felt it helps to demonstrate similarities with human cultures when teaching about plants and animals and the differences; when cultural differences and connec tions are talked about the students are much more interested. Teaching about relationships and parallels in nature is helpful to high school students so they will be encouraged to learn more, or to encourage students who are already parents to teach their own children about these things. Having good questioning skills and a good academic base of knowledge is important in encouraging students to develop these skills for themselves. When addressing sensitive subjects such as racism, having guest speakers c an be helpful. In order to engage authentically in Indigenous science, there is a need for support from principals, education systems, other teachers and from students. The holistic nature of Indigenous science means that it is not only specific content is learned, but the context of why it is important to learn including social and ethical considerations. The inclusion of spirituality and relationships all impact on how we think about science and the decisions we make with the knowledge we learn. Lear ning about recycling should lead to discussions about populations, pollution, environmental contamination, and health issues. Coming up with creative solutions can also include learning about simpler lifestyle choices, reducing consumption, and other envi ronmentally friendly strategies. It is the integration of deeper Aboriginal community perspectives and exposure to traditions and ceremonies that can help learners understand the holistic paradigm. Encouraging the use of Aboriginal languages at home and s c ho o l c an help to reinforce the preservation of worldviews different from Western Eurocentric worldviews. Using original Aboriginal languages is essential in understanding traditional uses of plants and animals, health, healing and wellness. All of the se perspectives can contribute to inspiring learners to explore careers in scientific disciplines that they may not have previously considered. Conversely, Learning Indigenous Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 130 science in relation to Place can also encourage learners to participate in more community -b a se d activities that will lead them to healthier lifestyles and cultural connectivity. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 131 6. RECOMMENDATIONS 6.1 A Holistic Paradigm The traditional knowledge of Indigenous Peoples differs from region to region and is grounded in the particular environment and culture from which it has emerged. Traditional knowledge has emerged over time and changes over time. All time is part of Indigenous Peoples history and has contributed to Indigenous epistemologies. Battiste & Henderson (2000) provide insig hts in this regard, From the beginning, the forces of the ecologies in which we live have taught Indigenous peoples a proper kinship order and have taught us how to have nourishing relationships with our e c o s ys t e m s . T h e e c o l o g i e s i n w h i c h w e l iv e a r e m o re t o u s t h a n s e t t i n g s o r p l a c e s ; t h e y a r e m o r e than homelands or promised homelands. These ecologies do not surround Indigenous peoples; w e a r e a n i n t e g r a l p a r t o f t h e m a n d w e i n h e r e n t l y b e l o n g t o t h e m . T h e e c o l o g i e s a r e a l i v e w i t h the enduring processes of creation itself. As Indigenous peoples, we invest the ecologies with deep respect, and from them we unfold our structure of Indigenous life and thought. (p. 9) Defining traditional knowledge for use in Eurocentric scientific paradigms is difficult. The oral nature, intangible aspects and holistic views of traditional knowledge are not easily understood, or accepted, within foreign scientific paradigms. That is, Eurocentric scientific paradigms search for finalities , for tangible evidence, for definition s a n d f o r n o n -contradictory qualities. Without these qualities, Eurocentric scientific paradigms cannot accept or process other kinds of information. This results in the hegemony of Eurocentric science paradigms being of little value in framing or understa nding traditional knowledge. The challenge remains for Eurocentric scientists to expand their repertoire of a single exclusive model of scientific inquiry to include new paradigms that respect the intangible, intuitive and shifting nature of other kinds of knowledges, including Indigenous traditional knowledge. Facing enormous global environmental crises in this millennium, governments and science communities are recognizing that irreversible environmental damage has placed continued human existence at risk . Yet, even Eurocentric science, embedded within Western ideology and hegemonic practices of capitalism and consumerism, has been powerless to avert pending disaster by providing sufficient solutions based on its own paradigms. In 2002, Simon Brascoup\u00e9, D irector of the Aboriginal Affairs Directorate of Environment Canada, explained, Science and technology are fundamentally limited in their scope and ability to solve the current environmental crisis. Their linear approach is juxtaposed to the holistic inte rpretations of Indigenous Peoples who seek to maintain a delicate balance between the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. Consumerism, which is the soul that feeds present day neo -liberal regimes, contrasts with the spiritual connection to the land that is at the heart of Indigenous People's philosophies and traditional practices. For the industrial world, there are many obstacles that cloud sustainable development and sustainable decisions. (Brascoupe, 2002, p. 29) Cajete (1994, 1999) has written extensively about Indigenous science education. Perspectives on ecology, personal spiritual development, traditional philosophies, mythology, artistic visioning, relationships, and curricula are offered to help understand th e complexities of Indigenous ecological education and formulate a framework for educators to work within. Cajete conveys methodologies for transformational education, drawing on Tewa teachings and similar philosophies from other Indigenous Nations. Cajete (1994) says, \"This transformation is a dynamic creative process that brings anything but peace of mind, tranquility, and harmonious adaptation. The exploration of self, and relationships to Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 132 inner and outer entities, require a tearing apart to create a new order and higher level of consciousness\" (p. 210). Personal transformation through spiritual development is necessary to achieve a completeness in life. The educational pedagogies employed to facilitate personal transformation need to be grounded in ecological awareness and connection. Cajete believes, \"a contemporary application of Indian education must integrate the orientation of economic survival and ecological sustainability if it is to serve the needs of Indian people living in contemporary times\" ( Cajete, 1994, p. 216). Hampton (1995) describes a redefinition of Indian education in terms of a six -directional framework, incorporating traditional teachings of north, south, east, west, spirit and earth. Combined, the framework is intended to demonstrat e a pattern for organizing thought about how we exist in the universe. Hampton believes it is important to recognize each direction's set of complex meanings, feelings, relationships and movements are dynamic, as is Indian education. Examining past and cur r e nt forms of Indian education is the beginning of a process to construct models and theories of education which will result in successful education for Indigenous students. Klug & Whitfield (2003) detail concepts of culturally responsive pedagogy for Amer ican Indian Children. Pedagogy includes concepts of how we decide what will be taught, what is taught, when and how we teach. Ismat (1994) is cited in describing culturally responsive curriculum capitalizes on students' cultural backgrounds rather than ov erriding or negating them; is good for all students; is integrated and interdisciplinary; is authentic and child centered, connected to children's real lives; develops critical thinking skills; incorporates cooperative learning and whole language strategie s; is supported by staff development; and is part of a coordinated, building -w i d e s t r a t e g y ( p . 1 5 1 ) . K l u g & W h i t f i e l d ( 2 0 0 3 ) describe the need to incorporate traditional languages and knowledge within existing curriculum, and to draw on cognitive psycholog ist's research on constructivist approaches to teaching and learning, which rely on students' abilities to create knowledge based on their experiences (p p. 167 -175). Ultimately, in actualizing Indigenous educational processes and goals outlined by writers such as Cajete (1994, 1999), Hampton (1995), Ermine (1995), Klug & Whitfield (2003), and others, Canadian education systems will need to create new forms of educational institutions which are grounded in Indigenous traditional knowledge and values, but can facilitate the development of Western scientific academic disciplines as well. Indigenous science education must be seen to be more than a process of discovering remedies to deal with ecological damages and environmental crises worldwide. Indigenous scien ce education must take its rightful place as the vehicle to produce ecologically aware citizens and a healthy global environment. Educators, researchers, policy -makers and community members can examine various forms of Indigenous education in an effort to ascertain common characteristics and philosophies, but the primary focus must be to integrate local knowledge systems into school science curricula.

Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 147 APPENDICES Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 148 Append ix 1: First Nations Holistic Lifelong Learning Model Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 149 Appendix 2: M\u00e9tis Holistic Lifelong Learning Model Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 150 Appendix 3: Indigenous Science and Western Science: Similarities and Differences In what follows, three comparisons are reviewed and/or adapted to provide some insight into the differences and similarities between Indigenous and Western knowledge/science. The first comparison is borrowed from Stephens (2000) and examines the similarities between Indigenous and Western science. The second comparison is adapted from Kawagley and Barnhardt (1999) and focuses on the similarities and differences between the I ndigneous and Western scientific worldviews. And the last comparison is borrowed from the Alaska Nat ive Science Commission website http://www.nativescience.org/issues/tk.htm . Stephens (2000) identifies commonalities between Indigenous science and Western science in the following four areas: Organizing principles, habits of min d, skills and procedures, and knowledge. Organizing principles include : the common notion that the universe is unified and that the body of knowledge is essentially stable but subject to modification. Habits of mind include : common notions of honesty, inqu isitiveness, perseverance, and open -mindedness. Skills and procedures common to both models of inquiry include : empirical observations in natural settings, pattern recognition, and verification through repetition, inference and prediction. Knowledge common to both models of inquiry include : plant and animal behaviors; cycles; habit needs; interdependence; properties of objects and materials; position and motion of objects; cycles and changes in earth and sky. ( p. 11) The commonalities above offer a startin g point for curriculum development that honours both Western science and Indigenous science. However, because Indigenous and Western worldviews and values differ, the interpretation of nature differs, and thus the knowledge/science content of each system is not easily translatable. The following comparison has been adapted from a comparison provided by Kawagely and Barnhardt (1999 ). They can serve as a first step towards understanding and celebrating cultural difference. Comparing worldviews can be a way of illuminating and rejecting the positivist Western science paradigm as the only way of knowing. More importantly, the comparisons serve as a point of clarity that positivist Western science thinkers may want to think about. As with most dichotomous com parisons, they can be challenged as partly accurate and useful. The first statement in each comparison is based on Indigenous worldview (IW). The second statement is based on the predominant worldview of Western science (WS): Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 151 Indigenous Science Worldview Western Science Worldview Spirituality is embedded in all elements of the cosmos; Humans have responsibility for maintaining a harmonious relationship with the natural world; Natural resources are viewed as gifts; Need for reciprocity between human and natural worlds ; Spiritual practice honors Nature on a daily basis; Wisdom and ethics are derived from direct experience with the natural world; Universe is made up dynamic, ever -changing natu ral forces; Universe is viewed as a holistic, integrative system with a unifying life force; Time is circular with natural cycles that sustain all life; Nature will always possess unfathomable mysteries; Human thought, feelings, and words are inextricably bound to all other aspects of the universe; Human role is to participate in the orderly designs of nature; Respect for Elders is based on their compassion and reconciliation of outer - and inner - directed knowledge; Sense of empathy and kinship with other forms of life; View proper human relationship with nature as a continuous two -way, transactional dialogue Spirituality is centered in a single Supreme Being; Humans exercise dominion over nature to use it for personal and economic ga in; Natural resources are available for unilateral human exploitation; Spiritual practices are intermittent and set apart from daily life; Human reason transcends the natural world and can produce insights independently; Universe is made up of an array of static physical objects; Universe is compartmentalized in dualistic forms and reduced to progressively smaller conceptual parts; Time is linear chronology of \"human progress\"; Nature is completely decipherable to the rational human mind; Human thought, feeling, and words are formed apart from the surrounding world; Human role is dissect, analyze, and manipulate nature for own ends; Respect for others is based on material achievement and chronological old age; Sense of separateness from and superiority over other forms of life; View relationship of humans to nature as a one - way, hierarchical imperative. Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 152 The following two charts appear on the Alaska Native Science Commission (ANSC ) website . They note, Too often, traditional knowledge is incorrectly made parallel only to science. Science is but a small part of non-indigenous knowledge. Similarly, to suggest that traditional knowledge is only the equivalent of science is to diminish incorrectly the strength and breadth of traditional knowl edge ...while it is not appropriate to compare scientific and traditional knowledge as equivalents , The use of traditional knowledge in scientific knowledge in science means that the two knowledge bases will be in contact with each other as practitioners atte mpt to weave the two together.

A. PROMISING PRACTICES IN INCLUSIVE CURRICULUM DESIGN (UNITS, LESSONS, ETC.) 1) Forests for the Future (Tsimshiam territory, BC) Social studies and science curriculum The Forests for the Future social studies curriculum focuses on four unit plans that incorporate Indigenous and scientific knowledge to meet the ecological needs of the local community. The curriculum incorporates the traditional ecological knowledge of Gitxaala Elders. http://www.ecoknow.ca/ 2) Rekindling Traditions (Northern Saskatchewan, Canada) 6 Cr oss -cultural science and technology units G u i d e d b y t h e w r i t i n g s o f D r . G r e g C a j e t e a n d o t h e r F i r s t N a t i o n s e d u c a t o r s , s i x t e a c h e r s a c r o s s northern Saskatchewan and Dr. Glen S. Aikenhead developed six cross -cultural science and technology teaching units (complete with lesson plans). The project involved the communities bringing First Nations science into the science classroom . They also wrote a teacher guide for the whole project and another document to tell our s tories about involving people in the communities (our challenges, successes, and advice). The units give students access to Western science and technology without requiring them to adopt the worldview endemic to Western science. http://www.usask.ca/education/ccstu/ 3) Manitoba Education, Citizenship and Youth Title: Incorporating Aboriginal Perspectives: A Theme -Based Curricular Approach (Resource Materials and Templates) This workshop package offers selecte d instructional strategies for specific grade and content areas. It is designed to assist teachers as they build Aboriginal Perspectives into curricula http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12 /docs/policy/abpersp/ab_persp.pdf To assist Manitoba educators in incorporating Aboriginal Perspectives, Native Studies documents have been developed and published, such as: Native Studies Early Years (K - 4) A Teacher's Resource Book Native Studies Middle Years (Grades 5 - 8) A Teacher's Resource Book Framework, and Native Studies Senior Years (S1 - S4) A Teacher's Resource Book Framework Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 155 Most recently Integrating Aboriginal Perspectives into Curricula: A Resource for Curriculum Developers, Teachers and Administrators has been distributed to schools to assist in the process. Cultural Concepts are organized according to grade level: Grade 2 Cooperation and Respect; Grade 5 Knowing Our Place Senior 2 Water and Collective -Decision Making Science units exi st for each grade level/cultural theme. http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/abedu/perspectives/resources.html 4) The Alaska Native Knowledge Network ANKN is a systemic initiative that has endorsed and developed curricula T h e A l a s k a N a t i v e K n o w l e d g e N e t w o r k i s a r e s o u r c e f o r i n f o r m a t i o n r e l a t e d t o A l a s k a N a t i v e knowledge systems and ways of knowing.

This sup port inspired a non -Aboriginal science educator to collaborate closely with three different Aboriginal family groups across Australia to produce a high school textbook, The Kormilda Science Project: An Indigenous Perspective on the Earth Sciences (see Read , Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 156 2002). The Kormilda Science Project i s a r a r e e x a m p l e o f a t e x t b o o k t h a t r e s p e c t f u l l y i n t e g r a t e s Indigenous science with Western science. 6) Native Access to Engineering Program The Native Access to Engineering Program has been producing curriculum since 1 998. Each topical set consists of a newsletter, worksheet and teacher's guide. Curriculum units include: Geomatics, Ocean Engineering, Nutrition, Building Engineering, Water, Geology, Biomedical Eng., Energy, Structures, Simple machines, Environment, Commu nications, Chemical, Construction, Flight, Materials, Measurement, Space, Agriculture, Mining, Forestry, Computer, Transportation, Sound, Light. http://www.nativeaccess.com 7) Practising the Law of Circular I nt e r a c t i o n (Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Centre, 1993) Indigenous ecology curriculum Practising the Law of Circular Interaction w a s b o r n o u t o f t h e e f f o r t s o f A b o r i g i n a l p a r t i c i p a n t s t o transform a Western science ecology curriculum into an Indigenous eco logy curriculum. The differences in epistemology, ontology, and axiology between the two knowledge systems were found to be so discordant that they necessitated a fresh independent start (This example reinforces the idea that curricula developed in one cul tural context/community is not necessarily transferable to another). http://www.sicc.sk.ca/ 8) Cradleboard Core Curriculum T h e C r a d l e b o a r d T e a c h i n g P r o j e c t h a s c r e a t e d a l i b r a r y o f f i f t e e n t e x t -based volumes of core c u r r i c u l u m b a s e d i n N a t i v e A m e r i c a n c u l t u r e .

The others exist as traditional school -type print and gr aphics curriculum units, waiting to be re - created as interactive multimedia units as time and project funding allows. Cradleboard Core Curriculum is available in five subject areas at three grade levels [elementary, middle years, secondary]. www.cradleboard.org B. Promising Practices in Pedagogy/Methodology Authentic Language learning/Instruction: M\u00e4ori schools in Aotearoa, NZ McKinley et al. (1992) enriched the idea of integration when they argued for students to le a r n bo th Indigenous and Western sciences in a student's Aboriginal language. This led to research into translating the Aotearoa New Zealand science curriculum into the M\u00e4ori language (McKinley, 1996) and to research into the effect of non -Indo European l anguages on student learning\" (Aikenhead, 2006b, 125). Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 157 Aotearoa New Zealand enjoys an enhanced science curriculum. A M\u00e4ori version of their country's science curriculum came about through negotiations between Elders of the M\u00e4ori nation and science educator s (McKinley, 1996; Stewart, 2005). This M\u00e4ori version, called \"p\u00fctaiao,\" was recognized by the country's ministry of education for a network of M\u00e4ori language schools and M\u00e4ori bilingual and immersion classrooms in elementary and high schools, including gr ade 12 (McKinley, 2005; McKinley, Stewart, & Richards, 2004). \"As an Indigenous science, p\u00fctaiao offers the opportunity to develop a uniquely local critical science education curriculum\" (Stewart, 2005, p. 866). Teacher candidates are being educated to pro duce lesson plans to fit p\u00fctaiao (Barker, 2004). It is clear from the Aotearoa New Zealand and Australian experiences that when Indigenous knowledge is recognized as foundational to school science, appropriate curricula, teacher education programs and inst ructional materials can ensue. 10) Student Engagement Through Technology (Digital Cameras) and Mentoring The use of digital cameras in Aboriginal student education emerged as a theme in effective practices. Traditional Pathways to Health i s a r e s e a r c h p r o j e c t developed through collaborative efforts between University of Victoria researchers, and Aboriginal teachers and students from two school districts. The project enables Aboriginal youth at three high schools in Victoria to use digital video to highlight the ir own positive activities, culture, and traditions as important dimensions of their lives that help to keep them well (see Riecken, et. al., 2006). The following are three examples of schools that have utilized and found the project to be successful: Care er and Personal Planning (CAPP) at Victoria High School (BC) has a course option for Aboriginal students that focuses on making connections with Elders and other Aboriginal role models. The Westshore Center for Learning and Training (BC) has developed a se parate First Nations graduation program with a strong cultural focus that engages adult and youth learners with Aboriginal artists, poets, dancers, and writers. In First Nations Leadership 11 at Esquimalt High (BC), the philosophy of the course is the belief that First Nations values and beliefs are essential to the understanding of self and others as leaders. Mentoring has been employed successfully in the areas of Aboriginal women's health (see Banister & Begoray, 2006), success coaches (see Costa, 2006), pre-service teachers' working with students (see McCluskey, Baker & McCluskey, 2005). C. Promising Practices in Systemic Initiatives 11) Aboriginal Knowledge and Science Education Research Project The Aboriginal Knowledge and Science Education Research Project was developed by the Aboriginal Education Enhancements Branch of the Ministry of Education and the University of Victoria. The principal goals of the project are to: \"...enable Aboriginal students to be successful in science and related programs at the mid dle and secondary school levels; to encourage Aboriginal students to consider science -related Learning Indigenous Science from Place Page 158 occupations; and to provide a meaningful context that will enable curriculum developers at a later phase to develop culturally appropriate science curriculum mate rials and programs for Aboriginal students\" (Snively & Williams, 2006, 242 - 243). 12) Aboriginal Learning Knowledge Centre The Aboriginal Learning Knowledge Centre was created by the Canadian Council on Learning as a national initiative supporting the develop ment of effective solutions to challenges faced by First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit learners. The Aboriginal Learning Knowledge Centre has a Consortium a nd a National Advisory Committee of more than 100 organizations and individuals from across the country working together to create a path for the improvement of Aboriginal learning in Canada. A Steering Committee made up of volunteer members of the Consortium and National Advisory Committee provide direction to the Aboriginal Learning Knowledge Centre. The Co-L e ad Organizations for the Aboriginal Learning Knowledge Centre are the Aboriginal Education Research Centre at the University of Saskatchewan and the First Nations Adult and Higher Education Consortium in Calgary, Alberta . http://www.ccl - cca.ca/CCL/AboutCCL/KnowledgeCentres/AboriginalLear ning/AboriginalLearningHome/?Language= EN "}
