The emergence of the new discipline coincidedwith important developments in biochemistry and the beginning of drugsynthesis in Europe.

Thus we ex-plore a eld of study distinct from ethnopharmacology, which focusesprimarily on the biochemical properties and effects of 'indigenous'medicines (while recognizing the importance of people's own concep-tions about these medicines). In this introduction, we set out our assumptions about medicines as socialandculturalphenomena.Webrieflyreviewtheancienttendencyofmedicines to move, as a background for appreciating the amazing spreadof biomedical pharmaceuticals. We trace the development of anthropo-logical interest in medicines, and explain our framework for the book. What are medicines? Medicines are substances with powers to transform bodies. Prayer, and rest, and exorcism may also have therapeutic powers, but they are notobjectied or crafted or commodied as medicines are. The centralityof medicines for medicine is apparent in the identity of the words usedin English. The same word, related to the Latin mederi, to heal, is used for the science or practice of treating and preventing disease, and for thesubstances used in that practice. Medicines are the primary means bywhich most medical traditions work upon disease and their use is thefundamental technology of biomedicine as an applied science. At a timewhen intellectuals and media in countries of the North are debating thenew medical technologies, it is worth stepping back to consider the oldmedical technology, the use of medicines, as a general phenomenon. 1. Medicines are substances. Their materiality, their thinginess, is a property of great analytical importance for anthropology. As things theycan be exchanged between social actors, they objectify meanings, theymove from one meaningful setting to another. They are commoditieswith economic signicance, and resources with political value. Above allthey are potent symbols and tokens of hope for people in distress. 2. Medicinal substances have powers to transform. At least, such pow- ers are attributed to them by social actors. Assumed efcacy is a deningproperty; a substance that no one believed efcacious would generallynot be considered a medicine. They are supposed to do something, tochange the body in a discernible way. 3. Transformative powers can be put to different purposes. Prototyp- ically, medicines are meant to heal. They should do something about disease. Some medicines, such as vaccines, are meant to prevent par-ticular diseases, or, like vitamins and tonics, to strengthen the body.Whereintenseawarenesshasbeencreatedaboutthefactorsthatincrease6 Part I Introduction chances of getting certain diseases, people even take medicines against risks. Medicinal powers can be used to injure as well as to heal. Theterm for medicine in many African languages refers to harmful as well aswholesome substances (Whyte 1988:218). 4.Medicinescanbesimultaneouslynoxiousandbenecial.Theambi- The eighteenth-century European pharmacopeia contained toxicdrugs like belladonna compounds and pharmacology (Weatherall 1993:919). Today, pack- age inserts in pharmaceuticals must warn of possible adverse effects and contra-indications. Benecial as they are, medicines can harm acciden- tally ('Keep all medicines out of the reach of children') or be used forsuicide. The potentially noxious effects of medicine are a key concern inthe biomedical tradition: 'There i s...noknowndrugthatisnotharm- ful or even poisonous at high doses, and much of the scientic work ondrugs has attempted to widen the gap between effective and toxic doses' (Burger 1986:1). 5. Medicines are used intentionally to achieve an effect in some body. Oneofthethemesofthisbookisthattheyhaveothereffectsaswell.Theychange minds and situations and modes of understanding. Medicines on the move Medicinesarementionedinsomeoftheoldestdocumentsofancientcivi- lizations.Claytabletsincisedwithcuneiformscriptrecordmedicinesusedin Sumeria 2,000 years before our era. The 60-foot-long Ebers MedicalPapyrus has a section on ancient Egyptian medicinal remedies. The RgVeda, dating from the latter part of the second millennium BC in SouthAsia,referstospecialistswhoknewthemysteriesofhealingherbs.Foun-dational texts of the Ayurvedic tradition, such as the Caraka Samhita,from the rst millennium of our era, contain hundreds of medicinalrecipesthatcanberelatedtonosologiesofdisease.InChina,Shen-nung'sScripture on Materia Medica, from the rst century AD, contained asmany descriptions of therapeutic substances as there were days in a solaryear - 365 (Unschuld 1988:181). It seems reasonable to assume that at least some medicines were ex- changedfromplacetoplacefromearlytimes.InsouthAsia,forexample,it is suggested that herbs from mountain or jungle areas were traded intoother ecological zones (Basham 1976:30). In an y case, knowledge about medicines was transmitted across geographic and temporal distances, asAn anthropology of materia medica 7 research on historical texts has shown. The Greeks, full of admiration for Egyptian medicine, transcribed their prescriptions (Wilson 1962).Hittite scribes in Anatolia copied tablets of Babylonian medical textsfrom Mesopotamia with their herbal mixtures, suppositories and lotions(Oppenheim 1962). Whole books of materia medica were translated; in-deedwholetraditionsofmedicalandmedicinalknowledgediffused.Oneof the most striking examples is the spread of the classic Greek traditionto the Arab world, on to South Asia as Unani medicine (from the Arabic'Yunani' meaning Ionian) and in time back to Europe again (B\u00a8 urgel 1976). In Greece the use of a range of botanical and inorganic substances was documented in the writings of Hippocrates of Cos and his follow ers about400yearsBC.However,theuseofmedicineswaslimited,emphasis being given to dietetics (Ackerknecht 1962:391). The great manuscript known as 'De Materia Medica' by Dioscorides, from the rst century AD, contained an exhaustive description of plants, animal products and chemical substances (like mercury and arsenic), including those he hadlearned about during his travels as a surgeon with the Roman armies . His successor in the second century, the physician and prolic writer Galen, reorganized these listings but also sought out new medicines. 'He travelled widely in Egypt, learning about the drugs imported from India,Africa and elsewhere from the shippers who brought them' (Conradet al.1995:61). This text-based tradition underwent a great revival as the Greek manuscripts were translated into Arabic around the third century. Theflowering of formal medicine in the expanding Arab-Islamic world in-cluded systematic work on materia medica as Arab armies overran newterritories with different assemblages of medicinal plants, animals andminerals.Theexpansioninmedicinalknowledgeisevidentintheseventh-centurymanuscriptonmateriamedicabyIbnal-Baytarwhichlistedover3,000 items, whereas that of Dioscorides had included only about 850.Arab-Islamic medicinal knowledge was written down and transmitted ina book trade that stretched from Spain to India. It was made available toliterate lay people in popular introductory texts (Conrad 1993:703-7).Much of this corpus was translated into Latin in the eleventh century,introducing to Europe the wealth of Arabic knowledge of drugs. InearlymodernEurope(1500-1700)thelivelymovementofmedicines (as well as texts about them) is well documented. Enormous efforts weremade to retrieve the drugs described in Dioscorides' Materia Medica.'Venice...ordered its diplomats, physicians, and traders in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean to be on the look-out for the plants thatgrew in Dioscorides' stamping ground' (Conrad et al.1995:305). Seeds8 Part I Introduction andspecimensweretransported,sometobeplantedintherstbotanical gardens at Pisa and Padua. New remedies were brought to Europe from Asia and the New World, ofwhichoneofthemostfamouswasthe'Peruvianbark',broughtbacktoRome in the early 1630s by Jesuit missionaries. Tried out successfully inRomeandGenoaagainstthe'intermittentfevers'ofthosemalarialareas,it quickly spread throughout Europe. Physicians debated its t into the Galenic system of humours (Jarcho 1993:19), just as Latin Americanswould discuss the hot and cold properties of penicillin three centurieslater. The bark was so esteemed that royalty made gifts of it. Supplies shipped back by merchants were stolen from warehouses or captured atsea by pira tes (Jarcho 1993:201 -2). The exotic drug challenged medical thinking and enjoyed a long cultural career in which it developed frombeing a specic against 'the intermittents' to being used as a panacea(Maehle 1999:223-90). It was not until 1820 that the active principlequinine was isolated from the bark of the tree named Cinchona by Linnaeus. Its travels were to continue as plantations were establishedby the Dutch in Java in the nineteenth century (with seeds smuggled out of Peru and Bolivia); they provided almost the entire world supply ofcommercial quinine up until the Second World War. More mobile medicines Throughout most of history medicines have been made from plants, an- imal parts and minerals through drying, grinding, decoction. This wascertainlytrueinEuropeasattestedbythepharmacopoeias,booksofstan-dard drug recipes, published by medical academies in Florence, Lyonsand London from the late Renaissance. After the time of Paracelsus(1482-1546) the methods of medical (iatro-) chemistry spread a newkind of drug production through much of Europe. The new technologycame to be associated with those who challenged the dominant Galenicmethods of established medicine and also with social reform (Temkin1964:5; Conrad et al.1995:318-23). Yet although iatrochemistry gained wider currency, herbal medications were still the most commonly usedin Europe right up through the eighteenth century. The revolution in drug production came in the nineteenth and twen- tieth centuries and laid the ground for a truly exponential increase inthe movement of medicines. It built on advances in physiology, chem-istry and pharmacy in France, and most dramatically in Germany. Fromthe early 1800s, methods for extracting pure drugs, or active principles,from crude natural products were developed. At the same time, the new science of pharmacology was being professed (Weatherall 1993).An anthropology of materia medica 9 From the mid-nineteenth century, the 'ne chemical' industries in Germany began to synthesize drugs and produce them on a large scale.WithWorldWarI,American,EnglishandFrenchcompaniesbegantheirown industrial production to ensure supplies. Then, in the late 1930sthe rst sulfa drugs were developed and this set off a flurry of activityas the potential of anti-infective drugs became apparent. But it was notuntil after the Second World War, when antibiotics, including the newdrug penicillin, were made widely available, that 'the great drug therapyera' opened. The pharmaceutical scene was transformed. Teams of sci-entists in industrial laboratories developed new drugs as well as 'me-too'products that duplicated existing ones but were marketed as different.Thousands of synthetic products replaced the limited number of naturaloriginavailablebefore1935.Bothprescriptionmedicinesandtheincreas-ing number of ov er-the-counter (OTC) drugs were heavily promoted (Silverman and Lee 1974:5-22). The movement of medicines that had long existed on a modest scale became a mighty current as drugs werepumped out onto national and international markets. MassproducedbiomedicalpharmaceuticalsspreadtoAsia,Africaand Latin America with remarkable speed. By the 1960s, antibiotics werebeing incorporated in the materia medica of Ayurvedic practitioner si n India(Taylor1976).Bythe1970sonecriticalobserverwaswritingabout 'thedruggingofthe Americas '(Silverman1976).While thevastmajority of pharmaceuticals were and are manufactured in Western industrializedcountries, some developing countries established their own production.By 1980, about 11 per cent of pharmaceutical production (by value) was locatedinThirdWorldcountries,mainlyIndia,Egypt,Brazil,Argentina,MexicoandSouthKorea(Melrose1982:28-9).Theglobalizationofsyn-thetic pharmaceuticals made a vast array of products available in poorcountries, and prompted a growing concern about the dangers of mis-use and waste of scarce resources. It was in the 1980s that the conceptof essential drugs, inexpensive and safe medications for the most com-mon diseases, gained notice, mainly through promotion by the WorldHealth Organization (Mamdani and Walker 1985; Kanji et al.1992: 28-41). Itisagainstthishistoricalbackgroundofmobilemedicinesthatwecan set the development of an anthropological interest in materia medica.However, it is important to note that while historians and activists focuson the movement of medicines, anthropologists combine that interestwith questions about why medicines are so attractive to people. What dothey mean that could explain their movement from hand to hand andplace to place? How is their movement shaped by social relations andhow does it in turn shape those relations?10 Part I Introduction Anthropology takes up the study of medicines Thecultural(symbolic)logicoftransformativesubstanceswasdiscerned by early anthropologists in 'primitive' societies. Since the publication ofThe Golden Bough by Sir James Frazer in 1890 (see chapter 3), anthro- pologists have attended to the way people conceive of forces as incarnatein, susceptible to the influence of, or powerfully represented by, materialobjects. They emphasized the possibilities this opens for communicating and controlling in an uncertain world. Studies of magic and fetishismshowed how people manipulated things, including substances made forthe purpose, to transform people and situations. In his classic treatment of magic, Malinowski wrote about 'material object s...substances best tted to receive, retain, and transmit magical virtue, coverings designedto imprison and preserve it until it is applied to its object' (Malinowski1948:72). 'Magic is the quality of the thing, or rather, of the relation be- tween man and the thin g...Itimplies the performing magician quite as muchasthethingtobecharmedandthemeansofcharming'(1948:75).The questions to be asked concerned how substances carried meaningwithin a cultural world and how people used them for their particularpurposes. Severalgenerationsofanthropologiststheorizingcosmology,ritualand symbolismexploredtheserelationships.L\u00b4 1966) and the effectiveness of symbols (L\u00b4 evi-Strauss 1963). A key landmark wastheworkofVictorTurner,pointingtothewaysymbolscondenseandunifydifferentmeanings.Beforemedicalanthropologywasestablishedasaeld,hewasalreadywritingoftheoverlapbetween'medicine'as'drug'and as 'ritual He showed as powers hidden and slumbering in herbs' (1967:350). With the growth of medical anthropology as a specialized eld in the 1970s, the approaches already developed for studying rituals and sym- bols were widely applied to illness, healing and medicines. Building on the tradition of eldwork in local communities, much medical anthro-pology concentrated on showing how seemingly exotic healing practices madesense.Withinthe'ethnomedicine'approach,indigenousmedicineswere placed in relation to the cosmology, ritual and knowledge of a local(usually ethnic) group, as Turner had done. It was an approach whosegreat value was contextualization; healing practices made sense in rela- tion to the shared meanings and social arrangements of the setting. Itsweakness was that context was often presented as integrated tradition, a homogeneous, static view of local culture and society.An anthropology of materia medica 11 Analternativeapproachwasrapidlygainingprominence.Thenotionof medicalpluralismfocusedattentionontheco-existenceofdifferentheal-ing traditions within the same society. This was clearly useful in complexsocieties such as India, where different kinds of sacred and secular, pro-fessionalandpopulartraditionsflourishedsidebyside(Leslie1975).Butwith the spread of biomedicine in the wake of colonialism and interna-tional trade, the concept served to underline that all societies had severalmodes of conceiving illness and practising treatment. The developmentof a research interest in medical pluralism was a precondition for themedical anthropological work on pharmaceuticals. A few early pioneers drew attention to the spread of pharmaceuticals that accompanied the worldwide dissemination of biomedicine. Alland 's study of Abron healing (1970) in the Ivory Coast contained a clear state-ment of the attraction of Western medicines (in contrast to Westernmedicine). Michael Logan (1973) showed how pharmaceuticals t intoGuatemalan humoural concepts. Cunningham's work on 'injection doc-tors' in Thailand (1970) drew attention to the popularity of hypodermicinjections. However, these studies were exceptions to the dominant in- terest of anthropology in exotic cosmologies and ritual practices. In the 1980s, eldworkers were beginning to de-exoticize the study of medicines in non-Western settings (Van der Geest 1984). Researchon the meaning and use of aspirin and penicillin was becoming just aslegitimate as studies of fetishes and purifying herbal enemas. This wasprobably due in part to the simple fact that biomedicine, and particu-larly 'biomedicines', were genuinely popular and heavily used in manysocieties of Africa, Asia and Latin America (Foster 1984). Moreover,Illich's(1976)attackonbiomedicine'sexpropriationofhealthandradicalcritiques of the pharmaceutical invasion of the Third World of some academics. Researchers documented the local realities in which medicines were actually made available and used (Nichter 1980; Haak 1988; NichterandNordstrom1989;Etkin et al.1990).Theyshowedthesignicanceof the transaction of informal channels(Ferguson 1981; Van der Geest 1982a, 1982b; Fassin that most pharmaceuticals, trained health worker (Haak and Hardon 1988; Hardon 1991).The rst edited volume on the topic wove together themes concerningtransactions of pharmaceuticals and considerations of the meanings at-tached to them (Van der Geest and Whyte 1988). These topics were12 Part I Introduction followed up in a second anthology (Etkin and Tan 1994) that included more articles on the practical problems of ensuring biomedically effec-tiveuseofmedicinesintheconditionsobtainingincountriesoftheglobalSouth. Analytical moves As older paradigms of modernization and development were supple- mented by analyses of transnational cultural flows (Appadurai 1990; Hannerz 1992), anthropologists focused on the way that political ideals,entertainment, institutionalforms,fashionsandcommoditiesbothtrans- formedandweretransformedbythecontextsthroughwhichtheymoved. Biomedicine is one of the best examples of globalization; it is truly cos-mopolitan,notWestern,medicine(Leslie1976).Indiversesocialsettings itprovidesaparticularlyappropriateempiricalbaseforaddressingnewertheoretical issues concerning cultural globalization (Parkin 1995). The older interest in 'medical pluralism' (Leslie 1975; Janzen 1978) took on new facets with the appreciation that oppositional identities areone possible outcome of globalization. Attending to pharmaceuticals fa-cilitates understanding of how 'traditions' come to appear distinctivewhile simultaneously influencing one another deeply. Pharmaceuticalsand 'indigenous' medicines take on meaning in contrast to one another(Sussman 1988; Nichter 1989:195-6). At the same time, pharmaceu-ticals may provide a prototype in terms of packaging and marketing for'indigenous'medicines(AfdahlandWelsch1988;Leslie1989;Tuchinsky1991). One outcome of this process was an emphasis on the medicinalaspect of other systems of healing as 'traditional' medicines gained ideo-logical weight in opposition to synthesized pharmaceuticals, and becameincreasingly commercialized. Pharmaceuticals may also be directly incorporated in a medical tra- dition notionally distinguished from biomedicine, as has been reportedfrom South Asia (Bhatia et al.1975; Burghar t 1988; Wolffers 1988). The model of medical pluralism is further problematized by the appear-ance of pharmaceutical specialists who belong neither to the traditionof biomedicine as practised in formal health institutions, nor to the tra- dition of indigenous medicine. These 'quacks' or 'charlatans' or 'bushdoctors' or 'injectionists', as they are called by the professional ideology,suggest that notions like 'creolization' (Hannerz 1987; Whyte and VanderGeest1994:138-9)or'counterwork'(Fardon1995)whichemphasizethe creative revision of forms and ideas may be more useful than the idea of pluralism for grasping the dynamics of pharmaceuticals in complex health care systems.An anthropology of materia medica 13 In recent decades, an increasing interest in Western culture and its products meant that biomedicine came to be seen as a cultural phe-nomenon worthy of study. As the 'exotic bias' diminished, more anthro-pologists from both the North and the South did eldwork in their ownsocietiesonaspectsofpopularcultureandeverydaylife.Capsules,tabletsand hypodermic syringes were no longer taken for granted and ignored;theycouldbedefamiliarized(denaturalized)andanalysedintermsofthemeanings people attributed to them in settings as different as Uganda(Birungi1998),thePhilippines(Tan1999),theUnitedStates(Vuckovic1999) and France (Fainzang 2001).

Ferguson 1988) and provided a bridge between culture and economy.The'thinginess'ofmedicinesandtheirtendencytobecomecommoditiessuitthemextremelywelltothisperspective.Seeingmedicinesasmaterial culture opens up two sweeping vistas. One has to do with processes ofcommoditization,globalizationand localization.The 'zations'(Anderson 1996:296,quotingL.Cohen)viewisthebroadoneofsocialandpoliticaleconomichistory,inwhichmedicinesnotonlymove,astheyalwayshavedone to some extent, but where their movement has implications aboutinfluence, dependence and transformation. The other vista has to do with the positions of medical materials in technologies of health care. If we think of technologies as 'practical arts'with purposes, and consider the relations between people and objects inaccomplishingthesepurposes,thenwewillbeledtoexaminethewaysinwhich artefacts are extensions of people in some situations, and ercelycontestedinothers(Pickstone1994).Itispossibletoaskquestionsabout powerfulsubstancesaspartofacomplexofinstitutions,technologiesandpractices characterized by styles of reasoning (Cambrosio et al.2000:5). We can look 'at how [people] perform things, rather than at the frozenproducts of those performances' (2000:8). The social lives of medicines In Appadurai's introduction to the anthology The Social Life of Things (1986) and in Kopytoff's contribution to the same book, the notion isproposed that things have biographies. That is, it is useful analyticallyto trace the careers of material things as they move through differentsettings and are attributed value as singularities or as commodities forexchange.Weusedthisideatoorganizeareviewoftheliteratureonphar-maceuticals: their production and marketing, their prescription, their14 Part I Introduction distribution through intertwined formal and informal channels, their deathsthroughoneoranotherformofconsumption,andnallytheirlivesafterdeathintheformofefcacyinmodifyingbodies(VanderGeest et al. 1996). In reality of course, things alone do not have a social life. At most they canbeseenasagentsinthesensearguedbyactor-networktheorists:theyform parts of complexes that co-produce effects in particular situations;things and people both can be seen as actors in that they mutually con-stitute one another (Prout 1996). But even if one does not accept theradical position that things and people are equally agents, it is essentialfor anthropologists to describe the lives that medicines have with peopleand between people. These lives are imbued with the practical artfulnessand purpose that characterize technology. They are lived in relation to problems and contexts. It is these qualities that we want to capture in the chapters that follow. Each builds on an ethnographic description of medicines in a specic place in Europe, Asia, the Americas or Africa. Each shows medicine inthe hands of particular types of actor s, moving between persons in cer- tain kinds of social relations. The rst four chapters take the perspectiveof consumers of medicine and the following four give more weight to the providers. Finally, we focus on the strategists who manufacture and market medicines, and those who attempt to regulate them. Thus we move from the intimate relations of mothers and children, to the global ones of the World Health Organization and the member states for whichit formulates policy. Each chapter concentrates on a different analyticalproblem in the study of medicines, one that seems well illustrated by theempirical case. Theoretical discussions and comparative material fromother places are brought in to develop the main point. As each issue un-folds, it comes to overlap with some of the others. We hope in this wayto give a sense of coherence, without forcing material and concepts intoone tight paradigm. The consumers: meaningful medicines at work We begin with mothers and children in Metro Manila and the prob- lem of efcac y - a logical starting point since drugs are used for their effects. In poor neighbourhoods of Manila, women say that cough andcold remedies dry up or 'ripen' colds, drive out phlegm and stop cough-ing. But there is a strong element of habit in their use of these remedies.They do not posit causes of colds, or experiment empirically to choosethe most effective medicine. This 'habitual' form of therapeutic practice,noted many years ago by one of the ancestors of medical anthropologyAn anthropology of materia medica 15 (Ackerknecht 1946), suggests that we need to consider efcacy very broadly.Drugshaveeffectsonthemindfulbodiesofindividuals;inspeak-ing of the 'meaning response' (Moerman 2000) or the 'placebo effect',we recognize that social and psychological factors contribute to these in-dividualeffects.Butdrugsalsohavesocialandperformativeeffectsinthewaytheyconrmsickness,anddemonstratethecharacterandintentionsof those who administer them. Using a commonly recognized treatmentin a habitual (unarticulated, unconscious) way has this kind of socialefcacy. The problem of efcacy relates to perceptions of the powers of medic- inal substances. This brings us to the symbolic nature of medicines and thequestionofnotwhat,buthow,medicinesmean.Inchapter3we move from the slums of Manila to the Sahel plains of Burkina Faso. Whereas Manilamothersusemedicinesfromthelocalshop,Mossipeopleprepareremedies from plants and animals in their locality. The logic they use isone of connections between causes, symptoms and treatments of illness.A disease that makes a child's skin stiff and shiny like that of a snakemayhave been caused by its mother stepping over one, and should be treated with snake skin. Among the users of biomedicines, as among theMossi users of plant and animal substances, symbolic associa tions may be metaphoric (analogies of likeness) or metonymic (connections of part andwhole,forexample).Whenmedicinalsubstanceswithsuchmeaning-ful associations are applied to ailing bodies, they concretize the problem and thus make it accessible to therapeutic action of a tting symbolic nature. Suggesting connections and making disorder and its correctiontangible is the symbolic and very practical work of medicines, even thosesynthesized in factories and prescribed by doctors. This insight leads on to the next analytical problem, that of control. The materiality of medicines makes them graspable tools in the effort tocontrol disease. But control is a tricky matter. In chapter 4, we see thisillustratedinthecaseofdistressedDutchwomencontrollingtheiranxiety withbenzodiazepines.Whereasmedicalprofessionalsspeakofcontrollingormanagingadiseasewithmedication,theusersofmedicinesareusuallytryingtocontrolnotjusttheirphysiologicalsymptoms,buttheirsituation.Thatis,theyaretryingtomakeadjustmentssothattheycanmanagetheirlives and projects. Medicines are empowering in that they offer users ameansofcontrol.Inmakingthisassertion,weplacemedicineswithinthelifeworlds of situated actors.

Scepticismaboutbiomedicaldrugsisthethemeofchapter5.Welisten to patients in London who express their doubts about pharmaceuticalsand their resistance to biomedical hegemony. Some see them as danger-ous to health. Many contrast the articiality of pharmaceuticals to theauthenticity of nature and natural medicines. This kind of oppositionalthinking about medicines, so pronounced in the alternative, or comple-mentary,medicinemovementofourdayisfoundinotherversionswherebiomedicine is seen as an imported medical tradition. Despite the globalpopularity of pharmaceuticals, resistance to certain kinds of biomedicaldrugs, or critically characterizing the whole category of Western or allo-pathicmedicines, isreportedfrommanydevelopingcountries.Wesuggest that scepticism be seen as a kind of cultural politics, in which medicinesareusedtoexpressissuesofidentity,controlandpower.Oppositions may be implied more than explicated. For the users of drugs, the personal is political in that they critically evaluate the larger connotations of putting medicinal substances into their bodies. The providers: medicinal commodities and social relations of therapy Turningtowardstheprovidersofdrugsinthenextsection,webeginwith drugvendorsandtheircustomersinaWestAfricanmarket.Commodi-cationisthethemeofchapter6.TheexamplefromCameroonillustrateshow antibiotics are sold like other commodities, having effectively es-caped the regulation that was intended to restrict their free exchange.This situation is common in many developing countries. It works to theadvantage of those who make their living by selling medicines and it is alsowelcomedbythecustomers.Commodicationcanbeunderstoodintwo different senses: medicines are commodied; and in a larger sense,so is health. Following Appadurai and Kopytoff, we show how the things themselv esaredivertedfromtheenclaveofprofessionalcontrolandmade common. That is, they are freely accessible and available to anyone with money; they are familiar and popular. The commercial interests in thesevaluable items ensure that they reach the remotest villages. They havelively commodity careers. This must be seen in terms of the other mean-ing of commodication: the idea that health can be purchased in theform of medicines or even that recovery from any illness requires buyingmedicines. In the following chapter, we continue with the topic of selling drugs, but use it as a way of examining the articulation of sectors in health careAn anthropology of materia medica 17 systems. The ethnographic setting is Mexico and Central America. The actors are pharmacists and their customers. Ideally pharmacists are pro-fessionals who ll prescriptions written by doctors. They are part of theformal and professional sector of biomedical health care. In reality theybridge sectors. Pharmacists often function like physicians, providing ad-vice along with medicines, even suggesting diagnoses. In Latin America,as in many parts of the world, the attendants in drug shops are often nottrained pharmacists. Restrictions on sales of prescription drugs are notnecessarily observed; that is, pharmacy shops function like part of theinformal sector. As members of the local community, 'pharmacists' mayshare local ideas about medicines, rather than adhering strictly to stan-dardbiomedical guidelines.Theymaythusbridgethedistinctionbetw een biomedical and indigenous or traditional medicine, perhaps selling both kinds.Inasense,commodicationisthedynamichere,mixing,bridgingand breaking through notional boundaries. One kind of provider of medicines well known in many developing countries is the injectionist. Chapter 8 sets out the history of injection provision in Uganda as a basis for discussing the issue of technology. In- jections are extremely popular ways of administering medicines; in factmost households own their own needles and syringes. With injectable chloroquine and penicillin for sale in local shops, 'high tech' medicine is readily available. In order to understand the use of injectable medicines today, we must analyse technology in the broad sense of material cul-ture linked to knowledge, procedures, social roles and meanings. Like alltechnologies, injection practices in Uganda have purposes (injection is apractical art) and institutional histories. They became routinized as thehigheststandardofcareinformalbiomedicalfacilities.Theygainedsocialefcacy as the recognized token of 'best treatment' carrying a moral con-notation about the quality of therapeutic relationships. In time they werecommodied, made common, as providers offered them for sale outsideof formal health facilities. Their meanings are shaped by local ideas ofillness and the body, but in turn injections form those ideas by symbol-ically localizing illness in the flesh and blood. In the era of AIDS, newmeanings concerning trust and personal relations have been attributedto injection equipment. Physicians are the prototypical providers of medicines in professional medical traditions. In writing prescriptions, they communicate instruc- tions about medicating disease. Chapter 9, about prescribing doctors,takesthethemeofcommunicationandunfoldsittoshowthemanyways,in addition to inscription, that physicians communicate with patientsaboutmedicines.Infact,theycommunicatewithandthroughmedicines,as well as about them, as shown in the example from Sri Lanka where18 Part I Introduction verbal communication is minimal. In a busy clinic, where high-caste doctors were treating poor, low-caste patients, there was limited verbalexchange about symptoms and diagnosis. The two parties had differentperceptionsofillness,andtherewasnotimefordialogue.Bothhadgreatcondence in the medicines, however, and the act of prescribing func-tioned as a positive gesture that allowed them to avoid discussing theirdifferences. Writing a prescription is an effective way of ending a consul-tation, and conveying authority and concern. Yet in other situations, thedoctor does try to communicate with the patient about symptoms, andhere medicines with their concreteness provide effective ways of pointingup elusive sensations. Adjusting prescriptions is a procedure that helpsdoctorstocommunicateaboutpathologicalprocesses.Apatientconsult-ing a doctor of Chinese medicine may become more attentive to changesin her mindful body knowing that she must monitor them in order to report to her practitioner who adjusts the medication in follow-up visits. Thusprescribing,withitswriting,itsdialogueaboutmateriamedica and its unspoken (mis)understandings is a rich communicative practice with implications for the patient's experience of illness and the doctor's abilityto reach out to patients. The strategists: marketing images and regulating practice In the third section of the book, we turn away from the immediate con- cerns of ill people and the practices of passing medicines from providersto users. We focus on the strategists, who plan and direct the movementsand uses of medicines from more distant positions. Chapter 10 is aboutthemanufacturersofcommercialmedicineswhomarkettheirproductstobothusersandproviders.Theexampleofcompaniesmaking'traditional'Ayurvedic and Unani medicines in India shows that manufacturers areproducingimagesaswellasmaterialthings.Inmanywaysthecompaniesare modelled on those that manufacture biomedical pharmaceuticals . They test their products and make scientic claims about their efcacy.At the same time, they distance themselves from biomedicine by under-lining the superiority of the Indian tradition with its values of purity andharmony with the environment. Ethnographic studies of pharmaceuti-cal companies are extremely rare. But by studying marketing practices(advertising, package inserts, the activities of sales representatives), it ispossibletotracetheculturaleconomyofthemanufacturers.Themarket,cultureandmedicineformthreesidesofatriangle.Commercialaimsareclothed in cultural values of scientic integrity and humanitarian con-cern.Theyplayonlocalvaluesandimages,whileclaimingthelegitimacyof a universal science.An anthropology of materia medica 19 In the headquarters of international organizations, in national min- istries of health, at conferences in big hotels, in the ofces of donoragencies, other strategists are concerned with medicines. Chapter 11 fo-cuses on health planners concerned to improve the availability and effec-tive use of medicines. It presents the case of the attempt by the WorldHealth Organization to establish and implement an Essential Drugs Pol-icy that would encourage rational and economical choices concerningdrugs. Limited resources should be spent on drugs that are necessary,effective, safe and affordable for use against the most common treatablediseases. In many ways the policy was seen as inimical to the commer-cial aims of the drug industry. It encouraged health managers to evaluatethe market critically and to choose on the basis of objective health needs,ratherthandemandsnurturedbythepharmaceuticalcompanies.Twoan-alyticalissuesemerge clearlyinconnectionwiththeanalysisofmedicines in the hands of health planners. One has to do with the process of policy formation,inwhichdifferentinterestgroupscontend.Thedrugindustr y, doctors and AIDS activists lobby against some or all of the limitations on drugs to be purchased in the public sector. Private sector commercialinterests are reluctant to accept regulation on what drugs they may sell.The second issue concerning the planners has to do with the effects of policies.Healthplannersproducepapers,anddisputeaboutthecontents of the papers. But transla ting paper policies into action is a complicated affair. For in reality drugs are in the hands of all the kinds of actors high-lighted in this book. Assumptions about efcacy, symbolic associations,hopes for control, scepticism, commodication, lack of strict regulation in health systems, the seduction of technology, communication by pre-scription, and commercial interests all play in to the circulation and useof medicines. The book concludes by considering a category of actors that has been implicit throughout: anthropologists who describe and analyse the sociallivesofmedicines.Throughparticipantobservationwetooarecaughtupin the sociality of medicines and take stances on the kinds of knowledgewe produce and the ways it is used.
