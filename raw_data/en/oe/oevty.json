Life Force is the world's first ISO 9001:2008 certified homeopathic clinic with an attached research wing. We have been practicing ISO modalities since 2002, which has made our system much more quality conscious than most others in the world, in the homeopathic practice category. Nephrotic Syndrome is a kidney disease where there is an abnormal leakage of protein, low levels of proteins in the blood, and swelling of body parts. Clinically proven homeopathy helps recover faster, reduce (and stop) the need for steroids, reduce frequency + severity of attacks in many cases. At Life Force, Dr Shah has worked on over 940 cases of Nephrotic Syndrome as of Sept 2021, from across 180 countries. Early cases respond better. Patients who are dependent or resistant to Cortisone or other immunosuppressive medicines pose more difficulty in reducing their dependency, in our experience. Know information on Nephrotic Syndrome and its Homeopathic Treatment My experience with Life Force is life-changing. My association started 10 years back when my son was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. After experimenting with allopathic medication and doing the full research on nephrotic syndrome we zeroed down to homeopathy (Dr. Shah). miraculously my son got cured and my believe in holistic medication started. I have also undergone treatment for gastric and frequent cold from Dr Shah. There is a significant improvement in gastric (nearly 80-90%). Visiting the clinic for the first time in 10 years and the experience was very fulfilling. I started the medicines from April 2012, since then I have got one major relapse of Nephrotic Syndrome (Minimal Change Disease) where I had to take steroids. Though there have been minor re-lapses where the protein leakage in urine starts but there is improvement in the frequency and time-lapse between such cases. Mostly such instances get healed without resorting to steroids. Last relapse was in February 2014. The first one since starting homeopathy in April 2012 and the only one since then. (Uploaded on 22nd September 2015 by Dr M. N. P.) Manav was suffering with Nephrotic Syndrome since 18 months of age. We have been treating him at Dr Rajesh Shah's Lifeforce Homeopathy Center for 1year now and he has been improving since then. There is no protein in urine since 1 year. Manav has not shown a relapse of Nephrotic syndrome for almost a year now. He is not on steroids or any allopathic medicines since almost a year. We are very happy to have met Dr. Shah. Thanks to the medicines prescribed by Dr. Shah, we would highly recommend others with Nephrotic Syndrome to Dr. Shah. Regards, Suraj Caculo My daughter who is undergoing your treatment for Nephrotic syndrome is doing really well and we are very pleased with her progress; a whole year has gone by and she has not had a relapse. She herself is feeling much better and her confidence within herself is building as she thinks she is getting better. This is with regards to ongoing treatment of Nephrotic syndrome for my daughter, she is shaping well with no relapse of Nephrotic syndrome for almost one year. As she is responding well to the medicine that she is put in to, I would like to continue using the same medicine.
