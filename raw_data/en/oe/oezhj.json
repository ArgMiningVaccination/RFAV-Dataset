This memorandum is concerned only uith the psychotherapist-Patient privilege. This is one area of the Evidence Code that is in need of consideration on a priority basis. We have received a number of com\u00ad munications concerning claimed deficiencies, and several law review articles have been published pointin~ out suggested revisions.

THE CASE FOR TIlE PSYCHOTHERAPIST-PATIENT PRIVILEGE The case for the psychotherapist-patient privile~e has been made, and made well, by nucerous legal scholars. It is enough here to brief\u00ad ly reiterate the thinking which led to the enactment of the ~rivilege in California. Tne standard test for the legitimacy of a privilege is the one devised by Professor Wigmore. The test has four parts, as follows: (I) The communications must oriEinate in a confidence that they 'lill not be disclosed. (2) This element of confidentiality must be essential to the full snd satisfactory ,~intenance of the relation between the parties. (3) The relation must be one which in the opinion of the conmunity ought to be sedulously fostered. (4) The injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation. The California Law Revision Commission concluded that each of these requirements is ,oet in the case of the psychotherapist-patient rela\u00ad tionship. In sum, the conclusion was this--treatment of the mentally ill is too important, and the assurance of confidentiality too central -2-to it, to risk jeopardizing the whole because of the relevance of some patients' statements to some legal proceedings. A further argument in favor of confidentiality, and not noted by the Law [.evision Commission, is the fact that the revelations of a patient to his therapist are for the most part not of such a nature as to be useful as evidence. Although absolutely necessary in treatment, data from free\u00ad association, or fantasies, or memories, are not reliable for use in court as they mostly represent the way the person experience an event, and not how the event occured. They are not \"facts' . Psychic reality is not the sa~e as actual reality . As the material revealed in psychotherapy does not deal with reality of the outer world, it would make poor, yet prejudicial evidence. [Slovenko, Psychiatry ~.!!. ~econd Look at the lledical Privilege, 6 !layne L. llev. 175, 194 (1960).] This argues that the benefit to be gained for the correct disposal of litigation, under Wigmore's fourth test, may indeed be slight, thus strengthening the argument to preserve the confidentiality of the communications. The ultimate recommendation of the Law I:evision Commission called for a privilege which would cover a psychotherapist who is a psychia- trist or clinical psychologist. '.'it;, this'>rid history no',' in focus, tqe can proceed to exa.:line each section of tne California Statute. lliiALYSIS OF PSYCHOTlIERAPIST-PATIZNT PRIVILEGE STATUTE Section lOlO. Definition of \"Psychotherapist\" The staff recommends that Section 1010 be amended to read as fol- lows: -3-1010. As used in 'this article, \"psychotherapist\" means: (a) A person authorized, or reasonably believed by the patient to be authorized, to practice medicine in any state or nation who devotes, or is reasonably believed by the patient to devote, a substantial portion of his time to the practice of psychiatry t ~ (l) A person licensed as a psycholo~ist under Chapter 6.6 (commencing uHh Section 2900) of Division 2' of the Business;in\\'d Professions Code t . (c) A person licensed as a clinical social worker under Arti\u00ad cle 4 (commencing with Section 9040) of Chapter 17 of Division 3 of the ,]usiness and Professions Code, when I>e such person is engaged in applied psychotherapy of a nonmedical nature. (li) A persoll who is serving as a school psychologist anc holds a credential authorizing such service issued by the state. (e) A person licensed as a marriage, family and child coun\u00ad selor under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 17800) of Part 3, Division 5 of the Business and Professions Code. (f)! person licensed ~~ licensed educational psychologist under Chapter i (commencing with Section 17800) of Part .h Division 5 of the Business and Professions Code. ---(g) ! oerson who is serving as ~ psychiatric social worker 1n ~ mental health services facility of the State of California, \u00a3! ~ person Who .!!!. servinr. ~ ~ psychiatric ~cial ,,yorker with substantially the ~ qualifications and duties ~ ~ ~te psychiatric social worker l!! ~ men tal health services facility provided El. the county \u00a3! qualifying for r aimbursement under the California Io.edical assistance program under Section 14021 of. th~ HeIfar\" and Institutions Code. \u00a3! under Title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act regulations thereunde~ \"hen ~ch natur~ , Comment On suggested amendments. Subdivision (f) is added to include within the definition of psychotherapi8t a licensed educational psychologist. Enacted ill 1970, .\"rticle 5 (commencing \"ith Section 17860) of Chayter 4 of Part 3, Division 5 of the Business and P~ofes- sions Code provides for the licensing of licansed educational psycho- logists who may engage in private practice and provide substantially the same services as school psycholog~sts which already are included within -' ,- the definition of psychotherapist under subdivision (d). 'See Dus. Co Prof. Code ~ 17861. In fact, the qualifications for a licensed educa- tional psychologist are more s~ringent than a school ,psy\"holngist, the licensed educational psychologiE t beJng required to have three years of -4-full-time experience as a credentialed school psychologist in the public schools or experience which the examining board deems equivalent. See Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17862. [For the text of Bus. ~ Prof. Code ,\u00a7 17861 and 17862, see Exhibit I attached.] Subdivision (g) is added to include a psychiatric social worker engabed in applied psychotherapy of a nonmedical nature within the definition of psychotherapist. By excluding psychiatric social workers, the existing privilege statute often works to protect the rich and deny the poor, Nho must rely on psychiatric social workers, not psychia- trists, for their psychotherapeutic aid. The subdivision is narrowly drawn to include only those psychiatric social workers who have substan\u00ad tially the same qualifications and duties as a state psychiatric social worker. [See Exhibit II for the specifications for Psychiatric Social Worker for the State of California.] The definition is further limited to those psychiatric social workers who work in state or county mental health services facilities or in mental health services facilities qualifying for reimbursement under the California medical assistance program or under Title XVIII of the Pederel Social Security Act. For a justification of extending the privilege to include confidential com\u00ad munications to psychiatric social workers, see DnderprivUege<! Communications: Extension of the Psychotherapist-Patient Privile;;,e .to Patients Social 110rkers, 61 t;al. L. ~ev. 1050 (1973)[copy of this article at- tached]. For a case holding that the,psychotherapist-patient privilege does not nON aJply to psychiatric social workers, see Belmont v. State Personnel Bd. , 36 Cal. App.3d SIll, [Copy attached as ~xhibit III.] Insofar as this case reveals the problem of the relationship of the privilege to the duty of the public employee to -5-comply with regulations of the employing public entity to disclose information to the employee's superiors, the same problem arose in connection with the school psychologist under the psychotherapist- patient privilege and has, as far as I can determine, been satisfacto- rily tforked out. Out-of-state psychotherapist. Additional policy issues are raised by Section 1010. The first noteworthy point is the matter'of the out- of-state psychotherapist. Under subdivision (a), a psychiatrist li- censed, or reasonably believed to be licensed, in ~ state \u00a3I nation, qualifies as a \"psychotherapist. By way of contrast, the persons described in the remaining subdivisions--psychologists, clinical social workers, school psychologists, marriage counselors, and the like, li- censed in other jurisdictions would not qualify as psychotherapists.' Several reasons might be advanced for the distinction. California is unwilling to rely on the quality of the licensing procedures of her sister states; it is felt that it is not necessary for California to foster the psychotherapeutic relationship in other states; the extension to professionals licensed in other states would uake the statute diffi- cult to draft and administer. The validity of the first two reasons is doubtful in light of Section 2912 of the ;;usiness and Professions Code ,\" which provides: 2912. \"othing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or prevent a person who is licensed or certified as a psychologist in another state or territory of the United States or in a foreip:n country or province from offering psychological services in 'this state for a period not to exceed 30 days in any calendar year. The proposed Federal Rules of Pvidence include within the privilege medical doctors and psychologists. The definition of psychotherapist included \"a person licensed or certified as a psychologist under the -6-laws of any state or natior .. \" ;!otwithstanding this provision of the propose<;i federal rules, the staff recommends against any similar revi- sion of subdivisions (t\u00b7) ane! follot,ing of Section 1010. It is difficult enough to define the ;>ersons to be er\"braced under those subdivisions when only persons practicine in California are taken into consideration. ':redical practitioners generally. A second, and major issue, is the definition of the psychotherapist in Section 1010(a) as one licensed to practice medicine \"ho devotes a substantial portion of his time to the practice of psychiatry. This definition excludes the general pralCti- tioner who does not .levote a substantial portion of his time, to.l'sychi- atric practice. The proposeci federal rule differs. T2e federal counterpart to Section 101O(C!) reads \"a person authorized to practice Hedicine in any state or nation , while engaeed in the diagnosis or treatment of a mental or e,motional condition \" The cornments to the proposed federal rule state: The definition of psychotherapist embraces a medical doctor while engaged in the diagnosis or treatment of mental or emotional condi\u00ad tions in order not to exclude the general practitioner and to avoid the making of needless refined distinctions concerning what is and what is not the practice of psychiatry. The Law Revision Cornnission has addressed and rejected the idea of incorporating the general practitioner while enga~ed in psychotherapy under the proviSions of the statute. The Commission noted that the general practitioner ordinarily has not had special training in psycho- therapy, and is presumably not as competent in this area as the psycho- therapeutic specialist. 1~e Commission went on to point out that the 3eneral practitioner will ordinarily deal with less serious cases. The Commission also noted the lack of any evidence that the general practi- tioner had been hindered in any way because communications between him -7-and his patients were not protected by a psychotherapist-patient privi\u00ad lege. Finally, from the standpoint of judicial administration, it would be difficult to dete=ine just when a physician is acting as a psycho\u00ad therapist and when he is not. Though the comments to the federal rule suggests otherwise, it is likely that the federal rule would in fact have severe difficulties in its administration. It is certainly an easier question to determine whether a doctor devotes a substantial amount of time to psychotherapy than it is to decide in a particular case whether or not a doctor was engaged in'psychotherapy. In the latter case, the word of the doctor 'TOuld often be all that would be available to decide the question. Take this example of how the rule might operate. If the family doctor inquires, 'Hal. did you sprain your ankle? 0, and the response is, 'lfuile walking my mistress home from a date.\", the response is not privileged. If the family doctor asks, \"tf,IY are you depressed?\" and the patient says, \"Because 1 just murdered my mistress.\", the patient's statement is privileged. See Krattenmaker, Testimonial Privileges in Federal Courts: An Alternative to the proposed Federal Rules of Evidence, 62 Geo. L.J. 61, 7Q (1973). The administrative problem then, presents one strong reason for not extending the privilege to the general practitioner when engaged in psychotherapy. In addition, the pull to extend the privilege is not in fact so strong. The general practitioner will only occasionally find himself taking on, the role of psychotherapist. and it could well be argued it is a role he best leave to those with specialized training. A look,at Wigmore's four tests, and some thinking about public policy lead to the conclusion that the decision to exclude the physician remains the better practical solution. -8-Professor Friedenthal reaches the opposite conclusion. .;e would alter the California section in line with the federal rule. See Study at par,es 28-29 (item I). Section lOll. Definition of \"Patient\" lOll. As used in this article, \"patient' means a person who consults a psychotherapist or submits to an examination by a psy\u00ad chotherapist for the purpose of securing a diagnosis or preventive, palliative, or curative treatlllent of his mental or emotional con\u00ad dition or who submits to an examination of his mental. or emotional condition for the purpose of scientific research on mental or emotional problems. Scientific research provision. Section 1011 defines 'ratient\" to include a person who submits to an examination of his mental or emo- tional condition for the pur?ose of scientific research on mental or emotional problems. The drafters of the proposed federal rule chose not to include a person submitting to examination for scientific purposes. rlowever, 42 u. S. C. 242 (a) (2), as amended by the Drug Abuse and Control i'.ct of 1970, P.L. 91-513, authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education and lIelfare to withhold the identity of persons who are the subjects of research on the use and effect of drugs. The decision to include those uho submit to examination for scien- tific purposes seems a wise one. It promotes a desired goal--volunteers for research--from which the community clearly benefits. Further, there is no reason to believe tnat communications divulged under test circum- stances would be any less embarrassing to the individuals involved. Finally, this logically seems a case where the deterrent argument is strong. The benefits derived by those volunteering for research are small, and the threat of having confidential communications exposed might well be sufficient to keep many away who might otherwise volun- ~ acder by the Drug and Control Act of 1:j7f.j~ P ~t~ 91-5 i_:~ ~ I~ obtained by an examination (\"r the ~jet Lent J transmitted between a patient <lud hls psychothera;>lst in the course of clpe pre8\u20ac::'lt tt> f~rtl;er the .interest of patient in the consul ration, including otl'&.l. \u00b7PJ'.JJ.Eln \u00a3!:esent ~~he accompli.f)hment of the whi.e:h the is Ln\u00ad cludeii a('~v~_~.e by ,Dsychothe:tapist in A The psychotherapist .,ho received or made a communica\u00ad tion subject to the. privilege under this article shall claim the privilege .,henever he is present when the communication is sought to be disclosed and is autho:::ized to claim the privilege under subdivision (c) of Section 1014. lie have no taatters to raise in connection >lith this section. For a discussion of cotupar\"ble rule provision, see Study on page 30, item 3. Section 1016. Exception: ~etient-litigant exception 1016. There is no privilege under this article as to a cOmF.unication relevant to an issue concerning the mental or emo\u00ad tional condition of the patieat if ouch issue has been tendered by: (a) The patient; (b) Any party claiming through or under the patiel1t; (c) '~lY party claiming as a beneficiary of the patient through a contract to which the patient is or was a party; or (d) The plaintiff in an nction brought under Section 376.or 377 of the Cod.\" of Civil ProceduLe for damages for the injury or deat!, of the patient. Over a per~o~ of years, the Commission has received a number of communi- cations ~hat contende\" that ,~ defendant in a rcrJcnal:'injnry case \"some- times used the retient-litigant exception to the psychotherapist-patient privilege to go afeer embar.ras~ing information that had no relevance to the per\u20acon\"l '.\"jury aetiGn in un \"ttempt to discourage the plaintiff fron going fOlw'\"rd \",',th his The Commission never seriously con\u20acidered th\"se sugr,estions but planneci to consider them when it reviewed th\" ~xl'~rience under the ;;vid~nce C::>de at the time the compa- rable provisions of t~e Federal Ruleo ot Evidence were considered. The st~,ff bcli(.vee that ,,~ rf';'isic.n of Section 1016 the issuo of the proper balance between protection of the confidential communications and the necessity for disclosure to get at -13-the truth in litigated cases and provides the needed guidelines. The case is outlined in an extract (set out as Exhibit IV) from a paper by Robert Plattner prepared as directed research for Professor Friedenthal. A related point, also discussed in the extract set out as Lxhibit IV, is whether the existence of the psychotherapeutic relationship itself should be privileged. The privile3e presently protects only the confi\u00ad dential communications, not the existence of the relationship. However, as dr. Plattner points out in his paper, In re Lifshutz lDay provide protection, for example, against an effort to discover this information where it is not relevant to an issue in the personal injury action. The staff recommends no revision in the statute to provide protection beyond confidential communications. Other Exceptions Other exceptions are provided by Sections 1017-1027. l'e have no problems with these exceptions. It should be noted, however, that they are broader exceptions than are found in the comparable federal rule. The text of Sections 1017-1027 is set out below. For a discussion of these exceptions and the narrower federal exceptions, see Study on pages 30-32, items 4, t.:;: iJ.L'11self Of to the person or r-r~1{'t~:ty a...'1d t.hat disclosure of article proceedi1!5 brought by or !he to. a p')bhG ~fnp-llly-e~ as to information requited to be.

The staff recommends that Section 1028 be repealed. Under this section. communications made to psychiatrists snd clinlcal psychologists are privileged H; criminal proceedings, '\u00abhile those made to clinical 90cl&1 workers, school psychologists, and marriage counselors are not. A number of years ago, the Commission proposed to extend the scope of the privilege to confidential communications to the latter three groups, and the bill passed the Legislature. It was vetoed by the Governor. It was strongly opposed by law enforcement officers who objected to the privi\u00ad lege applying in criminal proceedings, but the Commission refused to ,amend the bill to limit the privilege to civil proceedings. The Commis\u00ad sion believed that it 'JaS more important to encourage potential patients to, seek treatment for mental ana emotional disorders and was convinced that fear of disclosure of communications in criminal proceedings would discourage them from doing so. On balance, the Commission believed that the benefits to society of having treatment far outweighed the benefits to society of having the conviction of patients more certain by 1\u00b7;aking their communications to their psychotherapists admissible in criminal proceedings. This is especially important in drug addiction cases but it is important in other cases as well. Society is adequately protected by two other exceptions to the privilege: Section 1027 (no privilege \"here child under 16 is victim of a crime and disclosure in best inter\u00ad ests of child) and Section 1024 (patient dangerous to himself or others). In addition, the psychotherapist is personally liable for failure to exercise due care to disclose the communication where disclosure is essential to avert danger to others. Tarasoff ~ Regents of University ~ California, 13 Ca1.3d 177, 529 P.2d 553, 112 Cal. \"ptr. 129 (1974). For further discussion, see Study on page 29 (last oaragraph on page). hore important, the effect of the section is to deny the privilege to the poor and lONer-middle class and allow it \"ith respect to pre\u00ad cisely the same kind of information to the upper-middle class and the rich. It is also claimed the section discriminates against psychothera\u00ad pists on a sexual basis since it is clai@ed that the great majority of clinical social uorkers are women. Joth these points are well developed in the letter from Professor I'ap1an of Stanford Law School, which is attached as Exhibit '1. The staff considers the repeal of Section\u00b71028 a matter of great practical importance and strongly recommends the repeal of this section. 1laiver The Comwission has received communications indicating a grmiing con ~rn that disclosures made to obtain coverage on medical insurance or for dedi-Cal program coverage TIlay amount to a waiver of the physician- patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege. The same problem is presented by waivers or disclosures made pursuant to applications for life insurance. The staff proposes to discuss these problems in connec- tion 'lith its discussion (in a subsequent Jemorandum) of :';vidence Code Section 912. He merely note the matter nOl.' so you will not assume we have overlooked it. -18-Respectfully submitted, John ,;.

(Extrdct from paper prepared by Robert Plattner, May 26, 1975, Stanford La,,' Schoo1.] The second important question Y6ised by 1012 is whether the very exiat- ence of the psychotherapeutic relationship should itself be privileged. It has been noted that \"unlike the patient sufferins from an organic illness, ';\"person in psychotherapy, by dnd large, visits his psychiatrist with the same secrecy that a man goes t~\"a bawdy house. \"i9 If the privilege covers only the content of a communication and not the fact of a relationship, the identity of a treating psychiat\"i~t can be elicited under a discovery demand. This could then be used to frighten the patient, despite assurances from his attorney, into thinking that the very private disclosures he has made to his psychotherapist \"ill be l'evealed in open court. There is simply of -.-.r', te1ling the number of ca'ses \"hich patient\" have dropped or failed to initiate f f f d\u00b7 1 20 or ear 0 1SC osure. Anargumeht can be made then, that unlike other privileged relationships, the very existence of the psychotherapist-patient relationship should be kept confidential. There is language in the 1970 case of ~ ~ Lifshutz, 85 C~1. .:.. 21 Rptr. 829, 467 P.2d 557 ,,,hich indicates that the court, without change in the law, might in fa ot consider such information privileged. As \"le shall see, the question we are presently addressing is part of the larger question faced ly. Slovenko, supra note 4, at 175 20. See Slovenko, Psychotherapist-Patient Testimonial Privilege; A Picture of'; Misguided. HOpe, .t. -1-by the Supreme Court of California in Lifschutz ~ the core issue of tbe proper balance between protection for confidential communications and the necessity for disclosure to get at the truth in litigated cases. The Lifschutz case provides the most valUdble guid~nce available as to the balance which now exists, as interpreted by the court, in C~lifornia-\"'i VI. LIFSCHUTZ AND SECTION 1016 Lifschutz focuses primarily on Section 1016 of the Code, which creates an exception in the privilege as to communications relevant to ~n issue con- , '. i-, cerning the mental or emotio~l condition of tl:1e patient if such issue has been tendered by the ~tient himself, or by those claiming through him. The thinking behind this exceptio~ is evident; the patient should not be able to use the privilege as a sword as well as a shield. _ The critical issue is how closely the court >rill guard the ~onfide~tiality Of the psychotherapist-patient privilege in the face of this exception. In Lifschutz, Ute court answered this question at length. Among the important pronouncements by the court in Lifschutz were the following: ., (1) Under d properly limited interpretation the patient~litigant excep- tion to the psychotherapist-patient privilege does not unconstitutionally infringe the right of privdcy. (2) Because of the potential invdsion of a patient's constitutional interests, tri~l courts should properly and carefully control compelled dis- closures of psychotherapeutic pa tient s. (3) The patient-litigant exception allows only a limited inquiry into --. '--..... --- .. the confidences of a psychotherapist~~tientpriYlJeKe~.C.!lmpell.i:pg disclosure of only those :directly relevant to the natur~.o..f'j;.!Je_ .. s~l:;ific condi- tions the patient has tendered BS issues in his pleading or in discovery inquiries. ~2-(4) The \"automatic\" waiver of the patient-litigant exception is to be con- strued not as d oomplete waiver but as a limited waiver concomitant with purposes of the exception. (5) The burden rests upon the patient initially to submit some showing that a given confidential communication is not directly related to the issue he has tendered to the court. (6) Even when confidential information falls within the patient-litigant exception, trial courts may utilize the protective measures at their disposal to avoid unwarranted intrusions into the psychotherapeutic relationship. (7) The patient or psychotherapist, during discovery, may apply to the court for a protective order to limit the scope of the inquiry or to regulate the procedure of the inquiry so as to best preserve the rights of the patient. The court obviously recognized the social and moral importance of the pro- tection of important confidential communications, and has struck a highly desir- able ba lance between that need a nd the need for inforIl'.a tion for fa ir and a c cura te litigation. The patient, as \\,e ;;ere discussing ea rlier, may in fa ct be forced to dis- close the existence of a paychotherapeutic relationship, and he ;;ill in fact bear the burden initially to show that a given communication is not directly relevant, but he ;;ill hdve a number of safeguards he may employ. The exception \"ill include only those communications \"directly relevant\" to the issues tendered by the patient. The court suggests thdt necessary dis- 22 closures could be made ex parte in the judge's chdmbers. Further, under Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 2019(b), a court can issue an order to protect a party 22. In Re Lifschutz, 2 Cal.3d 415 at 437, 467 P.2d 557 Rptr. B'2:.jEit 843. or opprf:'ssion\".

Del'loully Law Revision Commission Stanford Law School Stanford, CA 94305 Dear John, Here is a copy cf the letter I sent to Otto Kaus. Secondly, ! want to ~Jrite you concerning Section 1028 of the Evidence Code. Essentially, that_ section says that in a criminal case the psychotherapist privilege is res\u00ad tricted solely to psychiatrists and psychologists and is denied to clinical social workers. To my mind this rule is not only indeftmsible, it is discriminatory in an especially unpleasant. way. First of all, r b'1ink you can find no one to deny that; the kind of psychotherapy per- -formed by licensed clinical social workers is precisely the same as that performed by psychologists and psychia\u00ad trists short on~y of two differences which, though prac\u00ad tically important, are irrelevant to onr concern (psychia\u00ad trists can both presc=ibe drugs and commit to a mental insti tuti\u20acln) l<!ore significan1.:, perhaps, this difference in treat\u00ad ment betWeen the clinical social worker on the one hand and the psychiatrisl; and psychologist on the other, operates to discriml.nate in two very importallt. ways. First of all, althougn they per.focm basica.l1y the same types of psycho\u00ad therapy, the clinical sccial liorker is much more often work\u00ad ing in either a mental hea.lth center, family service agency, or ether ager,cy. If~ is undeniable that\" these agencies tend to get those who simply cannot: afford the more expensive therapy provi_ded by the psychiatrist and to a lesser extent the psychologist. lu, a result, for the most_ part, the effect of the section in q'.lestion is t.O deny the privilege to the poor and lower-middl e elttbs anl: allow it with respect to precisely the samE kind of iLformation to the upper-middle class and :-11e rich '\" I cannot also riO\">i pOinting out t:.here is another t.lj_8crimi_nati I')n i,nhe\u00b7':-ent in Section 1023.

UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS: EXTENSION OF 111E PSYCHOTllERAPfST-PATIENT PRIVILEGE TO PATIENTS OF PSYCHIATRIC SOCIAL WORKERS The law of evidence in most jurisdictions contains a highly signifi\u00ad cant limitation: communications from a client who consults a private psychiatrist for treatment of mental or emotional illness arc privileged, while similar communications from a client to a psychiatric social worker are not privileged. This state of affairs stems from the failure of mosl evidence codes to provide testimonial immunity for psychiatric social workers who, as the mainstay of the staffs of most puhlic men\u00ad tal health facilities, are virtually the \"poor man's psychiatrist.\" This Comment analyzes some of the consequences that result from the failure to provide statutory privilege to psychiatric social workers and proposes a number of legHl theories courts could use to create or ~tend the privilege. Section r discusses in detail some of the problems that denial of this privilege creates for both patients and psychiatric Boclal workers. Section II examines the traditional test [or determining whether a relationship merits tile protection of privilege, and applies it to the psychiatric social worker-patlen! relatioll5hip. Section III ad\u00ad vances an argument based on fUllctional similarities between presently privileged professionals and psychiatric social workers. Section IV pro\u00ad poses an argument based 011 agency principles. Section V discusses the problem from an equal protection perspective, and Section vI pro\u00ad poses an argument based 011 equitable considerations.

Indeed, they figured prominently In the deliberations of at lenst one group charged with drafting legislation relating to medical prlvllege.

Courts have refused to permit n physician or attorney to Invoke privJ1ege when It was clear that he was not really performing medical, or legal services. For example, courts have denied privilege to 0 law\u00ad yer who was In reality serving as a tax consultant Dr general business advisor.

Rodrl/lue1..'1 The Court had before it a claim that Texas' s=heme for raising revenues for school districts unconstitutionaHy discriminated against residents 01 poor districts. Although after lengthy consideration the Court decided that the Texa; plan did not discriminMe against the poor, It seemed to leave Intact the princIple that wealth may be a suspect classification.\" After reviewing past cases Involving Indigency, the Court developed a twofold test. TO F!rst, it must nppear that the classification singles out a clearly defined group that by reason of Its impecul1ity is unable to pay for a valuable benefit. Second, as a result of the classification, the group must sustain absolute deprivation of a meaningful oppor\u00ad tunity to enjoy the benefit. Both requlremenb ar~ met In the case of indigent patients of psychiatric social workers. The poor have no realistic access to pri\u00ad vate psychiatry;'1 and those who receive care at the hands of psychi\u00ad atric social workers are d~nicd the benefit of privilege.\" Other tradi\u00ad tional indicia ot a suspect c1a.sification are also very much In evidence in the case of poor persons who suffer from menta) illness.

It coul<l be IIrgued that c~tcnd!ng privilege to lin additional class makes it more difficult to resist subsequent claims by new groups for privileged status, As was obsl)rvcd, how\u00b7 ever, this purpose call be served by <Irawlng the line to include only groups whose legitimacy hns reeciY'cd state recognition through llcenslng statutes or the establishment of a state job category.\u00b71 With state con\u00ad trot and supervision the danger of quackery would be minimal, and II ready meallS for resisting premature claims by new groups would be avallab!e. Given the impressive array of reasons favoring extension of the privilege to patients of psydliatric socia! workers, the relative Insub\u00b7 stantiality of the interests the statr seeks to protect, and the manner In which the statutory sch~me discrimin~tes against a suspect class, it is unlikely that the state will be able to satisfy the compelling interest standard required to justify the in'~quity currently perpetrated by most privilege statutes, B. The Rat/onality Test Even If the courts do not apply the compelling interest standard of equal protection review, however, withholding the privilege of con\u00ad fidentiality from pntients of psychiatric social workers probably cannot survive under the Jess stringent rational basis test.\" Under the rational basis standard, legitimate reform measures need not solve every aspect of a p,oblem,\" Nor is a statute void if it might p',ssibly fail to achieve its desired effect.\" Nevertheless, a c1rum that a classification is rational may be defeated by showing that the classification cannel further the purpose underlying the legisllltion.1I 93.

Moreover, extending a grenter degree of protection to private pa\u00ad tients than to indigents ~ml only fails to achieve the legislative goals, it is Invidious ns well. One common definition of a rational classifica\u00ad tion Is \"one which includes nil persons 'Nho are similarly situated with respect to the pnrpose of the law,'\u00b7I.' If privilege statutes c~ist in or\u00ad der to encourage the free flow of thoughis and feelings essential {or the therapeutic r~!ationshlp,' ua there is no rational justification for as\u00ad suming that this need is Ic.,s in the ,use of indigent paliell!s. On the contrary, it is generally recognized that the need for trust and confi\u00ad dence is greatest in dealing with the poor.'''' Thus, the classification suffer~ from lock of rationality In two key respects. It fails to promote its legislative objective and it draws a dis\u00ad tinction bel ween the wenltl,y and the PRI\\'ILEGH llY E~TOPPJlL The government owes a duty to those In its care to ensur~ that 99.

Indeed, psychiatric socia! workers lire required by their professional code to provIde an atmosphere of trus1.'\u00b7\u00b7 Thus, it is inevitable that many patients of state-employed psychiatric social workers wlll receive the Impression, from nonverbal clues and suggestions if not from overt assurances,lOt that their communications will be held in confidence. When state agencies hire psy,chiatric sodal workers knuwing of their professional commitmcnt to confidentiality, and when they !lSsign them duties which require such confidentiality to b~ performed successfully,l1O the state must assume a share of responsibility for fostering in the minds of many unsophistic<1tcd patients the belief that communications to the therapist will remain private.

The relationship between n psychiatric sOCial worker and his pa\u00ad tient, while currently unprotected by legislation, Is such a relationship. It Is in the best interest of society that it be protected. Legislatures should act in this critical area.

PRELIMINARY PROVISIOI~S; WORDS AND PHRASES DEFll'IED The first two divisions of the California ~vidence Code generally have no federal counterparts. Division 1 aimply gives aome baaic rule. of construction regarding such matters as tenses, genders, aingular and plural, etc. DiVision 2 defines basic words used in various placea throughout the coUe. Sometimes thess definitions are crucial to under\u00ad standing the substantive aspects of the state statutes, such as the definitions in \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 225 of \"hearsay evidence\" aod \"statement,\" The federal rules are organized differently. The definitions of \"bear\u00ad say\" and \"statement\" for example, appear in Rule 801, the basic rule OIl hearsay, and the only rule to which these definition. are pertinent. For purposes of analysis, whenever-definition. differ between federal and .tate provisions, the differences are discussed in connec\u00ad tion with the particular substantive rules of evidence which ara af\u00ad fected. DIVISION 3. GENERAL PROVISIONS Chapter 2. Province of Court and JUry California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 310-312 generally diacuss what .. ttera are to be decided by the court as a matter of lew and what matters are to be determineri by the trier of fact._ The Federal Rules of Evidence not contain similar provisions. Although there is no harm in placing such provisions in the Evidence Code, they would seem more appropriate 1n the Civil Procedure Code. (Deciaions on preliminary facta relatias to the admissibility of evidence are not treated here but in separata sections discussed below.) Chapter 4. Admitting and Excluding Evidence Article 1. General Provisions--Basic rules of relevancy in cali\u00ad fornia are governed by \u00a7 210 which defines \"relevant evidence\" and iii 350-352, ~1hicb define what is and what is not admissible. Their counterparts are Federal rrules 401-403, which are identical in sub\u00ad stance. ;;vidence Code ~~ 353-356 deal with special problems such as the effect of erroneous rulines of the trial court on the admission or exclusior, of evidence, and the admissibility of evidence for a limited purpose. These same matters are covered by Federal Rules 103, lOS, and 106, which again are practically identical in substance with the fol. lowing exceptions: 1. Ilhen evidence has been excluded, and the ruling challenged, both Federal Rule lu3(a) (l) and California Evidence Code i 354 provide that the ruling will not be overturned unless at the time of the rulles the court was made aware of the substance of the evidence involved by means of an offer of proof. However, unlike the federal rule, i J54{c) of the California statute exempts from this requirement any situation in which the evidence was sought by questions asked during cross or re\u00ad cross-examination. The reason for this exem~tion is unclear. It is true, of course, that on cross-examination, unlike direct, the ques\u00ad tioner may not knol'1 the answers to the questions asked, but it is dif. ficult to see why this should be allowed to interfere with the basic purpose of 5 354 to permit a subsequent court to see just what informa\u00ad tion was .excluded. Even if the trial court was incorrect in excludinft the evidence, if the information was of trivial significsnce, the csse should not be reversed or a new trial ordered. Uithout such information appellate court~ have '-itt::.e choice lout to overturn any decision in which excluded evidence might conceivably have altered the outcome. There seems little reason why a party should have to make an offer of proof with regard to direct examination and not to cross-examination. In either case, an appellate court is in the same difficult position if it does not have before it the substance of the evidence excluded. The matter is complicated by the fact that it is not always clear what is examination versus cross-examination. Under California Evidence Code \u00a7 776, for example, one party can call to the witness stand an opposing party who may then be exaruined \"~!!. under cross-examination.\" (Emphasis added.) Suppose the trial court improperly upholds an objec\u00ad tion to an examining party's question in such a situation. Is an ofter of proof unnecessary to preserve the fuStter for appeal because this is cross-examination? Or do the words \"as if\" mean thst the examination is -3'-to be treated as direct examination except for the technique of ques\u00ad tioning, in which case 5 354 would require an offer of proof. Given these uncertainties of application, plus any clear justifiea\u00ad tion for a special exemption, \u00a7 354(c) should be eliminated. 2. Section 354(b) exempts from the offer-of-proof requirement situations in which \"the rulings of the court make compliance * * * futile.\" The chief purpose of this exemption is to avoid the necessity of multiple objections when it is clear from prior rulings that evidence will not be aduitted and the reasons therefor are clear. For example, if the court rules out any evidence on an issue, on the ground that the issue is not material to the csse, a party should not have to make an offer of proof on the matter with regard to the testimony of each and every witness. However, the language of ~ 354(b) seems inappropriate to its purpose. Use of the word \"futile\" indicates that an offer of proof is unnecessary if it is clear that the evidence uould be rejected at trial. This has nothing to do with the major purpose of the offer of proof, to provide a proper record for decision on motion for new trial or appeal. Federal Rule 102(a) (2) handles the situation by exempting from the offer-of-proof requirement situations where the substance of the evidence is apparent fro~ the context within which the questions were asked. The federal rule is preferable and should be substituted for \u00a7 354(b). Even the federal wording is somewhat uncertain and should be clarified to ensure that what is required is a clear record to be avail\u00ad able on subsequent challenge. J. Federal l(ules 102 (c) and (d) have no California counterparts. Section ec) admonishes courts in jury cases to avoid presenting inadmis\u00ad sible evidence to the jury. suggesting that offers of proof be made outside of the hearing of the jurors. The matter is so obvious that DO specific California statute is required. Rule l02(d) permits parties, on challenge to rulings on evidence, to assert \"plain errors affecting substantial rights\" even though they were not brought to the attention of the judge who made the rulings. Such an escape clause probably should be included in the California Evidence Code to avoid miscarriages of justice. Admittedly, the matter is a difficult one; the presence of such an \"escape'; induces litigants -4-on appeal to raise all sorts of matters that should have been but were not raised below. One must count on courts to restrict the operation of such a clause only to grievous situations. Article l. Preliminary Determinations on Aoimissibility of Evi\u00ad dence--California E'-vidence Code :;~ 400-406 govern the determination of preliminary fact questions upon which admissibility of evidence depends, Federal Rule 104 deals lJith the same matters, but in a much less de\u00ad tailed manner. 1. The California Code divides preliminary questions into two basic types, those to be deterlliined solely by the judge as a matter of law and never brought to the attention of a jury, and those in which a court decision admitting the evidence may be . second-guessed\" by the jury. In the latter category, defined in 5 403, are situations, and only situations, in which the preliminary question governs whether the eVidence is relevant, or whether a witness has personal knowledge of the subject of his testimony, or whether a proferred writing is authentic, or, finally, whether a person msde a statement or engaged in conduct when that statement or conduct is the evidence sought to be introduced. With regard to these, and only these matters, the court not only must make its m<n decision on admissibility, but then, if the evidence is admitted, the court \"may, and on request shall, instruct the jury to determine Whether the preliminary fact exists and to disregard the prof erred evidence unless the jury finds that the preliminary fact does exist. \" Federal Rule 104 has no provisions of this type. Rule 104(a) merely states that preliminary questions concerning the adn,issibility of evidence shall be determined by the court. However, Federal Rule 104 (e) , lolhich is nearly identical in wording to ~ 406 of the California Code, specifically perwits a party to introduce before a jury, eVidence rele\u00ad vant to the loleight of evidence or to a witness's credibility. Since all of the preliminary questions within \u00a7 403 relate to the weight or credi\u00ad bility of evidence, the same evidence which is presented to a California jury will also be admissible before a federal jury. The difference is that in the federal court no specific instructions are mandated as they are under \"403. Suppose for example that a trial judge determines that a witness has first-hand knowledge of the matters to which he testifies, -5-but the jury disa1';rees. In California the jury normally ..,ill be told that it must ienore the testimony; in federal court, the jury may give the testiL10ny less weight because of its hearsay nature, but the jury will not ~e ordered to disregard it. Although Federal Rule 104 takes the orthodox view that is gener\u00ad ally, but not universally applied in most courts, see dcCormick, Evi\u00ad dence J ~3 (2d ed. 1972), the California approach is not irrational or unjustified. If it has any drauback, it is the difficulty that an attorney has in deciding the nature of the preliminary facts involved in a particular situation. See generally the official comments to J 403 and 405 which discuss the various types of situations in \",hich the jury is and is not instructed as to preliminary fact determinations. Unless courts and attorneys are shown to have had substantial difficulty in applying the current California rules, however. there seems little reason for altering theul. In this regard see Kaus, All Power ~ the Jury--California's Democratic Evidence Code, 4 Loyola L. Rev. 233 (1971), a scholarly analysis, severely criticizing the Cali\u00ad fornia provisions. 2. Federal Rule l04(d), which has no state counterpart, provides that an accused does not, by testifying on a preliminary matter, subject himself to cross-examination on other issues in the case. This is of substantial importance, since it allm,s an accused to give such testi\u00ad mony without waiver of the right to self-incrimination. The matter may sufficiently be covered by California Evidence Code ~ 773(a) which limits the scope of cross-examination to matters brought up during direct examination. To some extent, a broader scope of crosl\u00ad examination in the particular situation may be unconstitutional, see United States .!!. Simmons, 390 U.S. 377 (EIMl). :;evertheless even though Federal Rule ti11(b) generally limits the scope of cross-examination, as does G 17J(a) , promulgation of Rule 104(d) was thought necessary to clarify and protect the right of a criminal defendant with regard to testimony on preliminary matters. It would seem useful and appropriate for California to adopt a similar special provision. 3. Federal Rule 104(a) states that when a court makes a decision on a preliminary fact for evidence purposes, the court is not bound by the rules of evidence (except for the rules of privilege). Courts, including California courts, traditionally have relied on affidavits and other forms of hearsay to make all types of legal decisions. llowever, with respect to preliminary decisions on the admissibility of evidence, California has frequently been cited as a classic example of a state that does not permit use of otherwise inadmissible evidence. In 1962, the California Law Revision Commission in its Tentative Recommendation and ~ Study l~lating to the Uniform Rules of Evidence, Article VIII. Hearsay Evidence, pp. 46~-471. discussed the matter at some length and recommenJed adoption of a clause similar to that now adopted in Federal Rule 104(a). Indeed the Advisory Committee to the Federal Rules relied heavily on the California Study in adopting 104(a). Yet the California legislature rejected such a clause in the California \u00a3vidence Code. This position should be reexamined since it goes against the views of virtually every commentator who has considered the matter. See, e.g., \"kCormick, Evidence p. 122 n.91 (2d ed. 1972). Chapter j. lJeight of Evidence California Evidence Code % 410-413 govern the ~1eight to be given various types of evidence. Such provisions are norn~lly thought to involve matters of civil procedure rather than of evidence and hence are not contained in the Federal Evidence Rules. There is no particular reason, hmlever, for repeal of any of these provisions which basically state matters of simple logic. UIVISION 4. JUDICIAL NOTICE Californis's judicial ,notice statutes, Evidence Code \u00a7 \u00a7 450-460, are based on Rule 9 of the Uniform Rules of \u00a3vidence, adopted in a number of states. The federal approach to judicial notice differs in several ways from the California provisions. 1. The federal rule, Rule 201, is specifically limited only to adjudicative facts, i.e., those which would otherwise be presented to a trier of fact for decision. So-called legislative\" facts, i.e. , facts upon which the court determines the applicable law, are not included. These ' facts\" are usually put forth by lawyers in briefs to convince the court to adopt a particular legal principle. The California code does not distinguish between legislative and adjudicative facts. Second, the -7-federal rule doe~ not include judicial notice of foreign or domestic law or regulations, whereas California la'. expressly includes these matters. !leither of these differences is sufficient to justify alteration of the California provisions. Discussion of the determination of legisla\u00ad tive facts is largely academic in :he context of CaLfornia law which permits judicial notice only of indisputable facts. If a judge believes a fact to be indisputable, legal determinations Hill be \",ade accord\u00ad ingly, whether or not it is said that the fact is \"judicially noted.\" If the judge thinks th-c fact is disputable, judicial notice would be improper. Under federal rules judicial notice of law or regulations is considered to be a matter for procedural, not evidentiary rules. In\u00ad deed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 specifically deals with the manner of proving the la\", of a foreign country. Since la>'Yers in Cali\u00ad fornia have become accustomed to treating judicial notice of law as , evidence,\" there seems little reason to shift these provisions to the Code of Civil Procedure. 2. California Evidence Code I 457 requires the court, on request, to instruct the jury to accept as a fact any matter judicially noted. Federal Rule 201(g) does so only in civil cases; in criminal cases the court must tell the jury that it may ;'but is not required to accept as conclusive\" judicially noted facts. This limitation in criminal caaes was added by the House Cmamittee on the Judiciary which felt that a mandatory requirement in criminal cases was in violation of the spirit of the 6th Amendment right to trial by jury. Arguably, it is like a directed verdict of guilt which is not permitted. California should not accept the federal version for two reasons. First, the federal rule is illogical; the notion that the right to jury trial requires an instruction to a jury that it can properly ignore indisputable facts Is ridicalous. A jury ~ do so, but there is no reason to put an official stamp of approval on it. Secondly, the rule is written so as to permit the prosecutor as well as the defendant to obtain such an instruction. A finding of guilt based on jury rejection of an indisputable fact which would have required acquittal is not only absurd, but contrary to the spirit of both federal and state consti\u00ad tutions. -(l-DIVISION 5. BURDEN OF PilOOF AND PRESUIIPTIONS Division 5 of the [,vidence Code deals extensively with burden of proof and presumptions. The rederal rules do not touch on burden of proof and mention presumptions only to state that in the absence of a specific statute or rule to the contrary, they shall he considered only to shift the burden of producing evidence and not the burden of persua\u00ad sion. The California code in ~\u00bb 003 and 604 defines the criteria for two different types of presumptions and in Article 3 (\u00a7\u00a7 630-646) and Article 4 (\u00a7\u00a7 660-669) lists specific presumptions that fall into the categories. Federal Rule 302 specifically provides that state rules of presump\u00ad tion shall apply in federal cases to ~Ihich state law is applicable, thus recognizing the justification for local regulation. Given the careful definitions and examples in Division 5, the Evidence Code should not be altered to adopt the more general federal rule providing a \"presumption\" as to the type of presu~ption. DIVISIO\" 6. \\HTllESSES Chapters 1 & 2. Competency and )tequirements of Oath Federal Rules on competency and requirements of taking an oath generally parallel California rules, except: 1. California Evidence Code \u00a7 701 holds a ~dtness disqualified if he cannot express himself directly or through an interpreter so as to be understood or if he is incapable of understanding the duty to tell the truth. There is no comparable federal rule. however, evidence of such witnesses could be, and undoubtedly should be excluded under the gener\u00abl provision (Rule 403, cf. California Evidence Code \u00a7 352) for avoiding evidence that wastes time or is unduly prejudicial. There seems no reason to alter the California rule. 2. California Lvidence Code \u00a7 703 permits a judge to testify in a trial over which he presides, if, but only if, it is agreed upon by all parties, in advance of his being called. If any party objects to his being called, the judge must declare a mistrial and order the case transferred to another judge. Under Federal Rule 605 a judge is incompetent to testify in a trial over which he presides. This rule seems preferable to the California provision, despite all of the latter's safeguards. If the testimony relates to highly controversial oatters, the judge, on his own, should disqualify himself. aut if he does not, a party and his attorney 11i11 be very reluctant to refuse permission, even though such refusal would result in a trial before a different judge. The first judge would still be a witness and a party may fear that the testimony will be colored by the judge's feeling that his integrity has been questioned. The lawyer may fear that an objection to the judge's taking the stand may turn the judge against hll:l in subsequent cases. The only time '~hen a presiding judge's testimony might be justifi\u00ad able is \"hen the issue first appears in the middle of trial, and is non\u00ad controversial. The testimony could then avoid the cost and delay of a new proceeding. 6ut if the matter is non-controversial, so that the parties would not object, they may reach the identical result by stipu\u00ad lation. Even on what appears to be the simplest, most direct matter, an attorney could ask an improper question, or the judge as a witness could blurt out an inadmissible answer. The judge, acting as judge, would be in the undesirable position of having to rule on the propriety of his own testimony. It is therefore recommended that the federal rule be adopted in jllace of present EviJence Code \u00a7 703. 3. Evidence Code 5 704 permits a juror to testify to the panel on which he is sitting, if but only if it is agreed by all the parties in advance to his being called. Federal Rule 606(a) declares a juror incompetent to testify before the panel on which he is sitting. lbe federal provision seems preferable. Although the dangers of prejudice are not as great when a juror testifies, as when the presiding judge does so, it is fundamentally unsound to allow jurors to be wit\u00ad nesses. One cannot expect a juror to be objective as to her own testi\u00ad mony; furthermore the deliberations cannot be as free and open as they should be. A party who refuses permission for a juror to testify ruay fear that the juror will be able to ascertain which party made such refusal and will be biased against the objecting party for impugning the juror's honesty. In almost any case in which all parties would be willing to permit juror testimony, undoubtedly on non-controversial facts, the pur~ose can be accomplished by stipulation. California J 704 should be repealed and Federal ~ule 606(a) adopted. -u-Chapter 3. Expert \\'litnesses 1. The California definition of an expert in !3vidence Code J 720 generally parallels Federal ~ule 702. Also the rules as to court apt>ointed experts (California Evidence Code 5\u00a7 722(a), 730-733; Federal Rule ~re consistent with one ~other, except thpt Rule 706(a) specifically requires a court appointed expert to advise the parties of any findines he makes and specifically allows the parties to take the expert's deposition. It would appear useful to amend California Evi\u00ad dence Code 0 732 specifically to add similar provisions. Parties should automatically receive a copy of such an expert's findings in order to be able to deal uita the expert's testimony at trial. The current dis\u00ad covery provisions in )J 2016 and 2019 of the California Civil Procedure Code appear adequate to ~ermit the taking of such an expert's deposi\u00ad tion, but a specific clause alloNing such a deposition \"ould clear up any uncertainty that a court appointed witness is to be specially treated. 2. Evidence Code ~ 721(b) zoverns the cross-examination of an expert in regard to scientific, technical or professional publications. Such publications \",ay be utilized only if the witness referred to or relied on such publication in forming his opinion or if the publication has itself been admitted into evidence. 1:his rule must be considered in light of the very limited hearsay exception for books of this type. Pursuant to Zvidence Code \u00a7 1341, \"historical 'IOrks, books of science or art, and published maps or charts'; are admissible only when offered to prove facts of general notoriety and interest. On the other hand Federal Rule 303(18) excepts from the hearsay rule statements in historical or scientific publica\u00ad tions if \"called to the attention of an expert uitness upon cross\u00ad examination or relied upon by him in direct examination,' \"and estab\u00ad lished as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice.\" There is no specific federal rule solely governing cross-examination of experts by use of publications because Rule 803(18) obviously allm~s any reli- able work to be admitted into evidence and hence used for cross-examination. Because California does not have a provision akin to Rule 803(18), cross-examination of experts based on authoritative statements in lead\u00ad ing publications can be thwarted if the lJitness merely states that he -11-did not refer to the publication in forming his opinion. The restric\u00ad tive view taken in ~viuence Code\" 721(b) resulteu from fear that a zealous cross-examiner, if he could utilize statements in any scientific treatise, would be able to place unreliable or interested statements before the jurors who Illir,ht then consider then for their truth, rather than for the limited purpose of deciding if the expert witness <las or was not reliable. Certainly this danger can be overcome with less stringent methods. First, there seems little reason to prohibit cross\u00ad examination based ou publications that the witness himself admits are authoritative and reliable, even though he did not refer to then. Secondly. if other experts establish the reliability of a particular authority there seems little reason to permit the witness to thwart his own cross-examination by his refusal to acknowledge the validity of the work. There is no need to alter Evidence Code ~ 721(b) to achieve a more desirable result. If \u00a7 1341 is altered to conform to Federal Rule 803(18) to permit admission of reliable scientific treatises an an exception to the hearsay rule, then under the terms of \u00a7 721(b) such treatises can be used for cross-examination purposes. It should be noted that such a change might be less dramatic than might first,appear. Under the present law, if an expert is called by one side to give an opinion, it is arguable that passages from publica\u00ad tions would not be barred if introduced solely to show what he relied upon as opposed to the truth of what they say. See California Evidence Code ~ 802 which permits an expert to \u00b7'state on direct examination the reasons for his opinion and the matter * ~ * upon which it is based.\" If ~ 302 is read to permit introduction of publications and, if they are not excluded as unduly prejudicial, they would be in evidence and could be used to impeach any opposing expert under 9 721(b). llhere a change in California law would have its most important effect is in a case in which the defending party wishes to challenge plaintiff's expert without the expense of calling an expert of its own. If it could induce plaintiff's expert on the stand to acknowledge the reliability of the publication sought to be used, or if the court could take judicial notice of the reliability, much time and expense could be saved. Such a ne~1 provision would be especially helpful in caseS in -12-,Iunicipal or Justice courts in which the sums involved cannot justify the cost of expert testimony. Further consideration of this matter is contained in the discussion of ]. 1341. Chapter 5. l1ethod and Scope of ;;xanination In general the federal rules governing examination of witnesses are in harmony >lith California Evidence Code provisions. The latter are detailed in spelling out such matters as the order of examination, the right to recall witnesses, and >lho is an adverse ,,,!tness for cross\u00ad examination purposes, whereas the Federal );ules leave the matter up to the court. However, the California provisions are sufficiently flexible to obviate any practical differences. A few specific matters do require special consideration; 1. California Evidence Code \u00a7 770 provides that extrinsic evidence of a witness' statement inconsistent with his testimony is not admis\u00ad sible unless the witness has an opportunity, on the stand, to explain or deny it. This provision is parallel to Federal Rule 613(0) except that the latter specifically exempts from the rule admissions of a party\u00ad opponent, which can be introduced into evidence whether or not the party-opponent has taken the stand. It is obviously not the intent of \u00a7 770 to restrict introduction of such admissions when a party decides to testify and contradicts the admission. See California Evidence Code 5 1220. For clarity, a new subdivision (c) should be added to ~ 770 exempting admissions of an opposing party. 2. California Evidence Code ~ 771 and Federal Rule 612 spell out the obligation of a party to produce any writing used to refresh a witness' memory. (1) Under \u00a7 Tne provisions differ in several important respects: 771(a), an adverse party has a right to inspect such a writing whether or not it was used to refresh the witness' memory before or during testimony. Federal Rule 612 provides a right of inspection only if the writing was used to refresh the witness' memory on the stand; production of writings used to refresh a witness' recollection prior to testimony is allowed only when the court \"in its discretion determines [that production] * * * is necessary in the interests of justice. \" -13-The latter languarre uas insertec_ by the House Comm! ttee on the Judiciary to avoid an automatic fishing expedition by one party into the papers of opposing counsel. This limitation !'lakes practical sense since an attorney otheI'\\~ise \"ill feel obli3ated carefully to exclude from the file shown to a potential witness any doculCLents which the opposing party has not seen and is not entitled to obtain through discovery. The potential harm under ~ 771 (a) is enhanced by \"hat would appear to be a technical drafting error. Unlike Federal Rule 612 which governs .,ritings used to r .. fresh a witness' memory for the purpose of testi\u00ad fying,\" \u00a7 771(a) applies to any writing used to refresh a witness' memory \"with resl'ect to any !'latter about which he testifies.\" The California statute thus ap~ears to require production of a document even though the witness had reviewed it months prior to his testimony and for an entirely different purpose. It would thus seem appropriate to revise [ 771 (a) to conform with the relevant provisions of Federal Kule 612. In doing so, however, care should be taken to ensure preservation of the right of the defendant in a criminal case to compel the prosecution to produce any >ltitten state\u00ad l,'ent of a prosecution witness relating to matters covered in that wit\u00ad ness' testimony. This, right exists whether or not the written statement has been used to refresh the witness' recollection. See People ~ Estrada, 54 Cal.2d 713, 355 P.2d 641, 7 Cal. ~ptr. 897 (1960). A nearly identical federal provision is established by the so-called \"Jencks\" statute, 18 U.S.C. G 3500, and is referred to specifically in a special clause in Rule 612. (2) Federal ;{ule 612 contains the following provision: \"If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine 'the ./titing in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto.\" The California rule, on its face, requires the entire writinl) to be produced. It I~ould seem appropriate to amend \u00a7 771 to add the quoted sentence. This provides protection for a party from unwarranted intrusion into matters having no bearing on the testimony. (3) Under 3 771, failure of a party to comply with a demand to produce a writing used to refresh a witness' testimony requires that the -14-testimony be stricken. (T:,ere is no penalty ,.,hatsoever, however, if the document is not reasonably procurable.) By way of contrast, Federal Rule 612 provides for the striking of testimony only if the prosecution in a criminal case \"elects not to comply. Under any other circum\u00ad stances, the court has discretion to \"make any order justice requires.' If \u00a7 771 \"ere to be amended as suggested in 0) and (2) above, the automatic penalty it now contains liould not be inappropriate, and, indeed, is arguably preferable to the uncertainty of l'ecieral \u00abule 612. But given the current language of ~ 771, the automatic striking of testimony seems particularly harsh since a party ~ay wish to withhold dOCUlllents solely because disclosure of matters contained therein, irrel\u00ad event to the witness' memory, may be embarrassing or prej udicial. Thus, if the remainder of :: 771 is to be retained as is, the portion pertain\u00ad ing to the penalty for the failure to produce should be altered to provide the flexibility nm; contained in Federal Rule 612. 3. California ~vidence Code \" 775 provides, as does Federal Rule 614, that the court may call and interrogate \"itnesses. Federal Rule 614(b) goes on, however, specifically to permit the court to interrogate witnesses called by a party. Evidence Code :' 775 is alilbiguous. It permits the judge to interrogate \"itnesses called by the court \"the same as if they had been produced by a party.\" It is unclear \"hether this clause assumes that the court has power to interrogate a witness called by a party, or whether it merely means that the court's scope of inter\u00ad rogation of \"itnesses it calls is limited to usual rules of examination by parties. Since it is c9IDIDon practice for the court to interrogate witnesses called by the parties in the interest of gettin~ at the truth, a specific provision permitting such questioning should be included. Such a clause would fit well into Evidence Code 5 765 which generally gives the court pm;er \"over the mode of interrogation of a witness\" which itself could be read to peruit examination by the judge. Adding such a provision to ~ 765 would automatically lift the ambiguity from \u00a7 775. 4. California Evidence Code 5 777 allows the court to exclude witnesses from the courtroom when they are not subject to examination, except for parties. Federal Rule 615 is parallel except that it also prohibits exclusion of a person \"hose presence is shown by a party to -15-be essential to the presentation of his cause. It is reconnnended that this clause be aiderl as subsection (d) of Evidence Code \" 777. It may well be that exclusion of such a person, e.g., an axpert .. hose presence is imperative to aid in the evaluation of the testimony of an opponent's expert, would constitute an abuse of discretion under current 5 777. ,'!evertheless, inclusion of the provision would eliminate doubt as to when exclusion of such \"itnesses is proper. Chapter 6. Credibility The California provisions regarding attacking and supporting credi\u00ad bility are generally quite similar to the federal rules. l.owever, California Evidence Code \u00a7 780 which lists many of the grounds upon which credibility can be attacked or supported, has no federal counter\u00ad part. Similarly, there is no federal provision comparable to Evidence Code \u00a7 782 dealing with credibility of a complaining witness in a rape case, or to Evidence Code \u00a7 791 dealing with rehabilitation of a witness by use of prior consistent statements. Provisions with important differences are as follows: 1. California Evidence Code; 787 prohibits for attack or support of credibility the use of specific instances of conduct relevant only to prove a trait of character (except for prior felony convictions). Federal Rule 608(b) is identical except that it pern,its the court, in its discretion, to admit on cross-exS9ination of a witness specific incidents \"(1) concerning his character for truthfulness or untruth\u00ad fulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruth\u00ad fulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.\" The federal rule tends properly to balance the need for effective cross-examination with the dangers of using specific isolated incidents of improper conduct by limiting the evidence to matters involving truthfulness. The right to confront a witness with the fact that the witness previously lied may be vital, even though the tlitness was not under oath or convicted of perjury. The rule itself provides that the court may in its discretion keep out such evidence, underscoring the power already granted in J 352, the general relevancy provision, which gives the court such power over any item of othen,ise admissible evidence. The question whether to alter the Cali\u00ad fornia law is a close one; on balance the federal rule seems preferable and \u00a7 7~7 should be amended to conform to it. -1':-If j 787 is altered to permit limited inquiry into specific inci\u00ad dents, then an additional sentence included in Federal Kule 608(L) should also be added as follows, \"The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by any other \"itness, does not operate as a waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination when examined with respect to mat ters which relate only to credibili ty. ;, When a witness takes the stand, he cannot claim the~rivilege of self-incrimination as to matters about which he testified, thus defeating meaningful cross-examination. However, \"hen cross-examination refers only to specific incidents as to the witness' credibility, it is too harsh to require a lJaiver of the privilege of self-incrimination, and it could result in grave abuse. A witness could be called solely with the thought in mind to trap him into admitting a prior criminal perjury. This is possible since a party can impeach his own witness. California Evidence Code \u00a7 785. If this safeguard is not adopted, then the admission of specific incidents regarding truthfulness should not be allowed. 2. California Evidence Code ~ 788 provides for impeachment by evidence of a prior conviction of a felony. Federal Rule 609(a) ~iffers in that it allows (1) evidence of any conviction punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year or (2) any conviction, regardless of the punishulent, involving dishonesty or false statement. There are nany difficulties \"ith the California provision. First, the \"felony\" designation is imprecise when related to convictions outside California. Suppose, for example, that another state designates all of its crimes as felonies? The federal designation in Rule 609(a)(1), related to the punishment, is preferable. It also appears to coincide generally with the definition of a felony in California. Thus, at the very least \u00a7 788 should be altered to substitute for the word felony a clause relating to the punishment available for the crime in question. Both Federal Rule 609(a)(1) and Evidence Code \u00a7 788 are deficient, however, in not distinguishing the ~ of conduct. ~fuy should any felony, even one not related to truth and veracity, be adnissible to impeach a witness? The arguments for a different approach are well documented. California Law Revision Co.mdssion, Tentative Recommen\u00ad dation and A Study ;,elating to the Unifor<ll ';<ules of Evidence, Article IV. Witnesses, pp. 756-761 (1964). These arguments were rejected when -17-the new Evidence Code was adopted. The California courts have, however, made clear that the nature of the crime involved should be considered when the court decides .. hether the prejudicial effect of evidence of conviction outweights its probative value. See Comment, 9 U. San Fran\u00ad cisco L. Rev. 491, 504-50H (1975). Federal :lule 609 (a) (2) goes beyond Evidence Code \u00a7 788 to permit evidence of nonfelony convictions involving \"dishonesty or false state\u00ad ment.\" There is evidence that 609 (a) (2) is poorly drafted, and that what .,as meant was \"dishonesty and false statement. ,. Convictions of petty theft or 1linor crimes of violence evidently were not intended by Congress to be included, as opposed to matters such as perjury, false statement, criminal fraud, embezzlement, or other crimes involving some element of deceit, untruthfulness or falsification. See Conference Committee Report on Rule 609(a), H.I:. 5463 in House Report No. 93-1597, U.S. Code & Ad. news, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. Ho. 12A, p. 88 (January 15, 1975). It would be proper to amend ,j 788 to permit evidence of conviction of nonfelonies, but limited to those involving elements of deceit or untruthfulness. These are more significant for meaningful impeachment than are felonies which do not involve such false statements. However, California should avoid two additional defects in the federal rule. First, admission of felony convictions are specifically made subject to a determination \"that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweights its prejudicial effect to the defendant,\" .. hereas no similar provision exists for nonfelony convictions involving dishonesty or false statements. Second, the Conference C01ll1'littee Ueport, cited above, '.lakes clear that this balancing clause, even in its application to felony convictions, is directed to criminal cases .. hen the defendant is the witness. The Conference Cmumittee states that, in all other situations, admission is automatic and not subject to discretion of the court, which would seem to render inapplicable the general provision that allows rejection of any evidence when prejudice outweights probative value. California should be careful in drafting its provisions not to arrive at a similar conclusion. The court should always have discretion, as it does with other types of evidence, to hold inadmissible convictions .. hich, in context, would be ~ore prejudicial than probative. See People -13-~ Beagle, 6 Cal.3d 756, 492 F.2d 1, 99 Cal. ~ptr. 313 (1972), upholding such ,Iiscretionary po er in cases involving Evidence Code \u00a7 788. 3. The California Evidence Code has no counterpart to Federal Rule 609(b) which generally prohibits impeachment of a witness by use of a prior conviction if ten years have elapsed since either the time of the conviction or release of the witness from confinement. Under Rule 609(b) the court can admit the evidence even after the ten year period has elapsed if the proponent of the evidence gives the adverse party advance written notice of his intent to introduce it so that the adverse party can contest its use and if the court finds that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. Ironically, the federal rule was adopted from an original proposed version of California Evidence Code \u00a7 783 which was rejected. 7 Cal. La~, Revision Colllt!lission, Reports, Recommendations, and Studies, pp. 142, ,44 (1965). The Federal provision does little more than put a somewhat heavier burden On the proponent of the eviJence after the ten-year period has elapsed. California courts are nO\\\u00b7, free to reject older convictions as being unduly prejudicial. In substance, little would be gained by adopting the provisions of Rule 609(b). Federal ~ule 609(d) also has no California counterpart. It allows evidence of juvenile adjudications to be used to impeach a \"itness, other than a defendant, in a criminal case. The evidence is admissible only if a conviction of the offense charged could have been used to attack the credibility of an adult anl the evidence is necessary for a fair determination of the issue of guilt or innocence. The purpose of the rule is to penlit exceptions to the prevailing view, followed in California (see 1~itkin, Evidence 1147 (1966\u00bb, that juvenile adjudica\u00ad tions are not convictions and cannot be utilized in any situation. ~eed for such evidence exists where guilt or innocence may hinge on the testi~y of a single prosecution witness whose past juvenile record of perjury, if admissible, casts grave doubt on what otherwise appears to be solid evidence of guilt. HO\\~ever, in an atmosphere such as that in California, where juve\u00ad nile records are generally inaccessible (see California Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7 827), and where the juvenile adjudication is deemed not to be a criminal prosecution for any purpose in order to protect the -H-minor involved (see California 1.'elfare and Institutions Code ~ 503), even such a limited rule Hould be um'ieldy and umdse. Application would be spotty depending upon whether an attorney somehotJ learned of the witness' past record. Prosecutors would normally have an advantage since each would at least know about those juvenile ~tters handled by his office. Finally, in difficult cases, a good citizen with a bad juvenile record might find his past, carefully concealed up to that point, spread on the public record simply because, through no fault of his own, he I.itnessed a relevant occurrence and was subpoenaed to testify concerning it. Unless and until the current notions of juvenile adjudications are altered, California should not adopt Federal \u00b7'ule 609 (d) . ). Federal Rule 609(e) provides that, although pendency of an appeal does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible, the fact that an appeal is pending is admissible. California has no concomitant provision, but case law clearly provides that pendency of an appeal does not affect admissibility. ~ee People ~ Scrivens, 276 Cal. App.2d 429, 81 Cal. R~tr. 86 (1969). It seems unnecessary for California to cOdify the case lal\" since the matter seems so obvious. The federal provision regarding the right to introduce the fact that an appeal has been taken is questionable. The filing of a notice of appeal is arguably irrele\u00ad vant. The federal rule may even encourage frivolous, \"temporary\" appeals of prior convictions. )0 special California provision should be adopted. 6. California Evidence Code 5 791 governs the admissibility of prior consistent statements of a witness to rehabilitate the I,itness after his credibility has been challenged. There is no comparable federal rule, and thus it appears that it is up to the federal court in each case to determine, under general rules of relevancy, when such rehabilitation is appropriate. The lack of a federal provision is surprising. Courts have traditionally limited use of prior consistent statements to situations in which a charge is made that the witness developed a plan or motive to give false testimony. See generally c'lcCormick, Evidence lOS-lOG (2d ed. 1972). A statement made prior to the time the alleged plan or motive was formed, if consistent with testimony at trial, is powerful evidence that no such plan was formed or carried into effect. Some courts go further and admit a prior consist\u00ad ent statement of a witness to bolster his claim that he did not make a -2 'j-prior inconsistent statement as claimed by the party who cross-eJ,amined nim. The consistent statement must have been made at or near the time the alleged inconsistent statement was said to have been made. Other than in these lirai ted situations, courts have generally excluded prior consistent statements. It must be remembered that such statements are hearsay with regard to their truth; when admissible to rehabilitate a witness they are relevant only because they were made. Yet it is difficult, if not impossible, for jurors to ignore the truth of such statements and consider them only in context of whether a wit\u00ad ness is or is not to be believed. :Ience, as noted below, modern courts provide a hearsay exception for such statements once they are admitted to rehabilitate; thus, the statements can be considered not only as to credibility, but for their truth as \"ell. This. of course. underscores the need for strict rules limiting admissibility. The fact that a ~,itness has said something over and over again may delude a jury into believing it is true. In fact, there is very little evidentiary value to such repetition since it in no way guarantees that a witness is not lying or mistaken. If prior consistent statements were freely admis\u00ad sible, attorneys would encourage potential witnesses to repeat their stories to a broad range of acquaintances. There is some indication that the lack of a federal rule governing admissibility of consistent statements was due to an oversight. F~al Rule 801(d)(1)(B) provides that prior consistent statements are not barred by the hearsay rule if they were made in a formal hearing subject to cross-examination and are offered to rebut a charge of \"recent fabri\u00ad cation or improper influence or motive\" on behalf of the .,itness to falsify his testimony. The quoted language is derived from the tradi\u00ad tional rule regardins the admissibility of consistent statements for rehabilitation purposes. This strongly im~lies that drafters of the federal rules assumed that the traditional limits would apply. Other\u00ad .,ise why not make the hearsay exclusion apply to any statement made in a formal hearing subject to cross-examination and admitted to rehabilitate a \"itness? Certainly there is no reason whatsoever to grant a hearsay exclusion solely because the statement rebuts a charge of fabrication; there is nothing in such a statement that renders it any more immune to hearsay dangers than any other consistent statement. -21\u00b7\u00b7 The structure of the California provisions regarding consistent statements is substantially preferable to the federal rules. Section 791 governs when the statements are adnissible for rehabilitation; \u00a7 1236 grants a hearsay exception for all statements that are admissible under ~ 191. IDportant differences between Federal nc:le 801 (d) (1) (B) and;; 1236 regarding when such state!Jents are admissible despite the hearsay rule are discussed later in the section on hearsay. There is some question, hOl,ever, as to whether 5 791 is not too liberal in ad\u00ad mitting prior consistent statefwents. Section 791(b) adopts the tradi\u00ad tional approach ad8itting statements to refute a change of recent fab\u00ad rication or improper motive, if the statements were c,ade prior to the alleged time the motive or decision to give false testimony was formed. However, \" 791(a) o;oes s01lewhat beyond the traditional rule by permit\u00ad ting a consistent statement to be admitted if the witness' credibility has been attacked by a prior inconsistent statement and the consistent statement was made prior to the inconsistent statement. The argrn,~nt is that the production of an inconsistent statement is, in itself, akin to a charge that the witness formed a motive to give false testimony and, therefore, \u00a7 791(a) is a mere extension of the general rule. This reasoning is very weak indeed. One can Bake inconsistent statements, and often does, without having formed a plan or ,,\"otive to give false testimony. A good examiner, on deposition, invariably will be able to push a witness to say things that will prove inconsistent with his subsequent testimony at trial. It is a rare witness who gives the exact same story twice. As noted above, in most situations, the value of a consistent statement is minor at best. After all, the witness has testified directly on the matters at issue and has been subject to cross-examination and re-direct. In sum, then, the existence of \u00a7 791 covering consistent statements is ~referable to the federal situation where there is no rule at all. On the other hand, S 791(a) should be reconsidered with an eye to its repeal. DIVISIOtl 7. OPFlIOi, TESTIilONY AND SCIEIITIFIC EVIDENCE The California Evidence Code contains a number of general pro\u00ad visions governing opinion testimony of lay and expert witnesses that parallel federal evidence rules governing the same matters. The Cali\u00ad fornia code contains tIm general provisions not covered in the federal rules, ~ 803 dealing with opinions based on improper matter and \u00a7 804 dealing with expert opinions based on the opinion or statement of some\u00ad one other than the ',itness. Ti1ese two sections are basicially proce\u00ad dural and do not conflict with any policy as set out in the federal rules. California also has a nUl1b,x of specific provIsions, regarding certain types of opinion that have no parallel in the federal rules. Chapter I, Article 2 (\u00a7\u00a7 glO-S22) contains special provisions for evi\u00ad dence of valuation in condemnation cases, and Chapter 1, Article 3 U 870) deals with opinio:J. on the question of insanity. In addition, Chapter 2 (Gil 890-897) incorporates the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity. Each of these sections has obviously been the subject of detailed, specialized study and the advent of the federal evidence rules is no reason for alteration. There is only one significant inconsistency between the California and federal provisions on opinion. Evidence Code ~ 800 allm.s opinion of a lay witness \"as is permitted by law, including but .!!\u00a3!:. limited to an opinion\" that is (a) based on first hand knowledge, and (b) \"helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony. ,; (Emphasis added.) Federal Rule 701 flatly limits lay opinions to those which are (a) based on first hand knowledge and (b) \"helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony \u00a3!. the determination of ~ fact in issue.\" (Emphasis added.) The open ended nature of the California provision is somewhat matched by the additional words in \"(b)\" of the federal rule. l.ven so, there are differences. Conceivably a lay witness in California could, in a proper case, give an opinion not entirely based on his first hand knouledge, \",hereas this would not be permitted under Federal Rule 701. For example, California courts permit a witness to testify as to the value of his own real property, see Ihtkin, California Evidence j 403 (1966). Such an opinion often will be based, at least in part, on statements of real estate brokers or others rather than solely on the witness I Olom perceptions. The California rule seems preferable to Federal Rule 701. The court should have flexibility to accept lay opinion whenever its pro\u00ad bative value outweights undue prejudice. -23-iJIVISION B. PRIVILEGI::S Differences 1et\"een Uivision 3 of the California ~vidence Code and the Proposed Federal Rules on Privileges Rejected by Congress] The provisions regardinG privileges in the Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence as approved by the Supreme Court, were rejected by Congress for t<10 reasons. First, many of the legislators believed that promul\u00ad gation of privilege rules l~as beyond the power of the rule makers and that the rules should be developed on a case by case basis. Second, specific proposed regulations on privilege were subjected to severe adverse criticism for their substantive content. See, e.g., Friedenthal, The Rulemaking Power of ~ Supreme Court: ~ Contemporary Crisis, 27 Stan. L. '~v. 673 (1975). It is important to keep the latter in mind when considering whether or not California should adopt the federal proposals. Chapters 1-3: Definitions and General Provisions California Evidence Code ,.J 900-905, 910-920, govern details of privilege not involved with the substance of the privileges themselves (e.g. , \"aiver, instructions, error in overruling claim, etc.). Some of the same ground is covered by Proposed Federal \u00b7'[ules 501, 511-513. California provisions reach beyond the scope of the proposed federal rules but there are no significant inconsistencies. Chapter 4. Particular Privileges Articles 1 and 2. Self-Incrimination. California Evidence Code ~\u00a7 930 and 940 provide that, to the extent the federal and state consti\u00ad tutions require, there shall be a privilege of an accused not to take the stand and a privilege against self-incrimination. There is no comparable federal proposal; one is not needed. Sections 930 and 940 obviously do no harm. Article 3. Attorney-Client Privilege. California Evidence Code ~~ 950-962 deal with the attorney-client privilege. Proposed Federal Rule 503 covers the same ground. There are a few differences as follows: -24-1. Section 955 requires an attorney to claim the privilege on behalf of an absent holder of the privilege, unless the holder of the privilege has instructed the laloyer to permit disclosure. Proposed Federal Rule 5:.J3(c) says only that the attorney \"may\" claim the priv\u00ad ilege on behalf of the client. The Advisory Committ~e's Note to Rule 503(c) states that it is assumed that professional ethics will require the attorney to claim the privilege \"except under the most unusual circumstances.' The California provision is preferable; it should be up to the holder of the privilege, not the attorney. to determine l~hen \"unusual circumstancesH exist. 2. Section 952 specifically includes within the scope of the privilege the legal opinion formed by the attorney and the advice given by him or her to the client. Federal Rule 503(b) is not clear, partic\u00ad ularly with respect to the legal opinion formed by the attorney, since only \"communications are protected. As a practical matter, an at\u00ad torney's opinion is not subject to pretrial discovery, see Federal :(ule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), and it is highly unlikely that a federal court would order the attorney to take the stand to reveal legal opin\u00ad ions relevant to a client's case, whether or not they involve communi\u00ad cations. tlevertheless, if opinions are to be within the privilege, the California provision is preferable to the federal rule. 3. Sections 960 and 961 of the California Code have no federal counterparts. They except from the privilege any communication relevant to the intent of a deceased client with respect to the client's deed, will, or other writing purporting to affect an interest in property or any communication respecting the validity of such a deed, will, or other writing. The position taken by the legislature in adopting these two provisions is that the intentions of a deceased person should be given effect and that the privilege, when claimed by the client's successor\u00ad in-interest who may benefit personally, should not apply. In all prob\u00ad ability the client would not have wanted the privilege to apply in such cases. See ilcCormick, Evidence G \"'4 (2d ed. 1972). There appears to be no justification for the elimination of 90 '160 and 961. Article 4. Privilege \"ot to Testify Against Seouse. California Evidence Code ':;\u00a7 970-973 deal with the privilege of one spouse not to testify or take the stand against another. Proposed Federal Rule 505 covers the same general material, but there are major differences. -25-1. Sections 970 and 971 give the privilege to the spouse who would otherwise be required to testify. T;,e federal proposal gives the privilege to the spouse who is the party. The state prOVisions are clearly preferable in this regard. The only purpose of this privilege is to preserve marital harmony. '.dthout the privile.:e the witness\u00ad spouse is placed in a very difficult position because he or she \".laY be expected to lie to assist the party-spouse. If, however, the witness\u00ad spouse is willing to take the stand and testify, the situation between the spouses is such as to require no protection. To allow a party to keep the witness from testifying will simply be a ploy to avoid justice. 2. Sections 970 and 971 apply to \"any proceeding.' The proposed federal rule applies only to criminal actions. :,ere again the state rule is preferable. If, as it must be, the purpose of the privilege is to safeguard marital harmony, requiring a spouse to testify in a civil case which could cost the party-spouse a large judgment or in an admin\u00ad istrative hearing that could result in loss of an important license might be just as damaging as testinony in a simple nisderoeanor or per\u00ad haps even in a felony case. 3. Section 971 specifically prohibits a party from calling to the stand the spouse of an opposing party without first obtaining the con\u00ad sent of the desired witness. There is no federal counterpart. Proposed Federal Rule 513(b) does provide that cases should be conducted in such a way to permit privileges to be claimed without knowledge of the jury. Section 971 is sensible and should be retained. Article 5. liarita1 Communications Privilege. California Evidence Code ~\u00a7 980-987 provide a typical privilege for confidential communi\u00ad cations between spouses. The proposed federal rules deliberately omit\u00ad ted this privilege. See the Advisory Committee's ;\u00b710te to Proposed Federal Rule of O:;vidence 505(a) nhich states as its sole rationale, the following: \"The traditional justifications for privileges not to testify against a spouse and not to be testified against by one's spouse have been the prevention of marital dissension and the repuBnancy of requiring a person to condemn or be condemned by his spouse. 8 fJigmore a\u00a7 2228, 2241 (i-1cilaughton '{ev. i961). These considerations bear no relevancy to marital communications. ,-lor can it be assumed that marital conduct will be affected by a privilege for confi\u00ad dential communications of whose existence the parties in all like\u00ad lihood are unaware. The other communication privileges, by way of -26-contrast, have as one party a professional person who can be ex\u00ad pected to iuforI\" the other of the existence of the privilege . . -'oreover, the relationships from \"'hich those privileges arise are essentially and most exclusively verbal in nature, quite unlike marriage ... This rationale seems remarkably short and naive, particularly in light of the fact that Proposed Rule 505 would have provided a privilege not to take the stand only in criminal cases. On the other hand, it should be noted that the lat. has not recognized a parent-child privi\u00ad lege, a friend-to-friend privilege, or an employer-employee privilege, even though they involve relationships similar to the spousal situation. On balance elimination of the time-honored husband-wife cOllli!luni- cation privilege I~ould not seem warranted. Article 6. Physician-Patient Privilege. California Evidence Code ~\u00a7 990-1007 provide a somewhat limited privilege for confidential com\u00ad munications between a patient and his or her doctor. The Proposed Federal Evidence ;\",les do not provide this traditional privilege al\u00ad though, as noted below, proposed Rule 504 provides a specific psycho\u00ad therapist-patient privilege. The reasons for omitting a physician\u00ad patient privilege are set forth in the Advisory Committee's ;ote to Proposed Federal Rule 504 as follows. 'The rules contain no provision for a general physician\u00ad patient privilege. \\-ihile ,\"any states have by statute created the privilege, the exceptions which have been found necessary in order to obtain information required by the public interest or to avoid fraud are so numerous as to leave little if any basis for the privilege. Among the exclusions from the statutory privilege, the following may be enumerated; communications not made for purposes of diagnosis and treatment; commitment and restoration proceedings; issues as to wills or otherwise between parties claiming by succes\u00ad sion from the patient; actions on insurance policies; required reports (venereal diseases, gunshot wounds, child abuse); communi\u00ad cations in furtherance of crime or fraud; mental or physical con\u00ad dition put in issue by patient (personal injury cases); malpractice actions; and some or all criminal prosecutions. California. for example, excepts cases in which the patient puts his condition in issue, all criminal proceedings, will and similar contests, mal\u00ad practice cases and disciplinary proceedings, as well as certain other situations, thus leaving virtually nothing covered by the privilege. California Evidence Code J~ )90-1007.' The description of the California privilege is generally an ac\u00ad curate one, which BeanS that the few situations in which the privilege -'1.7-applies essentially are arbitrary or within the broad discretion of the trial court. For exa'llple, under California fvidence Code .; ~99, as recently amended, there is no privilege in a civil action for damages based on conduct of the patient if the trial court finds that good cause exists for disclosure. The ,lllrpose of a doctor-patient privilege is to safeguard the relationship in order that a person will not be inhibited from con\u00ad sUlting and confiding in a doctor. Once the law provides very broad exceptions such as tl''l~e per.Jitted under California la~1, that safeguard is effectively destroyed. The only counterargu;.1ent possible is that the general public does not realize ho., weak, and exception-riddled the privileGe is. Therefore, people continue to consult physicians in the false belief that their confidences are secure. If the privilege ~1as abandoned entirely, even this false delusion would be destroyed. Given the current state of the physician-patient privilege in California, a stronr, argument can be made that it should be abandoned entirely. Jot long ago the CalHornia Law ',evision Commission suggested a new statute in which the application of the privilege in all cases would have been placed in the discretion of the trial judge on a case\u00ad by-case basis, depending on the nature of the case, the value of the evidence, and the need for protection. This proposal, like newly amended \u00a7 999, has the drawback of uncertainty, making preparation for trial more difficult, but it would be an improvenent over the current scheme containing a laundry list of exceptions. Article 7. Psychotherapist-Patient Privilege. California Evidence Code ~\u00a7 1010-1028 provide a comprehensive privilege for communications between a psychotherapist and his or her patient. Proposed Federal Rule 504 would have established a similar privilege for use in federal courts but 'lith a number of i\"lportant differences. 1. Under 5 1010(a) \"psychotherapist\" includes a medical doctor \"ho devotes a substantial portion of his time to the practice of psychiatry. Proposed Federal Rule 504(a)(2) on the other hand, defines a \"psycho\u00ad therapist\" as a medical doctor ,oho is engaged in the diagnosis or treat\u00ad ment of a mental or emotional condition. Thus, communications to a seneral practitioner, who occasionally engages in psychiatric treatment, nould be covered by the federal rule whenever he is so engaged, whereas it would not be covered undeL _ 1010(a) because of the sporadic nature of his psychiatric practice. On the surface, at least, the feJ~ral proposal seems preferable. If psychiatric counseling is to be covered by privilege, the general nature of the doctor's practice su,ms irrelevant. 0.: the other hand. the California rule does provide a safeguard against unjustified claims of privilege by doctors who are willing to state that almost every type of wedical treatment involves a coordinate need for supportive emotional counseling. On balzn::c, ho .. c\"er, it appe-lrs that the California section should be altered in line Hith the federal iJroposa!. 'lhen a claim of privilege is raised a court can reasonably be expected to be able to determine \"hether or not the communications sought to be introduced were in fact transmitted for treatment of a mental or emotional condition. The same question will come up even under the current statute with respect to a doctor who devotes a substantial amount but not all of his practice to the treatment of mental disorders. 2. Section 1010 not only covers doctors of medicine but licensed psychologists, clinical social workers, school psychologists, and mar\u00ad riage and family counselors. Proposed Federal -:lule 504 (a) covers only medical doctors and licensed psychologists. As first enacted in 1965, ~ 1010 was identical in coverage to the proposed federal rule. Sub\u00ad sequent amendments, obviously given full consideration by the legis\u00ad lature, expanded the scope to include others. In light of this history, there is no reason now to reassess the California statute merely because the federal rule is more tightly dra,m. It is interesting to note that at the same time that the amendments were made expanding the scope of the privilege in California, another section, \u00a7 1028, was added stating that there is no privilege in crim\u00ad inal cases except for communications .usde to medical doctors and li\u00ad censed psychologists. This limitation is questionable but understand\u00ad able. A marriage counselor is thought of quite differently than is a psychologist uhen it comes to criminal admissions. Yet if there is to be a privilege to encourage persons to seek assistance, logically there is nO reason why such a line should be drawn. Obviously the legislature compromised; it expanded the scope of the privilege to include a greater array of professionals, but it '''asn r t willing to go all the way when detection of criminal activity is involved. -29-3. Section 1015 requires the psychotherapist to claim the privi\u00ad lege on behalf of an absent patient. Proposed Federal Rule 504(c) states that he \"may\" do so. As is true of the same situation involving the attorney-client privilege, the California rule is preferable. In the ordinary situation, s psychotherapist ought not to be sble to decide whether to disclose privileged information. Ultimately the choice to disclose or not to disclose should be made solely by the patient, even if the psychotherapist believes that disclosure is in the patient's best interest. 4. California includes many exceptions to the privilege thst are not contained in the proposed federal rule. These are the same general exceptions that apply to other communication privileges. It is impor\u00ad tant to note that the proposed federal rules do include many of these exceptions in rules regarding other privileges but do not do so with respect to the psychotherapist-patient privilege because of the fragile nature of the relationship that arguably commands complete, or nearly complete, security. The California exceptions not included in the federal proposal include: \u00a7 1018 (services sought to commit or escape detection from the commission of a crime or tort); \u00a7 1019 (issues involving parties all of whom claim through a deceased patient); & 1020 (breach of duty by psy\u00ad chiatrist or patient growing out of the relationship): S 1021 (intent of deceased patient with respect to his deed, will, or other writing pur\u00ad porting to affect an interest in property); \u00a7 1022 (validity of a deed, will, or writing purporting to affect an interest in property); and \u00a7 1026 (matters which the psychiatrist or patient must report to a public employee if the report is open to public inspection). It is difficult to evaluate the special need for protection of tbe psychiatrist-patient relationship with respect to these exceptions. Undoubtedly, many psychiatrists would take the position that the fear of revelation, even after death of the patient, will drive away many poten\u00ad tial patients who desperately need psychological help. On the other hand, the need for security after death or regarding matters in public reports is questionable and the California provisions cannot be said to be unreasonable. ~mre difficult is \u00a7 1018 relating to consultation for the purpose of COmmitting a crime or tort or to escape detection for -3<1-committing a crime or tort. Arguably tl,ere is a special need for pro\u00ad tection when a persoll sees a psychiatrist regarding these matters that does not exist when he communicates with his spouse or his lawyer. [It must be noted that an entirely different exception applies when the patient appears dangerous to himself or others. See the discussion of o 1024 below. 1 Both the exception in \" 1018 and the exception in \u00a7 1020 for suits between the psychiatrist and the patient raise difficult questions of where to <1raw the line bettJeen the need for protection and disclosure. I t cannot be said, hO<lever, that inclusion of these exceptions is irra\u00ad tional or inappropriate. 5. The California code also contains a number of exceptions to the psychiatrist-patient privilege specifically related to mental competency that differ from their counterparts in Proposed Federal '(ule 504. (1) Proposed Federal Rule 504(<1)(1) provides an exception in proceedings to hospitalize the patient \"if the psychotherapist, during the course of diagnOSis or treatment has determined that the patient is in need of hospitalization.\" California's rule does not go so far in giving leeway to the psychotherapist. Under r, 1024 the psychotherapist has the right to disclose a communication only if the patient appears dangerous to himself or others. The fact thst a patient who is not dangerous would be better off in a hospital does not itself permit disclosure. The California provision seems preferable in an enlightened society that ascribes increased dignity aud legal rights to those who are men\u00ad tally and emotionally ill. In commenting on the federal proposal, the Advisory Committee takes the position that disclosure by the therapist in whom the patient has already manifested confidence is not likely to damage the relationship. This seems extremely naive. One would guess that many emotionally disturbed patients would avoid seeking help if they thought that the result would be forced hospitalization, particu\u00ad larly if they knew that their own statements to the psychotherapist would be used to show the need for incarceration. (2) Proposed Federal Rule 504(d)(3) provides an exception whenever the patient relies upon his or her mental or emotional condition as an element of a \"claim or defense\"\u00b7 in any proceeding. A similar exception -31-is provided by ~\u00a7 1016, L023 and 1025 of the California code. \"owever the latter may go somewhat further than the feueral proposal, depending on the extent to which \"claim or defense' is to be given technical interpretations. For example, j 1025 quite appropriately provides an exception to the privilege in a proceeding brought by the patient to establish his or her competency. Such an action probably would qualify as a claim\" under the federal proposal but the matter is not clear. The California provisions are preferable because they avoid ambiguity. aowever, 'l 1016 which provides a general exception whenever the patient tenders his or her mental competency as an issue in a proceeding, would seem to make ~~ 1023 and 1025 unnecessary. Indeed the official Comment to ; 1023 specifically so states. Perhaps \u00a7 1016 should be amended clearly to include tbe substance of \u00a7~ 1023 and 1025 so that two of the three overlapping provisions can be eliminated. (3) California Evidence Code \u00a7 1027 excludes from the privilege situations in which the patient is under 16 years of age, has been the victim of a crime, and in which the psychiatrist believes that dis\u00ad closure is in the best interest of the patient. There is no federal counterpart to this section which was added to the code in 1970. Essen\u00ad tially the situations falling within this section involve incest or rape and are combined with intimidation of the child to a degree that re\u00ad quires disclosure if treatment is to be effective. Zxperience showed the provision to be necessary and obviously it should be retained. Article 8. Clergyman-Penitent Privileges. California Evidence Code ~~ 1030-1034 provide privileges for communications to clergymen by members of their church or organization. Proposed Federal Rule 506 covers the same general material. One important difference is that, under California 1all, both the \"penitent\" and the clergyman have a privilege. This is different frma all the other communication privi\u00ad leges in which only the communicator, and not the professional, holds the privilege. Thus, even if a person demands that a clergyman reveal the person's confidential communication, the clergyman Can refuse to do so. The proposed federal rule does not provide the clergyman with such a separate privilege. Preference between the federal proposal and the state law depends on how one feels about the obligations a clergyman has to his religious -32-tenets. Unlike the lawyer, doctor, or psychiatrist, the clergyman has obligations ,.hich go beyon'! the welfare of the person with whom he deals. Even though, on \u00b7balance, one:light prefer the federal rule, the California solution is a legitimate one. It is also a practical one since it is unlikely that a court would fine or jail a clergyman for contempt for failing to reveal a confidence, '~hen disclosure is pro\u00ad hibited by the clergyman's religious beliefs. Another possible difference bet\"een the California provision and the proposed federal rule involves the scope of the privilege. The federal proposal protects any confidential communication made \"to a clergyman ill his professional character as spiritual adviser.\" Cali\u00ad fornia J 1032 protects a cotn;;1Unication if the clergyman is \"authorized or accustomed\" to hear it and, if '\u00b7under the discipline, tenets of his church, denomination, or organization,\" he has a duty to keep it secret. Arguably, a case could arise in which a person reveals to his clergyman, in his capacity as spiritual adviser, a matter which the latter is not required to keep secret under formal tenets of his church. Obviously, such a communication is within the spirit of the privilege and should not be subject to an order of disclosure. However, to avoid technical arguments as to the meaning of \" 1032, California should consider amend\u00ad ing it to adopt the simpler language of the proposed federal rule. Article J. Official Information and Identity of Informer. Cali\u00ad fornia Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1040-1042 spell out privileges for certain types of government infortaation. The substance of these sections are covered in Proposed Federal Rules 502, 509, and 510. There are a nwnber of important differences as follows: 1. Section 1040(b) provides that a public entity has the privilege not to disclose and to prevent disclosure of certain material, including material protected by a federal or state statute. However, the law gives no privilege to the person who supplied the information. By way of contrast Rule 502 would also allow the person or organization who supplied the information to claim the privilege. This aspect of the federal rule should be incorporated into \u00a7 1040. In other words, if a state official fails in his auty to claim the privilege for a report or return which is by law to be held in con\u00ad fidence, the person or organization who filed the return should be able to step in to claim the privilege and prevent disclosure. -33-., 2. Section l040(b) covers loaterial privileged by statute and other official information when the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice is out\"eiched by the need for confidentiality. Unlike its counterpart, !Cule 509, it does not mention \"secrets of state\" that invoke national defense or international relations. Since protection of state secrets exists by virtue of federal common law pursuant to federal constitutional powers governing international relations and war, see United States .':!.:.. Reynolds, 345 U. S. (1953). the state courts would likely be required to grant such a privilege by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. For consistency and clarity. the limited federal state secrets privilege should be included in : 1040{b). 3. California Co l040(b)(2\u00bb and federal (Proposed ,lule 509(a)(2\u00bb privileges for \"official information\" are generally consistent ~Jith one another with respect to coverage. Jlowever, substantial doubt exists as to the validity of any privilege for \"official information\" in the absence of a specific statute covering particular information. More than any other provision, the proposal to grant such a general privilege aroused the ire of Congress and engendered doubts about all of the proposed federal evidence rules. Some of the sting of the California provision is removed by \" 1042 which provides that in a criminal case, when a claim of the official information privilege is upheld, the court must find against the government on any issue to which the information is material. This caveat applies to substantive issues at trial but not to preliminary questions regarding evidence when the names of informants are involved. Proposed Federal Rule 509(e) is not as strong as j 1042 since it merely provides that the court should make whatever rulings against the government are required in the interests of justice. On the other hand, S09{e) refers to all cases ill which the govenu:lent is a party, not just to criminal watters. On balance, California should eliminate its very general, \"discre\u00ad tionary\" official information privilege. In criticizing the California section, a leading commentator states: \"Situations where a true need for protection against disclosure exists are often covered by such standard privileges as attorney\u00ad client or in particular cases by specific statutory privileges. In addition, the often unrealized standing of governmental agencies to raise questions of relevancy in the broad sense affords insulation against forcing truly unwarranted disclosure. The difficulty of -34-obtaining governmental information is a matter of common knowledge. and the creation of an added obstacle in the fon' of a privilege so broad in terms and uncertain of application can scarcely be de\u00ad fended.' HcCormick, ;'vidence, p. 231 (2d ed. 1972). If the California privilege is retained, the safeguard of ; 1042 shoulJ also be retained but it should be expanded to apply to civil actions in which the z;overIlI!lent is a party. In an open society the loss of a lawsuit (if that should result), is a small price to pay for the eovernment's rieht to withhold infortlation vital to a case. Such a 'penalty also ensures that the privilege will not be invoked lightly. 4. Section 1041 provi(1,es a gov\"rnmental privilege for the identity of an informer. Unlike Proposed Federal ';;.ule 510(11), the California privilege is not automatic but applies only if disclosure is forbidden by a federal or state statute or if the court determines that the need for secrecy outweighs the necessity for disclosure. The provisions of 5 1042 discussed above also apply to the discretionary exclusion of an informer's identity under 0 1041. The California statute is preferable to the proposed federal rule. There is no reason for grantin~ an absolute privilege if the interests of justice are not served thereby. Furthermore, the goverDL~nt should be prepared to pay a penalty for invoking such a privilege. Eost of the time the identity of an informer will not be relevant to the issues; hence no penalty ,'1i11 be involved. ':ut if the non-government party would otherwise suffer because evidence is unavailable, the remedial approach of ~ 1042 should be followed in civil as well as in criminal proceedings. Articles 10 and 11. Political Vote and Trade Secrets. The privi\u00ad leges provided with regard to voting and trade secrets in California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 10S0 and 1060 are substantively identical to Proposed Federal Rules S07 and S08. Chapter S. I_unity of Newsman From Citations of Contempt Section 1070 of the California ~vidence Code provides a limited privilege for newsmen in that they cannot be held in contempt of court for failing to reveal their news sources. The proposed federal rules do not contain anything regarding this subject matter. \u00b7,35--- The California statute has been the subject of close detailed scrutiny. It has been amended three ti~es since first promulgated in 1965. There is no special reason to alter the section now merely be\u00ad cause a similar privilege \"as not included in the proposed federal rules. DIVISIOiI 9. BVIDKJCE AFFECTED OR E~;CLUDED BY E:>Tl{lNSIC POLICIES Chapter 1. Evidence of Character,_,abit, or Custom In general, 8alifornia Evidence Code provisions on character and habit are substantially the same as prOVisions of the federal rules. The California sections are a\u00bbkwardly written ho\"ever. Section UOO purports to establish a general rule as to what evidence may be utilized to prove character, but \u00a7'J 1101-1103 contain such major exceptions that there is little left of the basic rule. Federal Rule 405 is ~ore satisfactory in simply setting forth what types of evidence are avail\u00ad able for specific purposes. The California situation is seriously confused by the unnecessarily complicated drafting of r\u00b7\" UOO-li03. Another example of poor drafting in this chapter involves ~ 1104 which states that, except where a specific statute otherwise prOVides, evidence of character traits for care or skill is inadmissible to show conduct on a specific occasion. This provision is inserted despite the fact that .;. 1101 (a) speCifically states that, in the absence of statute, evidence of any character trait is inadmissible to sho., conduct on a specific occasion. Ihe problem is compounded by the fact that ~ 110l(b) and (c) make clear that evidence is prohibited under ~ 1101(a) only when introduced to show conduct on the specific occasion in confonility t.ith the trait and not when the purpose is to prove something else such as motive or knoldedge or to impeach a witness. Unfortunately\" 1104 does not contain clauses similar to ~\u00a7 1101(b) and (c), although it seems obvious that the same rules \\Jere intended to apply to traits of skill and care as to any others. The entire chapter, ~\u00a7 1101-1105 should be reviewed with the idea of simplifying the sections and eliminating repetition and uncertainty. The substantive differences between the California and federal prOVisions are as follows: -3[,-1. Evidence Code ',,) 11 02 and !I 03 permit a defendant in a criminal case to introduce evidence of his o.m character or of the character of the alleged victim of the crime. If defendant does so, the prosecution may rebut the evidence. Obviously, the character or traits of character involved must be relevant to the case. See generally 7 California Law :levision Commission, Reports, :tecommendations and Studies 212-213 (1965). \"owever ~\u00a7 H02-1103 do not specifically so state. Federal !iules 404(a)(1) and (a)(2) refer to a \"pertinent\" trait of character. Addition of words such as . pertinent' or otherwise relevant' to the California sections could avoid confusion, although the intent of the provisions as written is obvious. 2. California specifically prohibits defendant's introduction of evidence regarding the sexual conduct of an alleged rape victim, other than conduct with defendant, to shm~ consent at the time of the alleged rape. California lovideuce Code 3 ll03(2). There is no comparable federal rule. Since the California section was added in 1974 after specific consideration by the legislature, there is nO reason to alter it merely because it was not adopted in the federal rules. 3. Under ~vidence Code' 1103, when the defendant in a criminal case introduces evidence of the character of the alleged victim, or when the prosecution rebuts such evidence, they ~ay utilize evidence of specific instances of conduct as well as opinion evidence or evidence of reputation. This is to be contrasted with j 1i02 which limits evidence as to defendant' s ol~n character to opinion and evidence of reputation. Federal Rule 405 limits evidence as to the character of the victim as well as to the character of the defendant to opinion evidence and evi\u00ad dence of re~utation, and thus does not perQit evidence of specific acts. The zeneral prohibition against using specific acts of conduct to prove cnaracter are two-fold. First, there is great danger in gener\u00ad alizing from a few specific occurrences. For example, the fact that a person appears obviously drunk on three occasions does not necessarily show a general trait of intemperance; indeed, to the contrary, it could mean that he is so unused to liquor that he becomes obviously inebriated on those rare occasions when he imbibes. Second, a specific prior act of a party may so offend a juror's senses, that the juror will turn against that party tohatever the facts in the specific case. Hhen the character involved is that of a party, ~articularly a criminal defend\u00ad ant, the prejudice could be oven,helming. Thus both the California and the federal courts ilrohibit such evidence unless the party raises the issue himself and then generally prevent the use of specific acts except on cross-examination of the \",itness to test the basis for his opinion or his knowledge of reputation. Although the latter exception is signifi\u00ad cant, it does not permit independent evidence that certain acts have in fact occurred. Hhen dealing with a victim of crime, the danger of prejudice to a defendant by showing his prior misconduct is eliminated. Thus there is less reason to be concerned about evidence of specific acts. ;,everthe\u00ad less, if the victim is alive and. testifying, defense counsel I',ay turn the trial into a trial of the victim in the hope that a jury will so detest the victim that it will exonerate the defendant. This danger has specifically been recognized in rape cases in California in \u00a7 1103(2) as noted above. (There, however, the law goes further and bars any evi\u00ad dence of general sexual activity, including opinion and reputation.) It should be noted that the victim of a crime has no say in \"hether, and to .,hat extent, his reputation is placed in issue. Unlike a defendant, who may keep the issue out altogether, the victiQ's reputation is at the will of others. To help protect victims from an \"assault\" in the court\u00ad roon, it ,.,ould seem wise to amend \u00a7 1103 to conform to Federal Rule 405 by limiting character evidence to opinion and reputation. 4. Federal ;cule 404(a) (2), in addition to allowing a prosecutor to rebut character evidence of a victim introduced by the defendant, also permits the prosecutor to introduce \u00b7'evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the victim . in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor. The California code does not contain the latter provision and \u00abould not allow such evidence unless Jefendant has first specifically raised the issue of the victim's char\u00ad acter. Since the alleged victim is deceased, the prosecution is often hard pressed to counter testimony of self-defense by defendant, at least if the latter is the only living eyewitness. The federal rule balances the need for the evidence against the limited prejudice that such evi\u00ad dence could have and comes down on the side of admissibility. Although it is not a la8tter of great moment, the federal rule does seem to be -38-preferable. 'lowever, if the California code is to be altered, it would seem wise to limit evidence available for proving at least this aspect of the victim's character to opinion evidence or evidence of reputation. Otherwise a prosecutor will be telapted to paint the victim as a saint by dredging up every act of 'peace\" in .,hich the victim was involved. Chapter 2. Other Evidence Affected or Excluded by Extrinsic Policies l'ederal <lules 407 through 411, plus \"ule 606(b) , make certain items of evidence inadTc,issible for reasons of policy. Galifornia ;;vidence Code ~\u00a7 1150-1158 deal with all of these matters plus a nwuber of others. In particular, \u00a7\u00a7 1156-1i57. 5 render inadmissible certain records of medical committees formed to research, investigate, and evaluate hlatters relating to patient care generally, with the purpose of improvinG the quality of care and reducing morbidity or mortality. The federal rules do not deal with these matters, but that presents no reason for dispensing with the current state sections. The reasons for the sections are obvious and stem from the sanle types of policy consid\u00ad erations which justify similar decisions regarding other types of evi\u00ad dentiary material. The major inconsistencies between federal and state provisions are as follows: 1. Evidence Code'; 1150(a) states that upon inquiry into the validity of a verdict, any othen.ise admissible evidence may be used to shotl improper conduct or events occurring \"'ithin or without the jury room, but no evidence can be used to show l1hat influenced any individual juror to assent or dissent from a verdict. Section 1150(~) says that nothing in the evidence Code affects the competence of a juror to give evidence to support or impeach a verdict. The only California statute to govern the latter is Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 657(2) which specifically permits affidavits of any juror to prove that the jury resorted to methods of chance. Federal Rule 606(b) deals only with the competency of juror testi\u00ad mony and not with the question of what facts can or cannot be proved as set fortn in Evidence Code S 1150 (a) . Althoueh the latter is couched in terms of evi~ence, it is in fact a matter of civil procedure, in effect delineating the grounds for a new trial based on jury misconduct. -39-Federal Rule 606(b) permits juror testit:lony only to show \"whether extraneous prejudicial inforn~tion was im~roperly brought to the jury's attentio,l or \"hether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.\" Evidence Code \u00a7 1150(b) merely avoids the difficult oft-debated question of what juror testimony will be permitted to attack a verdict. See liote, Impeachment of Jury Verdicts, 53 .Jarq. L. \"\"v. 258 (1970); .lotes, Impeachment of ~ Verdicts ~ Jurors: ! Proposal, 1969 1I. Ill. L. Forum 38J. :Jol1ever, in 1969 the Supreme Court of California dealt witi1 the question in People;!.:... Hutchinson, 71 Gal.2d 342, 78 Cal. Rptr. 196, 455 P.2d 132, and decided that juror testimony would henceforth be permissible as a means of setting forth evidence allowe~. under '; 1150(a) to impeach a verdict. There is nothing in the decision that requires alteration of \u00a7 1150(b) and it seems better simply to leave matters as they are. If:; 1150(b} is to be changed to incorporate a rule as to juror testimony, it should follot, the decision in People ;!.:... Hutchinson rath~r than the narrot/er limitations of Federal Rule 606(b). The latter would not even permit jurors to testify that a verdict was arrived at by chance methods, which is the one area where, as we have seen, a Cali\u00ad fornia statute has specifically permitted the use of juror affidavits as proof. Evidence Code \u00a7 1150(a) mayor may not be wise. There is some question, for example, why a non-juror should not be able to state, if he has cOlapetent evidence on the matter, that a juror's decision in a case was based solely on racial prejudice. Affidavits or testimony of jurors on these matters is quite a different thing; jurors must be protected from post-verdict harassment leading them to make statements of personal bias or prejudice which, unlike testimony as to acts or events, usually cannot be verified or refuted by others. In any event, \u00a7 1150(a) should be reworded and transferred to Chapter 7, Article 2 of the Civil Procedure Code dealing with new trials and the vacation of judgments. 2. Evidence Code \u00a7 1151 is almost identical to ,(ule 407 in ex\u00ad cluding evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken after an event to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event. The federal rule, however, adds a last sentence, not present in the Cali\u00ad fornia Code, as follows: \"This rule does not require the exclusion of -40-evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving Olmership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment. It seems clear that EviC:\"nce Code ., 1151 is similarly not intended to exclude evidence of remedial measures for these purposes. However, the statement that such evidence is inadmissible to show \"culpable conduct,\" if read broadly, could raise a question about the matter, and it would seem proper to add the sentence quoted from the federal rule to j 1151. SiHilar statements of clarification appear elsetohere in the California Evidence Code, see, e.g., ~ 1101(b). 3. Evidence Code 5\u00a7 1152 and 1154 ruake inadmissible to prove liability or non-liability evidence of offers to compromise and partial payments made in an attempt to compromise disputed claims. Ingeneral Federal Rule 408 arrives at the same result. However, the federal rule does not make inadmissible evidence of any offer to payor any payment, or any acceptance of payment if neither liability nor the amount claimed has been disputed. The California rules do not have such a broad ex\u00ad ception; under \u00a7 1152(b)(1), evidence of partial payment of a claim without any challenge as to liability may be admitted to show the vali\u00ad dity of the claim, but that's all. The California formulation is preferable to the federal rule. There is great difficulty in knowing when liability or amount are in dispute. For example, a plaintiff ,dth a clear claim for $1000 may nevertheless express a willingness to accept $500 from the outset, even before defendant has had an opportunity to contest validity, merely to avoid the time, trouble, and bad publicity that a lawsuit could en\u00ad gender. Similarly a defendant may offer to settle a small claim, even before investigating the facts, just to avoid expense. In neither case should these offers be admitted on the issue of liability; yet the federal rule would not appear to exclude them. iiotoever, California \u00a7 1152(b) (1) itself is of questionable valid\u00ad ity. A person ~y pay a portion of a claim, without any overt challenge to its validity, in the hope that the opposing party will be satisfied. thus avoiding the expense and bad publicity of a trial. If the person making payment knows how to \"play the game, he toill fonaally dispute the claim at the same time that he pays; if he is unsophisticated, -41-however, and fails to challenee the claim's validity, the fact of the payment will be admissible against him if the opposing party sues for an additional amount. Therefore, ~vidence Code J\u00a7 1152 and 1154 should not be altered to conform to Rule 403; i, 1152 (b)(l) should be eliminated. 4. ~vidence Code ~ 1152 not only excludes evidence of compromise and offers to compromise disputed claims, but also payments or offers to pay arising from humanitarian motives. Thus, voluntary payment of hospital expenses of a child hit by a car, cannot be used to establish the culpability of the person who pays. Section 1152 goes on also to exclude as evidence \"any conduct or statelJlents made in negotiation thereof. \" 'flle policy behind this clause is to allo>1 parties to talk freely to one another during compromise negotiations. In jurisdictions without such a rule, neeotiators must talk in hypothetical terms in order to avoid admissions .mich could be used later in court should settlement negotiations fail. Federal Rule 408, which deals with settlement negotiations, also excludes statements made during those negotiations. But llule 408 does not deal with ?ayments or offers to pay arising from humanitarian mo\u00ad tives. That is dealt with in l',ule 409. Under 409, evidence of payments or offers to pay are not admissible; but factual statements nlade during Ute course of the dealings are not excluded as they are under the Cali\u00ad fornia code. Although it is a close question, the California provision should probably be retained. It is true that protection of statements of those who voluntarily payor promise to pay are different in quality from statements made during negotiations. ,Jeverthless, in both situations the conduct of the parties is to be encouraged. In the heat of anguish, an innocent automobile driver who has struck dmm a pedestrian may tell a hospital official, \"It was all my fault during the course of agreeing to pay for the injured person's medical care. Unlike statements made in formal negotiation, statements of volunteers are likely to be made by the individual himself, without aid of any attorney, thus maximizing the need for protection. The same policy which underlies the inadmissi\u00ad bility of the voluntary payment or offer to pay, also covers statements made at the time such payments are promised or negotiated. -42-5. EviJence Code J 1153 and Federal Rule 410 both make inadmis\u00ad sible offers to plead guilty or withdrawn pleas of 3uilty to a crime. There are, hOJever, several important differences between the two pro\u00ad visions. (1) The federal rule expressly includes offers to plead nolo contendere; the California provision does not. This seems peculiar indeed, since the very essence of a nolo plea in California is the fact that it cannot be admitted in a subsequent civil action that is based upon the acts on \"Ihich the criminal charge was based. California Penal Code \u00a7 1016(3). Surely Evidence Code J 1153 should be amended to ex\u00ad clUde as evidence offers to plead or t,ithdrawn yleas of nolo contendere. (2) Evidence Code: 1153 states that the evidence is inadmissible \"in any action or in any proceeding of any nature,' whereas ilederal Rule 410 states that the evidence is inadmissible in a case or proceeding against the person who made the plea or offer. Here again the federal rule seems preferable. The policy behind the exclusion of eVidence is to encourage compromise and to made feasible the IJithdrawal of an unwise plea. The policy only is relevant to protect the defendant. Thus it seems unnecessary and unwise to exclude the evidence when it is not used against defendant. This is particularly true since G 1153 (like 'lule 410) covers offers to plead to crimes other than the one charged. For example, if :C, to avoid a trial on a charge of armed robbery, offers to plead guilty to an unrelated burglary l,1th t<hich Z is chareed, it seems proper to allm', ,:; to introduce X t s offer in an effort to show Z t s inno\u00ad cence. To be sure, there may be some embarassment for X (although in the case of a withdrawn plea of guilty the matter is already on the public record). The court may, in its discretion, exclude such evidence in circumstances where prejudice to X \"70uld outweigh its vslue to Z: but there should not be an automatic exclusion as now exists under \u00a7 1153. (3) Federal Rule 410 applies the rule of exclusion not only to offers to plead guilty or nolo, but to \"eVidence of conduct or state\u00ad ments made in compromise negotiations. Evidence Code ~ 1153 does not exclude such statements. This is surprising in light of the fact that \u00a7 1152 makes inadmissible statements or conduct made in negotiations in civil actions. The strong policy favoring compromise is the same in criminal and civil cases. If statements made during negotiation are admissible, negotiators must talk in hypotheticals, ~ \"Suppose t<e -43-admit for a minute, that defendant entered V's building; the real ques\u00ad tion is how much did he take.\" A straightforward statement can be very harmful e.g \"IJe all agree defendant broke into V's building. :low lets get down to the real question of whether he took enough money to make his crime a felony as charged.\u00b7 There is little doubt that the federal rule regarding statements and conduct during negotiations is preferable to the California provision and that the latter should be amended. It should be noted that the federal rule also includes language making clear that voluntary statements made in open court in connection with pleas or offers to plead may be utilized for impeachment purposes or in a subsequent prosecution of the declarant for perjury. Although argu\u00ad ably such statements are not part of compromise negotiations, the hlatter should not be left in doubt. If Evidence Code ~ 1153 is to be amended to accord with the federal rule, all of the federal language should be included. b. Evidence Code J 1155 excludes evidence that a person was in\u00ad sured for harm caused to another when offered to prove negli?ence or other \"rongdoing. Federal Rule 411 differs in that it excludes evidence that a person was or ~ not insured in order to prove that the person acted or did ~~ wron3fully. Section 1155 is the better rule. There are strong reasons for excluding evidence that defendant is insured to show his liability. The probative value of such evidence is, at best, extremely weak; the pre\u00ad judice is great, since a jury may be induced to find for plaintiff solely on the ground that defendant, personally, will not be hurt by an adverse judgment. On the other hand, there is no undue prejudice to plaintiff when defendant introduces evidence that he is insured in order to dispute liability or wrong doing. Tne evidence may have substantial probative value. For example, in a hit and run case, evidence that defendant was insured against any harm he caused would tend to support defendant's claim that he did not realize that he had hit anyone. Section 1153 should remain as it is. -44-DIVISION 10. HEARSAY EVIDENCE Chapter 1. General Provisions 1. The general definition of hearsay in the California Evidence Code (\"3 225, 1200) is virtually identical to the definition in Federal Rule 801 but with two major exceptions as follows: (1) Federal ::tule BOI (d) (1) states that certain ;>rior inconsistent statements used to impeach a witness and prior consitent statements used to rehabilitate a Nitness are not hearsay, and may be admitted for the truth of the matters asserted. (2) Federal Rule dOl(d)(2) states that an admission of a party\u00ad opponent, including certain statements of other persons \"'hich were authorized or adopted by the party-opponent are not hearsay. In California, these matters are considered to be hearsay but are nevertheless admissible under broadly stated exceptions to the hearsay rule, \u00a7\u00a7 1220-1227, 1235-1236. In fact, the California provisions are wider in scope than are the federal; thus despite characterization of , such evidence as not hearsay, less is admissible under federal rules. For convenience, these differences in scope between the federal and state rules will be considered in the discussion of the California exceptions to the hearsay rule. It is sufficient to note here that there is no reason whatsoever for California to adopt the federal approach and to consider the listed items as not being hearsay. It is worth noting another technical difference between Federal Rule 801 (a) anJ California t.vidence Code \u00a7 225. The latter defines a statement as an oral or written \"verbal expression' or nonverbal conduct intended as a substitute for oral or written verbal expression, whereas Federal Rule BOI (a) defines a statement as an oral or 'Yritten \"asser\u00ad tion\" or nonverbal conduct intended as an assertion. Tile California rule appears less precise and has been challenged on that ground. See Letter of llarch 27. 1975 from John 'Caplan to the ::onorable Otto H. ;(aus (a copy of which was sent by Professor ,,-aplan to the California Law Revision Commission). From a practical point of view, the difference in language appears immaterial; thus there seems no necessity for altering 5 225. 2. Gection 1200(b) provides that hearsay is inadmissible \"except as provided by laH. This permits excepcions to the hearsay rule by -45-statute or by judicial decision. By \"ay of contrast, Federal l:ule 802 perndts exceptions only by formal rule of the Supreme Court or by Act of Congress. However, the federal rules provide for substantial flexi\u00ad bility through two \"catchall'; provisions allowing admission of evidence that does not fall within any of the specific exceptions to the hearsay rule. See Rules 803(24) and 304(b)(5). California has nO such \"catch\u00ad all' rules. Thus it seems wise to retain the traditional power of the courts to create new exceptions as circul1lstances warrant. 3. Jther general provisions regarding hearsay evidence are virtu\u00ad ally identical in substance in federal and California law. One minor difference exists between California \" 1203 and its counterpart, Federal Rule 806. Both provide that a hearsay declarant may be called and cross-examined by the party against whom the statement was used. (The Federal Rule covers prior statements of a witness and admissions of an adverse party even though they are not defined as hearsay under the federal scheme.) aowever, 5 1203 specifies that when the statement >Jas made. authorized, or adopted by the party against whom it was used, the section does not apply. This prohibits a lawyer from leading his own client on the stand. Undoubtedly the same result would obtain in fed\u00ad eral courts under the flexible federal rule governing leading questions, Federal Rule 611(c). See .\\dvisory Committee ;iote on Federal Rule 611(c) which states that normally an attorney should not be permitted to lead his m-m client, regardless of tJho called the client to the stand. Chapter 2. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule Article 1. Confessions and Admissions. As previously noted, undae Federal Rule 301(d)(2) admissions by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay. Under California law, ti\u00a7 1220-1227, admissions are excepted from the operation of the hearsay rule. The same language is used in the state and federal provisions and the results are identical ,,,1th only the following exceptions: 1. California Evidence Code\" 1222{a) permits admission of a hearsay statement by a non-party declarant against a party who author\u00ad ized the declarant to made the statement. Section 1222(b), which has no direct federal counterpart, goes on, however, to say that the evidence is admissible only if the proponent has or will be able to offer evi\u00ad dence sufficient to sustain a finding that the declarant was in fact -46-authorized. This provision seems unnecessary and redundant in liRht of Evidence Code ~0 403 and 405 which speak generally of when and before whom preliminary facts are to he proven. The particular matter is covered by \u00a7 403(1) dealing with situations \"here relevance depends upon the existence of a preliminary fact; Section 403 has identical require\u00ad ments as ~ 1222(b). Federal Rule 104(h) is generally identical \"ith \u00a7 403(1). 2. Federal Rule U01(d)(2)(D) allows admission into evidence a\u00ad gainst a party a statement of that party's agent or employee made during the existence of the agency or employment, 'concerning a matter within the scope of his agency or emplo)ll'1ent.\" Thus, this provision would permit introduction of the statement of a party's truck driver regarding an accident \"ith the truck, even though the driver was hired to drive and not to make statements. Such an extension, beyond the traditional rule which allo\"ed only authorized statements, makes sense for several reasons. First, the statement is that of a person directly involved and therefore likely to be of importance. Second, the motive of the agent to lie to his eruployer's detriment is curbed by the fact that a princi\u00ad pal or employer has a substantial hold over those who work for him (hence the requirement that the agency must exist at the time the state\u00ad ment is made). Third, if the agent slants his statement in favor of the employer it will not be used, for only an opposing party can introduce an admission. The California Evidence Code follows a somewhat different pattern fro~ Federal Rule ~Ol(d)(2)(D). Under 3 1224, if a party's liability is vicarious, i.e. based on the liability of another, then statements of the person who is primarily liable can come in against the party, even though no agency relationship exists. For example, if A borrows B's car and runs into C, II may be liable to C as the owner of the vehicle. Section 1224 would permit statements of A to be used against B in an action brought against E, even though A is not L's agent. Somewhat similarly, in three specific situations when a person as plaintiff is suing on behalf of or in the shoes of someone else, state\u00ad ments by the person \u00abhose rights are involved can be used against the plaintiff, even though no agency relation exists. 'fhus j 1225 allows statements of a party's predecessor in interest in property, 1f made -47-when he held the property, to be admitted against the party. Section 1226 allOl\"s the statement of a minor child to come in against a parent in an action brought by the parent for injury to the child. Finally, \" 1227 permits introduction of a statement of a deceased declarant to come in against the plaintiff in an action for declarant's wrongful death. T;,e propriety of the California scheme is questionable, for without even the safeguard brouGht about by the agency relationship, there seems little justification for a special exception for these types of hearsay. First, a special California exception is unnecessary if the statements were against declarant's interest when made. Such statements tlOuld COLle in under the broad exception for declarations against interest, j 1230, \"hich is justified by the fact that people do not usually make untrue statements which they perceive to be personally detrimental. Second, in the absence of normal safeguards, the most dangerous types of hearsay are admissible under the California code. For example, a disgruntled employee, fired because of his accident record, has nothing to lose by blaming any specific accident on his former employer, both to obtain revenge against the employer and to help vindicate himself. Such a statement will be admissible against the employer under ~ 1224 if the accident occurred prior to the time the employee was discharged. A similar situation would occur if the borrower of a car, to exonerate himself, tells the police that an accident \"as due not to his poor driving but to improper maintenance by the OI.uer. The only justification for admission of such statements is the fact that they have been made by a person with first hand knowledge of the facts. nut if that alone justified a hearsay exception, there would be little need for a general hearsay rule. It should be noted that unlike a direct admission of a party, which is admissible because the party (or his legal representative) uill be present at trial and can and will take steps directly to correct or explain the admission, a statement by a non-agent witness cannot be refuted in the same way. The party who in most cases was not present when the critical events occurred will not be able himself to explain the declaration, and the declarant may be una\u00ad vailable. Furthermore, the declarant may not have the same motive as does a party to protect the party's interests. -4,,-Although serious dangers of deliberate uisrepresentations do not el<ist \"ith re\"ard to matters covered in >;; 1225-1227, the reliability of the statements is in no ,.ay assured simply by the fact that they were made by individuals \"hose personal interests were involved. One wonders \"hy these provisions were not written in general terms to cover all cases in which statements I,'ere made by a predecessor in interest at the tine he held the interest or by persons for whose injuries suit has been brought by another. If au exception is to be made, it should cover all such cases. One of the primary reasons for including S\u00a7 1225-1227 ,.as to equalize the situation caused by J 1224. If suit is brought by one executor against anotlier, it would be grossly unfair to permit only the plaintiff executor to introduce statements of defendant's decedent and not to afford defendant the same rights ,.!th reeard to plaintiff's decedent. See the official Comments to ,\u00a7 1225-1227 in the California Evidence Code. If \u00a7 1224 were repealed, the justification for ~~ 1225- 1227 would be greatly diminished. Given the broad range of hearsay exceptions for declarations against interest, and for excited and contemporaneous utterances that exist in California, neither the exception in J 1224 nor those in ~\u00a7 1225- 1227 can be justified either on grounds that they involve statements likely to be accurate or that there is great necessity for such statements despite the hearsay hazards. The sections should be repealed in favor of a provision akin to Federal Rule dOl (d) (2) (D). It should be noted that the California Supreme Court in \".Jarkley .!!. Beagle, 66 Cal.2d 951, 429 P.2d 129, 59 Cal. Rptr. 809 (1967), took a very restrictive view of : 1224, holding it inapplicable to situation's where an employer is sued on the basis of the acts of an employee. The court decided that \u00a7 1224 should be interpreted in the same manner as the prior code provision it replaced. This decision has been the subject of substantial criticism. See, e.g., harvey, Are .!!!!. Employee's Admissions Admissible Against His Employer! ,; Santa Clara Lawyer 59 (1967). Given this interpretation, the California law fails to permit introduction of any employee's statement as an admission of the employer unless the employee was specifically authorized to make statements. See Evidence Code j 1222. This heightens the need for adoption in California of a clarifying proviSion akin to Federal ~:ule 801 (ll) (2) (I). -4)-3. Evidence Code, 1223(a) and Federal 1ule 801 (d) (2) (E) permit a statement of one co-cOl,spirator, made in furtherance of the conspiracy, to come in against another co-conspirator. Section 1223(b), which has no federal counterpart, specifically admits such a statement even if made prior to the time that the party against whom it is used had joined the conspiracy. The California provision thus takes the position that one who enters a conspiracy adopts or ratifies all that has gone on before. Although such an interpretation pushes the concept of agency authorization to the extreme, there seems little reason to eliminate \u00a7 1223(b), if for no other reason than the fact that the statements involved, since they must be designed to further the conspiracy, are not hearsay statements under California's definition. but examples of non\u00ad assertive conduct whose adr.lissibility ,dll turn solely on questions of relevancy. See the official Conw~nt to California Evidence Code i 1200. 4. Section 1223(c) requires that statements of co-conspirators be admitted only if evidence has been or will be introduced which is sufficient to justify a finding that the declarant was a member of an existing conspiracy at t~e time the statement was made. Here again, this provision is unnecessary and redundant in light of j5 403 and 405 which govern tne details of primary preliminary facts. Section 403(1) ~1Ould seem amply to cover the matter. Article Z. Declarations Against Interest. California hvidence Code \u00a7 1230 provides a hearsay exception for declarations against inter\u00ad est if the declarant is unavailable as a witness. It is quite similar in substance to Federal Rule 804(b)(3). The differences are as follows: 1. Section 1230 includes statements which could subject the de\u00ad clarant to hatred, ridicule, or social disgrace in the community. The initial version of Federal ~ule 804(b)(3) contained a similar provision but it was deleted by the House Committee on the Judiciary on the ground that such statements lack sufficient guarantees of reliability. The Senate Committee On the Judiciary accepted the deletion, but appeared to Jo so reluctantly. noting considerable support for the California-type formulation. There is no reason for alteration of 0 1230. Under the section the court must decide if the nature of the foreseeable detriment of making the statement is such that a reasonable man would not have made it unless it were true. If the embarrassment is sufficient to justify such a standard, the statement should be admitted. The courts are capable of making such decisions. 3ee In ~ \\,eber, 11 Cal. 3d 703, 523 P. 2d 229, 114 Cal. Rptr. 429 (1974)(shO<ting held insufficient). See generally, HcCormick, Evidence pp. 674-675 (2d ed. 1972). 2. Federal Rule tl04(b)(3) includes a caveat, not present in ~ 1230, as follows, \"A statement tending to expose the declarant to crminal liability am'_ offered to exculpate the sible corroborating circurustances clearly indicate_the trust\u00ad worthiness of the statement.;' This clause appears des igned primarily to combat an easy-to-make, false assertion that, .... 1 heard someone else confess. -' as a means of casting a reasonable doubt on the guilt of an accused. Interestingly enough, this problem does not as much involve a hearsay danger as it does the reliability of the witness who is on the stand and subject to cross-examination as to whether the statement was in fact made and as to the precise circumstances. The federal proviso seems overly cautious and California should not adopt it; the court has ample power to exclude any such statement if the circumstances indicate that it is untrustworthy. See generally, ;-jcCormick, Evidence p. 674 (2d ed. 1972). Article 3. Prior Statements of I~itnesses. As previously noted, Federal ~ule 801(d)(I) deems certain prior inconsistent and consistent statements of witnesses as not being hearsay. California simply pro\u00ad vides hearsay exceptions for such statements. There are, however, substantial differences between the scope of the statements covered by Federal Rule 801 (d) (1) and those covered by the ,comparable California provisions, Evidence Code S5 1235-1236. 1. Under ~ 1235 any prior inconsistent statement of a witness used to impeach his testimony (\"hich under Evidence Code :i 770 is permitted only if the party '-tho called the witness has or \"'ill have an opportunity to present the statement to the ;J1tness for purposes of explanation) may not only be admitted to ShOll that the witness is unreliable, but also for the truth of the matter asserted. First, it is unreasonable to expect a jury to utilize such a statement solely for purposes of im\u00ad peachment and not to be impressed with its content. Secondly, the presence of the witness helps guarantee accuracy since he can be cross\u00ad examined regarding his statement. Third, there is reason to believe -51-that statements made closer in time to the events to which they relate are likely to be more accurate than statements ~de later including those made under oath at trial. The chief practical effect of per\u00ad mitting such statements to come in for their truth is that they will assist a party in avoiding a direc~eJ verdict when h~s sole or major witness takes the stand and suddenly refutes all that he has said before trial. Federal .:ule 30l(d) (l)(A) is identical to ; 1235 with one vital exception. A prior inconsistent statement may come in for the truth only if it '.,as made under oath at a trial, or hearsay. or in a deposi\u00ad tion; otherwise it can only be used to impeach. It is interesting to note that the AJvisory Comnittee on the federal rules originally adopted the California formulation which was then accepted by the Supreme Court. The rule was changed to its present form by Congress. The chief problem with \u00a7 1235 occurs in the so-called \"sandbagging\" case in which one party calls to the stand a witness \"hon the party knows will testify that he has no information on the issues, only for the purpose of placing before the jury an . inconsistent\" statement of the witness regarding the facts. Tids is particularly disturbing when used by a prosecutor in a criminal case. The matter is not serious if the witness admits making the statement ancl can be cross-examined there\u00ad on; but. if the witness denies both knowing the facts and making the statement, the opposing party is deprived of effective cross-examination. Despite the dangers of \"sandbagging,\" 5 1235 is preferable to Federal Rule a01(d)(1)(A). In the vast n~jority of cases cross-exami\u00ad nation of the declarant will be available and there is no reason to copy the narrower federal provision. ~ven in the rare case when the witness denies both knowledge of the facts and the making of the statement, prejudice can be controlled. For example, the trial judge can prohibit extrinsic proof of the contents of such a statement if the possibility of undue prejudice appears substantial. Perhaps California should consider one minor change in 5 770(b) to eliminate the possibility that an injustice could occur before the court could react. Under S 770(b), and hence under ~ 1235, a prior incon\u00ad sistent statement of a witness is admissible even though the witness is not on the stand so long as the witness has not yet been excused from -52-giving further testimony. It would seer;: sound to limit : 770(b) to state that when a witness denies knowledge of events, a prior statement of the witness I'hich is inconsis tent with his testimony solely because it discusses these events, cannot be admitted until the \"itness has had an opportunity to testify as to \"hether or not he made the statement and, if so, to explain it. This would ensure that the substance of such an inconsistent state,,,ent would not be \"sneaked in\" before the court had an opportunity, based on all the evidence, to decide if its admission Houlo be unduly \"rej udicial. 2. Evidence Code j 1236 is the counterpart of j 1235 with respect to prior consistent statements of a witness which are admissible under \"\"vidence Code J 791 to rehabilitate the \"itness. Federal ~ule 301 (d) (1) covers such statements and provides the same limitations on their ex\u00ad clusion from hearsay as for prior inconsistent statements. As is true in regard to \u00a7 1235, the California rule is preferable. If anything, there is less potential harm in allowing the exception in J 1236 because the ,.itness has already been subject to thorough cross-examination and impeachment regarding direct testimony consistent .,ith the statement. (It should be recalled that ~,vidence Code ~ 791 has no federal counter\u00ad part. Hot.ever, reading c\u00a7 791 and 1236 together, the state provisions prove quite similar to Federal ,~ule 801 (d) (1) as to when a prior con\u00ad sistent statement may be utilized despite its hearsay aspects. Both systems permit use of such statements only after the witness has been impeached with regard to his testimony on the subject matter of the statements. ) 3. California Evidence Code l 1237 deals with past recollection recorded. Its federal counterpart, ~ule 803(5), is simpler in form, but generally the same in substance. The only significant difference is that ~ 1237(a) (2) requires that the record loUSt be \"made (i) by the witness himself or under his direction or (ii) by some other person for the purpose of recording the witness' statement at the time it >las made,' whereas Rule 803(5) requires only that the statement must be ;'shown to have been made or adopted by the witness.\" Thus, under the federal rule if X makes a recorded statement, to which Y later assents, the exception could apply if all other conditions \"ere met regarding either X or Y, uhereas in California, the statement is admissible only \u00b7\u00b753-, if the requirements are [.let with regard to X. Thus if X is dead, the statement would not be admissible despite the fact that Y was actually present \"hen ;~ made the statement, assented to it itmlediately there\u00ad after, and is quite clear and willing to testify that it accurately reflected the facts as Y saw them shortly before X's statement was recorded. California Evidence Code .; 1237 (a) shou).d be amended to include recorded statements of others adopted by a witness, provided all other requirements of \u00a7 1237 are met. 4. California ~vidence Code ) 1238 provides an exception for a prior identification by a \"Unese of a person as one ,oho participated in ~ crime or other occurrence. There is no federal counterpart to this rule. The House of Representatives included such a provision under its version of Qule 801(d)(1) involving prior statements of witnesses. The Senate bill did not contain such a provision because the Senate Judi\u00ad ciary Committee felt that a criminal defendant should not be convicted solely on the basis of such evidence. The aouse-Senate Conference Committee adopted the Senate version. The action of the Conference Gommittee seems nisguided. First, the question of what and ho\" much evidence is sufficient to convict a crim\u00ad inal defendant should not govern what is or is not admissible. Second, even if criminal cases should be exempt, evidence of prior identifi\u00ad cation of individuals in civil actions should not also be eliminated. Finally, one must recognize that. the evidence often ,.111 be admissible under another exception. For example, if the witness' prior identifica\u00ad tion was recorded, as it often would be in important situations such as identification in formal police lineups, the prior recollection recorded exception would apply whenever the witness at trial was unable to remember sufficiently to make the identification in court. ~r if the ,.ituess makes a different identification, then the prior identification will qualify as a prior inconsistent statement. On the merits, inclusion of a hearsay exception for a prior identi\u00ad fication made when fresh in the Plemory of a witness as required by Evidence Code j 1233(b), and only after the witness testifies as to its accuracy uhen made as required by Evidence Code S 1238(c), seems logical and appropriate .Iemories of faces tend to fade more rapidly than -54-- uemories of events. Futhermore, personal appearances change and, in\u00ad deed, can be deliberately altered at the time of trial. Thus, the rejection of a federal rule penaitting a hearsay exception for a prior identification should not induce California to alter or repeal l<vidence Code\" 123(,. Article 4. Spontaneous, Contemporaneous and Dying Declarations. 1. California Evidence Code; 1240 provides an exception for spontane\u00ad ous statements. Federal ;(ule 003(2) provides what appears to be an identical exception, although it is couched in different terms. The only possible difference is that the federal rule only requires that the statement relate to a startling event or condition whereas in California the statement must \"narrate, describe, or explain\" the act, condition, or event. Thus, if a person is injured in a certain manner, the spon\u00ad taneous excited statement of a witness that \"She's the third person hurt that way this lIlOnth,' arguably, might not fall under the California provision although it would come under the federal rule. However, inclusion of the word \"explain\" under the \u00a7 1240 seems adequate to give sufficient flexibility to the courts to admit spontaneous statements when otherwise appropriate; hence no alteration is needed. 2. Section 1241 provides an exception for a statement of a declar\u00ad ant \"offered to explain, qualify, or make understandable conduct of the declarant,\" if the statement was made while declarant was eneaged in such conduct. The federal counterpart, Rule 803(1) is substantially broader. It provides an exception for any statement of a declarant made either while declarant was perceiving an event or condition or immedi\u00ad ately thereafter. The federal provision, although generally accepted in only a minor\u00ad ity of jurisdictions, is in line with \",odern thihking regarding spon\u00ad :i 293 (2d ed. 1972). California goes half way by accepting some \"unexcited utterances\" but not others. \"1hy a contemporaneous utterance that ex\u00ad plains declarant's conduct is permitted when a statement describing ongoing conduct of another person is not, is not at all clear. Cali\u00ad fornia should adopt the modern rule as embodied in Federal Rule 803(1) and alter \u00a7 1241 accordingly. -55-3. California Evidence Code 'i 1242 and Federal Rule 804(,,) (2) provide hearsay exceptions for certain statements under belief of im\u00ad penrline death. Several differences exist between the two provisions. The California rule is a bit broader than the federal rule in that with respect to criminal cases the federal rule applies only to prosecutions for homicide tohereas the state rule is unlimited. however, the federal rule is much broader with respect to civil actions since the statement can be utilized even when declarant survives, whereas in Califonlia the statement is per~itted only if death occurs. Use of such a statement in federal courts is cut back, however, by the requirement that declarant be unavailable at the time of trial. Limitations On the use of dying declarations are arbitrary, re\u00ad flecting doubt as to the justification for any hearsay exception for such statements. Once an exception is \"~de, however, there is little reason to restrict its scope solely to homicide cases. For an excellent discussion see HcCormick, Evidence, ch. 28 (2d ed. 1972). ,loreover, the safeguard to truth of such declarations, the fear of lying at the time of death, exists \"hen the declarant believes death is imminent and is unrelated to his ultimate survival. Thus California Evidence Code \u00a7 1242 should not be cut back to eliminate criminal cases other than homicide, but should be expanded to permit statements made under a belief of impending death, even though death does not occur. It is unnecessary to require that declarant be unavailable at the time of trial, as does Federal Rule 804(b)(2), in order for the exception to operate. If the declarant is available, then he can be called and subjected to full examination on the matter and it Is of far less con\u00ad sequence uhether or not the statement is admitted. The court may always keep out such a statement on the ground that its value is outweiehed by possible prejudicial aspects. Article 5. Statements of Mental or Physical State. 1. California Evidence Code \u00a7 1250 provides a hearsay exception for statements re\u00ad garding declarant's present state of mind or physical state when declar\u00ad ant's state of ,\"ind or physical state is an issue in the case or when the statement is offered to prove or explain acts or conduct of defend\u00ad ant. Federal Rule 803(3) permits such statements but without specifying the purposes for which they can be utilized. toth the California and -56-Federal provisions specifically exclude statements of \",emory or belief offered to prove the facts remembered or believed. From a ~ractical point of view the provisions are identical in substance. Olle must recall that the Federal 2ules already contain a very broad contemporaneous utterance exception (Rule 803(1)} which, arguably, makes 803(3) unnecessary and thus accounts for its broad wording. The limitations in California C 1250 simply refer to the relevancy of such stateuents and reflect a fear that the law adopted in the famous case of -\u00b7'utual Life Ir:s. Co. v,. Hillmon, 145 U.S. 285, 295- 300 (1392), might be ap?lied too broadly, The question raised by Hillmon is whether a statei.lent by one person, X, \"r am going to Cripple Creek \"ith Y,' can be utilized to show not only that X \"ent to Cripple Creek, but that Y did so as well. Obviously the declarant's stated interest is relevant as to his own actions in regard thereto; but such a statement cannot 108ically be used to prove the acts of another. That Rule 803(3) was not intended to interfere with the normal rules of relevancy of such statements is clear. In approving Rule 803(3) the House Committee on the Judiciary specifically cited Hillmon and noted that the rule should not permit statements of intent to prove conduct of someone other than declarant. 2. California Evidence Code \u00a7 1251 permits statements of a de\u00ad clarant's past physical or mental state only if such physical or mental state is in issue and provided declarant is unavailable as a witness at trial. The hearsay dangers are substantially enhanced when a declarant describes past as opposed to present symptoms, for declarant's memory of previous sufferings may be faulty and those to whom the statement is made cannot observe declarant's actions to see if they are consistent with the stated symptoms. The counterpart federal rule, 803(4), pro\u00ad vides an exception for past physical or mental symptoms only when made for and pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment. In one aspect, the federal rule is broader than \u00a7 1251 since a statement of an absent eyewitness made to a doctor for diagnostic purposes could have relevance to a case despite the fact that the de\u00ad clarant's own physical condition was not in issue. For example, in a case by X against his employer, E, for negligently controlling radio\u00ad active materials, statements of \"~. s fellOlJ employee. Y, who died of -57-radiation poisoning, to Y's doctor could be of great significance. Such evidence is held to be admissible in many jurisdictions since one is likely to tell the truth to the best of his ability when consulting a physician for diagnosis or treatment of his mnl ailments. It would seem appropriate, therefore, to amend E',idence Code \u00a7 1251 to penuit state\u00ad ments of a person's past mental or physical symptoms or sensations made to a doctor for purposes of diagnosis or treatClent, even though such physical or mental condition is not in issue. On the other hand, \"J 1251 is broacler than the federal rule which, unlike d 1251, does not include a blanket exception for statements of past wental or physical symptollis or sensations when the state of ~ind or the physical symptoms are in issue. This raises a question whether the current provisions of 5 1251 should be retained. These provisions are quite modest; they require the declarant to be unavailable, and, under \u00a7 1252, such declarations are inadmissible if circumstances indicate the declarations are not trustworthy. On the surface, at least, current 0 1251 appears reasonable. Hhen a person's physical or mental condition is in issue and that person is unavailable, the need for the evidence, if otherwise trustworthy, out\u00ad weighs the hearsay dangers. There is, however, an underlying problem in that \"in issue\" is not a precise term. In some cases, the definition clearly applies; for ex~ple, when one sues on the basis of an inten\u00ad tional tort, evidence of intent is appropriate. But rarely, if ever, will such evidence not be in the form of an admission of a party or a predecessor in interest of a party and thus admissible on other grounds. Consider a more complicated case. F Corporation sues D, a physician, for slander, alleging that D falsely told employees of P that processes in P's plant seriously endangered their health, thus causing several of them to leave their jobs. One such employee, now living abroad, re\u00ad cently wrote a letter to a friend, stating, HI quit \"Iy job with P solely because after talking to D, I feared for ny health.\" Is such evidence admissible under ~ 12517 Is the employee's mental state \"in issue\"? Section 1251 specifically excludes the evidence if it is offered to prove any fact other than state of mind, emotion, or physical sensation. If the eVidence comes in solely to show that the employee feared for his health, it could be argued that his mental state was in issue. nut the -5:;,' Gtatement would not be admissible to show publication, i.e., that the eo'ployee heard D's words. That would have to be proved independently. Furthermore, and more fundamental, it is unclear if the statement could be admitted to show why the employee quit. If one takes the position that it is only an inference froEl the employee's state of mind (fear for health) that he quit for that reason, then state of mind is not an issue itself but only used as circumstantial evidence of another fact that is in issue. The official Comment to, 1251 reads, \"If the past mental or physical state is to be used merely as circumstantial evidence of some other fact, \" \" * the statetlent is inadmissible hearsay.\" It .uay be that the value of the evidence to be admitted justifies court determination, on a case-by-case basis, of when the statute does or does not apply. But the uncertainty as to application raises a serious question as to whether \u00a7 1251 should be scrapped entirely in favor of Federal Rule 803(4). Of course, it must be emphasized that the Federal Rules contain t>10 catchall exceptions, :!ule 803(24) and 1.ule 804(5), that permit the courts to admit hearsay not falling within specified exceptions. Those provisions '\"ould seem particularly appro\u00ad priate for admission of statements of past state of mind or physical condition in appropriate cases. Unless California provisions are amended to include such catchall clauses, arguably the current language of ~ 1251 referrin~ to matters \"in issue\" should not be eliminated. J. As mentioned above, California ~vidence Code \u00a7 1252. which has no federal counterpart, simply gives the court power to exclude hearsay statements regarding physical or mental condition when circumstances indicate they lack trustworthiness. Such a provision is superfluous in light of general provisions for exclusion of evidence; however, it emphasizes the need for caution on the part of courts regarding the evidence in question and arguably should not be altered or repealed. Article 6. Statements Relating to Wills and to Claims Against Estates. 1. California Evidence Code 5 1260 provides a hearsay excep\u00ad tion for a statement by declarant as to whether or not he has nmde, revoked, or identified his will. There is no federal counterpart. IUthout this special exception, the evidence would be barred under \u00a7 1250 \"hich, as previously noted, 'does not make admissible evidence of a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or be\u00ad lieved.' A ereat nmny courts, however, have found a special exception -5~-for statements regarding an 1~72). In the long run, such an exception assists in carrying out testators' intentions and thus should be retained. rlormally, there is little danger that a person nUL deliberately make a fals,\" or misleading statement conc' rning his mm .<!ill. The lack of a federal provision may be due, in part, to the fact that ordinary will contests usually do not reach federal courts. 2. California Evidence Code i 1261 provides an exception for a statement of a decedent i'1 ''', act'.on against his estate. The purpose is to help balance the fact that the plaintiff can give live testimony >Thereas the decedent cannot. l:istorically the .,ethod of controlling this injustice\" was to invoka a \"dead man statute '''hich prohibited testimony by the living party. Such a limitation was ridiculous and has been rejected under the modern codes, but \u00a7 1261 helps to soften the blow by permitting hearsay statements of the deceased. T:1e section specifically provides that the statement must have been \"made upon the personal knowledge of the declarant at a time when the matter had re\u00ad cently been perceived by hiI\" and when his recollection was clear.' Furthermore, 5 12f.l (b) holds such a statement to be inadmissible if circumstances indicate it is untrustworthy. There is no federal rule comparable to ~ 1261. Initially, a pro\u00ad posed Rule d04(b)(2) would have permitted any statement of an absent declarant's recent perception not in contemplation of litigation, regardless of who were the parties or the nature of the litigation. The provision was deleted by the Eouse Committee on the Judiciary because it permitted too broad an exception to the hearsay rule. A more limited rule akin to \u00a7 1261 apparently was never considered. lbere is no question that ; 1261 permits admission of self-serving, unreliable hearsay asscrt~onc of the most ~~ngerous type. There is, however, something to the unfairness argument when one of the parties is deceased and the other is not. The initial decision to include 5 1261 took these matters into consideration. The federal rules provide no additional insight into the problem and hence do not dictate a repeal. Article 7. Business Records. California Evidence Code Sections 1270-1272, taken together with \u00a7 250, I;hich defines a \"\"riting,\" estab\u00ad lish a traditional broad hearsay exception for records or absence of records of a business or calling, whether or not operated for profit. The sections are in subst\"nce identical to Federal P.ules 803 (:\u00bb and U03(7). Article 8. Official necords and iJritings. 1. California Evidence Code \u00a7 1280 provides an exception for an official record identical to the exception for an ordinary Jusiness record under ] 1271 except that the custodian or other qualified witness need not testify as to the mode and preparation of an official record as a prerequisite to admission, whereas such testimony is required for an ordinary business record. The federal counterpart to ;, 12{)0, ;Zule 803(ii), appears more restrictive. It permits records \"setting forth (A) the activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel, or (e) in civil actions and proceedings and against the Government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an inves\u00ad tigation made pursuant to authority 1';ranted by law.\"' The state rule, despite its more general terms seems clearly to cover all matters covered by parts (A) and (B) of the federal rule. TI,e caveat in part (B) of the federal rule regarding police officers and other law enforcement officials creates an ambiguity when read in con\u00ad nection with .lule 803(6) dealing with ordinary business records. The latter does not contain a similar caveat and would clearly seem to permit reports by such officers of their oton observations. Yet some doubt must be cast on the scope of 803(6), since the house of Represent\u00ad atives engaged in an elaborate discussion of the evils of utilizing police reports against an accused when voting to insert the caveat in Rule 803(8). Since the justification for treating police reports dif\u00ad ferently from other business records is weak, the current language in ~ 1280 is preferable to that of the federal rule and avoids creating an ambiguity in respect to ~ 1271. Section 1230 does not specifically mention official investigations as does part (e) of Federal Rule 803(d). If a strict analysis is observed, the record of an investigation could not be introduced under the state rule if the decision relied in any ~ray on testimony or infor\u00ad mation obtained from persons who did not have an official obligation -61-routinely to report their observations. Section l280Cc) merely states that\u00b7 the sources of infornation and IJethod and time of preparation [of the official record] must be . such as to indicate its trustworthi\u00ad ness.\" But the official Comments to J 1280 seem to require that the sources have the same duty to report as is required under \u00a7 1271. Furthermore, sections 1282 and 1283, discussed belo,7, indicate that findings of fact by government investigators nay not automatically be excepted from the hearsay rule, regardless of the sources of infor\u00ad mation. It would seem useful, therefore, to clear up ru'y uncertainty by adding a clause which provides for the introduction of factual findings of official investigations whenever the circumstances indicate that the findings are tr(lstworthy, regardless of whether all persons who gave testimony during the course of such an investigation had a routine duty to report their observations. !1oreover, there is no reason automa\u00ad tically to prohibit the use of such findings against the accused in criminal cases as is done under the federal provision. Courts can be expected to scrutinize the record in such situations to enSure that the accused is not unfairly prejudiced by admission of such evidence. 2. Sections 1281, regarding records of vital statistics, and 1284, pertaining to statements of the absence of a public in substance, as Federal :tules 803 (<;) and 803 (10). record, are the same Sections 1282 and 1283, however, which govern findings by federal officials that a person is alive or dead or that he is offically uissing, or captured by a hostile force, or interned in a foreign country, have no federal counter\u00ad parts other than Rule 803(8)(C) regarding the results of official investigations. There is no special reason for altering these sections except that they would automatically be included in a more general clause accepting the factual findings of official investigations. Article 9. Fortler Testimony. California Evidence Code 5\u00a7 1290- 1292 provide a hearsay exception for certain testimony given in prior proceedings. Federal Rule 804 (h)( 1) deals with the same subject matter, but is much simpler inform. There are several significant substantive differences between the California and federal provisons as follows: 1. Evidence Code \u00a7 1290 defines former testimony to include formal testimony under oath in agency adjudications and arbitration proceedings as well as in court cases and depositions. Federal 'Zule 804 (b) (1) does -62-not specifically include agency hearings and arbitration proceedings. There seetls littl., re'lson not to include ::>11 former te\"timony, formally ,1iven, regardless of the nature of the proceedings, provided other safeguards are met. Therefore, i 1290 should be left as is. 2. :;ection 1291(a) (1) provi :es a hearsay excel tion for former testimony against a person who offered the testimony in the prior pro\u00ad ceeding or agains\u00b7t that pcorson I s successor in interest. do other safe\u00ad guard is required. Federal itule 804 (b) (1) does not except any former testimony unles~ the person against whom it is offered or a predecessor in interest 'had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testi\u00ad !>lony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.' T;,e federal rule is preferable. A person who of fers test iruony in a prior case hJaY have had entirely different motives than when faced with that evidence at a later time. The use of such evidence against a successor in interest who was not present '~hen the testimony was taken seems particularly inappropri\u00ad ate without such a safeguard. It should be noted that \"henever former testimony of any other type is offered in California, the person against whom it was offered, wheth\u00ad er or not a party to the original proceeding, is protected by a rule re\u00ad quiring that the person himself or some party to the original proceeding has had appropriate opportunity and motive and interest to cross-examine the declarant similar to the current \",otive and interest of the person against whom the evidence is sought to be introduced. See California Evidence Code 5\u00a7 1291(a)(2), 1292(a)(3). Section 1291(a)(1) should be amended accordingly. 3. ~ection 1292 admits former testimony (assUilling other conditions are met) against persons who were neither parties not successors in interest of parties in the initial proceeding when declarant's testimony was taken. FederAl R\"le 8,)~ (h) (1) ie cor;\" in\u00a3<: to peroons who were parties to the first proceeding or their successors in interest. The House Committee on the Judiciary eliminated broader language akin to that in \u00a7 l2n. As the leading writers on the subject have noted, see l'lcCormick. Lvidence \u00a7 261 (2d ed. 1972), the federal-type limitations on former testimony are absurd in light of far more liberal rules permitting exceptions for other types of hearsay with far fe\"er safeguards. The with a party to a.former proceeding, but whether the person a.gainat whom the testimony is now sought to be used is protected by the fact that at the time the testimony was given there was adequate opportunity and proper motive and interest for full examination of the declarant. Since \u00a7 1292 contains the proper safeguards, it would be improper to alter \u00a7 1292 to exclude testimony even against persons who were neither parties nor successors to parties to the initial proceedings. 4. Section 1292, which permits former testimony against those not parties to the initial proceeding, li,\u00b7,1ts use of such testimony to civil cases. See \u00a7 1292(a)(2). This appears inconsistent with \u00a7 1291(a)(I) which permits former testimony introduced by a current party's pred\u00ad ecessor in interest to come in against the current party in criminal as well as in civil proceedings. For this purpose, no logical distinction can be made between persons who were not present at the time the testi\u00ad mony was taken. Being a \"successor-in-interest\" provides no special security from unfairness. The matter is particularly grievous in Cali\u00ad fornia because, as already noted, \u00a7 1291(a)(1) does not have the usually required safeguards of adequate examination. Federal Rule 804(b)(I), which allows former testimony only against parties to the original proceedings and their successors, limits use against successors to civil actions. The question whether criminal actions should or should not be included is a difficult one. The inability of a criminal defendant ever to confront a tlitness whose testimony, given in a former which defendant was not a party, is a serious detriment. proceeding to On the other hand, one might want to grant the exception for application only in those cases in which the nature of the examination provided full and adequate protection of defendant's rights and where justice would not be served by exclusion. On balance, the exception statutes probably should not prohibit use of former testimony in criminal proceedings. It is important to note that no matter how the issue of use in criminal cases is resolved,.\u00a7\u00a7 1291(a)(I) and 1292(a)(2) should be harmonized. and \u00a7 1291(a)(I) should be amended to require appropriate safeguards. Article 10. Judgments. 1. California Evidence Code t 1300 excepts from the hearsay rule a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a -64-crime punishable as a felony to prove any fact essential to the judg\u00ad ment. However, the ex ception is confined to civil actions. Federal Rule 803(22) is similar with the following differences, (1) Section 1300 refers to a crime punishable as a felony, whereas Rule g03(2Z) refers to a crime punishable by death o~ imprisonment in excess of one year. The federal rule, which conforms to California's definition of a felony, is preferable. A crime committed in another jurisdiction may be deemed a \"felony\" even though it is not regarded as serious and the authorized punishment is far less than what would qual\u00ad ify as a felony in California. This problem is not unique to this section. Perhaps it could be solved by defining \"felony, ,.' .,hen com\u00ad mitted elsewhere, as a crime that could be a felony in California. (Z) Federal Rule 803(2Z) is not confined to civil cases as is \u00a7 1300. The federal rule excludes use by the prosecution of convictions against persons other than the accused. Otherwise, however, convictions can be admitted in criminal cases. The federal rule, with its limi\u00ad tation regarding use by the prosecution of .convictions against third persons, is preferable. First it may be important for a criminal de\u00ad fendant to be able to utilize the exception, for example, to show that another person has been convicted of the crime for which he is being tried. Second, there is no reason that the prosecutor should not be permitted to use defendant's own prior conviction. Defendant had representation and the strongest of motives to obtain an acquittal. And the standard of conviction, beyond a reasonable doubt, adds reliability to the judgment. [It must be remembered that such a rule does not permit introduction of every prior conviction of every defendant. Only in a relatively rare situation when a fact that must have been decided in a prior case is relevant to the present action, can such a conviction be admitted, and only then when the value of the evidence outweighs its obvious prejudicial nature.] Evidence Code \u00a7 1300 should be amended to conform to Federal Rule 803(2Z). 2. California Evidence Code ~} 1301 and 1302 have no federal counterparts. They provide that certain judgments in civil cases may be introduced to prove certain facts essential to those judgments. Ba\u00ad sically the cases involve actions for indemnity or warranty for the -65-&mOunt ofa judgment, and actions based on vicarious liability when in a prior suit the primary tortfeasor has been held liable. The policy behind these sections are strongly related to principles of collateral estoppel. Unfortunately, there are substantial hearsay dangers that raise serious questions about the wisdom of ~; 1301 and 1302. For example, suppose a plaintiff sues and obtains a large judg\u00ad ment against a servant, who is insolvent. Plaintiff in a subsequent suit against the servant's employer may introduce the judgment obtained against the servant to prove the latter's liability. Yet the servant may have had little motive and no money ,;ith \"hich to put up a defense. Indeed, even a judgment by default would be admissible under the sec\u00ad tion. Under\" 1300 regarding criminal conVictions, only felony convic\u00ad tions are admissible. By way of contrast \u00a7\u00a7 1301 and 1302 provide no similar guarantee as to the importance of the first action. Noreover, the reasonable doubt standard is inapplicable in civil cases, so the decision in the first suit may have been a close one. In states such as California, as many as three of the twelve jurors could eVen have voted for the losing party. Perhaps if \u00a75 1301 and 1302 are to be retained, clauses should be added permitting the opposing party to introduce evidence that the decision was not unanimous. It is important to note that any analysis of ~ 1302 must take into consideration the case of l~rkley ~ Beagle. 66 Cal.2d 951, 429 P.2d 129, 59 Cal. Rptr. B09 (1967), already discussed in connection ,;ith Evidence Code ~\u00a7 1224-1227. That decision interpreted j 1224 not to apply to cases of vicarious liability in employer-employee situations. The court took the position that the new evidence code sections were designed only to carry forth 'the la,; as it had previously existed under what had been former Section 1851 of Code of Civil Procedure. Since g 1302 also derives from former Section 1851 (see Comment to r, 1302), its application is in doubt in any case in ,;hich an employee is sued on the basis of acts of an employee and a judgment against the employee is sought to be introduced, At the very least 5 1302 should be rewritten to clarify the la,;, If \u00a7 1302 is to be retained, there seems little reason not to apply the section to the employer-employee situation. -66\u00b7-Article 11. Family History. 1. California Evidence Code ~\u00a7 1310 and 1311 provid~ a hearsay ~xccption for certain statements concerning a person's family history. The sections are nearly identical to Federal Rule 804(b) (4) with one exccptiou. Under the federal rule a statement by one persen regarding the family l.istory of another is admissible if the declarant is related to the person \"hose history is involved or was so intimately associated with the latter's family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared. Section 1311 (a) (2) (i) a:ld (ii) ~rc\u00b7,::'d~ :on \"ddi ~iond r:lquircment, when the declarant is not related to the person whose history is involved. In that case the declarant's inforwation must have been received from that other person or from someone related to him or be based upon repute in that other person's family. This additional requirement seems unwarranted and unnecessary. It will often be difficult. if not impossible, to show the source of an absent declarant's information. Yet rhen it can be proved that a close relationship existed between declarant and the family of the person whose history is involved, it can often be fairly assumed that defendant had access to accurate information. It should also be noted that \u00a7 1311(b), for which there is no fed\u00ad eral counterpart. highlights the power of the court to exclude unreli\u00ad able evidence by providinz that statements of family history are inad\u00ad missible if made under circumstances indicating a lack of trustworthi\u00ad ness. Given this safeguard, ; 1311(a)(2)(i) and (ii) should be repealed. 2. California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1312-1316 provide hearsay excep\u00ad tions for family history for entries in family and church records, reputations in the family or community, and for marriage, baptismal and similar certificates. Federal Rules 803(11), (12), (13). and (19) provide nt!arly ident-<,c\"l exc'.rtiO'1R. The::e is, however, one wording difference that affects these sections as well as those involving state\u00ad ments of family history. The federal rules consistently add the word\" adoption\" to the list of matters included in family history, whereas the California provisions do not. The difference is probably unimportant since both federal and state provisions include \"ancestry.\" However, the matter is clouded by a concluding clause in California \u00a7\u00a7 1312 and 1313 allowing eVidence of another 'similar fact of the family history of -67-a member of the faioily by blood Q!. \"arriafie.\" '~'\u00a7 1315, and 1316, refer only to another \"similar fact of family history.\" Elimination of the words \"by blood or marriage at the end of \u00a7. 1312 and 1313 would seem wise. Another minor difference is that Federal nule G03(19) permits community reputation to be admitted concerning a person' s ;'birth, adop\u00ad tion, marriage, divorce, death, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact,' whereas its California counterpart, ~ 1314, permits such evidence only regarding a person's \"date or fact of birth, marriage, divorce, or death.\" The federal rule seems preferable. If community reputation, although ad\u00ad mittedly a weak source of information, is available to help prove a key question of ancestry, and the circumstances are such as to indicate its reliability, it should be received into evidence. Article 12. Reputation Concerning Community History, Property Interests. and Character. California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1320-1324 provide hearsay exceptions for reputation concerning facts of public notoriety and of a person's character. Federal Rules 803(20) and (21) cover much of the same ground. There is no federal counterpart to California \u00a7 1321 permitting evidence of reputation concerning public interest in property in the community. Nor is there a federal provision akin to \u00a7 1323 providing an exception for a statement of an absent declarant, who had sufficient knOldedge of the facts, regarding the boundary of land. The latter seems questionable since there is no special guarantee that such a flat hearsay declaration is trustworthy. However, such an exception apparently has long been a part of the California law of evidence (see Comment to ~ 1323), and the section itself requires exclusion of the statement if it appears untrustworthy. Article 13. D_:!-sl<.0~itive Instruments and Ancient Hritings. Cali\u00ad fornia ~vidence Code 1331, and 1600 deal with exceptions for dispositive instruments and ancient writings. Their federal counter\u00ad parts are Federal li.ules 803(14), (15). and (16). There is only one major difference. Federal Rule 303(16) defines an \"ancient\" document as one more than 20 years old. Section 1331 defines such a document as one more than 30 years old and adds the requirement that the statement sought to be introduced must generally have been acted upon as true by persons having an interest. -6J-Although one could debate t<hether tllenty or thirty years is more ap~ropriate, there seems little reason to alter ~ 1331 in that respect. The additional requirement of the state provision is a valuable safe\u00ad guard and should be retained. Article 14. Commercial, Scientific, and Similar Publications. California Jvidence Code \u00a7\" 1340 and 1341 deal with commercial and scientific publications as do Federal Rules 303(17) and (18). As al\u00ad ready noted in the discussion of ~ 721(b) regarding cross-examination of experts, California , 1341 is far more restrictive than is Federal Rule 003(10) regarding admission of learned publications. Indeed \u00a7 1341 only permits use of books to prove facts of general notoriety and interest. By \\lay of contrast, the federal rule provides a hearsay exception for any statement in any book, periodical or pamphlet established as reli\u00ad able by expert testimony or judicial notice, if called to the attention of an expert witness during cross-examination or relied upon by him during direct examination. Obviously there \u00abould be substantial danger of admitting untrust\u00ad worthy evidence if any statement in a document purporting to be reliable were to be admissible in spite of the hearsay rule. On the other hand, the use of such statements, when the general reliability of their source is established, is justified at least when, as required by the federal rule, the statements are called to the attention of an expert who is testifying in the case. Such evidence is valuable in situations where the amount in con\u00ad troversy is limited or where one party has limited assets and is hard pressed to obtain a battery of experts to match those of his opponent. It would seem appropriate therefore to amend } 1341 to adopt a provision akin to Federal Rule 803(13). In doing so, California should also adopt the sentence in b03(18) providing that admissible statements from books and other documents shall be read to the trier of fact but shall not be received as exhibits. This keeps the jury from giving undue weight to such statements during the course of its deliberations. For a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of various hearsay exceptions for sci\u00ad entific and literary works, see ~lcCormick, Zvidence :; 321 (2d ed. 1972). Additional Exceptions in Federal I{ules Jot Contained in the Cali\u00ad fornia evidence Code. 1. Federal Rule 803(23) provides a hearsay excep\u00ad tion for any judgment to prove facts relating to \"personal, family, or -69-general history, or boundaries, essential to the judgment if the same would be ~rovable by evidence of reputation.' The argument in favor of such an exception is that a judgment ~s as good as reputation. However, there is considerable doub~ as to the evidentiary value of a judgment in a civil caoe, particularly bass:! upm defendant's def lUlt. Even if litieated, the level of the burden of proof in civil cases (plus the non-unanimous verdict. where permitted) does not give strong guarantees of reliability particularly because there is no assurance that the case '(\\Tas tried 0::-clef c:lued \"lith v:\"g::.:.:. On the tlhole it Mould not seem wise for California to adopt a rule akin to Federal Rule 803(23). 2. Federal Rules 003(24) and a04(b)(~) provide special omnibus exceptions for stateLlents not covered by one of the specific hearsay exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trust\u00ad worthiness,\" if admission is in the interest of justice and \"the state\u00ad ment is more probative on the point for \"'hich it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure throup,h reasonable efforts. ,. Lawyers have long recognized the arbitrary nature of the hearsay exceptions. From time to time suggestions have been made to do away with the hearsay rule entirely and to leave the admissibility of hearsay to the discretion of the court. Federal Rules 803(24) and 804(b)(5) provide a step in that direction. These rules are subject to challenge on tl'O grounds. First, they give the court considerable power to admit untrust\",orthy evidence. For exsmp~.\", some California hearsay exceptions have no circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. See, for example, the prior discussion of r, 1224. Adoption of provisions like Federal Rules 803(24) and 804(b)(5) would, at least theoretically, permit the court to admit any h\"'~~~e'!j~ :-t:A.!:e\"1J-'!nt s:'nce. a!ly st.2.tement has '\u00b7equivalent as one admitted under \u00a7 1224. Second, because the standards of admission under these federal rules are so uncertain, attorneys Hill not be able to plan cases ade\u00ad quately. For example, a lawyer's entire stategy may depend on \"hether a crucial hearsay declaration will or will not be received. Indeed some cases which heretofore IOould not have been filled \"ould be brought with the hope that the only eviJence, statements of a deceased witness -70--~ clearly inadmissible under prior evidence law, would now be received. This drawback of uncertainty has been considered and dealt with in Rules 803(24) and 804(b)(5), which provide that the rules cannot be invoked unless tbe proponent informed the adverse party of his intention to do so sufficiently in advance of trisl to permit the adverse party to meet tbe evidence. This does not completely solve tbe problem, however. InfOrming tbe opposing side is, of course, important. Hut even When all persons interested are informed, they still want, and may need to know whether the court will admit tbe eVidence. Thus what is needed ia a provision for a pre-trial decision as to whetber tbe standards of tbe bear say exception have been met. On balance it would seem desirable to add to the California code a prOVision permitting introduction of hearsay evidence not falling within a specific exception, but only if the court, on motion of the proponent before trial, determines that the evidence is vital to the case and has sufficient guarantees of trustwortbiness to justify its admission. Failure of the proponent to move the matter in time to permit the opposing party to meet the evidence sbould be a ground for refusal to grant relief. As was noted at the outset of the hearsay material, the California scheme does not prohibit court-made hearsay exceptions in addition to those created by statute. Ilowever, although a court might feel impelled to admit reliable hearsay on a case by case baSiS, the court would often be extremely reluctant to establisb an entire new exception just to permit admission of an item of evidence in a case before it. Therefore, a new provision, as suggested above, would seem useful and appropriate. DIVISION 11. URITINGS Chapter 1. Authentication and Proof of I'lritings 1. California Evidence Code \u00a7; 1400-1402 and 5\u00a7 1410-1421 are tbe general provisions that establish a requirement of authentication and set forth the means by which authentication can be accomplished. The federal counterpart is Rule 901. (1) One interesting difference is the fact that Federal Rule 901 refers to all items sought to be introduced into evidence Whereas the California provisions apply only to \"writings\" which are defined in -71-EYi4leaea ~ode ,; 250 as any recorded method of communicaUon or repre\u00ad 'IIentation. The matter is probably of no consequence. Any real evidenc.e which is not within the definition of a \"writing\" \"ould nevertheless not be admitted without sufficient authentication, for otherwise it would be irrelevant. (2) A second difference is that Federal '(ule 901 has no provision akin to \u00a7 1402 which deals with altered writings, requiring the pro\u00ad ponent to explain the alteration before the writing can be admitted. Again the differ~nce 1s trivial, although conceivably in a few cases, writings will be held inadmissible in California whereas they would have been admitted in federal courts. If a writing is otherwise authen\u00ad ticated, an apparent alteration would seem more appropriately to go to the weight of evidence, not to admiasibility. (3) Federal Rule 901 (b)(l) through (b)(lO) gives a series of non\u00ad exclusive illustrations of how authentication can be accomplished. California Evidence Code ~\u00a7 1410-1421 provide a very similar, non\u00ad exclusive liat. The federal rule specifically deals with voice identi\u00ad fication. telephone conversations, and evidence regarding a process or system, whereas the state provisions do not mention these matters. Since these provisions merely involve a common-sense approach, and are non-exclusive, there seeus little reason for their adoption in the California code. (4) Federal Rule 901(b)(8) does provide for authentication of a document over 20 years old by showing its age and that its condition snd location are consistent with authenticity. There ia no comparable California statute. It is questionable if the showing auitable for the federal rule would satisfy California authentication requirements in the absence of a specific provision, although clearly it would not take much additional eviden~\" ~\" do '0. There seems little reason to add a new section to the California code. Age alone seems a weak and unsatis\u00ad factory basis for authenticity; the matter can be left to the California courts for an item by item determination on all the information avail\u00ad able. 2. California Evidence Code 5G 1450-1454 deal with certain pre\u00ad sumptions of authenticity that derive from official and offically ack\u00ad nowledged l~ritings. Federal Rule 902(1)-(4), -72-identical ground. dowever, Federal .~ule 902, unlike the California code, also covers publications issued by public authority, newspapers and periodicals, commercial paper, and trade inscriptions. The latter avoids ridiculous cases such as Keegan .Y.:.. ~ Giant \u00a32..:..... 150 iIe. 283, 110 A.2d 599 (1954), in which the label on a can of peas was held unac\u00ad ceptable to authenticate the peas as a product of the compnay whose name appeared on the label. The failure of California to have provisions for self-authentication of such items is unimportant so long as the courts are willing to make sensible decisions based upon circumstantial evidence. Even if it would otherwise be desirable, it would be impossible to foresee and forge a statute for every particular type of item that might give rise to technical problems of authentication. Chapter 2. Secondary Evidence of IIritings Article 1. Best Evidence Rule. Both California (Evidence Code .\u00a7 1500) and federal courts (Rule 1002) have a so-called \"best evidence\" rule. There are, hO>1ever, several substantial differences. 1. Section 1500 holds that \"the writing itself\" is normally the only thing admissible to prove its contents. Dut the section does not define \"the writing itself, n nor is a definition to be found in Division 2 of the Evidence Code which is confined to the definition of specific terms. By way of contrast, Federal Rule 1001 defines an \"original\" as any writing or recording \"or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it.\" A computer printout sheet giving stored data is specifically defined as an \"originaL\" In Cali\u00ad fornia a problem arises in a situation where a person prepares two copies of a contract, one of which signs and the other of which is signed by the other party to the agreement. At trial the plaintiff who seeks to establish the existence of a contract attempts to introduce the document which bears only his signature. Is that the \"tn-iting itself\" or must he introduce the document bearing the signature of the defend\u00ad ant? The federal rule leaves no ambiguity. The proffered document qualifies as an original. Arguably the California code should be amended to define 'writing itself\" consistent with an ;'original\" as defined in Federal ;tule 1001 (3). (However, see the discussion in 2., immediately below.) -73-2. Federal Rule 1001 (4) defines as a \"duplicate' a counterpart of the original 'produced by the same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by means of photography * * * or by * * * re-recording, or by chemical reproduction, or by other equivalent techniques which accurately reproduces the original.\" Federal Rule 1003 then provides that a duplicate is admissible just as is an original unless there is a question of the authenticity of the original or when circumstances whow admission of the duplicate to be unjust. California has no comparable provision. If it did it would obviate a need for further definition of \"the writing itself\" as discussed above. Furthermore, such a rule would recognize the realities of to\u00ad day's world where record-keeping has advanced substantially over times when a shopkeeper neatly filed a,.ay each original invoice. There seems little doubt that California should ada~t a provision encompassing the provisions of Federal Rule 1003. (It should be noted, as discussed belm<. \u00a7\u00a7 1550 and 1551 of the California code do go part way in admit\u00ad ting certain photocopies as if they were originals. However, these sections are limited in scope.) 3. Federal ',-ules 1004-1007 govern the admissibility of evidence other than an original or duplicate to prove the contents of a writing. The comparable California provisions are contained in \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1510. There are a number of important difference. (1) California follows the so-called \"second best\" evidence rule, while the federal courts do not. Thus in federal courts if no original can be found after diligent search, any evidence of the contents of the document is admissible, even though a duplicate or other copy exists. In California, however, under ~ 1505, testimony as to the contents of a \"riting is not admiSSible\" even if the original cannot be found, if the proponent has a copy of the original. The idea is that a copy of a writing is likely to be more reliable than testimony as to the contents. The failure to distinguish among various copies (e.g., a recent photo\u00ad copy is more reliable than an older one done in longhand) tends to weaken the argument. When initially deciding upon which rule to follow, the legislature must have considered the deep split of authority on the matter. See generally l-IcCormick, Evidence j 241 (2d ed. 1972). Therefore, there is no special reason now to alter the initial decision, although the de\u00ad tails as to its operation should be reviewed if California adopts a provision lilte Federal :lule 1003, as suggested above. (2) California \u00a7 1510, for which there is no federal counterpart, permits a copy of a writing to be introduced into evidence if the writing itself has been produced at the hearing and w~de available for inspection by the other party. The provision is sensible. If the original is phYSically present, it can be compared with the copy to assure that they are identical. However, the original can then be returned to the custodian's files; it need not be tied up during the court proceedings. (3) Federal flule 1007 provides that secondary evidence of the contents of a writing, recording, or photograph can be introduced, without concern for the best evidence rule, if the testimony is that of the party against whom the evidence is to be offered, or if such party made a written admission of such contents. This provision is sensible. The dangers protected against by the best evidence rule are inapplicable to conscious admissions by an opposing party on the stand or in writing before trial. The 'Gatter is not of great significance; nevertheless California should consider adopting a similar provision. Article 2. Official Hritings and ~corded Hritings. California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1530-1532 deal with copies of recorded documents and of documents in custody of a public entity. The sections appear to inter\u00ad twine problems of authentication and best evidence. To the extent that . the best evidence rule is involved, \u00a7\u00a7 1530-1531 seem to cover the same ground as is contained in j\u00a7 1506 and 1507. The comment to ~ 1530 acknowledges that it deals not only with authentication and best evi\u00ad dence, but also overcomes hearsay problems by permitting introduction of a writing based upon a certification of a custodian that the copy is correct copy of the original. Although there is nothing wrong with a simple set of sections COVering all aspects of admissibility of public documents, the placement of \u00a7\u00a7 1530-1532 in the Evidence Code is extremely awkward. Instead of their current location as Article 2 of Chapter 2, which sandwiches them between Articles 1 and 3, dealing solely with the best evidence rule, the sections should constitute a special chapter of their own, with a -75-Suitable title designed to show just what the sections are designed to do. Overlapping, and hence confusing, provisions regarding authenticity should be eliminated. Article 3. Photographic ~opies. California \",vidence Code \u00a7 1550 provides an exception to the best evidence rule for photocopies or photoreproductions of any document, if the copy was made and kept in the ordinary course of business. Section 1551 provides a similar exception for any photocopy or photoreproduction of a document, since lost or destroyed, if the person in charge of making the copy, at the time it '~as made, attached to it a certificate that it is a correct copy of the original. The provisions are a step in the right direction. They do not eo as far as Federal Rule 1003, however, which \"ould admit these documents, and all others like them, as \"duplicates,\" even though the original is available and not produced. As noted previously, it would be highly desirable for California to adopt 'Iule 1003 in which case it might wish to consider elimination of \"~ 1550 and 1551 as unnecessary. Article 4. Production of Business itecords. California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1560-1566 provide a detailed procedure whereby a party can subpoena copies of business records to be deposited in court in a sealed envelope, accompanied by an affidavit of the custodian. The documents can then be offered into evidence on the basis of the affidavit and will not be barred either by rules regarding authentication or best evidence. Of course the affidavit wust aver that the affiant is the custodian, that the copy is a true copy, and that the original records were pre\u00ad pared in the ordinary course of business at or near the time of the events recorded. There is no comparable federal procedure. The provisions do have a noble purpose; they permit introduction of records over which there is no dispute, without the necessity of requiring the custodian to attend and bring the original records with him. There is certainly no reason to eliminate the proviSions, which make sense, merely because the fed\u00ad eral rules do not have a comparable set of provisions. The California rules are cumbersome, however. For example, it is not clear if the party who demands the records is entitled to see them prior to the trial or hearing when they are to be introduced. A party can be in difficulty if a key document, upon ~.'hich he was counting heavily, has not been sent. Any defects in the operation of the procedure should, of course, be eliminated. Chapter 3. Official liritings Ufecting Property California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1600-1605 deal with copies of recorded documents affecting property interests. They not only overcome best evidence problems, but problems of hearsay and authentication as well. These sections are consistent with and overlap the more general sections governing admissibility of publicly recorded documents. In most cases the same matters are covered by feueral provisions scattered throughout the rules. For example, \" 1600, the basic provision, reads very much like Federal Rule 303 (14) There is no reason to repeal or alter the California provisions. Houever, their placement in the code should be reconsidered to ensure that attorneys understand just what the pro\u00ad visions are designed "}
