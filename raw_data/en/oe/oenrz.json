MEDICAL DEVELOPMENT GROUP BOSTON - EVENTS The [Medical Development Group Boston](https://www.mdgboston.org/) (MDG Boston) is a community of individuals professionally committed to the Medical Device and other Medical Technology Industry segments united by the belief that innovation and advances in technology lead to substantial improvements in health care. MDG's Mission is to contribute to the continuing development of medical devices and other medical technologies by enhancing the professional development of its members, fostering and supporting entrepreneurial thinking, serving as a forum for exploration of new business opportunities, and promoting best practices in enterprise management. MDG pursues this mission through the organization of educational programs and forums: the facilitation of cross-disciplinary dialogue and collaboration; the creation of venues for networking and information sharing for current and aspiring professionals, clinicians, and entrepreneurs; and the development of alliances with complementary organizations. We would love for you to attend and spread the word in your community! For more information on our upcoming events, visit our [website](https://www.mdgboston.org/). MEDTECH BOSTON INFORMATION SOURCE & CALENDAR OF EVENTS Boston has long been known as a medical mecca of scientific discovery. Boston's healthcare professionals and administrators are adopting practices from other high-risk and service industries. The 'big data' movement is thriving, fundamentally changing our healthcare delivery systems. Digital health investments are higher than ever before. Medical hackathons and un-conferences are now an every-weekend occurrence. And both redesign and innovation promise to change medicine as we know it. It's all happening right here, right now. But the problem is that many of us don't know it. Despite Boston's innovative energy and a solid medical infrastructure, many medical providers and health care entrepreneurs remain in the dark about the opportunities, events and work happening in and around the city of Boston - and across the country. That's where we come in. At Medtech Boston, we highlight exciting medical innovation work in and around the city of Boston. We aim to start a discussion about the most exciting and controversial new healthcare offerings, igniting a new reputation for Boston as a city with first-class medical research and patient care, but also as a city full of passionate people who use new technology to think big thoughts about medicine's most pressing problems. More organizational information and event postings from Medtech Boston is available [here](https://medtechboston.medstro.com/).

FLIPPING FAILURE - PEER SUPPORT COMMUNITY RESOURCE [Flipping Failure](https://flippingfailure.mit.edu/) is a collection of video stories told by MIT students about their path towards resilience when faced with challenge at MIT. The goal of this community initiative is to provide visibility to stories of academic challenge and resilience so that we can begin shifting the conversation around struggle from something to be ashamed of to something that is human. Struggling is not only part of the human experience, but it is often the result of tackling difficult challenges and learning experiences. We hope that watching peers talk about their challenges and hearing about the productive and healthy strategies they used to cope will help other students discover their own path towards resilience and self-acceptance. Thanks to Our Partners: Support Services (S3)](http://studentlife.mit.edu/s3) If you are interested in learning more about Flipping Failure or would like to contribute your story, please contact flippingfailure [at] mit.edu (flippingfailure[at]mit[dot]edu).

[MIT iREFS](https://gsc.mit.edu/committees/hca/irefs/) is a student group that offers confidential peer-to-peer support to fellow graduate students. What do we do? Our mission is to ensure graduate student wellness, especially in times of uncertainty, stress, and conflict. We provide confidential, peer-to-peer conflict support and coaching. We also provide informed referrals to MIT resources and offices. Further, we organize conflict management workshops for the MIT graduate student community on active listening and difficult conversations. Please feel free to contact us if you are looking to talk to a fellow grad student regarding an issue that is a cause of concern/stress for you. We are here to provide a listening ear, inform you about key student resources that you could benefit from, and help brainstorm ways to come out of such challenging situations.
