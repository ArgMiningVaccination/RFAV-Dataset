CODE OF MARYLAND REGULATIONS (COMAR) COMAR is the official compilation of all regulations issued by agencies of the State of Maryland. The Maryland Register is COMAR's temporary supplement, printing all changes to regulations as soon as they occur. At lea st once annually, the changes to regulations printed in the Maryland Register are incorporated into COMAR by means of permanent supplements. CITATION TO COMAR REGULATIONS COMAR regulations are cited by title number, chapter number, and regulation number. Example: COMAR 10.08.01.03 refers to Title 10, Subtitle 08, Chapter 01, Regulation 03. DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE Incorporation by reference is a legal device by which a document is made part of COMAR simply by referring to i t. While the text of an incorporated document does not appear in COMAR, the provisions of the incorporated document are as fully enforceable as any other COMAR regulation. Each regulation that proposes to incorporate a document is identified in the Marylan d Register by an Editor's Note. The Cumulative Table of COMAR Regulations Adopted, Amended or Repealed, found online, also identifies each regulation incorporating a document. Documents incorporated by reference are available for inspection in various depo sitory libraries located throughout the State and at the Division of State Documents. These depositories are listed in the first issue of the Maryland Register published each year. For further information, call 410 -974-2486.

To determine if there have been any subsequent changes, check the Cumulative Table of COMAR Regulations Adopted, Amended, or Repealed'' which i s found online at www.dsd.state.md.us/CumulativeIndex.pdf. This table lists the regulations in numerical order, by their COMAR number, followed by the citation to the Maryland Register in which the change occurred.

(text unchanged) THEODORE DALLAS Secretary of Human Resources Title 08 DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Subtitle 02 FISHERIES SERVICE 08.02.01 General Authority: Natural Resources Article, \u00a7\u00a74 -215 and 4-206, Annotated Code of Maryland Notice of Proposed Actio n [12-074-P] The Secretary of Natural Resources proposes to adopt Regulation .10 under COMAR 08.02.01 General . Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to create a pilot program permit structure for future commercial fisheries pilot programs. Th e Department of Natural Resources proposes to conduct certain voluntary pilot projects for practical demonstration and evaluation of alternative fisheries management and harvest methods to increase harvest accountability as well as efficiency and value wit hin the fishery. Current fisheries management is burdened by historical management practices largely developed over the last 100 years. Regulatory practices necessary to support that system lack flexibility in application and are often too complex for easy understanding. Typically, fisheries today are managed by requiring inefficiency of harvesters. With each regulatory step, harvesters attempt to regain efficiency through unforeseen loopholes or advances in harvest techniques which outpace the regulation. Management agencies respond with additional regulations \u2014 and the cycle continues. The Department believes the regulatory burden on both management agency and harvesters can be significantly reduced by emphasizing improved harvest accountability techniques and resulting increased efficiency value in the fishery. However, rather than create temporary additional regulations that apply only to permit holders, the Department proposes to conduct pilot projects developed in cooperation with the commercial fishing industry. Individuals participating in these projects would receive permits from the Department. The permits would specify the details of the project. Additionally, Natural Resource Police would be informed of all permit holders and projects. Pilot projec ts for demonstration and evaluation of alternative accountability practices would greatly enhance development and application of improved management practices. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed act ion. Estimate of Economic Impact The proposed action has no economic impact. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has minimal or no economic impact on small businesses. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has no i mpact on individuals with disabilities.

PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 429 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012 Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to: (1) Establish sanctioning guidelines for the Board to use when imposing discipline on a licensee for violating the Maryland Morticians and Funeral Directors Act or COMAR 10.29; (2) Establish requirements for individuals to apply for a permit to operate a crematory, for a license to be a crematory supervisor or for a certification to be a crematory technician; (3) Establish an application process for an individual to receive a permit to operate a crematory , a license to be a crematory supervisor, or to be certified as a crematory technician; (4) Establish the duties of a crematory supervisor; (5) Allow an individual to act as an interim crematory supervisor; (6) Prohibit a crematory from operating without a crematory supervisor or an interim crematory supervisor; (7) Establish a renewal process for permit holders, licensees and certification holders; (8) Establish application fees for a permit, license, and certification, a renewal fee for a supervisor licen se and technician certification, a late fee, a reinstatement fee, and a replacement fee for a lost or damaged permit, license or certification; (9) Establish an inspection process for crematories, including minimum standards for operation; (10) Prohibit c ertain acts and establishing a code of ethics for permit holders, supervisors and technicians; (11) Establish a process by which deficiencies can be determined and corrected; (12) Establish penalties for certain acts relating to inspections and correction of deficiencies; (13) Establish a complaints process; and (14) Establish a procedure for cremating human remains, including removal, transportation, and identification of human remains. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal stan dard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. The Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors will incur expenses as a result of establishing a new licensure program, permitting program, and certification program, reviewing applications, responding to inquiries, maintaining files and a data system, handling disciplinary actions, etc. A moderate fee will be imposed on crematory operators, crematory supervisors, and crematory technicians to offset the cost of these ser vices. The Board has been approved to hire additional staff to carry out the required functions of this proposal which will be paid for using existing resources. There could be some income generated from penalties under COMAR 10.29.18.06. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (R+) 17,000 (E+) $30,000 B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments: NONE Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (-) $17,000 E. On other industries or trade groups: (-) Unquantifiable F. Direct and indirect effects on public: (+) Unquantifiable (-) Unquantifiable III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. Additional staff costs will be only a contractual inspector, Grade 14, whose duties will be split between crematories (1/5) and funeral establishments (4/5). The cost of this position will be borne through fees established in this regulation and e xisting monies already in the budget. D. The Board estimates that it will issue 30 permits to operate a crematory, 10 licenses for crematory supervisors, and 60 crematory technician certifications (of which half will pay the $100 fee, and half will pay th e $50 fees for having more than three technicians in a single crematory). The estimated amount of permits is different from crematory supervisors because a permit holder may choose to also be the supervisor and will not be charged the supervisor fee. $350 \u00d7 30 permits = $10,500 $200 \u00d7 10 supervisor licenses = $2,000 $30 technicians without additional techs = $3,000 $30 \u00d7 50 additional techs beyond 3 = $1,500 Totals: $10,500+$2,000+$3,000+$1,500 = $17,000 E. The impact to other industries, to the ext ent that a crematory could pass on the cost of the additional fees to a mortician using their service, would be unquantifiable at this time. F. The impact on the public, to the extent that a permit holder could pass on the cost of the fees to consumers th rough price increases, is unquantifiable at this time. The public would, however, have the knowledge that the crematory is following specified standards and the staff are professionals with appropriate training. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The pro posed action has minimal or no economic impact on small businesses. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities. Opportunity for Public Comment Comments may be sent to Michele A.

JOSHUA M. SHARFSTEIN, M.D. Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene Subtitle 44 BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS 10.44.23 Unprofessional Conduct Authority : Health Occupations Article, \u00a7\u00a71-212, 4-315(a)(16), 4 -315(b)(3), and 4 -505(a)(2) , Annotated Code of Maryland Notice of Proposed Action [12-087-P] The Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene proposes to repeal existing Regulations .01 \u2014 .03 and adopt new R egulations .01 and .02 under COMAR 10.44.23 Unprofessional Conduct . This action was considered by the Board of Dental Examiners at public meetings held on November 28, 2011, and February 1, 2012, notice of which was given under the Notice of Public Meeting s link on the Board's website pursuant to State Government Article, \u00a710 -506(c), Annotated Code of Maryland. Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to delineate certain conduct that constitutes unprofessional conduct for dentists, dental hygieni sts, and dental radiation technologists. This is not a limitation of other conduct which may constitute unprofessional conduct. This proposal repeals existing COMAR 10.44.23.02, which requires that a dentist obtain specific informed consent from a patient before removing sound or serviceable mercury amalgam restorations. By repealing the regulation, the Board of Dental Examiners does not mean to imply that the removal of sound or serviceable mercury amalgam restorations may be performed without first obtai ning informed consent. Because a dentist is required to obtain informed consent for all dental procedures, it is not necessary to make distinctions and enumerate specific procedures that require informed consent. In fact, to do so may lead patients to infe r that procedures not enumerated do not require informed consent. New COMAR 10.44.23.01A(6) provides more generally that it is unprofessional conduct for a dentist to Perform[ing] a dental procedure without first obtaining informed consent from the patien t or the patient's legal representative. Informed consent only exists when a patient has gained full knowledge about what treatment will be performed, including available alternatives, risks or dangers inherent in or collateral to the treatment, possible complications, and possible consequences of not undergoing the procedures. The concept of informed consent is to enable the patient to make an intelligent and informed choice about whether or not to undergo such treatment. The information provided to a pa tient should be truthful, unbiased, and based upon sound scientific evidence. The Board wishes to make clear that it does not advocate mercury free dentistry or the removal of sound or serviceable mercury amalgam restorations for replacement of nonmercur y containing materials. The Board supports the present position of the federal Food and Drug Administration that there is no causal link between dental amalgam and adverse health effects, as contained in its publication Dental Devices: Classification of D ental Amalgam, Reclassification of Dental Mercury, Designation of Special Controls for Dental Amalgam, Mercury, and Amalgam Alloy, 74 Fed. Reg. 38686, 38686 -386714 (August 4, 2009). There is no credible scientific evidence to indicate that dental amalgam is harmful. See id. The Board wishes to stress that dental amalgam has proven to be a safe and cost effective way to correct dental decay. It is a material that due to its many advantages can be used in multiple situations that are not suitable to other re storative materials. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action.

PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 449 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012 Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to describe the requirements and procedures for an investor to receive a certificate allowing it to claim a credit against the State income tax for an investment in a qualified Maryland biotechnology company and to describe the requirements and procedures for a biotechnology company to receive a certificate that it is a qualified Maryland biotechnology company. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no correspon ding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. The direct economic impact of the proposal is that, if fully subscribed, there would be a $16,000,000 increase in equity investments in qualified Mary land biotechnology companies. Investors would receive a tax credit of $8,000,000 to be applied against the investors' corporate or individual income tax liabilities. State of Maryland General Fund revenues and transportation trust fund (TTF) revenues would be affected. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: NONE B. On other State agencies: (R-) $8,000,000 C. On local governments: (R-) Undeterminable Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: NONE E. On other industries or trade groups: (+) Potential $16,000,000 increase in equity of QMBCs F. Direct and indirect effects on public: (-) Undeterminable III. Assumptions. (Identified b y Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) B. The Act (Ch. 99, Acts of 2005, as amended by Ch. 518, Acts of 2008, by Chs. 605, 606, Acts of 2009, and by Ch. 349, Acts of 2011) creating the program requires the Comptroller to transfer money from the rese rve fund to the General Fund in an amount that is anticipated to offset credits that would be claimed in any fiscal year. Twenty - four percent of corporate income tax revenue is distributed to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF). All the money transferred from the reserve fund by the Comptroller in anticipation of credits being claimed is to be deposited in the General Fund and losses to the TTF would not be offset. As a result, General Fund revenues would increase and TTF revenues would decrease by a corre sponding amount. The amount depends on the amount of credits claimed against the corporate income tax and cannot be readily estimated. It is also assumed that taxpayers will claim the credit in the tax year that corresponds to the fiscal year in which the Comptroller transfers funds to the General Fund on notification of a certified credit. To the extent that taxpayers claim the credit in a tax year or adjust estimated quarterly payments or withholdings in a fiscal year different from the fiscal year in whi ch the transfer is made, General Fund revenues could increase in the fiscal year of the transfer and potentially decrease by a corresponding amount in later fiscal years. This timing issue, however, does not alter the total cost of the program. C. Local g overnment revenues would decrease as a result of tax credit claims against the corporate income tax. Corporate income tax is distributed 76 percent to the General Fund and 24 percent to the TTF. Of the 24 percent transferred to the TTF, approximately 30 percent is distributed to local jurisdictions in the form of local highway user revenues. Individual income tax revenue is distributed 100 percent to the General Fund. There is no effect on expenditures. E. There is a potential for a significant impact on e arly stage biotechnology companies with headquarters and operational facilities located in Maryland arising from the investment incentives created by the program for investors to invest in qualified Maryland biotechnology companies. F. There is a potentia l for significant State General Fund expenditures. The amount of the expenditure in an fiscal year depends on the amount of money appropriated to the reserve fund in each year. There is a potential significant increase in General Fund revenues when the Com ptroller transfers funds from the reserve fund to the General Fund and a corresponding decrease in TTF revenues due to reserve fund transfers for credits claimed against the corporate income tax. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic impact follows. The program provides an incentive to investors to invest in small early stage and young mezzanine stage biotechnology enterprises with not more than 50 employees and which are not publicly owned. Small businesses that meet the requirements for QMBC status under this chapter and whose investors qualify for tax credits will benefit from these regulations. There are about 500 bioscience companies in Maryland. To the e xtent that this tax credit program attracts additional investments in the biotechnology industry, qualifying biotechnology companies that are small businesses could benefit. Many of Maryland's biotechnology companies would not be considered to be small bus inesses. Small businesses in other industry sectors could be at a competitive disadvantage in the capital markets to the extent that the tax credit program causes investors to shift investment capital to the biotechnology industry. Impact on Individuals wi th Disabilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

B. The Department shall apply a facts and circumsta nces analysis on a case by case basis to determine whether a company meets the criteria of this chapter. PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 457 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012 C. Biotechnology. (1) Definition. (a) Biotechnology means innovative and proprietary technology that comprises, interacts with, or analyzes biol ogical material including biomolecules (DNA, RNA, or protein), cells, tissues, or organs and includes the application of scientific and technical advances to develop commercial products. (b) Biotechnology includes the following: (i) DNA/RNA: Genomics, pharmacogenomics, gene probes, genetic engineering, DNA/RNA sequencing/synthesis/amplification, gene expression profiling, and use of antisense technology; (ii) Proteins and other biomolecules including sugars, lipids, vitamins and metabolics; sequencing , synthesis, or engineering of molecules; improved delivery methods for drugs; isolation; purification, and identification of cell receptors; (iii) Cell and tissue culture and engineering: Cell/tissue culture, tissue engineering (including tissue scaffold s and biomedical engineering), cellular fusion, vaccine/immune stimulants, embryo manipulation; (iv) RNA vectors: gene therapy, viral vectors; (vi) Bioinformatics: construction of databases on genomes, protein sequences; modeling complex biological processes, including systems biology and mechanism of actions of drugs; and (vii) Nanobiotechnology: Applies the tools and processes of nano/microfabrication to build devices for studying biosystems and applications in drug delivery, diagnostics, and other applications. (2) Single Definition. (a) Section C(1)(a) of this regulation is referred to in this chapter as the single definition. The single definition is deliberately broad, general, and provisional. The single definition applies to the word biotechnology as used in the term biotechnology compa ny stated in Tax -General Article, \u00a710 - 725(a)(2), Annotated Code of Maryland. (b) The single definition connotes the manipulation of living organisms or their components to produce useful commercial products and the innovative and proprietary technologie s of biological science used in this manipulation. (3) List -Based Definition. The list -based definition is based on the list of biotechnology techniques in \u00a7C(1)(b) of this regulation and will function for the Department as an interpretative guideline to the single definition. The list is indicative rather than exhaustive and is expected to change over time as biotechnology techniques evolve. (4) The single definition covers all modern biotechnology but also many traditional or borderline activities. In application by the Department under this chapter, the single definition will always be accompanied by the list -based definition stated in \u00a7C(1)(b) of this regulation when the Department applies the single definition to particular facts and circumstances fo r the purposes of this chapter. The single definition and the list definition will be applied in conjunction under this chapter to take account of and to consider biotechnology techniques that fit the single definition but may not fit the list -based defini tion, with a view to constantly updating the list - based definition. D. Criteria for a Biotechnology Company. (1) A biotechnology company is a company primarily dedicated to turning the biological sciences into a commercial product and to commercialize th e results. The Department shall apply the single definition and the list definition to determine whether a company's activities or products constitute biotechnology for the purposes of the Act and this chapter. (2) The scientific biotechnological basis of the company's activities and plans is defining, but not conclusive. (3) The company shall demonstrate that the investment it will attract by reason of the tax credit available under the Act and this chapter will be likely to: (a) Materially advance and support the business viability of the company; and (b) Result in the production of a biotechnology product that will contribute to economic development and employment growth in the State. (4) Stage of Development. The company shall: (a) Have begun activ e activities and operations and fairly be characterized as actively engaged in a biotechnology business; (b) Be fully legally organized under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was organized; (c) Have competent management; (d) Own or have immediat ely available and useable rights in biotechnology -related intellectual property; and (e) Be actively engaged in research, development, or production of a commercially oriented, innovative, and patent protectable biotechnology product. (5) Eligibility: A ctive Business. (a) Except as provided in \u00a7C(5)(b) of this regulation, a company is eligible for certification as a qualified Maryland biotechnology company if it has been in active business not longer than 10 years. (b) A company that has been in activ e business for up to 12 years may be eligible for certification as a QMBC if the Department determines that the company requires additional time to complete the process of regulatory approval of a biotechnology product. (c) Active business means that th e Department can reasonably determine and establish the nature of the Company's commercial biotechnology research, development or production operations. The mere legal organization, appointment or election of officers or managers, initial capitalization, a nd establishment of business offices of a company, alone or in combination, are not sufficient to establish that the company is engaged in active business for the purposes of this chapter and the Act. (d) The Department shall apply a facts and circumstanc es analysis on a case by case basis to determine whether a company has been engaged in active business and for what period of time. (6) Commercialization of an Identifiable Biotechnology Product. (a) The company shall have a developed, focused plan for: (i) Research and development of an identifiable biotechnology product; and (ii) The company's growth. (b) A biotechnology product will generally be: (i) Used for human health, as in a therapeutic or diagnostic setting (for example, to treat, detect, or prevent diseases or to improve treatment outcomes); (ii) Used on domesticated or farm animals, as in a therapeutic or diagnostic setting (for example, to improve animal health); or plants (for example to increase agricultural production); or (iii) An appli cation originally derived from use of a living organism, as in production of alternative energy (e.g., biofuels) or engineering or chemistry derived from nature to improve properties of products (for example, re -engineering of attachment molecules used by mollusks for the next SuperGlue\u00ae). (c) In general, companies will not be certified that provide a service (e.g., analytical services or consulting services, etc.) or develop software, or develop or manufacture products or technology that do not involve us e or application of biotechnology. PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 458 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012 (d) A device may constitute eligible biotechnology if: (i) It delivers a direct therapeutic effect through biological interaction; or (ii) It performs a diagnosis through analyzing biological material. (7) Innovative Bi otechnology Projects and Products. The company shall provide evidence with its application that its existing or proposed biotechnology product is innovative and has the potential for commercial sale. The company must generally own the intellectual property or have exclusive rights to the use of the intellectual property. (8) Maryland Location. (a) The company shall demonstrate that its headquarters and the base of its biotechnology operations are entirely located in the State. (b) The company shall p rovide with its application evidence that it will maintain its headquarters, the base of its biotechnology operations, and the sites, buildings, and facilities in which its headquarters and biotechnology operations are or will be conducted, in the State fo r a period of not less than 48 months after the date on which its application for certification as a qualified Maryland biotechnology company is submitted to the Department. .15 Ownership Attribution.

PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 461 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012 B. In order to determine the Critical Area classification for an area newly included in the Critical Area on the working draft map, the Commission and a local jurisdiction shall use the mapping standards in COMAR 27.01.02.03 \u2014.05. C. Except as required under \u00a7D of this regulation, a local jurisdiction shall classify an area newly included in the Critical Area in accordance with at least one of the following factors: (1) Current land use based on present conditions; (2) Adjacent land use based on present conditions; (3) Future land use based on an approved, platted subdivision even if the lots newl y included in the Critical Area are nonconforming under local Critical Area requirements in effect at the time of delivery of the summary draft map to the local jurisdiction; or (4) Proposed land use based on future conditions if the local jurisdiction: (a) Accepted for processing an application for a subdivision, final site plan, or other final approval at least 90 days before the date of delivery of the summary draft map to the local jurisdiction; and (b) Issues a written final approval for the applicatio n within 2 years of the date of delivery of the summary draft map to the local jurisdiction. D. A local jurisdiction shall classify a dredged material containment facility as a resource conservation area if the facility is: (1) Surrounded by open water; an d (2) A State -sponsored island restoration project with conservation and habitat protection as essential elements of its operation. E. A local jurisdiction may not use a dredged material containment facility that meets the requirements of \u00a7D of this regula tion to generate growth allocation. F. At the time of a development application, a local jurisdiction shall classify an unclassified wetland as a resource conservation area if it is determined to be an upland area or a private wetland. G. A local jurisdict ion shall provide to the Commission a list of all parcels and lots that meet the requirements under \u00a7C(3) and (4) of this regulation, including the tax map and parcel number of each lot and parcel, as documentation that growth allocation will not be necess ary. H. As part of the mapping process, a local jurisdiction shall provide to the Commission documentation for those instances where the Critical Area boundary was moved and the resulting Critical Area classification is different from the adjacent Critical Area classification. I. A local jurisdiction may propose alternative criteria for development to address an instance in which an area newly included in the Critical Area, as a result of changes in the Critical Area boundary during a map update, would be r endered nonconforming or unbuildable without a variance. J. Federal lands not given a Critical Area classification are managed in accordance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71451 \u20141464. .06 Process for Approval of an Updated Critical Area M ap. A. Upon completion of a local jurisdiction's review of a working draft map, including its proposed critical area classifications for all areas newly included in the Critical Area, the Department and the Commission shall incorporate all necessary revisi ons and prepare a summary draft map for the local jurisdiction. B. The Department and the Commission shall deliver to the local jurisdiction a summary draft map of that jurisdiction's Critical Area that: (1) Identifies the shoreline and landward boundary o f tidal wetlands by use of the most recent aerial imagery or the best available aerial imagery of comparable scale; and (2) Ensures that the 1,000 -foot Critical Area boundary is accurate to a scale of 1 inch equals 100 feet. C. Except as authorized under \u00a7 D of this regulation, within 24 months of the date of delivery of the summary draft map under \u00a7A of this regulation, a local jurisdiction shall complete the process of local approval. D. The initial map update of a local jurisdiction's Critical Area map ma y occur in coordination with the local jurisdiction's 6 -year comprehensive review process, as required under Natural Resources Article, \u00a78 -1809(g), Annotated Code of Maryland, if the local jurisdiction provides evidence satisfactory to the Commission that reasonable progress has been made toward approval of its summary draft map. E. Upon receipt of a summary draft map under \u00a7B of this regulation, a local jurisdiction shall: (1) Provide public notice of its review of the final draft for approval; (2) Hold at least one public hearing; (3) Provide a reasonable public comment period; and (4) Review and approve the summary draft map in accordance with local procedures for map amendments. F. Upon the completion of all public hearings and the comment period, the lo cal jurisdiction shall amend its local Critical Area program by approving all elements of the summary draft map, including; (1) The shoreline and landward boundary of tidal wetlands; (2) The digitally generated and georeferenced Critical Area 1,000 -foot bo undary line which may be adjusted in accordance with Regulation .04 F of this chapter; and (3) In accordance with Regulation .05 of this chapter, Critical Area classifications of all areas newly included in the Critical Area. G. Upon completion of the appr oval process under this regulation, the local jurisdiction shall forward its locally approved map to the Commission for final approval. H. In accordance with Natural Resources Article, \u00a7\u00a7 8 -1807 and 8-1809, Annotated Code of Maryland, when the Commission approves the locally approved map: (1) It becomes the final approved map; and (2) The final approved map shall be the officially designated map of the Critical Area for that local jurisdiction. I. The local jurisdiction shall adopt the final approved map by incorporating it into its Critical Area program in accordance with its process for adoption of local law. .07 Periodic Review of a Local Critical Area Map. A. Beginning with the date on which the Department and the Commission delivered a summary draft map to a local jurisdiction under Regulation .06B of this chapter, at least once every 12 years thereafter: (1) The Department, the Commission, and the local jurisdiction shall conduct a review of the local Critical Area map; and (2) The local jurisdiction sh all submit any proposed map updates to the Commission for approval. B. The Commission shall determine the appropriate process for consideration and approval of the local jurisdiction's proposed map updates. C. An update of a local jurisdiction's Critical A rea map that is after the initial map update may occur in coordination with the local jurisdiction's 6 -year comprehensive review process, as required under Natural Resources Article, \u00a78 -1809(g), Annotated Code of Maryland, if the local jurisdiction provide s evidence satisfactory to the Commission that reasonable progress has been made on its comprehensive review and on the review of its maps.

A. In the preparation of local programs, local jurisdictions shall make provision for the granting of variances to these criteria where, owing to special features of a site or other circumstances, local government implementation of this subtitle or a liter al enforcement of provisions within the jurisdiction's Critical Area program would result in unwarranted hardship to an applicant. These variance provisions shall be designed in a manner consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter and all local C ritical Area program elements. The variance provisions shall, at a minimum, provide for the following: (1) That findings are made by the local jurisdiction which demonstrate that special conditions or circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or s tructure within the jurisdiction's Critical Area program, would result in unwarranted hardship; (2) That a literal interpretation of this subtitle or the local Critical Area program and related ordinances will deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjo yed by other properties in similar areas within the Critical Area of the local jurisdiction; (3) That the granting of a variance will not confer upon an applicant any special privilege that would be denied by this subtitle or the local Critical Area progr am to other lands or structures within the jurisdiction's Critical Area; (4) That the variance request is not based upon conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions by the applicant, nor does the request arise from any condition conforming , on any neighboring property; (5) That the granting of a variance will not adversely affect water quality or adversely impact fish, wildlife, or plant habitat within the jurisdiction's Critical Area, and that the granting of the variance will be in harmo ny with the general spirit and intent of the Critical Area law and the regulations adopted in this subtitle; and (6) That applications for a variance will be made in writing to the local approving authority with a copy provided to the Commission. B. Loca l jurisdictions may establish additional, more restrictive standards for the granting of variances consistent with the intent and purposes of this subtitle and the approved local Critical Area program, and further, shall establish notification procedures t o permit Commission review of findings made in the granting of variances. C. Appeals from decisions concerning the granting or denial of a variance under these regulations shall be taken in accordance with all applicable laws and procedures of each local jurisdiction for variances. Variance decisions by local boards of appeal or the local legislative body may be appealed to the circuit court in accordance with the Maryland Rules of Procedure. Appeals may be taken by any person, firm, corporation, or govern mental agency, aggrieved or adversely affected by any decision made under this section, and the Chairman may appeal an action or decision even if the Chairman was not a party to or is not specifically aggrieved by the action or decision.

SUMMARY : This document contains final rules that would amend the project review regulations of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (Commission) to include definitions for new terms and an amended definition; provide for administrative approval of interbasin transfers of flowback and production fluids between drilling pad sites that are isolated from the waters of the basin; provide for administrative approval of out -of-basin transfers of flowback or produced fluids from a Commission approved hydrocarbon development project to an out -of-basin treatment or disposal faci lity; insert language authorizing renewal of expiring approvals, including Approvals by Rule (ABRs); delete specific references to geologic formations that may be the subject of natural gas development using hydrofracture stimulation and replace with a generic category --``unconventional natural gas development;'' broaden the scope of ABRs issued to include hydrocarbon development of any kind utilizing the waters of the basin, not just unconventional natural gas well development; memorialize the current prac tice of requiring post -hydrofracture reporting; and provide further procedures for the approval of water sources utilized at projects subject to the ABR process. DATES : Effective April 1, 2012. ADDRESSES : Susquehanna River Basin Commission, 1721 North Front Street, Harrisburg, PA 17102 -2391. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Richard A. Cairo, on the proposed rulemaking, visit the C ommission's Web site at www.srbc.net . SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Comments and Responses to Proposed Rulemaking Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on July 13, 2011; the New York Register on July 27, 2011; the Pennsylvania Bulletin on July 23, 2011; and the Maryland Register on July 29, 2011. The Commission convened public hearings on August 2, 2011, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and on August 4, 2011, in Binghamton, New York. Public information meetings were also held on Oct ober 25, 2011 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and on October 27, 2011, in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. The original 60 -day comment period first established on June 23, 2011, was extended until November 10, 2011, pursuant to an action taken by the Commission on September 15, 2011. Comments on the proposed rulemaking were received at both the hearings and during the comment period. The comments can be divided into two categories: (1) General Comments --These comments are not directed to specific language of the pro posed rulemaking, but rather address perceived environmental and policy impacts; and (2) Comments by Section --These comments are directed at the specific language of the proposed rulemaking, often offering further revisions to this language. A summary of b oth categories of comments and the Commission's responses thereto follows. SPECIAL DOCUMENTS 466 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23 , 2012 General Comments Comment : The Commission should more clearly explain the scientific basis for the proposed rulemaking. Also, the Commission should conduct a full life cycle cumula tive impact study of the basinwide impacts of unconventional natural gas extraction prior to issuing this rulemaking. Response : The proposed rulemaking is administrative in nature and involves no substantive change in the review standards applied to projec ts. Therefore, the basis of the rulemaking does not involve the analysis, evaluation or re -evaluation of scientific principals. On the whole, it is an attempt to codify within the rules certain definitions, existing practices and policies, and to establis h certain procedures related to implementation of the Commission's regulatory authority. Comment : The more extensive use of the Approval by Rule (ABR) process in this proposed rulemaking will weaken the Commission's regulatory oversight and will simply ma ke it easier for gas well developers using hydrofracture stimulation methods to withdraw the waters of the basin. Response : The Commission believes that this comment indicates a basic misunderstanding of the scope of the ABR process and the fact that all w ithdrawal projects will continue to be docketed and acted on by the full Commission. Through the docketing process, the Commission actively manages the use of the basin's waters and mitigates impacts on surface and ground waters through appropriate conditi ons limiting use. The ABR process then provides an efficient monitoring system for waters that are consumptively used. The Commission applies the same approval standards to all approvals, no matter the form they take. It exercises continuing jurisdiction a nd oversight to ensure compliance, and can reopen approvals and issue new orders or conditions if warranted. Comment : Use of the ABR process to oversee the interbasin transfer of flowback and produced fluids and for the out of basin diversion of such flui ds for treatment poses a danger to the waters of the basin due to its toxic content and the potential for spillage. The ABR process also bypasses the usual analysis given to proposed diversions of water. Response : The proposed rules simply formalize practi ces that are already in place for the transfer of such fluids. These procedures will provide a net benefit to the basin by encouraging the use and reuse of lesser quality water instead of unimpaired water from streams or ground water sources. Furthermore, unlike the typical diversion of water out of the basin where the consumptive loss occurs and is evaluated in the context of the proposed diversion activity, the consumptive loss in this situation is considered to have occurred at the time of the initial wi thdrawal from the system, before its first use within the basin and prior to being diverted out of the basin. For into - basin diversions, the existing standards are focused on limiting any introduction of contaminated sources into the waters of the basin. T he final rulemaking, as structured, provides that same standard. What it changes is the form of the approval, not the standard that should be applied. Comment : The Commission places too much reliance on allegedly inadequate state water quality laws relati ng to wastewater disposal and residual waste. For example, the Commission cannot rely on such state laws and regulations to isolate from the waters of the basin the flowback and production fluids whose interbasin transfer the Commission proposes to approve administratively. Therefore, it is incumbent on the Commission to invoke its own water quality regulatory authority and ensure that wastewater is indeed handled in a manner that isolates it from the waters of the basin. Response : The Susquehanna River Bas in Compact, Public Law 91 - 575, Section 5.2(b) gives specific emphasis to the primary role of the states in water quality management and control. Member states are already exercising or preparing to exercise their water quality authority with respect to gas drilling activity and are also strengthening their laws and regulations. At this stage, there appears to be no justification for the Commission to assume water quality jurisdiction. As noted in response to a comment below, the Commission is taking steps t o replace the term ``isolate from the waters of the basin'' with language that references the standards and requirements of member jurisdictions. Comment : The Commission's refusal to promulgate water quality regulations relating to gas well development wi ll allow the non - uniform treatment of water users throughout the basin and therefore not conform to the purposes of the Susquehanna River Basin Compact. Response : The compact purpose of ``uniform treatment of water users'' does not require that the Commiss ion exclusively regulate all aspects of water resources in the basin. If state regulations and standards are compatible with the Commission's Comprehensive Plan and do an adequate job of fulfilling the purposes of the plan, the Commission will not attempt to duplicate those regulations and standards. Where it does act, it does so in a manner that provides for uniform treatment of all water users. Comment : The expanded use of the ABR process lessens the opportunity for public input and scrutiny on project a pprovals. Response : The Commission disagrees. The ABR applications must be noticed by applicants and there is an opportunity for interested citizens to comment on these applications before an approval is issued. ABRs are also subject to the same approval s tandards as docketed approvals, and may be reopened and modified by the Executive Director should unforeseen problems arise. Furthermore, notice of issuance of an ABR is published in the Federal Register and any such approval is subject to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 808.2. Comment : The Commission should not be extending the scope of the ABR program to include other forms of hydrocarbon development without first determining if the ABR program is suitable for these other forms of development. Response : The ABR pro cess has proven to be a valuable tool for monitoring consumptive use related activity on pad sites. This rulemaking, which as noted above is administrative in nature, would extend the use of this valuable tracking tool to other forms of hydrocarbon develop ment. Water withdrawals by any water user, including that undertaken for use in other forms of hydrocarbon development, will still undergo the full docket approval process, and be subject to all applicable Commission standards and requirements. Comment : The Commission is a federal agency under the Susquehanna River Basin Compact and is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It must therefore complete all NEPA requirements in connection with this proposed rulemaking action. Response : The C ommission categorically rejects any suggestion that it is subject to NEPA. This is consistent with the position the Commission has taken on NEPA since the 1980s. Instead of a federal agency, the Commission is a federal -interstate compact agency representin g all four of its member jurisdictions. The federal government is only one voting member of the Commission and any action of the Commission requires the vote of a majority of the members. Therefore, the actions of the Commission are not the actions of the federal government, but the joint actions of the member jurisdictions. Also, Congress has specifically exempted the SPECIAL DOCUMENTS 467 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012 Commission from the provisions of the federal Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Federal court decisions have taken a consistent view, nam ely that agencies not subject to the APA are not federal agencies in the conventional sense and are therefore not subject to NEPA or similar laws imposing requirements on ``federal agencies.'' Comments by Section, Part 806 Section 806.3 --Definitions Com ment : The 30 -day rule in the proposed definition of flowback means that fluid produced from the well bore from the 31st day until the well is placed in production is neither flowback or production fluid within the definition (unless the well is placed into production during the initial 30 -day period). Response : Agreed. The proposed definition is modified to remove the 30-day reference and to make clear that return flow recovered post - hydrofracture and pre -production is defined as flowback. Comment : The wor d siting in the definitions of hydrocarbon development and unconventional natural gas development is inconsistent with the initiation of construction standard in the Commission's project review regulations. The regulations specify the spudding of the well to be the initiation of a well project. Response : Agreed. The word siting is deleted from this definition to avoid the inconsistency. Comment : The definition of project does not make clear that unconventional natural gas development is a s ubset of hydrocarbon development activity. Response : Language is inserted in the definition to clarify that the term is a sub -category of hydrocarbon development. Comment : Several comments expressed disagreement with the proposed definition of tophole water, with one suggesting use of Pennsylvania's definition instead and another claiming that the definition is too vague. Response : The tophole water definition is replaced with a modified version of the Pennsylvania definition. The modification, notably removing the reference to surface water, makes it generally consistent with New York's interpretation of the term and allows for more basinwide consistency. Section 806.4 --Projects Requiring Review and Approval Paragraphs 806.4(a)(3)(v) & (vi) Comment : The phrase in such manner as to isolate it from the waters of the basin is too vague and should be replaced with a reference to the actual controls exercised by the member states. Also, because the industry may mix the waters of the basin withdrawn from surface and ground water sources with flowback or production fluids in preparation for hydrofracture use, it is not possible to isolate it from the waters of the basin if read strictly. Response : The isolate terminology is replaced with provided it is handled, transported and stored in compliance with all standards and requirements of the applicable member jurisdictions. The same language has also been inserted in Paragraph 806.4(a)(3)(vi), which similarly addresses diversions of flowback or production fluids, and is substituted in Paragraph 806.22(f)(11)(iii) for the same reason. Comment : There is no clear requirement that project sponsors keep track of interbasin transfers of flowback and production fluids. Response : Language is added to paragraphs 80 6.4(a)(3)(v) and (vi) reinforcing the requirement that all monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to the pad site ABR must be met. Similar language is added to paragraph 806.22(f)(11) to meet the same concerns about tracking. Paragraph 806.4(3)( vi) Comment : The use of the phrase the same implies that each tank load of flowback or production fluid would require separate approval. Response : The language is replaced with flowback or production fluids to remove any uncertainty. Section 806.13 --Submission of Application Comment : The phrase Project sponsors of projects subject to review and approval should properly be changed to read Sponsors of projects subject to review and approval. Response : Agreed. The suggested change is incorporated in to the final rulemaking. Section 806.14 --Contents of Application Paragraph 806.14(a) Comment : With respect to renewal applications, there is no clear indication that they will be made subject to any approval standards. Response : To remove any ambiguity, and to further clarify the original intent concerning renewal standards, the phrase shall be subject to the standards set forth in Subpart C --Standards for Review and Approval of this Part is added to this paragraph. Section 806.15 --Notice of Applicatio n Paragraph 806.15(e) Comment : The requirement for a newspaper notice in areas where a wastewater discharge source is to be used is unworkable where such water is mixed with other water sources at the initial destination and is then redistributed, oftenti mes to other locations not contemplated at the time notice is given. Response : The word ``initially'' is added before the phrase ``used for natural gas development'' to limit this requirement to the initial location(s) where this water is contemplated for use at the time of application. Section 806.22 --Standards for Consumptive Use of Water Paragraph 806.22(f)(10) Comment : Extension of ABR approval terms to 15 years will essentially lessen or weaken the oversight that the Commission exercises over gas dri lling activities. Response : Though the Commission feels that there is a fundamental misunderstanding by some who commented about the ongoing oversight that it exercises over approved projects, and the ability of the Commission to reopen approvals, it is wi lling to retain the current approval term with the addition of procedures for renewal of ABRs. Therefore, the proposed change is removed from the final rulemaking. Paragraph 806.22(f)(11) Comment : Need to make clear that this paragraph applies to the use of sources in addition to those sources approved for use by the project sponsor pursuant to \u00a7 806.4. Response : Wording is added to the beginning of this paragraph to make the suggested clarification. SPECIAL DOCUMENTS 468 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23 , 2012 Paragraph 806.22(f)(11)(i), (ii), and (iv) Comment : Tophole water, precipitation and storm water collected on the pad site or water obtained from a hydrocarbon storage facility can be contaminated, so there is a need to appropriately limit its use. Response : Language is added limiting the use of this water to drilling or hydrofracture stimulation only, or in the case of paragraph 806.22(f)(11)(iv), limiting the use to that provided for in the approval. Paragraph 806.22(f)(11)(iii) Comment : As defined, flowback and production fluids do not cover all fluids encountered in the drilling process that serve as a water source under current practice. For example, water can be recovered from drilling muds. Also, such fluids can be recovered from production well sites, in addition to drilling pad sites or hydrocarbon water storage facilities. Current Commission policy allows for the reuse of such fluids. Response : Drilling fluids and formation fluids are added to this paragraph to cover all fluids recovered during the drilling process and used under current practice f or hydrofracture stimulation. The term ``production well site'' is also added to clarify the sites from which such fluids can be recovered. The word ``only'' is also added to this paragraph to make clear that these fluids may only be used for hydrofracture stimulation. Language is also added clarifying that all such fluids must be handled, transported and stored in compliance with all standards and requirements of the applicable member jurisdiction. Paragraph 806.22(f)(14) Comment : The provisions of the p roposed paragraph 806.22(f)(13) pertaining to hydrocarbon water storage facilities need to be separated from provisions relating to public water supply and wastewater sources because of the possible application of the terms to third party water purveyors b uilding hydrocarbon water storage facilities that may not be associated with ABRs. Response : The changes incorporated into the final rule break out a separate paragraph 806.22(f)(14), clarifying the scope and intent, but make no substantive changes to the provisions contained in the proposed rulemaking. The rule is intended to provide for the approval of such facilities (not otherwise associated with an ABR) to provide a mechanism for monitoring, reporting and tracking associated with such facilities, and t o allow for the industry to efficiently register such sources for use. Paragraph 806.22(f)(15) Comment : The language in paragraphs 806.22(f)(12)(i) and (ii) relating to providing a copy of any registration or source approval to the appropriate agency of a member state, etc., is repetitive. Response : Language related to registrations and source approvals that is repetitive is removed and restated once in new paragraph 806.22(f)(15).

STEPHANIE L. RICHARDSON Secretary to the Commission WATER MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION Notice of Tentative Determination General Permit for Discharges from Swimming Pools and Spas , Including Baptismal Fonts General Discharge Permit No. 12SI (NPDES No. MDG76) applies to discharges from pools an d spas, including baptismal fonts to waters of the state in the state of Maryland. The Department proposes to reissue State/NPDES (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System) General Permit for Discharges from Pools and Spas, including Baptismal Font s with revisions to the previously issued permit (No. 07SI) as summarized below. The cyanuric acid limit decreased from 200 to 100 mg/L to reflect current industry standards. Backwash discharges are now subject to turbidity limits of 150 NTUs. The total si lver limit decreased from 3.4 to 3.2 ppb to reflect current water quality standards for acute fresh water. Total silver and total copper limits include limits for discharging to both fresh and salt water. The Department proposes to change the requirements for transfer of authorization under this permit from non -transferable to a person' to non -transferable to a change in location'. This ensures the Department is not authorizing a discharge at a new location without appropriate review through submission of a new application. The required notice of intent (application) now requires more complete information relevant to the permit conditions. Also required is the addition of a site map illustrating discharge locations. Finally the permit includes several c larifications on the types of eligible discharges authorized by the permit and updates various standard permit conditions. The updated standard permit conditions include, but are not limited to: requirements to obtain coverage under an individual permit, as necessary; termination of coverage under a permit; continuation of an expired general permit; the definitions for super chlorination, potable water, disinfectant, estimated flow, impaired water, and total maximum daily load (TMDL); notice of intent (app lication) requirements; submission of notifications once SPECIAL DOCUMENTS 471 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 39, ISSUE 6, FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012 registered under the permit; reporting laboratory performing analysis; facility operation and maintenance; and permit modification.
