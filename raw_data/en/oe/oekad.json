Juice cleanses for gut health and skin detoxifications seems to be all the rage. Detox, after all, is defined as the process of ridding the body of toxins. If we can follow an online program or social media account to do a diet or cosmetic detox, can we detox from drugs and alcohol the same way? The short answer: no. Detoxing from addictive substances is not only painful, but the side effects can be dangerous if they're not monitored. Attempting to detox on your own only using natural supplements is never a good idea. You might be wondering then, can I use supplements to help during detox? The short answer: yes! With the right professional help, there's no reason you can't boost your recovery with some detox supplements. There are huge benefits to supporting your health in whatever way you can when your body is recovering from addiction. First things first: detox the right way Before you go for the nutritional supplements you should be able to check a few boxes. It's important to have the right support in place during your recovery so you can get those long-term results. Here's what you need to do before you add nutritional supplements to your treatment regiment. - Get in touch with a mental health professional: Now is a great time to get started with a counselor or therapist if you haven't yet. Struggling with substance use on your own is a lonely journey and it can make a world of difference to have someone on your side to help you process, set goals and celebrate milestones. - Find someone who specializes in detox: Once you have a counselor it will be easy to get set up with other professionals who can help you detox from substances. Whether you participate in an inpatient detox program or consult with a psychiatrist, you'll want some support when those withdrawal symptoms get painful. It's important to note that detox can be dangerous. Depending on the substance and frequency and volume of use, the side effects could even be lethal. Withdrawal symptoms can include anything from nausea, trouble sleeping, dehydration, seizures, hallucinations or even death. It is critical that you don't detox alone. - Read up on the best detox supplements: Do your research to find out what is going to help you get sober and stay sober. - Consult with a professional: Chat about the nutritional supplements you're interested in. Most should be safe, but you'll want to double check that none conflict with other medication you may be taking, chemicals still in your system or any health condition you may have. Once you've completed the to-do list above, you're ready to incorporate supplements into your treatment. Keep in mind that these vitamins and minerals can all be found in food products, but if you're looking for an extra boost you can take them in supplement form through pills, powders or gummies. Here are the best detox supplements for your recovery. Vitamin B Drugs and alcohol decrease the body's ability to absorb B vitamins. B Vitamins convert calories into energy, build blood cells and keep the nervous system working at top notch. You'll want to take B vitamins to get your body back to a normal state, and keep in mind there are many different B vitamins (B-12, B-6, and B-16 to name a few important ones). Thiamin Thiamin is a B vitamin, but it deserves its own category. Thiamin is essential to immune system health, which will help you to detox and recover faster. There have also been [studies](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-2/134-142.htm) on the relationship between thiamine deficiency and alcoholism, because alcohol makes it difficult for the body to absorb this nutrient. Vitamin C A [2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306134/) found that patients withdrawing from alcohol lacked a sufficient amount of vitamin C. Vitamin C is a powerhouse vitamin, building and repairing muscle tissue, supporting immune system functioning and keeping bones strong. Calcium You've likely heard that calcium builds strong bones and teeth, but it also plays another critical role in the body: neuron functioning. Neurons are responsible for sending messages through your body and to your brain and an addiction damages these cells. Your body will need extra calcium to repair the neurons and return them to optimal performance. Daily multivitamins Taking a multivitamin supplement can cover your bases for many different vitamins and minerals. When you're in the midst of detox your body is being depleted of its stores of energy and nutrition quickly as it funnels all of its resources to ridding the body of toxins and managing the effects. A multivitamin can boost your intake of Vitamin C, iron, magnesium, potassium and more. Supplements alone should never replace a comprehensive detox treatment. It could be unsafe to detox without mental health and medical professionals. But once you've checked all the right boxes and have a team behind you, adding nutritional supplements to your detox can help you feel better, inside and out.
