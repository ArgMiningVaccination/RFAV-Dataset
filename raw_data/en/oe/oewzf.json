Pharmacist immuniser requirements In addition to completing an immunisation program recognised by the Chief Health Officer, pharmacist immunisers are required to display their certificate of completing said training, hold current First Aid and CPR certificates, and ensure that another suitably qualified staff member is on site when immunising in pharmacy settings.
