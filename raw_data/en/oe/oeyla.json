The disease is characterised by skin lesions and nerve damage, with involvement of the respiratory tract, eyes, and other organs occurring less commonly. The diagnosis of leprosy is based primarily on the clinical findings of peripheral nerve enlargement, characteristic skin lesions (hypoanaesthetic hypopigmented or reddish patch), and compatible microbiology ( detection of acid -fast bacilli in skin smears or biopsies) or histopathology. The disease is classified broadly into two categories based on the number of skin lesions; paucibacillary leprosy (2- 5 lesions) and multibacillary leprosy (6 or more lesions). A three- drug regimen is used for treatment, with dur ation of therapy determined by disease classification. Case management is an important component of treatment, ensuring optimisation of drug therapy, early detection of lepra reactions and provision of social support. Identification and surveillance of c ontacts plays an important role in the prevention of leprosy, facilitating early diagnosis of secondary cases, and provision of chemoprophylaxis if indicated. The clinical manifestations of leprosy are determined largely by the host immune response to M.leprae, with the spectrum of disease ranging from localised cutaneous disease, to disseminated disease with widespread skin lesions and nerve involvement. While leprosy is not considered to be a highly contagious disease, the dynamics of transmission are not well understood. An individual's susceptibility to disease is thought to be influenced by genetic determinants, with the majority of people unlikely to develop infection if exposed. The incubation period is highly variable and potentially very long, ranging from 2- 30 years. The sequelae of disease including stigma, psychological ramifications and deformity contribute to a significant burden, which affects the patient well beyond the completion of drug therapy. A long- term sustainable approach is therefore required to address the individual and public health consequences of leprosy. In areas of low incidence, such as Australia, waning expertise and awareness of leprosy can lead to a delay in diagnosis. Clinical examination of the patient is of great impor tance for both diagnosis and monitoring of leprosy (reflected in further detail in Chapter 5). Leprosy is frequently complicated by acute immunological reactions, called lepra reactions, which are the main cause of nerve damage and subsequent deformity an d disability. Early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy and associated immunological reactions are required to prevent permanent disability. Leprosy in Western Australia (WA) is managed primarily through a central clinic at the Anita Clayton Centre (Western Australia Tuberculosis Control Program), in collaboration with regional population/ public health units, community health centres , regional Physician teams and district medical officers throughout the state. While guidelines for leprosy control have been published in other Australian States and Territories, a guideline is also needed to address the unique cultural and geographic features of leprosy in WA. The vast land area of WA poses challenges for service delivery, with more than half of the leprosy c ases occurring in remote and very remote parts of the state. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 11 of 144 The guidelines are based on thorough literature review, expert opinion, and the recently published World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Lepr osy 1. The WHO Global Leprosy Strategy 2016- 2020 \"Accelerating towards a leprosy -free world\" 2 and the WHO Operational Manual3 and Monitoring and Evaluation Guide4 have been used to guide recommendations on contact tracing and other operational aspects of management, with the aim of promoting early detection and prompt initiation of treatment to prevent disability and reduce transmission. Recommendations made in these guidel ines have been adapted to the local setting, taking into consideration an assessment of quality of evidence, harm -benefit balance, acceptability (for patients and health care workers), resource provision, feasibility, and effectiveness. The most important changes included in these guidelines are; 1) The recommendation of a three- drug regimen for all leprosy patients, regardless of classification (see Chapter 6). This recommendation is in line with the WHO guidelines, the rationale being to simplify ther apy, overcome problems associated with misclassification of leprosy, and the potential for beneficial anti -inflammatory effects of clofazimine in paucibacillary patients with neuritis. 2) Formal recommendation for the use of single dose rifampicin as che moprophylaxis for contacts (>2 years) of newly diagnosed leprosy patients (see Chapter 10). The guidelines aim to raise awareness of leprosy in WA, and to equip health care workers with the information necessary to suspect, diagnose and manage leprosy. In addition, there is a focus on prevention and operational aspects of leprosy control specific to WA, including provision of a framework for high quality data collection to facilitate quality assessment and optimisation of service delivery. Through ongoing collaboration with involved stakeholders and sustained political commitment, the policy aims to ensure delivery of high- quality clinical care and reduce the burden of disease for all patients with leprosy in WA, with particular focus on ear ly diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment, contact surveillance, prevention of disability , and disease prevention through BCG vaccination and chemoprophylaxis.

License: CC BY -NC-SA 3.0 IGO Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 13 of 144 Chapter 2 Epidemiology 2.1 Global epidemiology Leprosy is an ancient disease that has historically been documented in nearly all parts of the world. Following the introduction of multidrug therapy in the 1980s, there has been a dramatic decline in the global prevalence of leprosy, from over 4 million, to 202, 256 at the end of 2019 1. The global registered prevalence of leprosy at the end of 2020 was 129 192, however this is likely an under representation due to less detection and reporting during the COVID -19 pandemic1. Halving of the recommended treatment duration for multibacillary disease in 1998, in addition to changes in case definitions, has also had a significant impact on reported prevalence. The elimination of leprosy as a public health problem is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population. This target was achieved at a global level in 2000, and in most countries by 2005, however elimination at a subnational level remains an ongoing challenge. The WHO Global Leprosy Strategy 2021 - 2030 has reset the target for leprosy elimination, now defined as no new autochthonous cases as a result of interruption of transmission. 2 Despite these prevalence figures appearing promising, leprosy disease burden is measured more accurately by assessing the new case detection rate, number of new cases detected, and rates of grade 2 disability (G2D) in new cases. Following a fall in new ca se detection between 2002 and 2005, there has been a stabilisation, with a gradual decline of approximately 2% per year, with a small increase from 2015 to 2016. In 2019, 202 256 new cases of leprosy were detected, with 79% of cases in Indonesia, Brazil and India. Data from 2020 noted that multibacillary disease accounted for 67.3% of new cases, and 6.8% of all new cases occurred in children, indicating ongoing transmission. Whilst a number of regions have noted a reduction in the number of new cases wit h G2D at the time of diagnosis, there were still 13, 043 new cases with G2D at the time of diagnosis globally in 2020. Of note, 91.4% of new cases in global priority countries had G2D, indicating delay in diagnosis. Until recently, the WHO has classified countries by utilising the absolute number of new cases as a measure of disease burden. In order to provide a more accurate measure of leprosy burden at a national and subnational level, the most recent Global Leprosy Strategy includes the following indic ators to calculate a composite score to guide classification: prevalence, case detection, case detection rate, percentage of children among newly diagnosed cases (marker of ongoing transmission), percentage of G2D among newly diagnosed cases (marker of del ayed case finding and therefore ongoing transmission), and G2D rate per million cases. Based on this scoring system, 22 high burden countries have been identified, allowing prioritisation for resource allocation and control activities.

In 2016 there were 21 new notifications of leprosy, which is the highest number of notifications since 1991. The disease affects two vulnerable populations, migrants from leprosy endemic countries, and Aboriginal people. The maj ority of leprosy cases have been acquired overseas, with only a small proportion of cases acquired in Australia, exclusively in the Aboriginal population. Since 1925, Western Australia (WA) has reported the highest number of leprosy cases, followed by the Northern Territory and Queensland. Between 2017 and August 2022 a total of 47 cases of leprosy have been notified to the NNDSS in Australia, with the majority of cases occurring in Western Australia, NSW and Queensland (Figure 2). It is important to note that case detection is highly dependent on a number of operational factors including robustness of contact tracing, active case finding and clinical expertise. The reported notifications in Australia are likely to be an underestimate of true prevalence due to limited allocated resources and health service factors related to the COVID -19 pandemic.

The Kimberley Aboriginal population has a l eprosy notification rate significantly higher than WA overall, highlighting the need for careful data collection, analysis, reporting and allocation of resources. The issue of addressing hotspots of leprosy at a subnational level in the push for elimination is addressed in the most recent Global Leprosy Strategy and o perational Manual. Leprosy is thought to have been introduced to WA, with the first recorded case in a Chinese migrant in Roebourne in 1889, and the first Aboriginal case occurring shortly aft er near Broome in 1893. There is no evidence that Aboriginal Australians were affected by mycobacterial disease prior to settlement, however leprosy infection spread rapidly throughout the Kimberley, with approximately 10% of the population affected by the 1950s. A leprosarium was established near Derby in 1935, with approximately 1200 Aboriginal patients being treated there before its closure in 1986. Since 1988, there have been 85 cases of leprosy notified in WA, with 44% of cases being Aboriginal and the majority of these residing in remote or very remote parts of the state. Of cases acquired overseas, 48% were from the South East Asian WHO region, and 43% from the Western Pacific region. The male to female ratio was 1.3:1, with an age range of 11- 77. Multibacillary disease accounted for 62% of cases and there is clear evidence of ongoing transmission of leprosy in WA , with secondary cases occurring in contacts. Figure 3 shows leprosy notifications in WA between 1988 and 2022 by place of acquisition. Of cases acquired in Australia during this period all except one were in Aboriginal Australians. While there has been a trend toward a predominance of overseas acquisition, an increase in notifications in cases acquired in Australia occurred between 2013 and 2017 due to enhanced surveillance activity in the Kimberley region of WA. Figure 3: Notifications of leprosy, Western Australia, 1988- 2022 by place of acquisition Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 17 of 144 Leprosy enhanced surveillance commenced at the WA TB Control Program in 2013. Since this time 32 cases of leprosy have been notified, of which 35% had G2D at the time of diagnosis, 16% were retreatment cases, and 65% suffered lepra reactions either before, during or after completion of therapy. These figures highlight the need for ongoing surveillance of both contacts and previously treated patients, as well as education to facilitate opportunistic diagnosis by health care workers. In addition, there is a need for strengthened referral pathways to ensure optimal care, particularly for those suffering lepra reactions and those residing in remote locations, in order to prevent disability. The guidelines aim to address these issues to optimise outcomes, particularly for patients residing in remote parts of state.

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 19 of 144 Chapter 3 Global considerations The epidemiology and burden of leprosy are highly variable at a national and subnational level. Therefore, adapt ation and implementation of guidelines at a local level is essential to achieve optimal outcomes. In December 2020, the WHO published 'Towards Zero Leprosy - Global Leprosy Strategy 2021 - 2030' , highlighting the shift in leprosy focus to interrupting leprosy transmission and achieving zero autochthonous cases with the eventual elimination of leprosy1. Targets of the strategy for the end of 2030 include:1 To have 120 countries with zero new autochthonous cases 70% reduction in the annual number of new cases detected 90% reduction in rate per million population of new cases with G2D 90% reduction in rate per million children of new child cases with leprosy The Global Leprosy Strategy aims to employ several strategic pillars to achieve these targets, including1; 1. Implementing integrated, country -owned zero leprosy roadmaps in all endemic countries 2. Scaling up leprosy prevention alongside integrated active case detection 3. Managing leprosy and its complications and preventing new disability 4. Combating stigma and ensuring human rights are respected. The WHO Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Leprosy published in 2018, is also accompanied by an Operational Manual2 and Monitoring and Evaluation Guide,3 assisting leprosy coordinators with program implementation and evaluation. Global leprosy data collection by the WHO has been simplified with the introduction of an electronic open- source software tool, encouraging improved reporting and more accurate measures of dise ase burden on which to base program recommendations. The WHO Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Leprosy4 were developed through a formal and robust guideline development process based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assess ment, Development and Evaluation) approach. These guidelines provide comprehensive clinical recommendations with a global focus, but particularly relevant for low and middle- income countries with high leprosy burden. The Western Australian Leprosy Guidelines provide recommendations adapted to local epidemiology and resources. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 20 of 144 References 1.

Leprosy cases meeting this definition should be notified to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) (see Chapter 12). Australian leprosy case definition: A confirmed case requires: 1. Laboratory definitive evidence OR laboratory suggestive evidence; AND 2. Clinical evidence: Laboratory definitive evidence Detection of Mycobacterium leprae by nucleic acid testing from the ear lobe or other relevant specimens Laboratory suggestive evidence Demonstration of characteristic acid- fast bacilli in slit skin smears and biopsies prepared from the ear lobe or other relevant sites OR Histopathologic al report from skin or nerve biopsy compatible with leprosy examined by an anatomical pathologist or specialist microbiologist experienced in leprosy diagnosis.

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 24 of 144 Chapter 5 Diagnosis of l eprosy 5.1 Clinical diagnosis 5.1.1 Presentation The presenting features of leprosy are highly variable, and dependent upon the host immune response to the pathogen, as well as duration of infection. Common presenting symptoms and signs inc lude: skin lesions - pale (hypo- pigmented), coppery, or reddish (erythematous) patch shiny thickened skin on the face (lion/leonine faces) swelling or nodules in the face and earlobes loss of sensation with or without skin lesions loss of sweating in a ski n lesion numbness or tingling of hands or feet weakness of hands, eyelids and feet injury secondary to nerve injury e.g. burn, ulceration visible deformity of the hands, feet and eyes nerve pain, acute nerve palsy, inflamed skin lesions, eye pain or fever in association with lepra reaction . The diagnosis of leprosy is heavily reliant on clinical symptoms and signs, especially in settings where access to slit skin smears and laboratory tests are limited. At least one of the three cardinal signs of leprosy must be present to make a diagnosis, with laboratory evidence required to meet the Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System definition of a confirmed case (see Chapter 4). Cardinal signs of leprosy 1.Skin lesions : Hypo -pigmented, coppery or erythematous skin lesions with reduced or absent sensation 2.Nerve thickening : Involvement of peripheral nerves in sites of predilection, as demonstrated by thickening or enlargement, with or without loss of sensation and weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve 3.Demonstration of M.leprae : either by slit skin smear (SSS), biopsy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 25 of 144 Standard questions asked as part of the history taking: Have you been treated for leprosy before? Has anyone in your family or community had leprosy? Have you noticed any skin lesions? Have you noticed any loss of sensation in your face, hands or feet? Have you noticed any dryness of the palms of your hands or soles of your feet? Have you noticed any weaknes s in your hands or feet? Have you noticed any weakness in your face or difficultly closing your eyes? Have you noticed any new sensations of pins and needles or tingling in your face, hands or feet? Have you noticed any new pain sensations such as burning or shooting pain? If the patient answers yes to any of the questions, enquire further as to location of the symptom and how long it has been present for. 5.1.2 S kin examination The entire body should be examined, preferably in natural sunlight. Lesions can appear anywhere on the body but tend to spare the axillae and groin. Findings of the skin examination should be recorded on the template in Appendix 1. Skin lesions in leprosy can be: single or multiple well defined or poorly defined variable in size macules (flat lesions) papules (raised lesions) nodular infiltrative hypo-pigmented (lighter in colour compared to surrounding skin) erythematous, reddish or copp ery hypo-anaesthetic (reduced sensation for temperature, touch and/or pain) dry with loss of sweating and/or loss of hair . The following features are not suggestive of leprosy: White (depigmented), dark red or black lesions . Scaly lesions . Lesions present since birth. Lesions which appear or disappear suddenly (exception with lepra reaction) . When a diagnosis of leprosy is suspected or proven, careful examination of the skin and peripheral nerves should be done, in addition to testing sensory and motor function of commonly affected nerves. Findings should be documented in detail in the templates located in Appendices 1, 2 or 3, with a guide for examination in Appendix 4. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 26 of 144 Pain or itchiness (exception with pain associated with lepra reactions) . Testing sensation in a skin lesion If a skin lesion is present, sensation should be tested using light touch and temperature. Light touch sensation is tested by using a cotton wool ball rolled to a point to touch the skin at a 90- degree angle. It is important not to stroke the skin. Demonst rate the process on an area of normal skin with the patient's eyes open, asking them to point to the area where the touch is felt. Light touch in the skin lesion is then tested with the patient's eyes closed. Temperature sensation can be tested using glass test tubes or cups filled with cold water (25 degrees Celsius) and warm water (45 degrees Celsius). It is important to note that skin lesions on the face and in lepromatous leprosy may have normal sensation. Testing light touch in areas with callus or thickened skin is not reliable, and interpretation of findings in children can be difficult. Digital photography of skin lesions at the time of diagnosis and at the completion of therapy with patient consent is recommended. Photography can also be a useful tool to monitor suspicious lesions during the diagnostic process. 5.1.3 Nerve palpation Nerve palpation is an important part of the clinical assessment, with nerve enlargement being one of the cardinal signs of leprosy. Detailed information and photographs to guide palpation of specific peripheral nerves can be found in Appendix 4. M.leprae grows best at temperatures lower than that of the body's core temperature, and therefore affects nerves at their coolest and most superficial location. This means that affected nerves are generally easily felt. The peripheral nerves most commonly affected are: Ulnar nerve at the elbow Common peroneal (lateral popliteal) nerve at the knee Poster ior tibial nerve at the ankle Median nerve at the wrist Facial nerve near the ear . Other nerves that may be affected include, but are not limited to, the greater auricular, sural and radial nerves. The ulnar nerve at the elbow is the easiest to palpate, with a section of nerve (up to 10cm) able to be felt above the elbow. This allows for detailed assessment of features of thickening, such as nodularity or rope like consistency. A normal nerve feels compressible, and generally flat. Table 2 outlines the method for palpating peripheral nerves. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 27 of 144 Table 2: Method for nerv e palpation Assess for: Thickness Consistency (may be rope like in advanced disease) Tenderness Irregularity (nodular, beaded) Number of nerves involved Symmetry Nerve enlargement is scored as follows 1: None (N) Possible (P) Definite (D) 5.1.4 Assessment of nerve function Nerve involvement with leprosy can cause abnormalities in autonomic, sensory and motor function, with motor loss generally occurring later in the course of the disease. Both cutaneous nerves and peripheral nerve trunks can be affected. While nerve damage occurs slowly, patients may present with acute deterioration in the setting of lepra reactions. Delayed detection of leprosy is strongly associated with an increased risk of nerve function impairment at the time of diagnosis, 2,3 which in turn is a strong predictor of the risk of further lepra reactions and progressive neuropathy.4,5 Careful standardised assessment of nerve function is an important part of the diagnostic work up of a patient, facilitating prompt treatment of reactional states when detected, and a means of allowing comparison in function over time to assist in early detection of deterioration. Method for nerve palpation: 1. position patient and examiner correctly, ideally seated comfortably 2. enquire as to whether any of the nerves are tender 3. locate the nerve 4. use the pulp of two or three fingers to roll the nerve gently against the bone (do not use the tips of the fingers) 5. observe the patient's face during examination to detect tenderness feel along the nerve as far as possible in both directions 6. compare features of nerve with the opposite side Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 28 of 144 Assessment of peripheral nerve function should be made at the time of initial presentation, as well as monthly while on tr eatment and following completion of therapy as outlined in Figure 5 in Chapter 6.5.5. The presence of autonomic dysfunction, sensory loss, weakness and secondary impairments are diagnostic of nerve damage and should be carefully assessed in the patient su spected of having leprosy. Table 3: Primary and Secondary impairments associated with peripheral nerve damage in leprosy Peripheral nerve Primary impairment Secondary impairment Sensory Motor Ulnar nerve * LF and ulnar half of RF Weakness of LF abduction Ulnar claw Contractures Radial nerve * Dorsum hand (thumb, IF MF, half RF) Weakness of wrist and finger extension Wrist drop Median nerve * Palmar aspect (thumb, IF, MF, half RF ) Weakness of thumb abduction Wasting of interossei and clawing Contractures Cranial nerve VII (zygomatic oris: abnormal eye closure Lagophthalmos Corneal ulceration / inflammation Blindness Cranial nerve V Corneal anaesthesia: impaired blink reflex Corneal ulcer ation / inflammation Blindness Common peroneal nerve Lateral leg and dorsum of foot Weakne ss of dorsiflexion of the foot Foot drop Posterior tibial nerve * Plantar aspect of foot Claw toes IF = index finger, LF=little finger, RF=ring finger, MF=middle finger *In addition, damage to autonomic fibres results in loss of sweating and loss of hair with subsequent predisposition to callus formation and fissuring of the skin. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 29 of 144 5.1.4.1 Sensory testing : The assessment of sensory function is important for the diagnosis of leprosy, as well as for monitoring the patient while on therapy to ensure early detection of neuritis and lepra reactions. The pattern of sensory neuropathy in leprosy often varies according to the type of leprosy. Table 4: Patterns of sensory neuropathy in leprosy Leprosy classification Pattern of sensory neuropathy Mechanism of neuropathy Indeterminate Localised cutaneous sensory loss, no nerve trunk involvement Injury to cutaneous nerve endings Tuberculoid Mononeuropathy, localised sensory loss in distribution of one peripheral nerve trunk Involvement of single peripheral nerve Borderline states, early Lepromatous leprosy Multiple mononeuropathy Multiple peripheral nerves affected Lepromatous leprosy Polyneuropathy, often in a glove and st ocking distribution Diffuse nerve involvement Sensory testing is performed on the hands and feet in the areas supplied by the peripheral nerves commonly affected in leprosy. Testing is done preferably using standardised, graded nylon monofilaments6 as outlined in Appendix 2 Referral Centre Template. In the field situation, or where monofilaments are unavailable, t he tip of a ballpoint pen can be used, and is equivalent to a 10g (orange) monofilament7 as outline in Appendix 3 Peripheral Centre Template. When using a pen to test sensation, touch the skin lightly with the pen from a perpendicular angle. It is important just to use the light weight of the pen, and to avoid pressing and indenting the skin. For further guidance see Appendix 4. Six colour coded monofilaments are used to test sensation in defined points, providing a means of monitoring sensory function over time. Table 5 outlines the features, force and interpretation of sensory testing with monofilaments. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 30 of 144 Table 5: Interpretation of sensory testing with monofilaments Colour Force Hands & dorsal foot Sole of the foot Green 0.07g Normal Normal Blue 0.4g Diminished light touch Normal Purple 2.0g Diminished protective sensation risk of injury and ulceration Normal - reduced sensation Dark Red 4.0g Loss of protective sensation Diminished protective sensation risk of injury and ulceration Orange 10.0g Loss of protective sensation Loss of protective sensation Bright red 300.0g Deep pressure sensation only Deep pressure sensation only When testing the hands, all monofilaments should be used, starting with the finest filament. For testing sensation on the soles of the feet, omit 0.05g (Green) and 0.2g (Blue) monofilaments. h e finest/lightest filament felt is recorded. Practice notes for using monofilaments: Ensure the monofilament is in good condition . Apply to the points indicated on the assessment form . Apply the monofilament at a 90- degree angle to the skin surface . Pressure should be slow and gentle to form a \"C\" shape in the monofilament. 5.1.4.2 Assessing motor function: Motor function is assessed using the Voluntary Muscle Test (VMT) and is scored using the modified Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale or alternat ive simplified system (Table 6). Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 31 of 144 Table 6: Modified MRC grading score for VMT8 Alternative scoring VMT score Description Strong (S) Grade 5 Full ROM against gravity and maximum resistance Weak (W) Grade 4 Full ROM against gravity and moderate resistance Grade 3 Full ROM against gravity, not added resistance Grade 2 Partial range of movement, no resistance, gravity eliminated Grade 1 Visible or palpable contraction with no movement Paralysed (P) Grade 0 Complete paralysis ROM=range of movement Considerations for performing a VMT: Ensure correct movement to test the selected muscle (patients may compensate for weakness in one muscle by using others) . Test muscle strength using appropriate resistance (for example, the examiner should use their own little finger to assess strength of little finger abduction in the patient) . The combination of sensory testing and voluntary muscle testing is called VMT -ST. Templates for recording findings can be found in Appendices 2 and 3, with a guide to performing VMT -ST in Appendix 4. The referral centre template (Appendix 2) is more detailed and requires greater clinical expertise. The peripheral centre template (Appendix 3) is designed for simple assessment at the community level. 5.1.5 P ain assessment Neuropathic pain is a common feature of leprosy, occurring due to nerve inflammation, nerve entrapment and nerve damage, with or without other symptoms of lepra reaction. Neuropathic symptoms can include: paresthesia pain: burning, stabbing, squeezing, stinging, aching, shooting stimulus induced pain. While the pain is often acute, chronic pain can develop in patients who have completed therapy, with significant impact on their quality of life. Pain is most easily assesse d using a visual analog scale, which is incorporated into the VMT -ST template. Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4) is a screening tool for Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 32 of 144 neuropathic pain with a higher sensitivity and specificity and can be used if clarification is required (Appe ndix 5). 5.1.6 Eye Examination Leprosy remains one of the leading causes of preventable blindness and visual disability, with studies reporting rates of potentially sight -threatening leprosy related eye pathology varying between 11% and 48% 9,10,11 and prev alence of blindness between 2.8% and 3.2%.10,12 Like all leprosy related disability, eye complications can develop before, during and after the completion of drug therapy. It is therefore important to perform careful examination of the eyes in a suspected case of leprosy, during therapy and following completion of treatment in patients with risk factors for progression. Eye involvement in leprosy can occur in three ways: 1. Direct infiltration of the eye and surrounding tissues . 2. Inflammation as part of lepra reactions . 3. Involvement of cranial nerves V and VII . Method for examining the eyes: Inspect for: loss of eyebrows (particularly outer 1/3) (Madarosis) loss of eyelashes inability to close the eyes (Lagophthalmos) infrequent or abnormal blink (reduced corneal sensation) dryness or scarring of the cornea (exposure keratitis) inflammation / infection of the lacr imal sac (between eye and nose) redness of the eye (iridocyclitis) sagging / turned out lower lid (ectropion) lid turned in towards eyeball (entropion) turned in lashes (trichiasis), often associated with corneal scarring Patients with MB leprosy and any patient with eye abnormality should be seen by an ophthalmologist at the time of diagnosis, annually during treatment and for a minimum of five years following completion of treatment. Risk factors for eye involvement in leprosy: Multibacillary disease Presence of other deformities Facial skin lesion Lepra reaction involving the face Increasing age Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 33 of 144 lens opacity (cataract) abnormal pupil shape facial skin lesions . Examine: Ask the patient to close their eyes (as if asleep) . o Look for a gap between the lids . o If present, estimate the gap in millimetres . If there is no gap visible, ask the patient to close their eyes tightly . o Use your index finger and thumb to try to open the lids . o If you are easily able to open the eye, the muscles are weak . Abnormal lid closure is caused by involvement of cranial nerve VII . Take note of the number of times the patient blinks. If they blink inf requently i.e. less than twice per minute, it implies anaesthesia due to involvement of cranial nerve V the trigeminal nerve. For safety reasons, testing corneal sensation with cotton wool should not be performed. Measure visual acuity in both eyes with a Snellen chart . Potentially sight -threatening ocular complications associated with Cataract uveitis Scleritis . 5.1.7 Leprosy in children Leprosy in children is a marker of ongoing transmission within a community, and the WHO Global Leprosy Strategy 2021 - 2030 emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and reduction of disability in children.13 Leprosy in a child is often difficult to diagnose due to subtle skin findings and difficulties encountered performing a neurological examination. Children are mor e likely to present with indeterminate or early leprosy with the following skin lesion features: Occur more commonly in Borderline Tuberculoid and Tuberculoid forms of leprosy. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 34 of 144 The diagnosis should be suspected in a child from a leprosy endemic region, or with a known family history of leprosy. A biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis of indeterminate leprosy however this is often not acceptable from a cosmetic perspective for a facial lesion. As approximately 75% of indeterminate lesions heal spontaneously, a reasonable approach is to apply topical antifungal for 4 weeks and observe for 6- 12 months. Changes in the lesion including development of well -defined margins, more marked hypopigmentation, and development of hypoanaesthesia are suggestive of progression into definite leprosy and requires further investigation. 5.2 Laboratory d iagnosis 5.2.1 Introduction The diagnosis of leprosy is hindered by the inability to culture M.leprae in the laboratory. While there is no true gold standard, full- thickness skin biopsy examined by an experienced pathologist is the most reliable and informative test. In many resource- poor settings, the diagnosis is purely clinical, sometimes supplemented with slit skin smear (SSS) results . Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) offers enhanced sensitivity compared with biopsy and SSS. PathWest Laboratory Medicine has developed in- house PCR assays with confirmati on by sequencing to increase diagnostic certainty. Collection of nasal swabs for PCR is now recommended for all cases in view of high sensitivity and ease of collection. 5.2.2 Slit skin smears SSS are performed to detect M.leprae bacilli in tissue fluid of the skin. The test has low sensitivity (10 -50% depending on expertise) but high specificity (100%). SSS have low diagnostic utility and are useful only in patients with borderline lepromatous and lepromatous leprosy, with smears often negative in many patients with other forms of leprosy. Despite this, SSS are relatively non- invasive, cheap and simple to perform, and help to identify and monitor patients who are most infectious and at highest risk of relapse. Indications: For d iagnosis in patients with suspected or diagnosed leprosy before commencing treatment . Monitoring response to therapy of multibacillary cases . Detecting relapse. It is recommended that smears be taken from a minimum of three sites, avoiding the face for cosmetic reasons. Small to medium size (1 -3 cm) Hypopigmented Ill-defined edges (particularly smaller lesions) Normal hair growth Sensation usually normal Often located on the face & extensor aspect of limbs Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 35 of 144 Suggested sites include: One ear lobe and two active lesions o Smears should be taken from the active edge if the lesion is distinct, and from the centre if the lesion is indistinct Extensor surface of elbow (s) Extensor surface of knee (s ) Dorsal surface of fingers . When utilising SSS for disease monitoring and detecting relapse, smears should be taken from previously positive sites. Method for taking a slit skin smear: 1. Consider applying topical anaesthetic cream if sensation preserved in selected site. 2. Clean site with alcohol swab and allow to dry . 3. Roll site between index finger and thumb until it becomes bloodless . 4. Using a size 15 scalpel blade, make an incision 5mm long and 3mm deep. 5. Maintaining pressure with the fingers, turn the blade at a right angle to the inc ision and scrape the slanted edge of the blade several times in one direction to obtain tissue fluid. 6. Smear the fluid gently on the slide in a circle approximately 8- 10mm in diameter . 7. Samples with visible blood content are unlikely to be useful. A second sample can be obtained after wiping the incision site with cotton wool while maintaining finger pressure. 8. Place a small dressing over the incision. 9. Fix the slide by passing the underside for 2 seconds over a naked flame . 10. Label the slide with patient details and site, and place in slide container . 11. Send to PathWest requesting smears for microscopy can be obtained using a sterile cotton bud wiped firmly in the nasal passage. Prepare the smear as outlined from points 5- 8 above. Nasal smears are often positive in patients with untreated lepromatous leprosy. Laboratory reporting of skin smears / nasal smears Samples are reviewed at the Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory (MRL) at the Pat hWest Laboratory Medicine Department at the Queen Elizabeth II (QEII) site. Smears with AFB seen are reported with the number of bacilli quantified using a semi logarithmic score called the Bacillary Index (BI). The BI ranges from 1+ to 6+, depending on the number of bacilli seen in an average microscopic field using an oil immersion lens or high power field (hpf). Untreated lepromatous leprosy patients generally have a BI of 5+ or 6+, falling by approximately 0.75- 1.0+ BI units per year with treatment. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 36 of 144 Table 6: Bacillary index definitions for skin smears In addition to the BI, the laboratory will report a morphological index (MI) for specimens where AFB are seen. The MI is the percentage of all bacilli that appear viable. These bacilli stain solidly and are of standard shape and size. Fragmented and granular bacilli are not considered viable and are often seen after several months of effective therapy. Occasionally globi are reported, describing clumps of bacilli, and are generally found in patients with lepromatous leprosy and high bac illary load. The MI in an untreated multibacillary patient generally ranges from 25% to 75% and should fall to 0% after 4- 6 months of effective treatment. It is important to note that the MI is a more useful measure of response to therapy and potential for transmission, with many patients, particularly those with high BI, remaining smear positive at the completion of therapy. 5.2.3 Skin biopsy A full thickness skin biopsy is the preferred test when leprosy is suspected on clinical grounds, having higher s ensitivity than SSS, particularly when examined by an experienced pathologist. While biopsy is more invasive than SSS, it has a number of advantages. Advantages of skin biopsy over SSS Facilitates diagnosis of paucibacillary cases and those with low bacill ary load not detectable by SSS . Allows classification according to Ridley -Jopling criteria o More accurate classification o Ensures appropriate therapy o More accurate prediction of prognosis Can identify lepra reactions . Facilitates diagnosis of conditions whi ch mimic leprosy. Optimal specimen for molecular testing o Enhance sensitivity o Allow detection of drug resistant determining regions in certain cases . Method for skin biopsy 1. Clean the site and inject local anaesthetic deep into the subcutaneous tissue around the biopsy site (do not inject intradermally as it ruins the biopsy) . 1 hpf Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 37 of 144 2. Full thickness elliptical (1cm long) or punch (4mm) biopsy from the advancing margin of an active lesion or centre of a subtle hypopigmented lesion with indistinct edge (two biopsies are preferred if the punch technique is used to allow for optimal mycobacteriological processing) . 3. Place a small part of the elliptical biopsy or one punch biopsy into sterile saline for microscopy and PCR . 4. Place the remainder of the biopsy, or second specimen (punch biopsies) in buffered formal saline (10%) formalin and stain for AFB and fungal stains. 5. Label the biopsies and send to PathWest Perth. Multiple biopsies should be obtained if there are numerous skin lesions with varying morphology. 5.2.4 Nerve biopsy and fine needle aspiration. Pure neuritic leprosy, sometimes called pure neural, primary neural, primary neuritic, or poly-neuritic leprosy, is a form of leprosy characterised by nerve involvement without skin lesions. It is not included in the WHO or Ridley -Jopling classification systems, and debate continues as to optimal treatment. Pure neuritic leprosy is most frequently seen in patients of Indian or Nepalese ethnicity .14 The ulnar, lateral popliteal, posterior tibial and sural nerves are most commonly affected, with patients presenting either with a mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex when several nerves are involved. While classic skin patches are absent, skin along the distribution of the involved nerve is often hypoanaesthetic and changes such as anhidrosis, xerosis, fissuring and trauma can be present. Pure neuritic Leprosy When to suspect Patient from leprosy endemic area, particularly India. Mononeuritis or mononeuritis multipl ex. Clinical features Thickened, tender peripheral nerves . Sensory, motor or autonomic impairment . Skin lesions absent . Diagnosis Nerve biopsy is gold standard. Fine needle aspiration cytology from nerve . Nerve conduction studies resolution ultrasonography . SSS negative . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 38 of 144 Nerve biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but is prone to sampling error, with low sensitivity and the risk of permanent nerve damage. Biopsies are most commonly taken from a branch of a purely sensory nerve such as the superficial sensory radial nerve branch at the wrist, ulnar cutaneous nerve near the hand, and sural nerve near the ankle. The procedure is generally done by an experienced neurologist or neurosurgeon. Specimens should be sent to anatomical pathology for haematoxylin and eosin stain and Fite- Faraco stain. Fine needle aspiration cytology is a less invasive, simpler method that can be used prior to nerve biopsy if pure neuritic leprosy is suspected .15 The sensitivity is low but improved with use of M.leprae PCR in addition to cytology and 5.2.5 Molecular testing M.leprae PCR PCR is a rapid, reliable, sensitive and specific tool which can be used to detect M.leprae deoxyribonucleic acid (D NA) in a variety of tissue sources including skin biopsy samples, oral or nasal swabs, SSS fluid ,17 and whole blood. Multi -copy targets are increasingly used to improve sensitivity and current assays are reported to have a lower limit of detection than microscopy. PathWest is unable to validate its in- house Leprosy PCR to NPAAC standards due to the infrequency of cases. All PCR detections are confirmed by sequencing. While s kin biopsy in saline is the preferred sample for optimal DNA extraction 18 it is strongl y recommended that nasal swabs are sent for PCR in all cases where leprosy is suspected. Situations where PCR may be useful include: paucibacillary cases with atypical clinical findings and non- diagnostic histological findings pure neuritic leprosy . 5.2.6 Susceptibility testing Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance has been identified as an important component of the Global Leprosy Strategy 2021 - 2030. In 2008, the Global Leprosy Programme (GLP) established a surveillance network to collect data on antimicrobial resistance in M.leprae . Global data from sentinel sites of 19 countries collected by the WHO between 2009 and 2015 reveals rates of rifampicin resistance of 5.1% i n 1143 cases of relapsed infection (proxy fo r secondary resistance), and 2 .0% in 789 new cases (proxy for primary resistance). The global rate of rifampicin resistance was 3.8%, with higher rates in Brazil (9%) and India (5%). The global rate of dapsone resistance was 5.3% with rates in Brazil and India again higher, at 12.7% an d 6.4% , respectively. 19 These figures highlight the need to expand the surveillance network and implement susceptibility testing for all retreatment cases. The inability to grow M.leprae in vitro, and the expense and time -consuming nature of the mouse footpad technique, has prompted a recommendation from the WHO for susceptibility testing to be performed using molecular techniques to detect the mutations known to be associated with has not been standardized, with varying techniques utilised. Amplicon - based sequencing is available at PathWest Laboratory Medicine. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 39 of 144 Susceptibility testing should be requested for: all retreatment cases o with the exception of transferred cases who have documentation of uninterrupted treatment . all new multibacillary cases with a BI of >2+ . Required specimens include either two slit skin smears or one skin biopsy, with collection performed by an experienced clinician following discussion with the Infectious Diseases Specialist at the WA TB Control Program . Skin biopsy is the preferred specimen. Method for sample collection: Slit skin smear samples: Two samples to be obtained using method outlined in 5.2.2. o Either 2 from most pr ominent lesion with BI >2+, or one from most prominent lesion and one from the earlobe. Extra caution should be taken to prevent contamination . Following collection of tissue fluid from the incision site, the blade should be rinsed into a 1.8 mL centrifuge tube with screw cap pre- filled with 1mL of 70% ethanol (molecular biology grade absolute ethanol at 70% v/v + sterile deionized water from MilliQ or human injection quality 30% v/v) . Transport to the MRL at QEII temperature. Skin biopsy: New cases: 4mm punch biopsy of cases: 6mm elliptical biopsy of most prominent lesion is preferred for cases with BI <3+ to improve yield. Place the biopsy in a 1.8mL centrifuge sterile tube filled with 70% ethanol as described above. If the ethanol mixture is unavailable, place the biopsy in an empty 1.8mL sterile centrifuge tube with a screw cap. Transport to the MRL at QEII at room temperature. WA TB Control will report the following annually to the WHO: Number of new MB cases tested, and the number and proportion of resistant cases (to one or more drug) . Number of retreatment MB cases tested, and the number and proportion of resistant cases. The Infectious Diseases Specialist responsible for lepr osy at WA TB Control will complete the forms for data collection with assistance from the Mycobacterial Reference L aboratory (Appendix 6). 5.2.7 Quality control All PathWest laboratories are accredited by National Association of Testing Authorities and undergo regular audit s. Proficiency is assured through participation with national (Royal College of Pathologists Australasia) and the Special Interest Group for Mycobacteria within the Australian Society for Microbiology. These programs cover all aspects of tertiary mycobacteriology. PathWest laboratories offering AFB microscopy also undertake quality Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 40 of 144 assurance to ensure competency. The MRL offers training and quality control materials as required. 5.2.8 Laboratory n otification of results New smear positiv e, PCR positive and results of susceptibility testing are communicated by the scientist to the requesting doctor or laboratory. Hard copy and electronic reports are managed via a laboratory information system. The MRL will notify all new smear positive and PCR positive results to the Medical Director, Western Australia TB Control Program by fax followed by a hard copy of the report. 5.3 Other diagnostic tools 5.3.1 Nerve conduction studies Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are rarely indicated in the diagnosis of leprosy, and should be reserved for difficult cases, in consultation with the neurology department. NCS are invasive, uncomfortable and time consuming. Furthermore, the sensitivity of sensory testing with monofilaments in conjunction with VMT and nerve palpation for detecting nerve damage in leprosy is similar to that of NCS. 21 5.3.2 Imaging High resolution ultrasonography (HRUS): HRUS may be indicated in the following situations: In cases where the diagnosis of leprosy is unclear o Used with colour doppler to demonstrate nerve enlargement and inflammation . Early detection of neuritis (with use of colour doppler) . To localise nerve pathology to guide aspiration or biopsy . When nerve abscesses are suspected. While some ultrasonographic features including extensive nerve enlargement, increased endoneural and epineural blood flow and thickening of the epineurium are suggestive of leprosy, HRUS cannot distinguish leprosy from other causes of nerve pathology, 22,23 Hence the findings must be used in conjunction with clinical findings and microbiological results. 5.4 Disease classification and a ssessment 5.4.1 Introduction Leprosy is a chronic disease which presents with a wide spectrum of clinical features. Disease expression is determined by the patient's cell mediated immune response, with the potential for variation over time. Classification systems have been designed to simplify categorisation for treatment purposes, as well as determining infectivity , risk of leprosy re action and nerve damage. It is important to note that the systems are designed to be used as a guide, with some patients presenting with atypical features , and recognising that clinical features can change during the course of disease. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 41 of 144 The most common cl assification systems currently in use are the WHO classification 1998,24 the National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) of Government of India classification,25 and the Ridley -Jopling classification .26 The choice of classification system depends upon availability of resources and operational factors. In WA, the Ridley -Jopling classification is used when skin biopsy is available, in view of greater utility in terms of predicting prognosis. In situations where only SSS are available, the NLEP classifica tion is preferred due to inclusion of the number of nerves involved, providing greater sensitivity and allowing for incorporation of pure neuritic leprosy into the diagnostic spectrum. The WHO classification is used in situations where neither SSS nor sk in biopsy are available, and for reporting to the WHO. Treatment is guided by correlation of Ridley - Jopling and NLEP classification with WHO classification as outlined in Table 8. 5.4.2 Ridley -Jopling classification The Ridley -Jopling classification syst em identifies five forms of le prosy on the basis of clinical, histological, bacteriological and TT: Tuberculoid Borderline Lepromatous leprosy LL: Lepr omatous leprosy This classification represents a spectrum from localised disease with high cell mediated immunity (CMI), robust granulomatous response and few to no AFB in TT leprosy , through three immunologically unstable borderline forms , to the polar lepromatous (LL) form which is characterised by disseminated disease with abundant M. leprae and poor CMI . It is important to note that in a small proportion of cases clinical features do not correlate with the histopathological classification. This may represent immunological instability with a lag in clinical manifestations. Indeterminate and pure neural leprosy are not included in the Ridley -Jopling classification. Indeterminate leprosy is believed to represent an early form of leprosy, which occurs in a proportion of patients following exposure to M.leprae. It is characterised by a hypopigmented patch with ill -defined edges and in most cases preservation of hair and nerve function. Dia gnosis requires demonstration of typical perineural inflammation or more rarely, the presence of scanty bacilli. The majority of cases will self -heal without therapy, with a small proportion progressing to TT leprosy. The features of pure neural leprosy are outlined in section 5.2.4. 5.4.3 WHO C lassification The WHO classification was initially proposed in 1982 to guide fixed duration MDT (FD - MDT). It was revised in 1998 to simplify diagnosis in the field and remove the need for slit skin smears. The pri mary clinical criterion for classification is the number of skin lesions, with paucibacillary disease having (1- 5 lesions) and multibacillary disease (6 or more lesions). Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 42 of 144 5.4.4 NLEP Classification The NLEP classification proposed in 2009 is based on the WHO classification, with the addition of assessment of the number of nerves involved. A MB case is defined as the presence of six or more skin lesions, involvement of more than one nerve (irrespective of the number of skin lesions) and skin smears positive at any site. As stated previously, inclusion of the number of nerves involved improves the sensitivity of the classification and ensures inclusion and accurate treatment facilitates of pure neural leprosy.

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 43 of 144 5.4.5 Disability grading Leprosy remains an important cause of disability worldwide, with prevention and management of disabili ty being one of the components of the current WHO Global Leprosy Strategy . The rate of Grade 2 disability (G2D) in WA is 50%, well above accepted targets. The proportion of G2D cases amongst newly diagnosed cases and the G2D rate in a population are mar kers for delayed leprosy detection. Factors influencing the rate of G2D include community awareness of the early signs of leprosy, access to leprosy services, skills of healthcare workers, and stigma. Grading disability in leprosy is important for assess ing program efficiency, as well as assessing changes in individual patients over time. Three grading systems are currently in use: the WHO disability grade, the Eye Hand Foot (EHF) score and the Impairment Summary Form (ISF). WHO disability grading: The grading system currently in use was proposed by the WHO in 1997 (Figure 4). Grading should be performed at the time of diagnosis, primarily for reporting. Detailed operational definitions for the grading scale have been proposed to enhance reliability of data, facilitate comparison between programs or groups of patients, and assist with interpretation of the EHF score. 27 The WHO disability grading should be used primarily to assess program efficacy in terms of early case detection. Figure 4: WHO disabil ity grading 199828 with proposed operational and expanded grading. Hands and Feet Grade 0: no anaesthesia, no visible deformity or damage. Grade 1: anaesthesia present, but no visible deformity or damage. Includes scars of healed ulcers when sensation is impaired, muscle weakness without clawing or contracture. Grade 2: visible deformity or damage present . Includes ulcers, severe cracks, severe atrophy, contractures, digital absorption, clawing Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 44 of 144 NB: 1. Facial deformity in association with lepromatous leprosy such as loss of eyebrows, enlarged earlobes and collapse of the nose are not included but should be recorded 2. Impairments which are not due to leprosy should not be included. Record separately and annotated with \"non- leprosy\" 3. The highest score for either the eye or hands / feet is reported EHF impairment score: The EHF impairment score is more complex than the WHO grading, providing more detailed information on the site and degree of impairment. Individual impairment grades for eyes, hands and feet are added together to give the final score (Figure 5). The maximum score for each hand, foot and eye is two, with a maximum final scor e of 12. The EHF score provides an indication of extent of nerve impairment, with a score of 5 or more reflecting involvement of 3 or more nerves. While the EHF can provide some information on changes in impairment over time, it is not a highly sensitive or reliable indicator at an individual level, with the potential for deterioration in one area to be masked by improvement in another. 29,30 For this reason, it is recommended that the EHF, like the WHO grading system,31 be used primarily to assess program effectiveness, rather than to assess change in impairment in individual patients. Figure 5: WHO grading and EHF score31: Site R eye L eye R hand L hand R foot L foot Total Grade (0-2) ISF has a total of 24 variables including 3 for each eye, 5 for each hand and 4 for each foot. It should be performed at least every 6 months while on therapy, and after completion of therapy for patients at high risk of further impairment. ISF scoring provides more detail than that provided by the EHF and WHO grading, with greater sensitivity for assessing deterioration at an individual level.29 It is useful for monitoring both secondary impairments, as well as detecting development or deterioration in pri mary nerve function. The ISF is detailed and time consuming, and therefore most suitable for assessments at the referral centre level. An ISF Scoring table can be found in Appendix 7. Eyes Grade 0: no eye problem due to leprosy , no evidence of visual loss . Grade 1: eye problems due to leprosy, but vision not severely affected (VA 6/60 or better, can count fingers at 6m) . Includes absence of regular blink . Grade 2: severe visual impairment (VA worse than 6/60, inability to count fingers at 6m, lagophthalmos, iridocyclitis, corneal opacities . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 45 of 144 5.4.6 Case notification When a new case of leprosy is confirmed, i t is a requirement that a notification form is completed as soon as possible. It is important that cases not meeting the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance definition, but fulfilling criteria required to meet the WHO leprosy case definition, are not ified to the Director of the WA TB Control Program (for definitions, see Chapter 4). In addition, the enhanced surveillance database should be completed by the treating physician and case manager . Assistance with completing the database and notification forms can be provided by WA TB Control Program staff. 5.4.7 Functional assessment Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease which has the potential to significantly impact the patient's Health- related Quality of Life (HRQoL). 32,33,34 Factors contributing to impaired quality of life include: stigma associated with disease physical consequences of the disease chronic pain lepra reactions and their consequences physical deformity and disability medication side effects . Measurement of the impact of disease on a patient's overall wellbeing provides valuable information that can guide care planning and interventions to optimise patient outcomes. HRQoL can be measured using a number of t ools. The World Health Organisation Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL- BREF) has been validated for assessing quality of life in patients with leprosy. The scale has four domains; physical health, psychological health, social relationship and environmen tal health. The questionnaire is very comprehensive with a complex scoring system which may not be suited to the clinical setting. Initial screening with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) is recommended for all patients at the time of diagnosi s and annually while on treatment. For patients with acute neuritis, lepra reactions or nerve damage, the survey should be completed six -monthly during treatment and follow up (Appendix 8).

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 49 of 144 Chapter 6 Medical treatment of leprosy 6.1 Introduction Multidrug therapy for leprosy In 1982, prompted by the emergence of dapsone resistance and in an attempt to improve compliance and efficacy, the WHO recommended the use of multi drug therapy (MDT) for the treatment of leprosy 1. Since this time, the WHO has made a number of changes to both the classification of disease and the duration of therapy. Significant controversy exists regarding duration of treatment and removal of the need for skin smears to determine classification. Uni form MDT (U -MDT), involving 6 months of treatment for all patients, regardless of classification, has not been widely adopted. Reasons for this include minimal long term follow up data and concerns regarding the risk of relapse, particularly in multibacill ary patients with a high bacillary index (BI 4+). Similarly, there are concerns that Accompanied MDT (A -MDT), where the patient is provided with the entire supply of MDT drugs at the time of diagnosis, with the supervision of a nominated person, may com promise adherence, resulting in relapses which may not be detected in periods of short term follow up. Several studies where long term follow up has been performed have noted higher rates of relapse in cases with a high BI (4+) managed with shorter durat ion of MDT 3. Review of the literature using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach has revealed that evidence for clinical improvement and relapse rate with MDT for MB and paucibacillary (PB) leprosy is low (relapse rate MB leprosy) to very low (clinical improvement MB and PB, relapse rate PB leprosy) 4. For these reasons, Western Australia guidelines recommend at least 24 months of therapy for patients with BI 4+. WA guidelines align with the United States National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP) guidelines5 for treatment duration of patients with BI>4+ but differ with regards to dosing of rifampicin. WA has adopted the WHO recommendation for monthly rifampicin, rather than daily dosing as suggested by NHD P, based on results from a multicentre RCT demonstrating similar clinical improvement but increased adverse events with daily rifampicin6. Uncertainty still exists regarding optimal dosing of rifampicin, with some suggestion that patients with high bacillary index (>4+) may benefit from daily rifampicin in the first month of therapy. The recently published WHO guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of leprosy7 recommend using a three- drug regimen of rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine for all patients, regardless of classification. The advantages of this approach include simplification of prescribing, reduction in impact of misclassification of MB leprosy as PB leprosy, and possible anti -inflammatory benefits for PB patients with neuritis, who otherwise would not receive clofazimine. In view of this, the WA guidelines have followed this recommendation.

It is recommended that all patients are seen by a doctor at least monthly, with specialist review at least every three months . More frequent reviews are required for patients with lepra reactions and treatment complications. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 53 of 144 Suggested monitoring while on treatment (see Clinical Template Appendix 9) : Clinical item Frequency Dispensing medication Weekly for first month, then monthly Clinical review including skin examination, VMT -ST Monthly More frequently in presence of lepra reaction (usually 1- 2 weekly depending on severity of reaction) Blood tests: FBC, EUC, LFT Monthly for first 3 months, then if normal 3 monthly Additional investigations required for patients receiving prednisolone (see 7.2.2.4) Skin smears For patients with positive smears at time of diagnosis, repeat smears 12 monthly until completion of therapy. Smears should be taken from previously positive sites. More frequent or further investigation may be required in cases where treatment failure is suspected. Disability grading WHO grading and EHF score at time of diagnosis and completion of treatment Impairment summary form (ISF) 6 monthly (see 5.4.5 and Appendix 7) 6.5.2 Treatment completion Treatment completion is defined as: Treatment completion is not necessarily synonymous with improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or with microbiological cure. For this reason, while fixed duration therapy is recommended by the WHO, therapy often needs to be individualised where resources permit. In the absence of a true test of cure, the relapse rate is the main method of PB leprosy : 6 months of doses (or 6 x 4 weekly cycles) within 9 months . MB leprosy : 12 months of doses (or 12 x 4 weekly cycles) within 18 months or for BI 4+ 24 months of doses (or 24 x 4 weekly cycles) within 36 months . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 54 of 144 assessing the efficacy of treatment. In multibacillary cases, SSS should be taken at previously positive sites at the completion of therapy to allow assessment of treatment response and facilitate ongoing monitoring to detect relapse. In patients with high BI at the time of di agnosis (>4+) the BI will remain positive at completion of 24 months fixed duration therapy however the MI should reveal dead bacilli which stain irregularly and are reported as being fragmented or granular. The BI should fall by 0.75- 1+ each year while on treatment and following completion of therapy (See 5.2.2). 6.5.3 Follow up after completion of therapy The aims of reviewing patients following completion of therapy are: To detect relapse (see 6.10.1): The suggested duration of follow -up for MB patients with high BI is based on clinical data suggesting that the average interval from completion of therapy to relapse ranges from 3 years to 26 years, with a mean of 10.5 to 14 years . 8,9,10. Relapse rate is an important indicator of effectiveness of drug thera py and program quality . Estimations of relapse rate following completion of MDT vary widely due to variations in definitions, treatment regimens and durations, patient characteristics including smear positivity, and duration of follow up. The WHO estimates that relapse rates following 12- 24 months MDT are extremely low, with average rates of 0.1% per year for PB leprosy and 0.06% per year for MB leprosy . The rate of relapse is higher w injec table thiambutosine / DPT) are used t o treat multibacillary leprosy. Rates of relapse are reported to range from 2.5% 11 to 8.6%12 with one study reporting a rate of 25%13, driven primarily by sulphone resistance . The majority of cases diagnosed in WA prior to 1986 did not receive rifampicin as part of their therapy. Patients with a high bacillary index at the time of diagnosis (4- 6+) have higher rates of relapse compared with those with lower bacillary index, hence more intensive follow up is recommended in this group of patients .14,15,16 Early detection of relapse is important to prevent transmission and avoid further complications of leprosy including nerve function injury . To prevent disability and deformity Evidence suggests that the majority of initial nerve function injury (NFI) occurs within 2 years of diagnosis . 17 Any NFI at diagnosis is predictive of further impairment of nerve function18 Disability progression and burden of deformity are significant problems following completion of therapy o In a prospective cohort study , 40% of patients showed disability progression in the 10 years after treatment completion, with the majority presenting after 5 years . 19 Suggested duration of follow up reflect these fi ndings and aim to deliver a high standard of care . Early detection and treatment of lepra reactions is facilitated by close follow up following completion of MDT . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 55 of 144 Education for self -care of hands, feet and eyes is an essential component of prevention of di sability . Coordination of the multidisciplinary team involved in the care of patients with nerve function injury is facilitated by the follow up suggested . Case detection Education about signs and symptoms of leprosy . Enquiring about contacts and reviewi ng completeness of contact tracing. Figure 6 outlines the suggested follow up of leprosy patients in WA once they have completed recommended therapy. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 56 of 144 6 Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 57 of 144 6.6 Alternative regimens Unable or refusal to take rifampicin (adult). In case of allergy to rifampicin, seek advice from Immunology regarding safety of rechallenge with a reintroduction schedule, and feasibility of substituting with rifamycin analogues such as rifapentine. Where rifampicin cannot be given (in case of allergy or drug resistance): 300mg clofazimine monthly AND 50mg clofazimine daily o In addition to at least two second line agents: 400mg moxifloxacin / clarithromycin daily . To be given daily for 6 months, followed by clofazimine + one second line drug for an additional 18 months . In cases where ofloxacin resistance is also present, a fluoroquinolone should not be used as part of second line treatment. The recommended regimen is clarithromycin, minocycline and clofazimine for 6 months, followed by clarithromycin or minocycline plus clofazimine for an additional 18 months (conditional recommendation, based on expert opinion) . Unable or refusal to take dapsone (adult). Dapsone can be replaced by 400mg moxifloxacin daily . Unable or refusal to take clofazimine (adult). Clofazimine can be replaced by: moxifloxacin 400mg daily OR minocycline 100mg daily . In cases where alternative or second line regimens include use of a fluoroquinolone, care should be taken to exclude active tuberculosis infection. For cases where second line therapy includes the use of fluoroquinolones, clarithromycin or minocycline, electrocardiographic monitoring should be performed due to the risk of QT -prolongation and associated cardiac arrhythmias. 6.7 Regimens for drug -resistant leprosy In the situation where single or multiple drug resistance is identified, expert opinion from an Infectious Diseases Physician at the WATB Control Program should be sought. Alternative regimens are outlined above in section 6.6. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 58 of 144 6.8 Adverse drug effects Dapsone Dapsone Hypersensitivity Syndrome is an uncommon but serious reaction that appears to occur at a higher incidence amongst Aboriginal people. It occurs most commonly between the 2 nd and 8th weeks of dapsone therapy and requires immediate cessation. Rechallenge is also contraindicated. improving, cease dapsone Dapsone Syndrome / Dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome Criteria proposed by Richardus and Smith20: 1. Presence of at least 2 of the following: fever, skin eruption, lymphadenopathy, liver abnormalities 2. Appearance of adverse events between the 2nd and 8th week after starting dapsone, which disappear on cessation of dapsone 3. Symptoms not attributed to any simultaneously used drugs or to lepra reaction 4. Symptoms not attributed to any other diseases Immediate cessation of dapsone: high mortality rate Prednisolone commencing at 1mg/kg daily, then weaning regimen for 4-6 weeks Supportive therapy Rifampicin Serious adverse effects are infrequently encountered with monthly administration, however respiratory distress with dyspnoea, fever, cough, and flu like symptoms, gastrointestinal upset, thrombocytopaenia, shock and acute renal failure can occur. Consultat ion with an Immunology service is strongly recommended. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 59 of 144 Clofazimine Adverse effect Features Treatment Skin discoloration Brownish -red discoloration of skin No treatment required, drug cessation if stigmatising Usually takes 6 -12 months to resolve following cessation Ichthyosis Violaceous brown lesions on extensor surfaces 10% urea cream and dermeze - apply topically to affected areas on alternate days Enteropathy (occurs with doses of >200mg for > 3 months Abdominal pain, subacute bowel obstruction Reduce dose of clofazimine 6.9 Special considerations 6.9.1 Pregnancy It is widely accepted that pregnancy can have an adverse effect on women with leprosy, however there is limited good quality data to support this, and there is little data from the MDT era. The changes in cell mediated and humoral immunity that occur dur ing pregnancy and in the post-partum period may have the following effects on the course of leprosy for women either on therapy or following completion of therapy: Increased risk of ENL in LL / BL patients . Increased risk of progression of infection towards the lepromatous end of the spectrum (new skin lesions, increase in BI, progressive NFI) . Increased risk of neuritis . Increased risk of relapse. Increased risk of Type 1 reaction (post -partum) . In addition, there appears to be an increas ed risk of presenting with leprosy during pregnancy or post -partum period because of the altered immunological state. It is important to note that pregnancy is safe for women who have completed effective MDT, however those affected by lepra reaction during treatment should be monitored with voluntary motor and sensory testing as well as nerve and skin examination three monthly during the antenatal period and at one month following delivery (see Appendix 1- 4). The WA BCG policy recommends that babies of p arents with leprosy or a family history of leprosy be offered BCG. This is best facilitated through ensuring documentation in the antenatal record for current and future pregnancies. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 60 of 144 Drug therapy of Leprosy during pregnancy Standard MDT should be continu ed throughout pregnancy and breast -feeding and is safe to be commenced if a new diagnosis of leprosy is made. Lepra reactions should be treated as per standard recommendations, however thalidomide is absolutely contraindicated. Effects of fed infants . Rifampicin: association with haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, prophylactic vitamin K for newborn. Clofazimine: temporary discoloration of foetal tuberculosis Patients with leprosy and active tuberculosis (TB) require full treatment for both conditions. Screening for tuberculosis should be done in all patients with newly diagnosed TB and vice versa. 6.9.3 Co -existent latent tuberculosis All patients with lepr osy should be screened for tuberculosis with a tuberculin skin test (TST) or Quantiferon Gold and chest X -Ray. If there is evidence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active disease has been excluded, latent infection can be opportunistically treated with daily rifampicin for four months, in addition to standard MDT. Alternatively, leprosy and LTBI can be treated sequentially. 6.9.4 Co -existent H uman Immunodeficiency Virus infection Despite the host immune response playing an important role in all aspects of leprosy infection, there is little evidence to suggest that Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has a significant impact on the course of disease. Similarly, it does not appear that leprosy has a significant impact on the course of HIV infect ion, unlike tuberculosis 21. HIV co -infection may be related to an increase in the frequency of lepra reactions, particularly in unstable borderline states, however the evidence from a small number of studies is conflicting22,23. A number of case reports have described an association between leprosy and Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome occurring following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with two main forms identified24: 1.

In light of the lack of evidence to support significant interaction between M.leprae and HIV, the following is recommended: Standard MDT should be given wi th no change in duration of therapy . Patients should be closely monitored for development of lepra reactions (particularly type 1 reaction) following institution of HAART . Reactional states should be treated without modification from routine guidelines , however prolonged courses of prednisolone may be required, even after completion of MDT . Leprosy should be suspected in a patient from a leprosy endemic area presenting with skin lesions or neurological symptoms shortly after HAART initiation. 6.9.5 Treatmen t interruption and default Poor adherence to leprosy therapy remains a significant problem in many endemic regions, with implications for both the individual, as well as for the success of disease control. Contributing factors: Socioeconomic disadvantage Cultural Geographic isolation Psychosocial Drug related Disease related Health service related Stigma WHO definitions for treatment default:25 Failure to complete 6 months of prescribed therapy within 9 months Failure to complete 12 months of prescribed therapy within 18 months . To incorporate the 24 month treatment duration recommended by WA TB Control Program for patients with BI 4+, this definition also includes: Failure to complete 24 months of prescribed therapy within 36 months Patien ts who fail to attend for a monthly dose of directly observed therapy (DOT) should be located immediately to facilitate early intervention and address factors that may be contributing to incomplete adherence. The management of treatment defaulters is often extremely challenging and resource intensive. The long duration of therapy for leprosy is a significant barrier for a number of patients, with little evidence to support the use of shorter or monthly regimens. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 62 of 144 Suggestions for managing poor adherence: Patients who have poor adherence related to a single drug in the MDT regimen can be changed to an alternative regimen as outlined in 6.6. Monthly supervised rifampicin, ofloxacin and minocycline (ROM) can be considered for persistent defaulters with PB (minimum 12 months) or in rare situations with MB leprosy (minimum 24 months), however every attempt should be made to re-establish the patient on daily therapy . Patients receiving ROM require careful long term follow up to detect relapse. 26,27 Methods to assess and improve adherence are discussed further in Chapter 8. 6.10 Retreatment 6.10.1 Definitions Retreatment case: a patient diagnosed with leprosy who has already received treatment for the disease in the past . Retreatment cases are further classified into the following groups28: (a) Retreatment after loss to follow -up: a patient diagnosed with leprosy who has abandoned treatment before its completion and returns to the health facility to complete treatment . (b) Relapse : a patient who has completed full treatment course for leprosy in the past and who returns with signs and symptoms of the disease that are not deemed due to a react ion according to the clinician . (c) Transferred in : a patient who has started treatment in one facility and reports t o another f acility to continue treatment . (d) Other retreatments: any leprosy case that does not fall in any of the above categories and requires treatment . 6.10.2 Differentiating relapse from reactional state Differentiating relapse from reactional state is often challenging. Features that can help to ensure the correct diagnosis is made are shown in Table 11. Factors predisposing an individual to relapse: Inadequate or irregular therapy . Dapsone monotherapy (pre MDT era) . BI risk of having persisting organisms: \"persisters\") . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 63 of 144 Table 11: Features of relapse and reactional state Clinical feature ENL Relapse Relationship to treatment Before, during, or after treatment After completion of therapy Onset Sudden Gradual Constitutional symptoms Often present Absent Clinical signs Tender, warm, erythematous superficial nodules, appear in crops Full thickness lesions, not warm or tender SSS Fragmented AFB BI>2+, solid staining AFB Clinical feature Type 1 reaction Relapse Relationship to treatment Before, during, or after treatment Usually > 1 year after completion of treatment Clinical signs erythema, swelling, tenderness of skin lesions Ulceration may occur in severe reactions Oedema of hands and feet Few new lesions may appear Acute painful neuritis which may be associated with motor or sensory loss Appearance of new skin lesions, non- tender, often satellite lesions Ulceration does not occur Rarely seen Many new lesions Neuritis may be present, but generally not acute SSS BI continues to fall Bacilli granulated in reactions BI may increase Response to prednisolone Prompt improvement in skin lesions and neuritis No or minimal response Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 64 of 144 6.10.3 Management of retreatment cases Retreatment after loss to follow up and transferred- in cases should be re- evaluated and treated according to guidelines . Drug resistance testing should be requested for all MB retreatment cases with BI>2+ (excluding transferred- in cases unless thought to b e at risk due to irregular treatment) o Procedure described in Chapter 5.2.6. Where the diagnosis of relapse is unclear and type 1 reaction suspected, a trial of prednisolone is warranted o Improvement in clinical signs within 2 weeks of commencing prednisolone is suggestive of lepra reaction. If drug resistance is detected, specialist advice should be obtained . Drug sensitive relapse and relapse where sensitivity testing is not possible (BI <2) or available should be reclassified and treated according to guidelines . Patients who have previously received either dapsone or clofazimine monotherapy should be retreated with MDT as per WA guidelines .

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 67 of 144 Chapter 7 Diagnosis and m anagement of neuritis and r eactional states 7.1 Diagnosis of neurit is and reactional states 7.1.1 Introduction Leprosy or lepra reactions occur as a result of immune mediated inflammation and can involve the skin, nerves, eyes, and body organs. Reactions and neuritis are a major cause of nerve damage and subsequent disability in leprosy. Urgent referral for assessment is required for a patient presenting with any of the following: Lepra reactions and acute neuritis can occur: before diagnosis or at the time of diagnosis (prompting presentation) . during treatment for leprosy . after completion of treatment . Principles of management: Early diagnosis . Prompt treatment . Referral for specialist advice. Close clinical follow up . Red, painful nodules with or without ulceration . Pain or tenderness in one or more nerves, with or without impairment of function . Any new nerve function impairment . Red, swolle n skin patch on the face or overlying a major nerve trunk High fever . Marked oedema of hands, feet or face. Pain and / or redness of the eye(s) with or without impaired vision. Painful swelling of joints or testes with fever . Mild reactions that have not responded to two weeks of anti - inflammatory treatment . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 68 of 144 7.1.2 Neuritis Neuritis is the inflammation of nerves. In leprosy it can manifest in the following ways: 1. Subacute , low-grade neuritis associated with disease . Acute, more severe neuritis associat ed with reactions . 3. Silent neuritis (nerve function impairment without symptoms) . 4. Neuropathic pain. Clinical features of neuritis: Nerve thickening. Nerve tenderness . Nerve pain o includes paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, allodynia. Nerve function impairment (NFI) o sensory o motor o autonomic. Secondary complications of NFI o deformity o trauma. Diagnosis of neuritis: Sensory impairment detected using graded monofilament testing (Appendix 2) o Monofilament threshold sensation increased by 1 or more levels at any one site. Motor impairment detected with voluntary muscle testing (VMT) using modified Medical Research Council (MRC) scale (Appendix 2) o Motor impairment present if VMT score for any muscle or group of muscles 4 on the modified MR C scale . o Reduction in MRC score for any muscle group. Eye signs o Reduced corneal sensation. o Weakness of orbicularis oris (lid closure) . 7.1.3 Type 1 Reaction 7.1.3.1 Clinical features Type 1 (reversal or upgrading) reactions (T1R) are Th1 mediated delayed hypersensitivity responses to M.leprae antigens, which cause a sudden increase in cell mediated immunity and a shift towards the polar tuberculoid end of the Ridley -Jopling leprosy spectrum. Type 1 reactions occur primarily in borderline leprosy (BT, BB and BL), affecting approximately 30% of cases 1. Inflammation involves the skin, nerves (neuritis), or in some cases both. Neuritis causes loss of sensory and muscle function, generally associated with Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 69 of 144 nerve pain, but in some cases without pain or nerve tenderness (silent neuritis). Skin inflammation can be disfiguring and painful but is less serious than neuritis. Type 1 reactions occur most commonly after starting treatment but can occur at any time in the course of infection. Type 1 reactions are usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings. There are no laboratory tests useful for the diagnosis of type 1 reactions in clinical practice. The C-Reactive Protein (CRP) may be elevated but is a non- specific marker. Skin biopsies can be useful if the diagnosis is uncertain, with skin specimens typically showing lymphocytic infiltration, extracellular oedema in and around destruction and nerve fibre ischemia . Risk factors for Type 1 Reaction Borderline group Previous lepra reaction Pregnancy and the post -partum period Starting treatment with MDT Extensive disease ( 3 body areas involved) Skin lesions overlying nerve trunks oFacial lesions are high risk for ocular NFI . Features of Type 1 Reaction Skin (changes in existing and new leprosy lesions) Pain Swelling Redness Warmth Necrosis and ulceration in severe cases . Nerves New sensory loss New muscle weakness Nerve pain or tenderness . General Oedema of hands, feet or face . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 70 of 144 Table 12: Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of type 1 reaction 2 * ENL = Erythema Nodosum Leprosum 7.1.3.2 Severity Index A severity score for type 1 reactions was developed and validated in 2008.3 While detailed and requiring skills in the assessment of VMT and use of monofilament testing, the scale is useful in the referral centre setting, and for research purposes. The severity scale is designed for assessment of NFI present for less than 6 months (see Appendix 1 1). Table 13: Grading scale for severity of type 1 reaction 7.1.4 Erythema Nodosum Leprosum 7.1.4.1 Clinical features ENL (Type 2 reaction) is a systemic inflammatory condition, which occurs in up to 50% of patients with lepromatous leprosy, and 5- 10% of patients with Borderline Lepromatous Leprosy (BL). 4,5 One major or at least two minor criteria (without signs of ENL *) required for the diagnosis of T1R Major 1.Pre-existing and/or new skin lesions become inflamed, red and swollen . Minor 1.One or more nerves become tender and may be swollen 2.Crops of new, painless lesions appear 3.Sudden oedema of face and extremities 4.Recent loss of sensation in hands and feet, or signs of recent nerve damage (loss of sweating, sensation, muscle strength) in an area supplied by a particular nerve. Mild Small number of inflamed skin lesions (excluding facial lesions) . No nerve pain or loss of nerve function. Severe Nerve pain or sensory change. Loss of nerve function. Fever . Peripheral or facial oedema. Inflammation of skin lesion on the face. Ulceration or necrosis of skin lesions . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 71 of 144 ENL can occur prior to, during, or following the completion of curative therapy for leprosy. Patients may experience a single episode of ENL or have recurrent episodes occurring over several years, with some developing chronic ENL. 6 While the exact cause of ENL i s unclear, it is associated with a complex array of immune activation resulting in inflammation at multiple body sites. Immune complex formation and deposition are thought to play a role, with IgG, IgM, complement and mycobacterial antigens identified in E NL skin lesions. Pro- inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor , interferon gamma, interleukin- 6, interleukin- 17 and interleukin- 1 may also be important in the pathogenesis of ENL. 7 The main risk factors for ENL are:8 lepromatous leprosy wi th skin infiltration bacterial index >4+ age less than 40 years . The diagnosis of ENL is based primarily on clinical findings. Skin biopsies may be useful in cases where the diagnosis is unclear. Clinical features of ENL: Sudden onset Crops of tender subcutaneous nodules Pre-existing leprosy skin lesions usually unchanged Fever Peripheral oedema Lymphadenopathy Neuritis (generally not as severe as in type 1 reactions) Pain, often bony in nature Joint swelling Dactylitis (swelling of fi ngers or toes) Eye inflammation (iridocyclitis) The clinical presentation can often mimic an acute infection, with high fever, leucocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. Renal dysfunction and liver dysfunction occur in some cases, generally indicating a more severe reaction. Clas sification of ENL : Acute : single episode lasting less than 24 weeks . Recurrent : occurrence of a second or subsequent episode of ENL 28 days or more after stopping treatment for initial episode. Chronic : episode occurring for 24 weeks or more during which a patient has required ENL treatment either continuously or where any treatment free period has been 27 days or less. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 72 of 144 ENL is often a severe illness that has a significant impact on the patient and their families. It is associated with increased mortality, 9 economic hardship10 and a negative impact on health- related quality of life.11 7.1.4.2 S everity Index Assessment of ENL severity is useful to guide appropriate treatment, predict prognosis and monitor progress. A 10-item severity score for ENL has recently been validated.12 In clinical practice, the score is helpful to determine the severit y of the reaction, monitor response to therapy, and in the research setting, to compare the effectiveness of various treatments. The severity scale and user guide are included in Appendix 12 . When using the ENL ENLIST Severity Scale, a score of 8 or less indicates mild ENL, and when comparing scores, the minimal important difference is 5. In situations where it is not practical to use the severity scale, a general classification into mild and severe ENL can be made according to the features outlined in Table 14 . Table 14: Features of mild and severe ENL Clinical feature Mild ENL Severe ENL Skin lesions Few, limited in distribution Multiple, red, painful nodules, widespread Ulceration / necrosis of skin lesions Absent May be present Fever, arthralgia Absent Present Neuritis Absent Present Peripheral oedema Mild Often marked, including face Eye involvement Absent May be present Lymphadenopathy Absent Often present Systemic inflammation (nephritis, epididymo- orchitis) Absent May be present 7.1.5 Lucio's Phenomenon Lucio's Phenomenon is an uncommon immunological reaction that occurs in diffuse non- nodular form of lepromatous leprosy, called Lucio's Leprosy. This form of leprosy has been associated with Mycobacterium lepromatosis and is only seen in certain populations, including Mexicans and Brazilians. It primarily occurs in patients who have not received treatment. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 73 of 144 Features include: appearance of irregular painful plaques which become haemorrhagic and subsequently evolve into necrotic ulcers . absence of fever (unl ike severe ENL) . ENL and Lucio's phenomenon are sometimes difficult to differentiate clinically and have been reported to occur simultaneously. 13 7.2 Treatment of neuritis and lepra reactions 7.2.1 Introduction Early identification and prompt treatment of reactions is one of the most important aspects of leprosy management. Lepra reactions can result in permanent deformity and disability, including blindness. If a lepra reaction or new NFI is suspected, urgent r eferral should be made through the WA TB Control Program for specialist review, and advice should be sought regarding immediate management. Early diagnosis can be facilitated by: educating patients, their families and health care workers about the early signs and symptoms of reactions, and the need for urgent medical review . monthly clinical review, including neurological examination, of patients while on therapy, and following completion of therapy for those at higher risk of lepra reaction. ensuring systems designed to maintain good communication between regional / remote and referral centres . Principles of management of lepra reactions: early diagnosis and prompt treatment multi drug therapy (MDT) should be continued or initiated (in those who first present with a T1R) anti-inflammatory therapy should be commenced at a dose to reduce inflammation rapidly, then gradually tapered down adequate analgesia physical therapy including rest and splinting where required close monitoring of neurologic al function. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 74 of 144 7.2.2 Type 1 Reaction and acute neuritis 7.2.2.1 Treatment of mild type 1 r eaction Mild T1R is characterized by erythema, pain and tenderness in a few of the existing skin lesions. Nerve symptoms are absent. Analgesia (aspirin or paracetamol) for 2- 3 weeks . Fortnightly review until resolved. Escalation of treatment if reaction becomes severe or symptoms / signs of nerve involvement appear . 7.2.2.2 Treatment of severe T1R and acute neuritis (<6 months duration NFI) Severe T1R is characterized by one or more of the following: inflammation of multiple existing skin lesions and appearance of new lesions nerve pain, tenderness, paraesthesia, loss of nerve function fever , arthralgia ulceration of skin lesions oedema of hands and/or feet . Patients may present with symptoms of type 1 reaction, acute neuritis or recent (<6 months old) NFI at the time of diagnosis. These patients should be commenced on MDT and treated according to the guideline below. Despite a paucity of high quality evide nce to guide treatment for t ype 1 reaction and acute neuritis, it is generally accepted that prednisolone should be the cornerstone of therapy 14. Prednisolone reduces inflammation of skin and nerves and helps to improve pain and nerve function. Optimal d osing and duration have not yet been established, with guidelines varying between institutions. An individualised approach based on careful and frequent assessment of neurological function using VMT -ST is ideal. The recommendati on is for patients with severe t ype 1 reaction to be reviewed fortnightly until symptoms of acute neuritis have improved. VMT -ST should be performed and recorded at each visit. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 75 of 144 7.2.2. 3 Assessment, therapy and monitoring of patients prescribed long t erm prednisolone Baseline Weight, height, BMI Blood pressure TST/QFN and CXR exclude LTBI or active TB specimen Treat active infection (osteomyelitis, cellulitis, scabies) Random blood glucose level HIV and Hepatitis B serology Melioid serology if clinically indicated Lipid profile FBC, Calcium, Vitamin D BMD assessment Serum testosterone, LH and FSH in men with LL and clinical suspicion of hypogonadism (recurrent ENL) Visual acuity, obtain history for personal or family history of open angle glaucoma Commence H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection Osteoporosis prevention with calcium and vitamin D supplementation if required Subsequent monitoring Measure BP and weight at each visit Assess lipids one month after initiation of prednisolone then every 6- 12 months Measure blood glucose level 2 weeks after commencing prednisolone, then 3- 6 monthly for first year and annually thereafter . Refer to Endocrinology if abnormal blood glucose levels. Ophthalmology referral for those with symptoms of cataract, diabetes mellitus , personal or family history of glaucoma, BMD one year post initiation of prednisolone, then frequency as guided by result s. Consider referral to Endocrinology if BMD is decreasing BMI = Body TB = tuberculosis; HIV Human immunodeficiency virus; FBC full blood leprosum; BP = blood pres sure Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 76 of 144 7.2.2. 4 Prednisolone regimen Table 15: Suggested regimen for treatment of severe type 1 reaction in a patient weighing 50kg Week number Prednisolone dose (daily) Alternate regimen to reduce pill burden 1-2 50mg 3 45mg 1.5 x 25mg tablet + 1 x 5mg tablet = 42.5mg 4 40mg 1.5 x 25mg tablet = 37.5mg 5 35mg 1.5 x 25 regimen, it is important to note the following: Patients must be assessed prior to commencing prednisolone and monitored closely for adverse events . Prednisolone should be commenced at 1mg/kg. If symptoms or NFI fail to improve after 2 weeks the dose should be increased. For less severe reactions, a starting dose of 40mg may be adequate. Once symptoms are controlled and NFI improves, begin reducing the dose of prednisolone by approximately 5mg every 1 - 2 weeks until 20mg is reached. If symptoms recur or NFI worsens, the dose should be increased to the level at which symptoms were contro lled, and maintained at this level for a minimum of 2 weeks before reattempting dose reduction. Once the dose of 20mg is reached, this dose should be continued for at least 4 weeks or until symptoms have resolved and NFI is stable or optimally improved. Further tapering should then occur with dose reduction of 5mg every 2 weeks . A proportion of patients may not respond to prednisolone therapy . Improvement in nerve function with prednisolone is more likely to occur when NFI has been present for < 6 months . 15 Evidence from a small number of randomised studies suggests that a 5 month course of prednisolone is as effective as an 8 month course and associated with better outcomes compared with a 3 months course 16. Despite this, some patients will require prolonged courses of therapy, particularly patients with BL or Borderline Borderline (BB) leprosy . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 77 of 144 While there does not appear to be a benefit of giving higher doses of prednisolone17, in some circumstances, higher doses may be required to control inflamm ation, particularly in patients with a higher body weight. Recurrence of type 1 reaction or acute neuritis following completion of prednisolone treatment should be retreated as per the suggested guideline. Supplementary doses of prednisolone or steroid may be required in the event of illness or surgery, either during or for up to 12 months after completion of a prolonged course of prednisolone. The patient should be made aware of this and an alert placed on their medical record. Live vaccines should be avoi ded whilst on high dose prednisolone (40mg / day) and for 3 months after cessation. Prednisolone should be given in the morning to minimise suppression of the adrenal axis. 7.2.2.5 Alternative agents A proportion of patients, particularly those with severe Type 1 reaction or BL leprosy, will fail to respond to prednisolone, or require prolonged periods at high doses. A number of studies have been conducted to examine the role of alternative immunosuppressive agents including azathioprine 18, cyclosporine A19and methotrexate20 in the treatment of type 1 reaction. While there is no evidence to support the first line use of these agents, they may be considered in certain cases where the patient is failing to respond to prednisolone, or as a steroid sparing agent in patients with significant adverse effects. Specialist advice should be sought from the ACC in these circumstances. 7.2.2.6 Non -pharmacological therapy In addition to prednisolone, patients with severe type 1 reaction may require analgesia and splinting of the affected limb(s). 7.2.2.7 Surgical therapy Surgical therapy for Type 1 reactions includes decompression of affected nerves by incision of the epineurium and / or opening of the fibro -osseous tunnel through which the affected nerve travels. Whi le the available evidence is limited and of poor quality, there does not appear to be any enhanced benefit of surgery over prednisolone for patients with Type 1 reaction 21. Surgical therapy should therefore be reserved for patients with nerve abscesses, or in very select and rare cases where the patient suffers intractable severe pain despite maximal immunosuppressive therapy. Such cases should be discussed with the specialists at WA TB Control Program prior to surgical referral. 7.2.3 Treatment of Erythem a Nodosum Leprosum Treatment for ENL aims to resolve skin lesions, relieve pain, as well as reduce and prevent complications by reducing systemic and neural inflammation. Corticosteroids, clofazimine, and thalidomide, either alone or in combination, are t he drugs most commonly used to treat ENL. Recent data from small case series and a single centre Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 78 of 144 pilot study, as well as local experience support the use of apremilast as an alternative to thalidomide in both chronic and recurrent ENL 22, 23. Due to the t endency for ENL to become recurrent or chronic, treatment is often prolonged, requiring many months to years of therapy. I t is preferable to initiate steroid sparing agents early to induce faster remission, avoid the side effects of prolonged steroid ther apy and reduce chance of recurrence. It is important to note that at present there is not a therapeutic regimen demonstrated to be reliably effective, and extended use of currently recommended agents is often complicated by serious side- effects. There is limited high quality clinical data to guide drug choice, dosing and duration, with recommendations based on a small number of randomised studies and expert opinion. Two open- label randomised studies comparing treatment options for ENL provide evidence to support the use of thalidomide for both acute and chronic/recurrent forms of ENL. An open- label randomised study performed in India showed that significantly greater clinical improvement was achieved in patients with acute ENL with a 20- week reducing schedule of thalidomide compared with a 20- week reducing schedule of prednisolone, and in patients with chronic / recurrent ENL, with a combination of prednisolone and thalidomide compared with a combination of prednisolone and clofazimine. In addition, thali domide appears to act as a steroid sparing agent, with reduced total prednisolone requirements 24. An earlier open- label randomised study, also performed in India, compared the efficacy of thalidomide with prednisolone for moderate to severe ENL25. Result s of the study showed that clinical response was significantly faster with thalidomide, with cutaneous lesions resolving in a mean of 5.54 days compared with 13.25 days in the prednisolone group, and constitutional symptoms resolving in a mean of 2.04 days vs 4.37 days. The period of remission was significantly longer, and number of relapses significantly lower in the thalidomide group. Importantly, adverse events were more common in the prednisolone group, with somnolence being the most common side effect of thalidomide. There is a need for high quality randomised studies using validated severity scoring to determine optimal treatment for ENL, and to assess in more detail adverse effects associated with thalidomide. Research aimed at identifying other agents for ENL is essential, to provide treatment options for patients in regions where thalidomide is unaffordable, intolerable, unavailable or highly restricted. Suspicion of ENL should prompt immediate referral for specialist review. Features of ENL impacting on therapy: Neuritis and NFI occur less commonly in ENL compared with type 1 reaction. ENL has a greater tendency to recur or become chronic compared with type 1 reaction, placing the patient at risk of steroid dependency and high cumulative steroid doses . 7.2.3.1 Treatment of mild ENL, not associated with neuritis or NFI: Bed rest. Aspirin Prednisolone should be commenced if there is no improvement within two weeks . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 79 of 144 7.2.3.2 Treatment of moderate - severe acute ENL associated with neuritis or NFI (<6 months): If acute neuritis or NFI < 6 months duration present, commence prednisolone at 1mg/kg and reduce as per recommendation outlined for ty pe 1 and acute neuritis outlined above . If no symptoms of neuritis, commence prednisolone at 1mg/kg and reduce by 5-10mg every 1- 2 weeks o Shorter courses of prednisolone are preferred for ENL to prolonged courses and steroid dependency in light of the tendency for the condition to recur or become chronic . If symptoms of ENL (excluding neuritis) fail to resolve within 2- 4 weeks, seek specialist advice and consider adding thalidomide (see below for guidelines and precautions) . Thalidomide can be considered as first line therapy for severe ENL. If eye symptoms are present, urgent ophthalmology review must be arranged . If ENL becomes chronic, consider adding extra clofazimine and seek specialist advice (see below for guidelines and precautions) . 7.2.3.3 Thalido mide: Mechanism of action and indications: Exact mode of action unclear, however reduction in TNF appears to be important in treating ENL. Very effective in controlling skin lesions and fever associated with acute ENL and preventing recurrences . Rapid onset of action, within 48- 72 hours . Indicated for acute treatment of moderate to severe ENL, maintenance therapy and suppression of ENL recurrences . If neuritis is present, thalidomide needs to be used in combination with prednisolone. Prescribing requirements: Available through a restricted distribution program similar to the United States FDA System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (STEPS programme) https://www.iac cesscelgene.com/Prescriber/Register . Treatment must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a specialist in the management of leprosy experienced in the treatment of ENL. Informed patient consent must be obtained prior to prescribing. Adverse effects: Common: drowsiness, somnolence and sedation (care with driving and operating heavy machinery) . Peripheral neuropathy (baseline and 6 monthly nerve conduction studies recommended for use > 6 months) . Development of peripheral neuropathy requires drug cessation except in rare cases of severe ENL where alternative options are not appropriate. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 80 of 144 Thrombogenicity (thromboprophylaxis recommended for patients with additional thrombotic risk factors) . Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to thalidomide or its components . Age < 12 years . Pregnancy or breastfeeding . Patients unable or unwilling to comply with adequate contraceptive measures to prevent pregnancy . Precautions and contraceptive requirements: Risk of teratogenicity requires extreme caution with prescribing, particularly for women of childbearing potential . Contraception must be continued for one month after stopping thalidomide. Women of childbearing potential must take two forms of contraception, receive detailed co unselling and have monthly medically supervised pregnancy test Dosing: Optimal dosing schedule for thalidomide has not been established. Suggested regimen for severe ENL is outlined in Figure 7. Lower starting doses (eg.100mg nocte) can be used for less severe ENL. Figure 7.

May help to facilitate dose reduction of corticosteroids in chronic ENL . Increase clofazimine to 300mg daily for one month (maximum of 3 months) . Allow 4 -6 weeks for any beneficial effect to be apparent . Reduce to 200mg daily for 3- 6 months, then 100mg daily until completion of MDT . High doses of clofazimine are associated with gastrointestinal side effects, skin discoloration and ichthyosis . Abdominal symptoms in a patient on high dose clofazimine should be investigated promptly . 7.2.3.5 Apremilast dosing over effects mild and usually transient, including diarrhoea, nausea, headache, depression. 7.2.3.6 Alternative agents for ENL: In patients in whom prednisolone, clofazimine or thalidomide are either ineffective or contraindicated, specialist advice should be sought. Agents including azathioprine, methotrexate, TNF inhibitors (including infliximab and etanercept), pentoxifylline, cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil and oral zinc can be considered. 7.2.4 Treatment of Lucio's Phenomenon Patients with Lucio's Phenomenon usually respond well to the initiation of MDT. In the uncommon situation where it occurs after commencing MDT, prednisolone can be commenced and tapered as per the schedule out lined for Type 1 reaction. (see Table 15). Thalidomide is not effective.

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 84 of 144 Chapter 8 Prevention and management of disability 8.1 Introduction Despite widespread use of multi- drug therapy (MDT) and a fall in the prevalence of leprosy, global rates of Grade 2 disability (G2D) among new cases of leprosy have remained largely static. In some regions, including South East Asia, rates of G2D among new diagnoses have increased.1 In Western Australia, the current rate of G2D amongst new cases of leprosy is greater than 50%, well above the WHO target of less than 5%. Historical data is not available to allow assessment of trends. The current WHO global s trategy identifies reducing leprosy related disability as one of its key focus areas, with global targets for a 90% reduction in rate per million population of new cases with G2D and a 90% reduction in rate per million children of new child cases with leprosy by 2030.2 The G2D rate among new cases is an important indicator of the efficiency of early detection of leprosy, as well as an indirect marker of community awareness of the early signs of leprosy and expertise of healthcare workers in leprosy diagnosi s. Leprosy related disability is caused primarily by nerve damage, which can occur before, during or after completion of curative MDT. Nerve damage resulting in sensory, motor or autonomic deficits predisposes the patient to injury with development of secondary impairments including ulcers, shortening of digits, contractures, bone destruction, and visual loss. Disability results when these impairments make it difficult for a person to carry out their activities of daily living. Disability can lead to stigma and discrimination and has a negative impact on quality of life. Prevention of disability (POD) can be defined as \"a concept comprising all activities at an individual, community and program level, aimed at preventing impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions\". 3 The success of POD is reliant on interplay between personal attitudes and circumstances, and provision of medical care in the form of pharmacological and physical therapies.4 The goals of preventi on of disability are to: 1. prevent the development of any disability or deformity not present at the time of diagnosis . 2. prevent the progression of disability or deformity . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 85 of 144 8.2 Early detection and treatment Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of early leprosy is often extremely challenging. A high degree of suspicion is required, as well as awareness of the early symptoms and signs amongst communities and health care workers. In areas of low endem icity with disease affecting primarily vulnerable populations such as in Western Australia, the foll owing activities are recommended 5: 1. Targeted education of health care workers involved in the care of affected populations a. Focus on early symptoms and signs which may raise suspicion b. Information regarding referral pathways . 2. Education of index cases and affected communities a. Simple educational material b. Community awareness campaigns . 3. Integration of screening for leprosy (skin c heck) into school health check s for Aboriginal children. 4. Comprehensive c ontact tracing of household and community members of diagnosed cases. 5. Optimise treatment adherence through a. Patient centred approach b. Case holding: supervision of treatment until compliance is established, then monthly directly observed therapy c. Ensuring uninterrupted drug supply . 6. Maintaining up to date knowledge and support of developing innovative methods of early diagnosis of leprosy . The components required to achieve these goals include: 1. early detection and treatment of leprosy before nerve damage has occurred 2. accurate assessment of disability at the time of diagnosis and at subsequent assessment 3. early detection and treatment of leprosy reactions 4. education and support to encourage self -care of h ands, feet and eyes 5. access to a multidisciplinary team including podiatry, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and surgery 6. ongoing surveillance of patients at high risk of progression of disability following completion of MDT . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 86 of 144 8.3 Accurate assessment of disability at the time of diagnosis and at subsequent assessment Grading disability in leprosy is important for assessing program efficiency, as well as for assessing changes in impairment in an individual patient over time. Three grading systems are currently in use, the WHO disability grade, the Eye- Hand -Foot (EHF) score (See 5.4.5) and the Impairment Summary Form (ISF)6 (Appendix 7). See Chapter 5.4.5 for further detailed information on these scoring systems. It is importa nt to identify patients with Grade 1 disability ( G1D), mainly sensory impairment , and institute measures for POD including education on self -care, provision of adequate footwear and referral for ongoing multidisciplinary care coordinated by the case manager. Patients with G1D and G2D require lifelong care to prevent progression of their disability. 8.4 Early detection and treatment of leprosy reactions and acute neuritis Leprosy reactions and acute neuritis are the most important case of nerve damage and subsequent disability and deformity. Approximately 10- 30% of all leprosy patients will experience a lepra reaction either before, during, or after completion of MDT. Prednisolone is effective in 50- 70% of cases where nerve damage has been present for less than 6 months however optimal dose and duration have not been clearly defined. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of reactional states reduces the risk of permanent nerve damage 7. The following measures are suggested to optimise early detection and tre atment among cases of Leprosy : 1. Patient education: At the time of diagnosis and treatment completion, educate the patient regarding the signs and symptoms of reactions, and the need to present promptly for review . 2. Regular nerve function assessment using VMT -ST (ideally monthly), particularly for high risk patients including a. patients with existing nerve function impairment b. post-partum women c. patients with multibacillary leprosy . 3. Robust referral systems with urgent referral required in situations where lepra reaction is suspected. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 87 of 144 8.5 Self -care In many cases, leprosy becomes a chronic condition, with peripheral neuropathies predisposing the patient to secondary impairments and subsequent disability and deformity. Self-care is central to the management of chronic conditions, as outlined in the WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) framework 8. The framework is based on achieving optimal outcomes through a healthcar e triad, illustrated in Figure 8. The concept of patient -centred care is increasingly being recognised as a core principle of management of chronic disease. The emphasis is on the central role of the patient in the management of their condition, assuming responsibility for their own health outcomes, rather than being a passive recipient. Self-care is important for all patients with leprosy, particularly those with any degree of nerve damage, and those at risk of lepra reaction. Patients and their families should be taught self -care practi ces to prevent disability, with a focus on developing problem solving ability, and ongoing partnership between healt hcare teams and the community. The principles of hand and foot care include 9: Inspection o Daily inspection of both hands and feet Looking for wounds and cracks Areas of redness or swelling. o Daily inspection of footwear 8 Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 88 of 144 Foreign bodies Damage to footwear . Soaking, scraping and moisturizing o To prevent development of callus, cracks and subsequent ulceration . o Soak daily in clean water for 30 minutes . o After soaking, scrape dry skin away . o Follow with an oil based moisturisers or Vaseline. Exercises (active and passive) to maintain joint mobility and strengthen weak muscles o In consultation with physiotherapy/hand therapist . o Audio- visual aids can be used to teach patients . Protection from injury o Education regarding appropriate footwear Sports shoes Sandals with heel strap, preferably velcro Firm undersole and soft insole Custom made footwear . o Aids to avoid injury In consultation with occupational therapy . Devices to assist with cooking . Splints . The principles of eye care include: Lagoph thalmos o Acute lagophthalmos should be treated as a lepra reaction. o Wear glasses and a hat . o Keep the eye clean and moist Daily inspection and washing with a clean cloth Lubricating eye drops . o Check vision daily by looking at the same fixed object 6 metres away . o Daily exercises Try to close the eyes with force daily . Passive exercise required for complete paralysis of orbicularis oris. o Surgical assessment is required for chronic lagophthalmos . Corneal anaesthesia o \"Think blink\" Encourage the patient to force themselves to blink frequently, can be prompted by seeing a common object, such as a certain tree or household applianc e. o Daily lubricating eye drops . o Wear glasses and a hat . The booklet \"I can do it myself!\" produced by the WHO is a useful resource to help educate and empower patients affected by leprosy to embrace self -care. http://english.aifo.it/leprosy/documents/selfcarebooklet -who07.pdf Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 89 of 144 8.6 Access to a multidisciplinary team Leprosy patients, especially those who suffer lepra reactions and tho se with permanent NFI, frequently require a multidisciplinary approach to their care. Services including podiatry, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, ophthalmology and surgery can provide preventative and therapeutic management. All patients with any degree of nerve damage involving the feet should be taught self-care of their feet and referred to either a local podiatrist or to the Podiatry service at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH ). Telehealth is available for remote patients who cannot attend the RPH clinic . Patients with a facial patch or any degree of eye involvement should be referred to an ophthalmologist for initial assessment and ongoing review. Referral should be facili tated through the WA TB Control Program physician and case manager. Where consultation at RPH is not feasible, alternative arrangements for review by visiting podiatrists and specialists should be made. Communication between involved parties is extremely i mportant, and can be facilitated by email, telehealth and multidisciplinary meetings. 8.6.1 Reconstructive surgery The aim of reconstructive surgery is to restore form and function. Indications for surgical referral include: Deformity (secondary impair ment) present for > 12 months o Claw hand o Chronic foot ulceration o Lagophthalmos o Foot drop. Patient not currently receiving prednisolone. No active neuritis or lepra reaction. Patient motivated and committed to pre and post -operative physiotherapy . 8.7 Ongoing surveillance Patients at high risk of progression of disability require ongoing surveillance and care following completion of MDT . The following patients are at high risk of progression of disability following completion of MDT . 10,11 Patients with existing nerve function injury . Patients with MB disease. Women of childbearing age (post -partum risk) . Patients who have had lepra reactions or neuritis . These patients require a patient -centred chronic disease approach to thei r management, with ongoing self -care, multidisciplinary team involvement and surveillance.

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 91 of 144 Chapter 9 Case Management 9.1 Introduction Case management is a form of healthcare deliver y in which a management plan is individualised for the patient according to their personal circumstances and developed by a multidisciplinary team to achieve a specific and measurable outcome. Case management is central to the success of the W A TB Control Program's management of leprosy. 1 This is the nurse- led, individual patient -based activity that ensures that treatment is adhered to and completed satisfactorily, and that contacts are identified and screened. In the treatment of leprosy, it is never enough to prescribe the correct drug therapy alone. The prescription must always be accompanied by case management. Rationale Cure of leprosy requires medication to be taken for an extended period of time. Adherence with prescribed drug regimens can be further hampered by the perceived stigma associated with the diagnosis, language and cultural barriers, social stressors, competing work demands, and potential for side effects related to the medication. Patients left to take treatment unsupervised are at risk of having difficulty adhering to the treatment regime. Complications from leprosy, as well as the medication used to treat the disease, can occur at any time throughout the treatment process. Patients require considerable support and care during the treatment period, provided by the case manager in collaboration with the treating physician. Case management ensures early detection of lepra reactions and acute neuritis, facilitating early treatment with the aim of minimising permanent deformity and disability. Contact tracing, a secondary component of case management, aims to interrupt leprosy transmission by early identification of s econdary cases and provision of chemoprophylaxis for eligible contacts . Regular screening of contacts and institution of therapy for newly diagnosed active cases aims to reduce the overall burden of leprosy and leprosy related disability at diagnosis. All patients undergoing treatm ent for leprosy in Western Australia are assigned a case manager from the WA TB Control Program based at the Anita Clayton Centre (ACC) , Perth. This includes patients diagnosed and treated for leprosy by both private and public physicians outside the WA T B Control Program. The case manager is allocated according to the index case's home address and pre-defined regions assigned by the program. This allocation can be altered at the case manager's discretion and by agreement. For patients located outside metropolitan Perth, a local case worker will be assigned with coordination and care delivered as outlined in the Memorandum of Agreement between WA Country Health Service (WACHS) and the WA TB Control Program. 1 The case manager works closely with medical s taff and other professionals involved with the care of the patient to support the patient to completion of his or her leprosy treatment. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 92 of 144 9.2 Components of case management Case management in leprosy involves a range of activities commencing from the ident ification of the leprosy patient, thr ough to contact tracing, assessment and education of patients early after the diagnosis, support and care coordination during the treatment period and case review once treatment is completed. The components of case management include . 2 1. Case detection including contact tracing investigation. 2. Assessment . 3. Care planning . 4. Care coordination a. Medication management including D irectly Observed Therapy (DOT) b. Self-care support c. Advocacy and negotiation d. Psychosocial support e. Monit oring and review . 5. Case review and ongoing follow up at completion of treatment . 9.3 Case detection Case detection is the early identification of patients with leprosy, to ensure that treatment and control activities can be initiated as soon as possible. This may involve: liaison , networking and communication with both hospital -based and private. pract itioners to ensure the early identification of patients suspected of having leprosy coordination of contact tracing (See Chapter 11 ). 9.4 Assessment The assessment phase involves the gathering of information about the patient's disease and social circumst ances to assist with the planning of leprosy treatment. Information may be gathered from a variety of sources including the patient, other health care providers, community -based agencies, and other government departments e.g. housing and schools. Assessme nt should be initiated as early as possible after diagnosis. It may take place at the first clinic appointment or at the first home visit by the case manager. Prior to the first home visit a risk assessment must be undertaken and a mutually suitable time t o visit the patient at their home confirmed. During the assessment phase the case manager should aim to: complete Nursing Assessment: identifying demographic and medical history on relevant database. collect and record surveillance data as a requirement for statutory medical notifications . obtain or review previous medical history . identify household and close contacts to guide contact tracing activity .. evaluate the patient's knowledge and beliefs about leprosy assess any leprosy medication that has been prescribed. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 93 of 144 identify any barriers to treatment adherence e .g. difficulty swallowing tablets, transportation problems to attend appointments, issues that may require directly observed therapy develop an understanding of the patient's social c ircumstances that may impact on completion of treatment i .e. living arrangements, housing issues, employment, education, residency status, travel plans, welfare issues, cultural background and presence of any drug or alcohol misuse . Patient assessment should continue throughout the treatment period in order to detect any changes in the patient's circumstances that might affect treatment compliance. 9.5 Care planning The patient's care plan is pivotal to case management and should be developed with consider ation to the individual's personal circumstances , their health needs and service provision. The plan should be developed in consultation with the patient and their medical team. The care plan will change according to the patient's individual situation and clinical progress. Care planning should be an ongoing process throughout the treatment period and should include the commencement of the contact tracing investigation, monitoring of drug therapy, regular medical review and assessment of adherence. 9.5.1 Ca se management meeting A case management meeting is held at least monthly, to plan and review the care of active leprosy cases. The purpose is to document new cases, discuss issues that may be a barrier to successful treatment, discuss the extent of contact tracing, address problems which arise, provide a forum for peer review, and ensure that critical outcomes are achieved. For patients being cared for outside metropolitan Perth, case meetings are held 4- 6 weekly via videoconference. Case histories are coll ated by the assigned case managers on a shared spreadsheet, with new cases added at the time of diagnosis. All new notifications in the interval since the last meeting are discussed, in addition to any case with adherence issues , lost to follow up, transfe rred out of WA or completing treatment. A summary of case discussion and any proposed changes to management should be documented in the patient's record and communicated with their care providers. This is particularly important for patients managed outsi de metropolitan Perth and for those cared for by Physicians outside the WA TB Control Program. Attendance at the meeting is open, but it is primarily for the WA TB Control Program physicians and case managers. The meeting is chaired by the Clinical Nurse Manager (or Medical Director of TB in her / his absence) but is an open forum format with decision making by discussion and consensus. Videoconference case meetings with WACHS organisations are attended by a WA TB Control Program Physician, the WA TB Contr ol Program WACHS case manager, relevant local case workers, a member of the relevant Regional Physician team, a representative from KPHU and the regional leprosy nurse specialist. Other involved health care providers attend where required. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 94 of 144 9.6 Care coordination The case manager should act as the central point of contact for the patient for the duration of their treatment. The case manager is the coordinator of care and primary source of support for the patient and should be in continuous communication with the patient throughout the treatment duration, via telephone, home visits or clinic attendances. Care coordination for leprosy can be structured as follows: Diagnostic assessment o Initial medical assessment and completion o f relevant investigations Start of Treatment : Clinic visit o Seen by physician and case manager o Begin discussions on contact tracing o Supply one month's medication One week : Home visit o Assess environment o Complete management plan o Assess medication related is sues Two weeks : Clinic visit o Physician and case manager o Clinical review o Assess medication adherence Three weeks: Home visit o Assess medication adherence Four weeks: Clinic visit o Physician and case manager o Clinical review o Supply one month's medication o Assess medication adherence Monthly review: Clinic visit o Physician and case manager o Clinical review o Supply one month's medication o Assess medication adherence Fortnightly or more frequent review may be required in the following circumstances: o Issues with adherence o Management of lepra reaction or acute neuritis o In the setting of adverse drug reaction or coexisting illness Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 95 of 144 9.6.1 Medication management An essential part of successful leprosy treatment is the completion of prolonged antibiotic therapy. In addition, patients who experience lepra reactions require close supervision of prednisolone and other medication. Important roles of the c ase manager include monitor ing patient adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, supporting the patient through medication side- effects, recognising lepra reactions, and identifying and address ing promptly any barriers to medication compliance. The treatment should be directly observed on the firs t day of the monthly prescription, and either self -administered or directly observed at various intervals as required for the remainder of the monthly schedule. The case manager should work closely with the medical team to ensure that the medication is bei ng taken according to the prescription, and to ensure optimal adherence. Case managers are responsible for ensuring that patients have an adequate supply of medication. This includes patients living in rural and remote areas. In rare instances where patients with leprosy are managed by Physicians without consultation with the WA TB Control Program, medication and case management can still be provided through the WATBCP. These patients must have a medication chart at the WA TB Control Program . 9.6.1.2 N on-adherence and directly observed therapy (DOT) Case managers must encourage adherence thorough education outlining the indication for and importance of treatment, management of adverse effects, the use of dosette boxes or Webster packing as required and ensuring a regular supply of medication. Adherence should be checked regularly by direct questioning of patients, pill counts, and rapid contact whenever a patient does not attend planned appointments. If there is evidence of non-adherence it should be dis cussed with the treating physician as soon as possible, and a plan made between the case manager and physician for enhanced monitoring, formulation of timelines for tolerance of incomplete adherence and measures to be taken if this threshold is reached. Direct observation of the patient taking the first dose of monthly therapy is a requirement of leprosy treatment in WA. DOT may be recommended more frequently in the following circumstances: Demonstrated poor adherence that jeopardises successful leprosy treatment Relapsed leprosy where non- adherence is suspected All hospital inpatients (while in hospital) All patients within correctional services Any other patient where the case manager considers there to be a high risk of non- adherence . DOT involves ob serving the patient swallowing every dose of treatment. The process should be explained to patients at the start of leprosy treatment, and the value of DOT should be reinforced by the treating physician and the case manager. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 96 of 144 DOT is established and managed by the case managers at the WA TB Control Program. DOT is most commonly provided by the case manager, but with consent from the patient, can be provided by a community nurse or service, local doctor, local pharmacist, correctional staff or hospital sta ff. The external DOT providers should be given information and instruction on DOT and a Directly Observed Therapy Log sheet . The DOT Log sheet can be found at https://healthpoint.hdwa.health.wa.gov.au/policies/Policies/NMAHS/Public%20Health/WAT BCP.Directly%20Observed%20Therapy%20Log.pdf and is reproduced in Appendix 13 . The log should be returned to the service on a monthly basis. It is not recommended that family members observe therapy as they are not typically neutral or objective about the patient's health. DOT can be arranged for any location convenient and safe to the patient and the provider. Community based DOT can be provided more efficiently by establishing partnerships with services based in the community. When a patient refuses treatment and cannot be managed by routine case management or DOT, there is prov ision in the Public Health Act 2016 Part 9: Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Related Conditions; 3 to enforce a test order or public health order. The provisions for doing this are extremely limited, and the situation should be discussed with the Medical Director of the TB Control Program. All socially and culturally appropriate avenues to assist with adherence should be exhausted before considering further action. Incentives and enablers may assist with adherence. Incentives are small, non- monetary rewa rds given to patients to encourage them to take their medications or attend appointments. Enablers can assist clients to take treatment and attend appointments by overcoming barriers such as transportation issues. Incentives and enablers can be provided after consultation with the Clinical Nurs e Manager. 9.6.2 Self -care support The level of support offered to leprosy patients by their case manager will vary according to the complexity of the disease and needs of the individual. While patients are supported to manage their own condition, the case manager may: ensure the patient has a good understanding of his or her condition and provide continuous education regarding leprosy and its treatment . provide and/or make referrals for general health education and advice e.g., diet, exercise, smoking cessation. provide and/or make referrals for advice on health conditions occurring as a complication of leprosy or specific to the patient's circumstances e.g., podiatry, ophthalmology, physiotherapy, ensuring general practitioner involvement for management of diabetes . provide education on navigating the healthcare system and services to contact regarding non- urgent issue. 9.6.3 Advocacy and negotiation A key role in case- management is advocating for and negotiating on behalf of the patient for access to services and needs identified in the care plan. This may involve liaising with Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 97 of 144 other government departments e.g., housing, social security , liaising with employers on behalf of the patient; ensuring the patient is aware of and attends appointments for referrals made to other providers; providing education for the patient's family and friends regarding leprosy and its treatment. The case manager plays an important role in keeping the treating P hysician informed of the patient's condition and treatment. The case manager should ensure that the Physician is aware of any difficulties or compliance issues and assist with explaining the Physician's recommendations to the patient. For patients treated in regional areas, the WA TB Control Program case manager has a responsibility to communicate weekly with the local case manager regarding patient progress and medication adherence. Documentation of cli nical information should be made both at the WA TB Control Program and in the local record. 9.6.4 Psychosocial support The leprosy case manager has the most contact with the patient and should remain with the patient from time of diagnosis until discharge from the program. The case manager should provide continuity of care throughout the treatment duration , either directly or through the local case worker for non- metropolitan patients . This regular contact ensures support for the patient and promotes completion of therapy. Being diagnosed with leprosy and the social stigma associated with the diagnosis can be a source of great distress for the patient, and the case manager has an important role to help them through this difficult time. The aim of case management beyond the successful treatment of leprosy is to rehabilitate the patient to full pre- morbid health and function. 9.6.5 Clinical handover It may be necessary for case managers to handover the care of their patients when they go on leave. The patient should be made aware of the handover and given contact details for the relieving case manager. The handover should be documented in the patient record at the WATBCP and in the local record for patients treated outside Perth. If a client is transferred t o regional Western Australia, interstate or outside of Australia, a nursing summary with a management plan should be provided to the receiving health service . The document can be found at https://healthpoint.hdwa.health.wa.gov.au/policies/Policies/NMAHS/Public%20Health/ACC %20Clinical%20Handover%20Procedure%20Guidelines.pdf . This document can be sent with t he medical summary. Acknowledgement that the document has been received by the health service should be documented in the patient record. 9.6.6 Monitoring and review A case -manager's role is to determine if a patient is receiving and complying with appropr iate leprosy treatment and revising the care plan as necessary. The frequency of monitoring is dependent on the patient's circumstances and level of need. It may vary during the treatment program i.e. more frequently at the beginning of treatment or increase in times of personal crisis or treatment issues e.g. medication side effects. Monitoring may take place daily, weekly or monthly and may occur in a variety of forms i.e. direct contact through clinic appointments, home visits or telephone contact. Emai l can be Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 98 of 144 used, but only for simple information e.g. confirming appointments, and not for collecting personal medical details or conveying medical advice. All contacts with patients and other care providers should be recorded in the patient's record. Home visiting can be used to evaluate the patient's home environment and social situation and is a tool to monitor patients and provide support to promote adherence. Not all patients require regular home visit s, but it is recommended that the case manager meets with patients t aking treatment for leprosy at least monthly. This can be done at home or in clinic. Prior to any new site or home visit a risk assessment is to be completed and reviewed by the Clinical Nurse Manager or Area Manager. The Risk Assessment tool can be found on the patient database. If it is not possible to carry out a risk assessment, two people are required to attend the site or home. 9.7 Case closure The process for discharge of patients from the case management program or 'case closure' should be clear and defined in time. The aim for case management for leprosy should be the successful completion of medical treatment. The decision to discharge a patient should be determined by the case manager and treating physician. The timing of case closure after leprosy treatment varies significantly, and must be assessed on an individual basis , considering disease classification, bacillary index at time of diagnosis, presence of lepra reactions, presence of nerve function injury and the ne ed for ongoing prevention of disability. The decision on follow up and case closure is made by the medical p hysician and case manager (see Chapter 6.5.3 Follo w up after completion of leprosy treatment ). In a number of cases, case closure may not occur for several years after completion of drug therapy. For this reason, the case manager should update the Western Australian Notifiable Infectious Disease Database (WANIDD) (see the WA TB control policy C hapter 12.0 Notification of Leprosy and enhanced surveillance data) and ensure all contacts have been assessed, screened and managed (see WA TB Control program Policy C hapter 11 Contact tracing) when the patient completes drug therapy, and add additional information as required at the time of case closure.

The King's Fund ; 2011 [cited -November WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 100 of 144 Chapter 10 Prevention of Leprosy 10.1 Introduction The introduction and widespread implementation of multi drug therapy (MDT) for leprosy in the 1980s has been successful in achieving a dramatic fall in global prevalence, from over 5.2 million people, to 202, 256 at the end of 2019. The impact on new case detection rate and disease transmission has been less impress ive, with stagnation in figures over the past decade. Several countries continue to have a high burden of disease, both at a national and subnational level with pockets of higher endemnicity, 1 It is therefore clear that measures other than MDT are required to interrupt transmission and prevent leprosy on a global scale. This has been recognised and addressed by the WHO and the most recent Global Leprosy Strategy,2 with a focus on strengthening political commitment to ensure adequate resources for clinical care and research, promoting early case detection, and promoting interventions for the prevention of infection and disease. Interventions aimed at interrupting disease transmission and preventing leprosy include: MDT: optimisation of drug supply, complia nce and addressing drug resistance Early case detection through contact tracing and active case finding o Enhanced through development of tests to facilitate early diagnosis and subclinical disease Immunoprophylaxis Chemoprophylaxis (post exposure prophylaxis) Addressing social factors such as overcrowding. This chapter will focus on vaccination and post exposure prophylaxis, with other interventions discussed in other sections of the guideline. 10.2 BCG vaccination Bacillus Calmette -Guerin (BCG) vaccine w as developed in the early 20th century with the aim of preventing tuberculosis. While protection against pulmonary tuberculosis is relatively poor, BCG vaccine provides good protection against miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis3. BCG protect ion against leprosy varies between 20% and 90%, with study design (BCG efficacy in experimental studies = 41% versus observational studies 60% and features of the target population (efficacy higher in contacts of leprosy compared with the general population; 68% versus 53%) likely to be the most significant factors influencing observed vaccine efficacy 4. The impact of vaccine strain, exposure to environmental non- tuberculous mycobacteria, number of doses of BCG and age at vaccination are less clear. BCG is categorised as being a beneficial intervention for leprosy, with evidence graded as being of low quality, according to the most recent British Medical Journal Clinical Evidence publication 5. The protection against leprosy offered by BCG alone is inadequa te to interrupt transmission of leprosy. However, its importance as a component of preventative strategies remains significant. Results of a recent modelling analysis comparing the predicted impact of future Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 101 of 144 intervention strategies on leprosy case detection rates indicate that infant BCG vaccination, contact tracing, early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy, and chemoprophylaxis have the greatest impact 6. Alternative leprosy vaccines under investigation include ICRC vaccine, Mycobacterium indicum pranii (Mw) vaccine 7 and killed M.leprae , either alone or in combination with BCG, and as both immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy in combination 10.2.1 Western Australia BCG Policy BCG vaccin ation should not be offered routinely to Australian reside nts. However, it is indicated in the following peop le: 1. Children less than 6 years old who are going to live in another country with a high incidence of tuberculosis (defined as an annual incidence of > 40 / 100 000 population) for more than 3 months (once off or cumulatively) . BCG should be given 2 - 3 months prior to departure. For coun try spec ific inciden ce rates see the World Organisati on TB country pr ofile website http://www.who.int/tb /country/data/profiles/en/index .html 2. Newborn children of migrants who have arrived from countries with a high incidence of tubercul osis (see definition above) in the last 5 years, or newborn children who have household contact with people who have arrived from a high inciden ce country in the last 5 years. 3. Newborn children of parents with Leprosy or a family history of leprosy . 4. Children less t han 6 years old w ho have not previously been vaccin ated with BCG and are household contacts of newly diagnosed leprosy. 5. Infant household contacts of TB after empiric prophylaxis if TST remains negative. BCG vaccin ation is not recommended for general use in the Australian population. BCG can be cons idered for persons not included in these indications. However, care should be taken to adequately inform all persons of the potential risks and l ow efficacy of the vaccin e, especially in adults. It is recommended that the decision to give BCG outside of the above indications should be discussed with the Medical Director or Clinical Nurse Manager of the WA Tuberculosis Contr ol Program. Information on BCG contraindications, general considerations, and dose and administration can be found in the WA TB Control Program TB policy at https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Articles/A_E/About -the-Western- Australia -Tuberculosis - Control -Program . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 102 of 144 10.3 Chemoprophylaxis 10.3.1 Review of evid ence Chemoprophylaxis for leprosy has been of interest since the 1960s. Early studies with dapsone and acedapsone given to contacts showed an overall reduction in leprosy of between 40% and 60%. 8,9 The long duration of treatment and side effects associated with these drugs prompted studies and programs utilising other regimens, including rifampicin, and the combination of (ROM).10 Chemoprophylaxis with single dose rifampicin (SDR) has been shown to have a protective effect in leprosy contacts when used in high incidence settings. The COLEP study in Bangladesh, a randomised placebo controlled trial conducted in a highly endemic region in northwest Bangladesh showed an overall reduction in incidence of leprosy of 57% (CI 33- 72%) at 2 years for contacts who received SDR 12. No further risk reduction was seen at 4 and 6 years.13 The overall number needed to treat to prevent one case of leprosy was 265 after 2 years, and the intervention was found to be cost effective.14 Interestingly, SDR seemed to be most effective in contacts determined as having a lower risk of developing leprosy: Those not closely related or in close physical contact Contacts of index cases with paucibacillary disease Social contacts . Results of this study are consistent with those of an earlier unblinded intervention study conducted on five Indonesian islands using two doses of rifampicin given approximately 3.5 months apart 15. The study noted that the cumulative new case detection rate in the control islands was 39/10 000 population while in islands using the blanket approach the new case detection rate was found to be approximately three times lower. These findings support the observation that protection from chemoprophylaxis appears to be great est for those at lower risk, either through lower exposure or lower susceptibility. While rifampicin chemoprophylaxis appears to have short term protective efficacy in subgroups of people in highly endemic regions, uncertainty remains regarding the applic ability of results to areas of lower endemicity or with pockets of higher endemicity, optimal drug choice (rifampicin vs rifapentine), dosing frequency, adverse effects of rifampicin in the medium and longer term, and the suitability of blanket versus targ eted chemoprophylaxis in different settings. The results of the leprosy post -exposure prophylaxis (LPEP) programme, an international, multicentre feasibility study implemented within leprosy control programmes of Brazil, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Tanzania was published in October 2020. The programme assessed the feasibility of combining three key interventions: systematically tracing contacts of individuals newly diagnosed with leprosy, screening the traced contacts for leprosy, and administering SDR to eligible contacts. The overall findings were that post - exposure prophylaxis with SDR was safe, can be integrated into control programmes with minimal additional efforts once contact tracing has been established, and is generally well accepted by index patients, their contacts and health care workers. The effectiveness of BCG vaccine alone versus BCG in combination with SDR in the prevention of leprosy among contacts of newly diagnosed leprosy cases was assessed in a Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 103 of 144 single centre, clus ter randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh (MALTALEP trial).18 Whilst the trial noted a 42% reduction in the incidence of paucibacillary leprosy amongst contacts who received SDR after BCG vaccination, the result was not statistically significant. Post e xposure prophylaxis (PEP) with single dose rifampicin is currently in use as part of national policy in Cuba, Morocco and Samoa, and as part of subnational policy in Australia (Northern Territory), India, Indonesia and Nepal. In addition to the LPEP study, other collaborations are investigating the feasibility and efficacy of one month of multibacillary multidrug therapy for household contacts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in Cambodia, SDR PEP is being administered contacts of retrospectively identified index cases in an area of low case detection. 19 10.3.2 WHO Recommendations In 2018, the WHO formally recommended chemoprophylaxis with SDR for contacts of leprosy cases (adults and children 2 years and above), after excluding leprosy and TB diseas e, and in the absence of any other contraindications. They specify that this intervention should only be implemented by programmes that can ensure: (a) adequate management of contacts, and (b) consent of the index case to disclose his/her disease. The rec ommendation has been made utilising the GRADE approach, with the strength of recommendation classified as \"Conditional\", and the quality of evidence \"Moderate\". 20 10.3.3 Western Australian recommendations Chemoprophylaxis with single dose rifampicin should be offered to all household contacts of a newly diagnosed case of leprosy, following screening for signs of leprosy and exclusion of contraindications as outlined below. Consent of the index case for disclosure of the diagnosis to the contacts is requir ed. In remote settings where there is frequent close contact outside the household, or where the household is extended (for example Aboriginal communities), chemoprophylaxis should be offered to each member of the community with individual medical assess ment prior to prescription. In this situation, disclosure and consent of the index patient is not required. The community should instead be informed that leprosy cases have been found in the region over the past years, and that community screening is planned to find hidden cases and prevent further cases. Community screening must be accompanied by an education campaign aimed at raising awareness about the clinical signs of disease, and to address problems which may arise as a result of fear and stigma. 21 Chemoprophylaxis should be administered as part of contact tracing activities. The program will be conducted through an operational research study aimed at assessing the feasibility, acceptability, adoption, cost, coverage and sustainability of the intervention in WA. 10.3.4 Process for Chemoprophylaxis Following identification of a new active case of leprosy (Index Case): A decision on the extent of contact tracing will be made by the Physician at the WA TB Control Program in consultation with regional P ublic Health Unit for non- metropolitan patients . Definitions for household and community contacts can be found in Chapter 11 . Contact tracing should occur between 1 and 6 months after the index case has commenced MDT . Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 104 of 144 Where household screening is to be undertaken: o The rationale for contact tracing should be explained to the Index case, and their verbal consent for disclosure of diagnosis obtained o If consent obtained, the assigned case manager is responsible for creating a list of identified contacts o For co ntacts residing outside metropolitan Perth, collaboration with regional public health units should occur in the planning of tracing and screening activities . Where community screening is to be undertaken: o The assigned case manager and treating physician should liaise with relevant public health units, stakeholders and community health centres to carefully define the size of the targeted community o Consideration should be given to the local disease epidemiology, available resources, feasibility and acceptabil ity screening . When conducting contact screening activities, the Leprosy Contact Screening Form for Consideration of Chemoprophylaxis should be used. (see Appendix 14) In addition, documentation of the following indicators related to performing contact screening is required: o Number listed (for household and neighbour screen) o Number estimated (for community screen) o Number traced o Numbers screened o Number confirmed or suspected leprosy o Number received SDR o Number refusing SDR Data obtained will be recorded in a secure central database at the WA TB Control Program, with information used for clinical follow up as required, and to facilitate reporting.

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 107 of 144 Chapter 11 Contact Tracing 11.1 Rationale Unlike many other infectious diseases, the pathogenesis and exact mode of transmission of leprosy are not well understood. This is mainly due to the inability to grow M.leprae in the laboratory, and lack of a suitable animal model. Formulating clear guidelines for leprosy contact tracing is therefore somewhat chall enging, with recommendations based on limited evidence and expert opinion. 11.1.1 Transmission Leprosy is thought to be transmitted primarily person to person via droplets from nasal secretions of infected patients, and to a lesser extent through direct contact with skin lesions. Patients with untreated multibacillary disease are believed to be the primary source of infection, however all cases of active leprosy should be considered potentially infectious. It is believed that subclinical cases may also contribute to transmission, with identification of the infective source not possible in a significant number of cases. Infection associated with inoculation from environmental sources has been documented, as has zoonotic transmission following contact with armadillos. 1 Leprosy is not considered to be a highly infectious disease, generally requiring prolonged periods of close contact. It is believed that the majority of people have natural immunity to infection with M.leprae , with genetic factors being of primary importance in influencing susceptibility. 2 The likelihood of transmission is to a lesser extent influenced by various factors including extremes of age, hygiene, overcrowding, pregnancy and nutrition. It is estimated that only 3 -5% of conjugal part ners of patients with untreated lepromatous disease develop infection, with a higher risk observed in other family members, particularly children 3. Evidence suggests that in areas of lower endemicity such as Australia, the majority of new cases will be fou nd amongst contacts of known active cases, emphasizing the importance of contact tracing.4 11.1.2 Incubation period The incubation period for leprosy is highly variable and potentially long, requiring extended periods of annual surveillance for effective contact tracing. The average incubation period is thought to be between 5 and 7 years, however disease may not manifest for 20 years or more. The widespread use of drug therapy has not been successful in eradicating infection, with stabilization of the new case detection rate evidence of ongoing transmission of infection in a number of areas worldwide. Other interventions, including preventative strategies and contact tracing are therefore required. Contact tracing is a key intervent ion in the World Health Organization Global Leprosy Strategy 5, with a target to screen all household contacts of active cases. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 108 of 144 The objectives of contact tracing are to: promote early case detection o Reduce transmission o Minimise leprosy associated deformity . provide an opportunity for prevention o Use of post exposure prophylaxis in some settings . provide an opportunity for education Promote self -presentation. 11.2 Governance Contact tracing will generally be undertaken by the Western Australia Tubercul osis Control Program. Primary oversight is provided by the Case Manager for the index case, who in turn reports to and seeks advice from the WA TB Control Program Physician responsible for Leprosy care and the Medical Director for TB Control. In situatio ns where contact tracing is undertaken by other agencies, there should be consultation with the WA TB Control Program. In rural and remote areas, contact tracing can be done by the relevant WA regional population / public health unit in consultation with the WA TB Control Program. There is no specific legislation governing contact tracing, other than the requirement that information on contacts must be collected and kept in compliance with privacy laws. 11.3 Definitions 11.3.1 Index case The person diagnosed with leprosy prompting contact tracing. If the contact tracing identifies a new case of leprosy, this then becomes a new case that requires independent, although often overlapping, contact tracing. 11.3.2 Household (close) contacts Household contacts are people who share a bedr oom, kitchen, bathroom or sitting room with the index case. Such contacts may include immediate and extended family members, as well as people who cohabit in dormitories or other residential accommodation. A broad definition should be used to maximise the impact of contact tracing, with consideration of cultural and local factors. 11.3. 3 Community contacts Community contacts are those who have less direct exposure to the index case. The exposure is generally outside his or her primary place of residence and may include more distant family members, school or work contacts. The definition of community contacts will depend on local conditions and characteristics of the index case. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 109 of 144 11.4. Extent of contact tracing 11.4.1 Timeframe Contact tracing should begin as soon as possible after diagnosis of an index case with Leprosy. Determining the exact period of infectivity is often challenging. In general, contacts should be determined from the time of onset of symptoms, which may be neurological, skin changes or both. Given that the average incubation period is 5- 7 years, contacts of the index case during this period may be included, particularly in situations where the aim of contact tracing is to find a source (for example in contact t racing of paucibacillary cases). 11.4.2 Who to contact trace All household or close contacts of the index case. In remote settings where there is close contact within communities, extended family and community members should be included . For contacts of p aucibacillary cases, contact tracing is focused primarily on identifying a possible source of infection i.e. a multibacillary case. Retrospective contact tracing is recommended in regions where there is ongoing transmission and surveillance has been incomplete o Includes Kimberley and Pilbara regions for cases diagnosed after 1996 when local surveillance programs ceased. 11.5 Procedure for contact tracing The procedure for contact tracing is outlined in Appendix 15. 11.5.1 Review of Index case The index case should be carefully interviewed in a culturally appropriate setting to determine lists of contacts that require screening. Confirmation of case classification as multibacillary or paucibacillary, including bacillary index where available, is important t o determine duration of contact follow -up. Contacts of MB cases require annual review for a minimum of six years. Contacts of PB cases require a single review with no further follow up necessary in the absence of any suspicious findings. The index case should be educated regarding the risk of possible transmission of infection to their contacts, and potential benefits which may result from contact tracing and administration of chemoprophylaxis where appropriate. Consent from the index case for disclosur e of the diagnosis must be obtained prior to proceeding with contact tracing. In situations where community wide screening is planned, consent from the index case is not required, however it is paramount that the index case is not identified during the scr eening process. 11.5.2 Stratification of Contact List Contacts should be stratified into groups to reflect the intensity of exposure i.e. household contacts, family contacts, community contacts and casual contacts. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 110 of 144 11.5.3 Contact screening Once the cont act list has been created, contacts should undergo the following: Interview o Questioning for symptoms of Leprosy including skin lesions, changes in sensation, new weakness or deformity o History of BCG vaccination o Previous TB exposure or treatment o Co-existing medical conditions Clinical examination o Skin, peripheral nerves, eyes as outlined in Chapter 5.1 o VMT -ST should be performed if examiner is skilled in the procedure (see Appendices 2 and 3) Education o Educate the contact regarding symptoms and si gns of leprosy, to identify early in themselves and others o Importance of early presentation Investigations o If clinical features of leprosy are present the patient should have further investigation including either skin smear or skin biopsy o In situations where investigations are not possible, referral should be made to a specialist BCG o Contacts who have not received BCG should be vaccinated according to WA BCG policy which can be found under policy links at https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Articles/A_E/About -the-Western- Australia - Tuberculosis -Control -Program Referral o Contacts with clinical features suggestive of leprosy should be referred to the Infectious Diseases Physician at the WA TB Control Program for review Assessment for eligibility for chemoprophylaxis with single dose rifampicin o See Appendix 14 Arrange subsequent review o Contacts of PB cases without any suspicious findings do not require further review o Contacts of MB cases should be reviewed annually for a minimum of 6 years Contact tracing report o A list of all contacts should be maintained by the local case worker and WA TB Control Program case manager o The completeness and results of contac t tracing should be recorded and communicated in an annual report Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 111 of 144 11.6 Other considerations 11.6.1 Maintaining confidentiality of the index case The name of the index case should never be disclosed to contacts without the consent of the index case. Health professionals (including public health authorities) have a duty to maintain the confidentiality of all information that comes to them in the cour se of providing medical treatment and care to patients. Inadvertent disclosure of a patient's diagnosis of Leprosy to a third party could have adverse consequences for the patient, both at home and in the workplace. Further information regarding patient confidentiality is provided in the Government of Western Australia, Department of Health, Patient Confidentiality Policy. 6 11.6.2 Contacts declining screening Contacts who refuse to be screened for Leprosy should be informed of the symptoms and signs of infection and advised to seek medical attention with any concerns. They should be informed that symptoms might take many years to appear. 11.6.3 Media attention Media attention may develop when leprosy involves schools, hospitals, detention facilities or oth er public settings. This is most likely to arise through contacts speaking to the media. Contact tracing procedures and priorities should not alter in this situation. Attention should be paid to clear and prompt communication with contacts to alleviate anxiety and concerns that may prompt erroneous media reporting. Any media enquiry should be addressed as soon as possible, so to ensure accurate reporting. Pre- emptive statements in the setting of contact tracing are not recommended. All media enquiries should be referred to the Medical Director of the WA TB Control Program. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 112 of 144 References 1.

Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 113 of 144 Chapter 12 Notification of leprosy and enhanced surveillance 12.1 Introduction Leprosy is an infectious disease for which there is a legal requirement for clinicians and laboratories to report the diagnosis to the Western Australia Department of Health. All cases of active leprosy, in both children and adults, are notifiable. 12.2 Statutory medical notifications Under the Public Health Act 20161 (the Act) if a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner or responsible pathologist at a pathology laboratory forms the opinion that a patient of the practitioner, or from whom a sample was taken, has or may have, a notifiable infectious disease or notifiable infectious disease- related condition, they have a legal requirement to notify the Chief Health Officer. Part 9 Division 2 of the Act outlines detail relating to notification. Notification should be made using the approved notification form, by post, fax or telephone, depending on urgency. The Act states that notification should be made as soon as is practicable, or within 24 hours for urgently notifiable infectious disease, and within 72 hours for any other notifiable infectious disease or notifiable infectious disease- related condition. In situations where two or more practitioners may be involved in a patient's management and it is not clear if the case has already been notified, the cas e should still be reported. This ensures optimal ascertainment of all cases. In addition to an obligation to notify the Chief Health Officer about notifiable infectious diseases or notifiable infectious disease- related conditions, medical practitioners, nursing practitioners and responsible pathologist have a duty to provide the patient with information about the disease or condition, including; the patient's obligations under section 88(2) - (4); the patient's rights under section 88(5); and preventing the transmission of the disease to any other person; information about the obligation to notify the disease; and any information prescribed by the regulations in subsection (2)(d). 12.3 Case definition for leprosy The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) definition for leprosy is outlined in Chapter 4. All confirmed cases should be notified to the Department of Health. Cases not meeting the CDNA definition but where a high degree of suspicion of leprosy exists and criteria for the WHO definition of leprosy are met should also be notified. Reporting of cases meeting the WHO case definition ensures accurate reporting by WA TB Control Program to the WHO annually. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 114 of 144 12.4 Notification and surveillance process 12.4.1 Western Australia 12.4.1.1 Notification The responsible practitioner is required to complete a Department of Health Notification form, which is reproduced in Appendix 16 and available from the WA TB Control Program website at http://www.health.wa.gov.au/acc/tb/hp.cfm . Reply paid envelopes are provided with notification forms, and a fax number is provided on the form. Notifications are sent to the Director of the Communicable Disease Control Directorate (CDCD) for cases diagnosed in the Perth metropolitan area, and to the appropriate Public Health Unit for cases diagnosed in country areas. Pathology laboratories generally provide notifications by automated electronic downloads or relevant information directly to the CDCD. Core notifiable disease data from both paper -based clinician notifications and electronic or paper -based laboratory notifications are stored in the Western Australian Notifiable Infectious Disease Database (WANIDD), which is accessible to a limited number of authorised users, including designated staff of the WA TB Control Program. Notifications are entered into WANIDD within 24 hours of receipt at CDCD. The database provides real - time surveillance capacity on a state wide bas is. The responsibility for entry of notifications into WANIDD lies with designated staff in CDCD. Notifications are often generated by or sent directly to the WA TB Control Program (Anita Clayton Centre). These are immediately faxed to CDCD for data ent ry. Conversely, notifications received by CDCD, once entered into WANIDD are faxed to the TB Control Program to ensure the program is aware of the newly identified case. The receiving officer of the fax at the Anita Clayton Centre (usually the Senior Administrative Officer) will then inform the case manager (if already assigned) of the notification, or alternatively the Clinical Nurse Manager or Medical Officer if the case is not already known to the centre. The Mycobacterial Reference laboratory, in additi on to sending electronic notifications to CDCD, also notifies the TB Control Program of all new positive M.leprae microscopy and PCR by fax. Cases of leprosy treated in WA but diagnosed in another state or country are not notifiable. The WA TB Control Pr ogram is responsible for providing surveillance data back to the notifying state or country as required and where possible. 12.4.1.2 Enhanced surveillance The WA TB Control Program collects additional information for notified leprosy cases using a specifi c enhanced surveillance form REDcap database. The form is completed by medical and case management staff at the WA TB Control Program. 12.4.1.3 Review of notification and surveillance data Data cleaning of the initial notification for leprosy (and tuberculosis) is performed monthly by designated staff at CDCD. Requests to complete missing data fields from the form for notification of infectious diseases in WA for all patients diagnosed with leprosy are emailed to the Clinical Nurse Manager, Medical Director and case managers of the WA TB Control Program monthly. Final WA Leprosy Guideline - April 2023 Page 115 of 144 In May each year, leprosy notifications from the previous 12 months are reviewed at the WA TB Control Program, to ensure completeness and accuracy, prior to submission of the surveillance data to t he Commonwealth and WHO. 12.4.2 National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) was established in 1990 and is maintained by the Australian Government Department of Health (DoH). Under this scheme, de- identified core information on cases of infectious diseases that are notified to State or Territory health authorities, are forwarded electronically to DoH on a daily basis for incorporation into the NNDSS database. CDNA, which comprises representatives from DoH and State/Territory Departments of Health, coordinates national surveillance of the agreed list of communicable diseases that are maintained in the NNDSS. Sharing of notifiable disease data across jurisdictions is auspiced under the terms of the National Health Security Act 2007. In addition to the electronic transmission of core surveillance data on notified leprosy cases from WANIDD to the NNDSS, CDCD provides the Department of Health on an annual basis with the additional data col lected from the enhanced surveillance scheme.

The Minimal Important Difference of the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale is 5. Scale Item Notes 1. VAS Pain Instruct the patient to point to the position on the line to indicate how much pain they are currently feeling. The far left end indicates 'No pain' and the far right end indicates 'Worst possible pain'. Take the measurement (in mm) using a ruler from the LEFT end of the line to the centre of the cross. Ensure that the line when reproduced from this document is 100 mm long . 2. Fever Take temperature (in \u00b0C) using a thermometer. If the temperature is GREATER than 37.5 \u00b0C the patient has a fever. If it is less than or equal to 37.5 \u00b0C the patient scores 0 for this item UNLESS they give a history of having had a fever in the last 7 days in which case they score 1. The cause of the fever does not need to be established. 3. Number of ENL skin lesions Note: only skin lesions due to ENL are to be considered by this item . 4. Inflammation of ENL skin lesions Note: only skin lesions due to ENL are to be considered by this item . The term complex refers to the following type of participant fulfils criteria for more than one score then the highest scoring criteria should be used . For example if there are red ENL skin lesions and some are ulcertated or vesicular or pustular then the patient scores 3 because \"complex\" lesions are present. 5. Extent to ENL skin lesions Note: only skin lesions due to ENL are to be considered by this item. The separate regions are: a) Head and neck b) Left upper limb c) Right upper limb d) Torso - front (including genitals) e) Torso back (including buttocks) f) Left lower limb g) Right lower limb 6. Peripheral oedema due to ENL The three sites to be considered are the face, hands and feet. Both feet count as one site. Both hands count as one site. Oedema thought to be due to treatment such as corticosteroids or thalidomide should not be counted.
