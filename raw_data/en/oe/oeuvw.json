World Federation for Laser Dentistry, 2012, Barcelona, Spain. Narrative Report (limit to 500 words) The research in my laboratory is broa dly in the area of phototherapy. This was originally concentrated in photodynamic therapy (PDT) but has subsequently broadened to include the modality known as low level light therapy or photobiomodulation. We have made a number of significant contribution s in the treatment of infectious disease, cancer, heart disease, wound healing and neurology. Antimicrobial PDT. Molecules with a pronounced positive charge are able to effectively target bacteria (both Gram (+) and Gram ( -)) for photodestruction. This i s because the outer -membrane permeability barrier typical of Gram ( -) bacteria is disrupted by cationic molecules, while Gram (+) species have negatively charged but permeable cell walls. We have discovered several novel classes of data on the structure-function relationships of these PS molecules and their efficiency in photodynamic inactivation of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms has been obtained. Gram- positive, Gram -negative bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi and even bacterial spores can all be effectively eradicated w ith more than 6 logs of killing. Multi- antibiotic resistant bacteria can be killed as easily as naive strains. Multi -drug resistance pumps can be overcome and specific small molecule efflux pump inhibitors are synergistic with PDT. PDT can also photoinactivate virulence factors and toxins that are secreted by pathogens. PDT and anti-tumor immune response. The ideal cancer treatment should target both the primary tumor and the metastases with the minimal toxicity. This is best accomplished by educating the body's immune system to recognize the tumor as foreign so that after the primary tumor is destroyed, distant metastases will also be eradicated. PDT may accomplish this feat and stimulate long- term, specific anti-tumor immunity. PDT causes: an acute infla mmatory response, the rapid induction of large amounts of necrotic and apoptotic tumor cells, induction of immunostimulatory heat-shock proteins tumor antigen presentation to na\u00efve T-cells generation of cytotoxic T- cells that can destroy distant tumor meta stases. By using various syngeneic mouse tumors in immunocompetent mice, we can study specific PDT regimens related to tumor type, the synergistic combination of low-dose cyclophosphamide and PDT, and PDT combined with immunostimulants (toll- like receptor ligands) to maximize the generation of anti- tumor immunity. The use of tumors expressing defined tumor associated antigens with known MHC class I peptides allows anti- tumor immunity to be quantitatively compared. Low level light for stimulation of healin g, reduction of inflammation and as a therapy for brain damage. It has been known for many years that low levels of laser or non-coherent light (LLLT) accelerate some phases of wound healing but the benefits of LLLT in wound healing are still 46 controversial . Partly this may be explained by the complicated dosimetry that pertains with regard to wavelength, total fluence pulse structure and power density. We have developed a quantitative and reproducible model of LLLT in mice and are exploring its use a in rat arthritis model. Transcranial LLLT with NIR light may an effective therapy for stroke, traumatic brain injury, and degenerative brain diseases. We are exploring some of these applications in mouse models.
