A new study looked at the records of 537,303 children born in Denmark between January 1991 and December 1998 of whom 440,303 had been given the MMR vaccine. The research, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that 316 children had been diagnosed with an autistic disorder and 422 with other autistic-spectrum disorders. The researchers, led by Kreesten Madsen from the Danish Epidemiology Science Centre, found the relative risks of developing an autistic disorder were similar for those who had been given the MMR jab and those who had not. They also found no link between the development of an autistic disorder and the child's age at the time of vaccination or the date when they had the MMR jab. The authors concluded: \"This study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism.\" The suggestion of a link between MMR and autism was sparked by Dr Andrew Wakefield in a study published in 1998. However, since then numerous studies have said there is no evidence that the jab causes children to develop autism. "}
