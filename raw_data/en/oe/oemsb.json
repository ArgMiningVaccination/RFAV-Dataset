Each Mission contains a full set of online and oine activities. Full Missions each include 40 interdisciplinary online STEM and computer science lessons, and takes approxi- mately 8-10 hours to complete. Express Missions are shortened versions of each full Mission, including 10 interdisciplinary online lessons, and takes approximately 2 hours to complete. In addition to the robust online lessons, each Mission includes the following ready-to-use activities: Interactive Lessons Over 400 online lessons connect more than 100 STEM careers and technologies to students' academic skills, demonstrating real-world problem solving. Challenge Projects Simple hands-on activities emphasize problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork and communication using readily-available materials. Career Videos Each STEM career addressed in our online lessons also includes a career introduction video presenting the career and its education pathway. Parent Discussions Parent-ready handouts stimulate STEM conversations at home, help \u00ffll ESSA requirements for parental involvement, and encourage research and simple at-home experiments. Design Thinking Students use Design Thinking methodology to solve complex problems through brainstorming, collaboration, and the creative exploration of new possibilities. 3D Printing Activities 3D printing experiments and projects demonstrate STEM principles and provide students experience turning 3D designs into physical items. Coding Activities Fun, interactive coding lessons introduce students to computer science and the development of problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity needed for success in career paths. Papercraft Figures Each STEM career and technology is accompanied by a 3D papercraft \u00ffgure students can assemble, helping internalize a knowledge of 3D shapes and o\u00b0er a tangible reminder of the careers and technologies.
