In This Article Lemonade Diet For Weight Loss 1. What Is Lemonade Diet? It is a Master Cleanse, very low calorie diet plan for [ internal detoxification](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/guide-for-detox-diet-plans/). The lemonade diet has four main ingredients - fresh lemon juice, cayenne pepper, maple syrup, and pure water. The diet is sometimes also known as the 'juice cleanse'. This lemon water diet is reputed to be the best diet to shed extra weight and get rid of the accumulated toxins. This can also help to deal with obesity, which affects 39% of adults aged 18 and older worldwide, as per a [study](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) conducted. Out of which 39% of them were men and 40% were women. Further the study also revealed that obesity or being overweight takes more lives than those who are underweight or malnourished. The lemonade diet was developed by Stanley Burroughs in the 1940s. But it picked up around 1976 when Burroughs wrote two books, \"The Master Cleanser\" and \"Healing for the Age of Enlightenment\", giving precious information about the diet. The lemonade diet is said to do wonders by cleansing the body of harmful toxins, especially in the colon region. Today, the lemonade diet is one of the most rapid and extreme weight loss programs for those who wish to lose those extra pounds super quick. A study on Korean subjects revealed that this special diet helped reduce body weight and fat mass and improved insulin resistance ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912765)). However, one should take great care while following this plan, and it should be under close supervision of health professionals. While following this diet, no solid food is allowed. It calls for six or more servings of the specialized lemonade mixture every day. In addition to this, the salt water flush helps to cleanse the body. Different people incorporate this diet for varying amounts of time, mostly lasting for two days. Combining food with the diet throughout the entire process would, therefore, defeat its main purpose. However, food can be included in the beginning and at the end of the lemon juice diet to ease your body into and off the diet. 2. How Does The Lemonade Work For Weight Loss? Those following the lemonade diet are required to consume a concoction of lemon juice, cayenne pepper, maple syrup, and pure water at least six times a day. Any solid food should be avoided, except for phases 1 and 3. Care should be taken to include solids, exclude solids, and again re-include solids judiciously to protect the body from the sudden attack of a very low-calorie diet. The intake of calories must be well below the dieter's previous daily intake. Individuals on the diet should consume approximately 500 to 600 calories a day, which is well below the prescribed 1,600 calories for women and 2,500 calories for men. The intake of a low-calorie liquid diet for 10 days will help your body use the fat cells as the energy source for performing the necessary functions ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784876)). A study showed that people aged between 18-29 years who were given a lemon and honey concoction for 4 days lost nearly 2.2 kg and improved their triglyceride levels ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910284/)). We need to remember that these fancy diet plans are temporary not permanent and sustainable solutions to lose weight. 3. How Does Lemonade Diet Work For Cleansing?
