Perfect for honoring and celebrating birthdays, weddings, memorials, buying or selling property and other major life transitions. ---------------------------------- In these times of such pervasive change it can seem that the world is out of balance. Structures and paradigms on which we have relied heavily are breaking down so that new holistic structures can be birthed. It is a time of great opportunity to create balance in our lives through ceremonies such as the ayni despacho. For hundreds of years, the paqos, high shaman or wisdom-keepers from the Q'ero lineage of Peru, have used the ayni despacho ceremony. Central to their cosmology is the understanding that the universe is benign, and only seems predatory when we are out of balance. They believe that the world mirrors back our own state of ayni or right relationship. Coming back into ayni, allows the Universe to work on our behalf once again, restoring the flow of synchronicity. When we work in ceremony such as the ayni despacho, we work at the level of the soul. A despacho is similar to a mandala or sacred creation in that it holds symbolic elements and the prayers of the participants. As the shamans add the elements to the despacho, the vibration of the participants and the room raises. The despacho becomes a living prayer that brings energy shifts and healing. In shamanic tradition, an ayni despacho is done with the intention to bring oneself and one's community into right relationship with the natural world. It creates a sense of union, harmony and reciprocity with nature. For the ayni despacho, the shaman begins with a large piece of white paper that will serve as a 'wrapping' for all of the offerings. All ingredients have significance and each receives prayer before being placed on the paper. Coca leaves or bay leaves are used to hold prayers. Sugar and various sweets bring sweetness and love to the prayers. Corn and other grains are used to nourish participants and the Pachamama (the Earth). Once all ingredients have been added, the shaman carefully folds the bundle into the shape of a square 'gift' and ties it. After a despacho is prepared, the shaman uses it to cleanse the energy body of each participant. To close the ceremony, the despacho is placed in a ceremonial fire, buried in the earth or released into the water.
