Since, a variety of drug products in China have been approved formarketing in other countries, and approximately 10 products have submitted theIND application to FDA of United States, of which various Chinese herbal preparations such as compound Danshen dripping pills, Xingling granules, and HMPL-004 have been approved to be investigated in phase III clinical trials. Ingeneral, multi-center studies of TCHM are increasing with years, but most of thestudies are performed in some certain country, and the actual international multi-center clinical trials are very rare. Number of SCI literatures on multi-center clinicaltrials of TCHM that published in the recent decade also showed increasingtendency with years, despite the evident reduction in the past 2 years due tothe in fluence of COVID-19 pandemic. Of the multi-center clinical trials of TCHM that performed by mainland China and other oversees regions, except for Taiwan, China, nearly 70% were focused on classic Chinese medicinal formulae andChinese patent medicine, while the other 30% were on dietary supplementsand plant extracts. Facing the future, the \"human experience \"has attracted close attentions from researchers throughout the world. Effectively utilizing thehistoric \"human experience \"is an important method to vitalize potential of original scienti c and technological resources of TCHM. Performing multi-center clinical trials with high qualities is still an essential method for TCHM in accessing the mainstream medicine market. In addition, it is also required to further improve the evaluation techniques and methods that not only meet the international standardsbut also meet the characteristics of TCHM. Furthermore, we should also focus onthe TCHM speci c clinical values and scienti c reports.OPEN ACCESS EDITED BY Daniela Calina, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ofCraiova, Romania REVIEWED BY Hee Geun Jo,Gachon University, Republic of KoreaAdina Turcu-Stiolica, University of zjhtcm@foxmail.com These authors have contributed equally to this work RECEIVED 28 March 2023 ACCEPTED 02 May 2023 PUBLISHED 18 May 2023 CITATION Wu S, Wang C, Bai D, Chen N, Hu J andZhang J (2023), Perspectives ofinternational multi-center COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2023 Wu, Wang, Bai, Chen, Hu andZhang.

Clinical trial of drugs is an important process in drug development,and the quality could directly in fluence the safety and effectiveness of drugs after marketing. In this globally rampant pandemic of COVID-19, TCHM has been extensively used throughout the anti- pandemic processes, various TCHM that important materials(Zhang et al., 2020 ), and have been approbated by various countries. In the past 4 decades, the introduction of subjects such as clinicalepidemiology and evidence-based medicine has substantially improved the qualities and levels of clinical studies on TCHM, and a lot of high-quality high-level clinical studies on TCHM[including Investigational New Drugs (IND) not aiming forregistration] have been performed successively, and a large groupof TCHM have been registered for marketing in other countries,which have promoted the advancement of TCHM industry and theinternationalization of TCHM. 2 Registration, marketing, and clinical trials of Chinese domestic TCHMoverseas According to the statistics of World Health Organization (WHO), TCM has been acknowledged by 29 countries and regions, including Australia, Canada, Austria, Singapore, Vietnam, by legislations, and 18 countries and regions haveincluded TCHM in medical insurance. A lot of TCHM have beenregistered successively in the European Union (EU), Russia,Singapore, Cuba, and Vietnam. The current 2004/24/EC decree on traditional herbal medicinal product (THMP) that issued by EU in 2004 provided a simpli ed registration procedure of THMP that had been used traditionally for long term but lacked evidence from modern studies, of which the \"non-clinical \"and \"clinical \"studies were derated from the application les of the Common Technical Document (CTD) of the products, while only literatures, evidence from experts, and reviews and reportson safety were required to demonstrate that the product had suf cient traditional use and safety, after which the product could be registeredfor marketing. Such measurements substantially reduced thedifculties in registration. This decree also encouraged the approval of THMP, including compound products of TCHM, to obtain EU market admittance for drugs ( Qu et al., 2021 ). Currently, several varieties including Di 'ao Xinxuekang capsule produced by the Chengdu Di 'ao Pharmaceutical Group (2013, Netherland) ( Wang,2012), Danshen capsule produced by the Tasly Pharmaceutical Group Co. LTD. (2016, Netherland) ( Zhang et al., 2017 ), Yufengningxin tablets produced by the Tong Ren Tang Group (2019, Netherland) (The Medicines Evaluation Board, 2019 ), and Banlangen granule produced by the Xiangxue-Cambridge International ResearchCenter of Traditional Chinese Medicine (United Kingdom, 2015)(Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 2022 )h a v e been registered for marketing in EU. TCHM could be registered as natural health products (NHPs) in Canada through the \"traditional-application (also known as traditional ef cacy application) \"processes, for which the TCHM products of the formula, preparation processes, and indications being used for more than 50 years. Regarding the preparation ofles for application, the les on treatment ef cacies of the products are relatively flexible, while the safety and quality of the products are highly concerned. Since 2010, several TCHM products haveacquired the marking quali cation in countries other than China (Table 1 ). In 2008, the Fufang Danshen dripping pill and Chaihu dripping pill produced by the Tasly Group passed all the review and approval procedures by Health Canada as a Traditional Drug ( Zhao et al., 2009 ). In 2016, the Danning tablet produced by the Shanghai Hutchison Pharmaceutical Co., LTD. was approved for marketingby the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate ofHealth Canada ( Huang et al., 2018 ). In addition, the Juhong Tan Ke liquid produced by the Xiangxue Pharmaceutical Group (2012) andAntiviral Oral-Liquid (2016) were also approved by Health Canada(Xiangxue Pharmaceutical, 2021 ). The Huatuo Zaizao pill produced by the Guangzhou Baiyunshan Qixing Pharmaceutical Co., LTD. is one of the con dential products in China, which has accessed 27 countries and regions including Russia,Canada, Australia, and Vietnam, and has been included in the medicalinsurance of Vietnam and Essential Medicine List of Russia. HuatuoZaizao pill has already acquired the permanent drug registrationcerticate in Russia in 2010. In May 2012, the Qixing Pharmaceutical Group signed an \"evidence-based clinical study agreement for treating cerebral st roke in rehabilitation stage by Huatuo Zaizao pill \"with the Belarus National Scienti cP r a c t i c e Center of Cardiology, and jointly initiated the evidence-basedclinical study of \"Huotuo Zaizao pill. \"In 2005, Xuezhikang was registered in Taiwan, China and Singapore as a prescription drug,and the clinical study results were published in Norway in 2006. In2011, the clinical ndings of Xuezhikang were included in the European Guidelines for Blood Lipid Management . Furthermore, the Juhong Tan Ke liquid produced by the Xiangxue Pharmaceutical Group was approved in Kenya (2013), and Xiaoerhuashi oral-liquid wasapproved for marketing by the Singapore Health Sciences Authority(2017). Lian-Hua-Qing-Wen Capsule was approved for marketing as\"Chinese patent medicine, \"\"medicine, \"\"botanical medicine, \"\"natural health product, \"\"dietary supplement, \"\"modern botanical medicine, \" and \"natural medicine \"in Hong Kong and Macao, China, Brazil, Indonesia, Canada, Mozambique, Romania, Thailand, Ecuador, Singapore, Laos, Kyrgyzstan, Philippines, Kuwait, Mauritius, Uganda, and Russia. The registration of Lian-Hua-Qing-Wen Capsule has alsobeen initiated in the Middle East and Africa. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 02Wu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1195364Substantially different from EU and other regions, TCHM could only apply for marketing in the United States through the new drug application (NDA) procedures, according to the Guidance for Industry Botanical Drug Products that issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of USA. In recent years,approximately 10 TCHM products submitted IND application toFDA ( Table 2 ). The compound Danshen dripping pills produced by the Tasly Pharmaceutical Group Co., LTD., Xingling granulesproduced by the Xingling Sci-tech Pharmaceutical Co., LTD., andHMPL-004 produced by the Hutchison Whampoa Co., LTD. have been approved to be investigated in phase III clinical trials. 3 Advances in international multi- center clinical trials on TCHM In general, international multi-center studies on TCHM are increasing with years in the recent decade, despite the fact that the total number is still limited. When using \"Herbal medicine \"as the keyword to search the United States Clinical Trial Registry,212 clinical trials on TCHM were found registered in European orAmerican countries (From January 1989 to April 2022). One hundredandfty-six (73.58%) of the clinical trials were mainly from East Asia (including 104 from mainland China, 27 from Taiwan, China, and 15 from Hong Kong, China), 22 of the clinical trials were from North America (including 8 from New York, United States; 7 fromCalifornia, United States; 3 from Connecticut, United States; and3 from Maryland, United States), 4 of the clinical trials were fromSoutheast Asia, and 3 of the clinical trials were from Europe ( Figure 1 ). Unfortunately, most of these studies were performed in some singlecountries, while the real international multi-center clinical trials werevery rare. From the aspect of study status, 67 studies have completed as planned (31.60% completed), 39 studies are recruiting subjects (18.40% recruiting), 24 studies have not started the subjectrecruitment (11.32% Not yet recruiting), 6 studies terminatedprematurely and subjects were not further treated or examined(2.83% Terminated), 3 studies are active and on-going (1.42%Active, not recruiting), 2 studies terminated prematurely but maybe re-started again (0.94% Suspended), and 2 studies terminatedbefore the recruitment of rst subject (0.94% Withdrawn). From the phases of studies, 86 studies (40.57%) were phase II clinical trials, 34 studies (16.04%) were phase III clinical trials, 21 studies (9.91%)were phase I clinical trials, 21 studies (9.91%) were phase IV clinicaltrials, and 9 studies (4.25%) were early phase explorative trials.TABLE 1 Marketing of traditional Chinese herbal medicine overseas.

However, the num ber of studies was substantially lower in the recent 2 years, due to the in fluences of COVID-19 pandemic. When using \"herbal medicine AND Randomized control AND multicenter \"as the keywords to search the NewPubmed literature analysis system (pubmedplus.cn), 327 literatures wereretrieved (From January 1989 to April 2022). Speci cally, 4 studies (1.2%) were published in 1989 -2000, 47 studies (14.4%) were published in 2001 -2010, and 275 studies (84.1%) were published in 2011 -2022. The number of studies published in 2020 was the highest (n= 59), which reduced to 21 in 2021, and further reduced to 6 in 2022 (Figure 2 ). China is the country with the most multi-center clinical trials on TCHM performed and most re levant SCI articles published in the world. The total number of SCI articles on multi-center clinicaltrials on TCHM in China was 263 (80.4%), followed by 5.2% in Japan,2.8% in United States, 2.5% in Korea, and 2.1% in Pakistan. The ve cities participated in most multi-center clinical trials on TCHM in China and overseas were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, andChengdu, and Tokyo (Japan), Karachi (Pakistan), Fukuoka (Japan),Kyoto (Japan), Chiba (Japan), respectively. The subjects in these trialsmainly with tumor, cardiovascular di seases, respiratory diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. Nearly 70% of multi-center clinical trials of TCHM performed in regions other than mainland China and Taiwan, China are on classicChinese medicinal formulae and Chinese patent medicines, and theother 30% are mainly on dietary supplements or plant extracts. Forinstance, the following multi-center clinical trials decoction, of COVID-19; Wulingsan for treatment of glossalgia and prevention of recurrence carcinoma; Daikenchuto for thetreatment of intestinal of obesity hypertension; Jinkui Shenqi pill for the treatment of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (neurotoxicity); and Goshuyuto forthe treatment of headache.

In recent years, several countri es and regions issued new drug development policies and laws with human use histories regardingthe surveillance of traditional herbal medicine. Taking FAD as anexample, the Botanical Drug Development Guidance for Industry was issued in December 2016 to provide guiding for pre-marketingreviewing of botanical drugs. The a pplicants are required to provide data of human experience when applying for phase I or phase II clinical trial, which could help providing surveillance requirements of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Count ries or regions such as EU, Japan, and Korea also have special policies on reviewing, approving, andsurveillance of traditional herbal medicines, Chinese prescription medicines, and prescriptions from Classic medicine books. \"Human experience \"is the summary of repeatable experience of treatments by TCHM that has certain regularities fr om long-term clinical practices. The historic human experience is mainly documented in ancient medical books, while the experience of using Chinese PatentM e d i c i n e si sm a i n l yf r o mt h eu s eo fp reparations of medical settings and expert empirical prescriptions from prestigious physicians of TCM.It is not dif cult to nd that adhere to the guiding of clinical values, and establish the \"three combinations \"evidence system of TCHM reviewing based on TCM theories, human experience, and clinical trials will be theimportant innovation method for the advancement of TCHM to higher qualities and internationalization. How to summarize the involved scienti c law and dig the implied scienti c values of TCHM based on the thousand years 'historic human experience have profound strategic importance and im portant practical signi cances forimproving the quality and ef ciency of TCHM and promoting the processes of internationalization of TCHM. Therefore, we should notimproperly belittle ourselves. Performing multi-center clinical trials with high qualities is still the essential method for TCHM to access the mainstream international medicine markets. Since the implement of GCP, the overall quality ofclinical trials of new drugs in China has improved substantially, despitethat there are still s everal limitations ( Yuan et al., 2021 ). Such as non- standard collection of human safety data, insuf cient basis for researchers to judge the relationship between adverse events andtrial drugs, and the inability to trace the main ef cacy indicators such as scale in effectiveness data. To address these problems, targeted quality control measures should be formulated and principle of blind law should be strictly abide by. Encourage the use of moderntechnology, such as TCM equipment and other advanced tools forevaluation. The 14th Five Year Development Program for Pharmaceutical Industry in Interpretation 2021 described supporting clinical study settings in China to actively participateand organize international multi-center clinical trials, and improvethe internationalization levels of clinical trials ( http://www.gov.cn/ zhengce/2022-02/01/content_5671569.htm ). Therefore, developing specic quality control measurements according to the characteristics of multi-center clinical trials when obeying thecurrent GCP and ICH-GCP in China has important strategicsignicances for improving the development of new TCHM in China, as well as accessing the international mainstream medicinemarkets. The quality of TCM clinical trials depends on the design,especially the method of statistical data analysis. Therefore, in the process of trial design, considerations should be taken into account in how to collect research data, control test standardization and statisticalanalysis, so as to improve the quality of clinical trials. Besides, theclinical evaluation of TCM is a complex evaluation system. If we wantto accurately screen the clinical t rial indications of modern disease classi cation in early clinical research, and identify and evaluate the safety risk information number, we should reasonably use theinformation of the toxic action mechanism and target organs of TCM based on computer prediction. Network pharmacology in recent years has been widely used in the eld of traditional Chinese medicine. The research methods based on network pharmacology canquickly identify the key medicinal components and targets of TCM,TABLE 3 ( Continued ) General characteristics of multi-center clinical trials on TCHM performed overseas (in regions other than mainland China and Taiwan, China) in the recent 15 years.

At the same time, it providesclearer guidance and direction for key safety signal monitoring in laterlarge-scale clinical research. It is necessary to further develop clinical evaluation techniques and methods not only meet the international standards but also meet the characteristics of TCHM. In recent years, the new techniques and methods of international clinical trials on drugs have been graduallyapplied in clinical trials of new drugs of TCHM, which showed thefollowing advantages: 1) broke through the adaptive design ofchoosing the frequency-based statistical methods that has beenlong used in design and analysis in clinical trials; 2) enrichmentstrategy was developed to improve the accuracy of subject inclusion inclinical trials, and reduce the confounding factors ( Yan et al., 2017 ); 3) master protocols and other high-ef cient clinical trial design strategy, such as basket trial and umbrella trial ( Guo et al., 2021 ), were used to improve the ef ciency of clinical trials, shorten the duration of clinical trials, reduced and decrease of the costs of clinical trials. In 2015,China issued the formal announcement of the implement of ICHE17 guiding principle ( National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), 2015 ). Identifying the clinical position of drugs for treatment diseases that meet the characteristics of TCHM effects, and capable of leading to evident clinical values and bene ts, and seeking, investigating, establishing, and designing scienti c clinical ef cacy evaluation tools and methods that been acknowledged by consensus to meet theclinical objectives and clinical positions will be an important studydirection in the methodological eld of clinical evaluation of new drugs of TCHM. Quality marker (Q-marker) was proposed by Liu C. X. et al. (2016) in response to the problem of TCM quality research. Since then, quality studies of TCM, in particular Q-marker studies were performed as to establish new research pattern. It will be ofgreat signi cance to include Q-marker in TCM clinical trials in the future ( Zhang T et al., 2018 ). Additional attentions should be paid on TCHM speci cc l i n i c a l values and the scienti cr e p o r t s( Hu, 2021 ). In recent years, the relevant laws and regulations in China highly highlighted theTCHM speci c clinical values. What are TCHM speci cc l i n i c a l values, and how to scienti cally express them are very critical questions. It can be said that this is one of the questions related tothe \"life-gate \"of high-quality development of TCHM industry. When facing the requirement for TCHM caused by deep aging, health issuescaused by chronic non-communicable diseases, and threats frominfectious diseases such as COVID-19, everyone are anticipatingsolutions from TCHM. However, comparing with the heatedextolling of TCHM, the TCHM industry showed falling tendency in recent years, of which one important reason is that the speci c clinical value has not been clearly described. TCHM has speci c characteristics; however, acknowledged expression methods arerequired to describe the TCHM speci c clinical values, which could help the mass to better understand. The clari cation and description of clinical ef cacy are the keys, instead of the mechanisms of effects. Artemisinin has already won the Nobel Prize, while the mechanisms ofeffects are still under investigation. The scienti c evidence of clinical efcacy could be various, and the description of clinical values of TCHM should not only based on the results of randomized controlledtrials, but also from other sources, such as case report, classicliteratures, and records of clinical experience. The founder ofevidence-based medicine, Gordon Guyatt, said that any empirical observations could be served as potential evidence, regardless of thesystemic collection of it ( Guyatt G et al., 2008 ). The focus of the innovation in the new TCHM reviewing and approval is the \"three combinations \"of clinical trials, human experience, and TCM theories. We speculated that systemically digging and scienti cally evaluating the multidimensional evidence reaching the same study conclusion are worth encouraging. However, we need to further free our minds onhow to promote the implement of rele vant policies, which could free us from the limitations of randomized clinical trials. In recent years, China has increased the investment on TCHM, and the internationalization of TCHM are now embracing the all-round, tridimensional, multi-level development, as a result of thepromotion of \"Belt and Road Initiative \"construction and accelerated overseas layout of leading enterprises of TCHM. Despite the various challenges of integration of standards, policybarriers, and protection of intellectual property, TCHMinternationalization has much to do and a long way to go, butstill has a bright future.
