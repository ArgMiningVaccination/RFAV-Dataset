Naturopathic medicine focuses on treating the cause of your disease, not just the symptoms. By taking a deeper look into what is causing your symptoms, we can stop disease from recurring and prevent it from spreading to different areas of the body. Naturopathic physicans are trained in starndard allopathic medicine, as well as receiving additional training in herbal medicine, physical medicine, homeopathic medicine, counseling, and nutritional medicine. This holistic training allows ND's to look at the whole picture of someone's health. "}
