Marisol is a world expert on the topic and founder of Queen of Thrones, a maker of heatless, less-mess castor oil packs. You may not think there's that much to cover about castor oil, but it has an amazing array of benefits! Castor oil has uses ranging from beauty to hormones to health and so much more. I've used castor oil before to help grow my eyelashes (with great success!) and for a few other things, but after our chat today, I learned of even more ways to use it! Marisol shares how castor oil is uniquely good for the skin because it penetrates the dermis (many oils can't). This makes it a great option for post-tattoo care, skin elasticity, and oil cleansing. Its benefits are more than skin deep though.

We cover a wide array of castor oil benefits and practical ways you can start incorporating it into your daily routine. So let's dive in!
