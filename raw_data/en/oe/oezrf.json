OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 307 RIN 3206-AE59 Veterans Readjustment Appointments AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management is issuing a final rule to reflect statutory changes in the Veterans Readjustment Appointment (VRA) authority. The Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992, approved October 29, 1992, includes a provision to restore eligibility to Vietnam-era veterans for Federal employment under the VRA authority. The new law puts Vietnam-era service on equal footing with post-Vietnam-era service in qualifying for the VRA program, simplifies the eligibility requirements, and enables Federal agencies to make greater use of the VRA authority by expanding the pool of VRA eligibles. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 24, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas O'Connor, (202) 606-1407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has responsibility for implementing the VRA program as provided by the initial statute, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended (38 U.S.C. 4214). Accordingly, OPM is required by law to issue and amend regulations governing the VRA program. The VRA program reflects the nation's continuing interest in enhancing employment opportunities for Vietnam- era and post-Vietnam-era veterans. The VRA program is intended to meet the unique needs of veterans in the labor market, and to enable Federal agencies -to hire needed talent quickly.The VRA is an excepted appointment to a position otherwise in the competitive service that, prior to the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992, Public Law 102-568, had been available to most post-Vietnam-era veterans but only to those Vietnam-era veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability, a separation from active duty for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, or a campaign or expeditionary medal for service during the Vietnam era. The new law eliminates those restrictions on Vietnam-era veterans. The term \"Vietnam-era\" refers to the period beginning August 5, 1964, and ending on May 7, 1975; the term \"post-Vietnam era\" refers to the period after May 7, 1975. The VRA program was established in 1970 to help recently discharged Vietnam-era veterans who lacked marketable skills \"readjust\" by making it easier for them to obtain civil service employment. The VRA authority has been amended at various times over the years, with the primary concern being to provide a helping hand to the more recent service members. However, there was concern that the amendments of 1989 and 1991 to extend the program to veterans serving after the Vietnam era, had an adverse impact on Vietnam-era veterans by restricting their eligibility. As a result, the Office of Personnel Management asked Congress to put Vietnam-era service on equal footing with post-Vietnam-era service as qualifying for the VRA program. Congress agreed, and passed the amending legislation. The regulations are also amended to reflect the modification of the definitions of VRA eligibility made by Public Laws 102-16 and 102-127. OPM published interim rules in the Federal Register (58 FR 12145) on March 3, 1993. Two comments were received. One agency recommended granting VRA eligibility to pre-Vietnam- era veterans. OPM cannot do this by regulation because VRA eligibility is defined by statute. Another agency suggested describing the VRA as a noncompetitive appointment. This would not be correct because the VRA is an excepted appointment. The noncompetitive aspect consists of the conversion to career-conditional appointment that follows, providedperformance is successful, 2 years after the VRA appointment is made. OPM a1o has supplemented the new law with guidance issued through Federal Personnel Manual Letter 307- 17, February 12, 1993. E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined in E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it applies only to Federal Government employment practices. List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 307 Government employees, Veterans. U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Patricia W. Lattimore, Acting Deputy Director. PART 307-VETERANS READJUSTMENT APPOINTMENTS Accordingly, OPM is adopting its interim regulations amending 5 CFR part 307 which were published at 58 FR 12145 on March 3, 1993, as final regulations without change. IFR Dec. 93-20439 Filed 8-24-93; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6325-01-M DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 319 [Docket No. 92-180-2] Importation of Corn Seed From New Zealand AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the regulations concerning the importation of corn to allow seed of Indian corn or maize (Zea mays L.) that is free from the cob and from all other parts of the corn to be imported into the United States from New Zealand. This action is warranted because pest risk analyses indicate that injurious plant diseases of concern to U.S. agriculture are not disseminated by such corn seed. This 44744 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 /Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations action relieves restrictions on the importation of corn seed from New Zealand, providing U.S. seed developers with a winter generation of corn seed to help speed the development of new seed varieties. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 18, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Peter M. Grosser, Senior Operations Officer, Port Operations, PPQ, APHIS, USDA, room 632, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest MD 20782, The-regulations in 7 CFR 319.24 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation into the United States of seed and all other portions of maize or Indian corn (Zea mays L.), and closely related plants, in the raw or unmanufactured state. Section 319.24(a) lists countries in which diseases occur that are injurious to such corn and closely related plants, and lists some of those diseases. Section 319.24(b) lists countries from which the importation of seed and all other portions of maize or Indian corn (Zea mays L.), and closely related plants, is generally prohibited because of the diseases of such corn listed in paragraph (a) and other diseases. Prior to the effective date of this final rule, New Zealand was among the countries listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of \u00a7 319.24. On June 10, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 32456-32458, Docket No. 92-180-1) a proposal to amend the regulations to allow seed of Indian corn or maize (Zea mays L.) that is free from the cob and from all other parts of corn to be imported from New Zealand into the United States. Also, we proposed to remove New Zealand from the list in \u00a7 319.24(a) of countries in which certain injurious diseases of such corn and closely related plants occur. These actions are warranted because pest risk analyses show that corn in New Zealand is pot affected by the injurious diseases specifically listed in \u00a7 319.24(a) and we believe that any other plant diseases affecting corn or other plants in New Zealand would not be carried by corn seed. Miscellaneous The regulations in 7 CFR 319.41 govern the importation of Indian corn or maize, broomcorn, and related plants. Section 319.41-1, \"Plant products permitted entry,\" lists products of Indian corn or maize, broomcorn, and closely related plants that may be imported into the United States. In Docket No. 92'-180-1, we also proposedto add a new paragraph (c) to \u00a7 319.41- 1, stating that seed of Indian corn or maize (Zea mays L.) that is free from the cob and from all other parts of corn may be imported into the United States from New Zealand without further restriction, in order to make this section consistent with the proposed changes in \u00a7 319.24. Finally-we proposed to amend footnote 2 in \u00a7 319.41-1. The footnote paraphrases \u00a7 319.24(b). We proposed to amend this footnote to reflect the proposed changes to \u00a7 319.24(b). We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending July 12, 1993. We received 1 comment by that date, from a seed trade association, which was in favor of the proposal. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule. Effective Date This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Making this rule effective immediately will allow interested seed developers to begin preparing for research activities in the 1993-94 winter season. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be made effective upon signature. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, and we have determined that it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity. innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. New Zealand is not expected to export a significant amount of corn seed to the United States for feed orindustrial use as a result of this rule. Rather, New Zealand is expected to serve as a location for off-season seed development for purposes of research. Several large U.S. corn seed companies and at least one U.S. foundation grower (a grower that develops seed for public use) grow seed in the southern hemisphere during the fall and winter seasons to help speed the development of new seed varieties. Currently, Argentina and Chile are the primary countries utilized for this purpose. In 1992, the U.S. corn seed industry had annual sales of approximately $1.5 billion. Only about 5 percent (less than $75 million) of this total was reinvested into developing new seed varieties. Of the companies making this investment, only a few used locations in the southern hemisphere for off-season seed development, and even fewer used New Zealand for this purpose. Current U.S. corn research in New Zealand is valued at around $3 million. Most of the corn seed grown by U.S. companies in New Zealand is exported to countries in Europe, and would continue to be exported there even with the implementation of this rule. However, the overall U.S. research investment in New Zealand may increase somewhat with easier importation into the United States. Most small businesses involved with corn production in the United States produce corn for feed and industrial use. There are approximately 160 small businesses in the United States that produce corn seed. Because the United States is one of the lowest-cost producers of corn in the world, these small businesses would not be threatened by imports from New Zealand. It is more expensive to grow corn in New Zealand, and transportation to the United States would add as much as 40 percent to the cost. In preparing this analysis, APHIS first considered the possibility that the rule change would give large corn seed companies an advantage over small companies that could not afford, with their smaller budgets, to take advantage of the seed development opportunities in New Zealand. Large corn seed companies are usually trying to develop new varieties of corn. As a rule, small corn seed companies are not involved in research and development, but are more interested-in taking varieties already developed, usually by foundation growers, and adapting them for local conditions. Therefore, southern hemisphere locations would not be useful to small corn seed companies, except indirectly, as these locations are No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44745 used by foundation growers. For this reason, the use of New Zealand by large corn seed developers will not put small companies at any disadvantage. As stated above, large corn seed companies are already using other southern hemisphere locations for seed development. No small businesses are known to have operations overseas. If there is a shift to more development operations in New Zealand, it will be at the expense of the other southern hemisphere locations, not at the expense of small corn seed companies in the United States. APHIS also considered the possibility that this rule would prompt New Zealand to begin producing corn seed for planting by U.S. farmers, generating competition for U.S. corn seed companies, large and small. However, as stated earlier, it is much more expensive to grow corn in New Zealand than in the United States. With the addition of transportation costs, it is highly unlikely that importation of corn seed grown by New Zealand companies will pose any threat to U.S. companies. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has' determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule., Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its loan making regulations to extend the period of time that an applicant may be eligible for direct and guaranteed farm operating, farm ownership, and soil and water loans to five years. This action is necessary to implement a provision of the Agricultural Credit Improvement Act of 1992, dated October 28, 1992. The intended effect is to reduce the amount of time needed to process Farmer Programs loan applications and reduce the amount of burden on County Office personnel, lenders, and the County Committee. DATES: Interim rule effective August 25, 1993. Written comments must be submitted on or before September 24, 1993. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments, in duplicate, to the Office of the Chief, Regulations Analysis and Control Branch, FmHA, USDA, room 6348-S, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250. All written comments made pursuant to this rule will be available for public inspection during regular working hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Karen D. Eifert, Senior Loan Officer, Farmer Programs Loan Making Division, FmHA, USDA, room 5438-S, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250; telephone (202) 720-3889. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification This action was reviewed under USDA procedures established in Departmental Regulation 1512-1, which implements Executive Order 12291, and has been determined to be nonmajor because it will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Intergovernmental Consultation For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to Notice 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, and FmHA Instruction 1940-J, \"Intergovernmental Review of FmHAFederal -Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Programs and Activities\" (December 23, 1983), farm ownership loans and farm operating loans are excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. The soil and water loan program, however, is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372. Programs Affected These changes affect the following FmHA programs, as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 10.406-Farm Operating Loans 10.407-Farm Ownership Loans 10.416--Soil and Water Loans Environmental Impact Statement This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, \"Environmental Program.\" The FmHA has determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. Discussion of the Interim Rule Farm loans made to FmHA applicants are governed mainly by the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT; 7 U.S.C. 1921, et seq.). Present loan making regulations require the County Committee to determine an applicant's eligibility status for each loan requested, with the eligibility determination remaining valid for that loan only. It is the policy of this Department to publish, for comment, rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, and contracts, notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. This action, however, is not published for proposed rule making because a statutory change made by section 12 of the Agricultural Credit Improvement Act of 1992 (Act) to section 333 of the CONACT necessitates amendment of Farmer Programs direct and guaranteed loan making regulations, and section 23 of the Act specifically requires publication of an interim rule. Section 12 authorizes the County Committee to extend an applicant's eligibility to a period not to exceed five years. Upon determination by the County Committee that an applicant is eligible for a particular type of loan, any subsequent requests submitted by the applicant for the same type of assistance will not require County Committee action if the request is approved less than five years from the date of theoriginal County Committee determination. However, if FmHA determines that the applicant's situation has changed significantly since the Committee's determination, the request will be presented to the County Committee for a new eligibility determination. The applicant will be notified in writing if the request is presented to the County Committee again. This action is not appealable; however, any ultimate denial of a loan guarantee would trigger appeal rights. This will provide some assurance that applicants who do not meet the eligibility requirements at the time of the loan request will not receive assistance. The eligibility will be determined by loan type because eligibility criteria vary slightly between loan types. For instance, an applicant for a farm ownership loan must be owner-operator of the farm after loan closing, while an applicant for a farm operating loan must be the owner- operator OR tenant-operator after loan closing. Emergency loan applicants are excluded from the five-year eligibility period because two of the eligibility requirements for emergency loans mandate that an applicant operate in a designated or contiguous disaster area and suffer a qualifying production and/ or physical loss. The Committee cannot certify that an applicant will meet these requirements for any length of time. Therefore, eligibility determinations for emergency loans will continue to be made by the County Committee for each loan application, as set forth in \u00a7 1945.180 of subpart D of part 1945 of this chapter. Eligibility and ineligibility determinations by the County Committee are appealable in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter, and applicants are given their appeal rights when notified in writing of an unfavorable Committee determination. This rule is intended to minimize the administrative burden on the Agency and County Committee and decrease the timeframe for processing applications. These revisions will allow an applicant to remain eligible for FmHA farm operating, farm ownership, and soil and water loan assistance, as determined by the County Committee, for five years in most cases. FmHA and the County Committee will no longer be required to review every application for eligibility from an applicant already determined eligible. References to \"insured loans\" in the regulation texts have been changed to read \"direct loans\" to reflect changes in terminology required by the Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.). Provisions also are added toensure that each lender and loan applicant is notified of eligibility or ineligibility within 5 calendar days of the County Committee's determination. This revision is intended to provide more timely processing of applications within a reasonable period of time.

Section 1910.4(g) is revised to read as follows: \u00a7 1910.4 Processing applications. (g) Determining eligibility. The County Committee will determine eligibility of all Farmer Programs applicants including RH applicants who are also applying for a Farmer Programs loan, or who are already indebted for a Farmer Programs loan. The Farmer Programs application does not need to be complete before it is reviewed by the County Committee; however, all44746 Federal Register / Vol. 58, Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 1' Rules and Regulations 44747 information relative to the eligibility decision must be received. The County Supervisor will determine eligibility for all other RH applicants. (1) The County Committee will certify whether or not the applicant meets the eligibility requirements and whether or not the applicant is a beginning farmer or rancher, as defined in \u00a7 1955.103 of subpart C of part 1955 of this chapter, by use of Form FmHA 440-2, \"County Committee Certification or Recommendation.\" An eligible FO applicant requesting to purchase suitable farmland, who is considered a beginning farmer or rancher, will be given priority as outlined in \u00a7 1955.107(f) of subpart C of part 1955 of this chapter. In addition, it is the responsibility of the County Committee to determine whether or not the applicant is an operator of not larger than a family size farm, as of the time immediately after the contract of sale or lease is entered into, even though the applicant is not in need of FmHA credit assistance on eligible rates and terms to purchase suitable farmland. The County Committee will not determine the applicant's projected repayment ability, or the adequacy of collateral equity to secure the requested loan(s), or the feasibility of the proposed operation. These decisions must be made by the loan approval official. (2) Eligible applicants will remain eligible for Farmer Programs loans for a period of five years from the date of the most current Form FmHA 440-2, subject to the following guidelines: (i) The eligibility period for emergency loans is valid only for each application submitted, in accordance with \u00a7 1945.180 of subpart D of part 1945 of this chapter. (ii) For OL, FO, and SW loans, the five-year eligibility period is valid by loan type (e.g., OL, FO, or SW). The exact dates of the period of eligibility will be documented on the Form FmHA 440-2. Loans must be approved prior to the end of the period of eligibility. (iii) Subsequent requests for loan assistance within the eligibility period from an applicant who has previously been determined eligible for the same type of assistance do not need to be reviewed by the Committee unless the County Supervisor has determined that the applicant's situation has changed such that the eligibility determination would potentially be affected. (iv) If the County Committee is to review an application within the eligibility period, the County Supervisor will immediately notify the applicant in writing prior to the Committee review, including the reason(s) for the review. This notification is provided as acourtesy and is not appealable. The review will take place without delay. The County Supervisor will send written notice of eligibility or ineligibility to the applicant within 5 calendar days of the date of the review, along with the exact dates of the period of eligibility, as applicable. (v) If an applicant is determined eligible for a direct loan, the applicant is automatically eligible for a guaranteed loan of the same type. Likewise, an eligible determination for a guaranteed loan automatically indicates applicant eligibility for a direct loan of the same type, provided that the County Supervisor can document that alternate sources of credit are not available to the applicant with or without a guarantee. The County Supervisor must clearly document in the loan file the reason(s) the applicant is moved to direct credit in such cases. * * * * * 6. Section 1910.4(i) is amended by revising the words \"farmer program\" to read \"Farmer Programs\" in the first sentence. 7.

If the decision of eligibility is favorable, the County Supervisor will notify the applicant within 5 calendar days of the County Committee determination. For OL, FO, and SW loans, the notification will include the exact dates of the period of eligibility, in accordance with \u00a7 1910.4(g) of this subpart. For Farmer Programs, if the County Supervisor has determined the operation is feasible, the loan will be promptly processed in accordance with the applicable regulations. Care/should be exercised that the applicant clearly understands a decision of eligibility does not constitute approval of the loan. In notifying the applicant of a favorable decision on eligibility, the County Supervisor will, when necessary, schedule a meeting with the applicant to proceed with developing the loan docket. When the applicant has been determined eligible for assistance and additional information becomes available that indicates the original eligibility determination may be in error, the County Committee will reconsider the applicant, taking the new information into account. The County Committee will then recertify whether or not the applicant still meets eligibility requirements, by the use of Form FmHA 440-2. Written notificationas to the action taken will be sent to the applicant within 5 calendar days of the County Committee determination. (b) * * * (1) The County Supervisor will notify the applicant in writing of the unfavorable decision within 5 calendar days of the County Committee determination. * * * * * * * * PART 1941-OPERATING LOANS 8.

Thelen, Senior Loan Officer, Program Development Staff, USDA, FmHA, room 4918-S, South Building, Washington, DC 20250, telephone: (202) 720-0830. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification This interim rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Departmental Regulation 1512-1, which implements Executive Order 12291, and has been determined to be nonmajor because there will not be an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation; or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Sections 1922.202-1922.208 of FmHA Instruction 1922-E are being exempted from the Federal Register. FmHA believes that these sections are exempt from those requirements because they involve only internal Agency management. It is the policy of this Department to publish for comment, rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to proposed rule making. Civil Justice Reform The proposed regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2 (a) and 2 (b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling. All administrative remedies pursuant to 7CFR part 1900 subpart B must be exhausted prior to filing suit. Environmental Impact Statement This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, \"Environmental Program.\" It is the determination of FmHA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190, an Envirohmental Impact Statement is not needed. Programs Affected This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under NOS. 10.404-Emergency Loans, 10.406-Farm Operating Loans, 10.407-Farm Ownership Loans, and 10.416-Soil and Water Loans. Intergovernmental Consultation I For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to Notice, 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983) this program/activity is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Discussion of Changes 7 CFR part 1809, subpart A \"Appraisal of Farms and Leasehold\" Interests,\" is being deleted from the Federal Register and revised and renumbered to FmHA Instruction 1922, subpart E-\"Appraisal and appraising properties subject to easements\" are being published for comment. All other \u00a7\u00a7 1809.2 through 1809.8 of subpart A have been amended and placed in \u00a7\u00a7 1922.202 through 1922.208 of FmHA Instruction 1922 subpart E. The amendments were made in order to comply with FIRREA or FmHA Instruction 1922-A \"General Appraisal\" and Section llI.A.3.a. (1) of OMB Circular A-129. FmHA Instruction 1922-A and OMB Circular A-129 .require that the Agency's farm real property appraisals and reviews conform with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) Standards 1, 11, and III. Sections 1922.202 through 1922.208 are being exempted from the Federal Register since they involve internal Agency management. The following changes are being made to \u00a7\u00a7 1809.1-1809.2 of 7 CFR part 1809 subpart A:1. Section 1809.1 entitled \"General\" has been amended to include compliance and reference to Section I and II of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and will be published for comment as \u00a7 1922.201 \"General.\" 2. Section 1809.1 \"General (a)-(d)\" placed in \u00a7 \"Administrative responsibilities\" of 1922.203 entitled \"Definitions.\" Section 1922.203 includes a new definition for appraisal, and definitions for reproduction and replacement costs. 3. Section 1809.2 \"Definition of values\" was deleted and amended since references to agricultural value, Form FmHA 424-1 and other statements are no longer used in farm tract appraisals and/or are explained thoroughly in other parts of FmHA Instruction 1922- E or Sections I and II of USPAP. This amended section has been replaced with \u00a7 1922.204 \"Fundamental assumptions\" and includes those assumptions described 1809.3 (a)(1) through (4). 4. Section 1809.3 \"Basic farm valuation principles\" was deleted, revised and placed in \u00a7 1922.205 entitled \"Basic principles of real property valuation.\" A majority of the principles set out in \u00a7 1809.3 are adequately described in USPAP Sections I and II and ExhibitA of FmHA Instruction 1922-E. The now \u00a7 1922.205 will include use of 12 economic principles affecting value. The 12 principles are: Anticipation, substitution, change, competition, supply and demand, balance, conformity, externalities, contribution, highest and best use, surplus productivity and increasing and decreasing returns. 5. Section 1809.4 \"The three-way approach to market value\" has been amended to follow Sections I and II of USPAP standards. The amended information has been transferred to \u00a7 1922.206 \"Appraisal process\" value.\" Section 1922.206 is an outline of the items to complete in the appraisal process, while \u00a7 1922.207 details the three approaches as set out in USPAP. Major changes in the cost approach include authority to use either a direct method (Age-Life) or indirect method (Market extraction) in arriving at depreciation for buildings. 6. Section 1809.5 \"Normal long-term prices and costs,\" has been updated and revised to include typical prices and costs used in the Income approach. The current contents of this section are now fully described in the Income approach in \u00a7 1922.207.Federal Register / Vol. 58, 44750 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 7. Section 1809.6 \"Making the appraisal\" has been deleted and current revisions of the information are covered in Exhibit A of FmHA Instruction 1922- E. 8. Section 1809.7 \"Loan to holders of leasehold interest\" has retained as \u00a7 1922.208 \"Appraising leasehold interest.\" The major amendments include guidance on appraising land subject to Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) leasehold interests. Section 1922.208 will require that the appraiser complete a market analysis to determine if the CRP leasehold interests have any significant increase or decrease to the market value of the property before an appraisal is completed. 9. Section 1809.8 \"Preparation of appraisal report\" has been amended by deleting references to Exhibit C \"Long- Time Commodity Price Data;\" D \"Present Value of $1 PER ANNUM;\" E \"Long-Time Cost Data;\" F \"Work-out Earnings Table of Several Sales;\" and G \"Guide for Preparation of Form FmHA 1922-11 Appraisal for Mineral Rights.\" Exhibits C, D, E, and F are outdated and no longer applicable under USPAP standards and are no longer acceptable appraisal techniques. Exhibit G has been deleted and the information was placed in a Forms Manual Insert. The form will continue to be used. Discussion of the Interim Rule It is the policy of this Department to publish notice of proposed rulemaking with a comment period before rules are issued, even though 5 U.S.C. Section 553 exempts rules relating to loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. However, exemptions are permitted where an agency finds, for good cause, that compliance would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Sections 1922.202 through 1922.208 of FmHA Instruction 1922-E are being revised and omitted from the Federal Register since they involve only internal Agency management. Sections 1922.201 and 1922.209 are being published for comment. Section 1922.201 requires that FmHA farm tract appraisals be performed in accordance with Sections I and II of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP). These sections of USPAP and Section III were published as Interim Common Rule in the Federal Register (See 55 FR 53610 No. 251 dated 12/31/90) by the following Agencies and Departments: (1) Department of Treasury-Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 12 CFR part 34; (2) Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 CFR part 225; (3) FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation, 12 CFR part 323; (4) Department of the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision, 12 CFR part 564; (5) National Credit Union Administration, 12 CFR part 722; and (6) Resolution Trust Corporation, 12 CFR part 1608. It is intended that FmHA farm tract appraisals and reviews be performed in accordance with generally accepted appraisal standards (Sections I, II, and III) as evidenced by the standards promulgated by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation. Section 1922.209 \"Easements and appraising properties subject to easements\" is also being published for comment. This new section was added to FmHA Instruction 1922-E, in order to furnish guidelines for FmHA contract appraisers and FmHA designated appraisers. FmHA believes that the methods, concepts and guidelines to be used in the easement valuation process are germane and acceptable to those promulgated by real estate appraisal foundations, alliances, institutes, and societies in the United States. FmHA is making this action effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, without prior public comment. FmHA has concluded that there is a. need to provide immediate guidance to FmHA designated appraisers and FmHA contract appraisers, concerning the use of the uniform standards as set out in Sections 1, 11, and I1 of USPAP. This emergency action is necessary since most States have enacted legislation and have implemented FIRREA. Most States implemented FIRREA on January 1, 1993; thus, the USPAP standards have to be adhered to by all appraisers when completing real property appraisals. This also means that such appraisers obtain or complete certain educational courses and testing for the appropriate State certificate or license. Further delays by FmHA will have a very real adverse impact on FmHA borrowers and loan applicants. Delays will allow FmHA contract appraisers, some guaranteed lenders and FmHA designated appraisers to use outdated techniques and methods when appraising farm real property. The continued use of outdated, nonuniform appraisal techniques will assuredly cause such appraisals to be appealed and ultimately reversed, since they may not have been completed within USPAP standards. Such actions will cause undue hardship and delays for many FmHA borrowers and Farmer Program loan applicants.Lists of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 1809, 1823, 1922, 1941, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1951, 1955, 1965, 1980 Accounting servicing, Agriculture, Credit, Crops, Debt restructuring, Disaster assistance, Farm labor housing.

(a) Easements. Easements represent an interest in real property that conveys use, but not ownership, of a portion of an owner's property. Easements frequently permit a specific portion of a property to be used for access to an adjoining property or as a public right- of-way. Although surface easements are the most common, subterranean and overhead easements are used for public utilities, roadways, bridges, air rights, etc. Basic easement valuation concepts are as follows: (1) A property that acquires an easement is the beneficiary of additional rights; one that is subject to an easement is burdened. Easement rights can be conveyed in perpetuity or for a limited time period. An easement can be created by a contract between private parties or it can be arranged by states, municipalities, or public utilities through the exercise of eminent'domain. In any case, a valuation is needed to estimate the price the easement beneficiary should pay to the burdened party. (2) An easement that affords ingress and egress to an otherwise landlocked parcel may increase its value. The value of an easement is usually estimated as some part of the amount of value it adds to the property it benefits; the burdened property's loss in value can also be used to indicate the value of an easement. The value of an easement reflects the basic economic concept of contribution. (3) When an easement is acquired by a public utility company for overhead power lines, valuation becomes more complicated. In all cases, however, an easement is a partial interest in the burdened real estate property. (4) Preservation easements, such as conservation easements, prohibit physical changes to the property. Usually, the owner must maintain the condition of the property at the time the easement is donated or immediately after a proposed restoration. The economic theory that underlies thevaluation of preservation easements is generally the same as that which governs eminent domain appraising, although the acquirer of a preservation easement receives rather than takes rights. Each easement document contains specific controls and restrictions. An appraiser must carefully analyze easement restrictions or proposed restrictions to determine how it affects the property. Damage to the reniaining property is the difference in the value of the remainder as a part of the whole, or its value before the easement, and the value of the remaining property after the easement before consideration of compensation. The amount of compensation is determined by subtracting the Value of the remaining property after the easement, before compensation, from the value of the remaining property after easement, after compensation. (5) Frontage easements (roads or underground water pipes, electricity, communication lines) can contribute to the value of the property. Rights considered consist of both subsurface and surface rights. Fair or just compensation consists of compensation for: The taking and use of the subsurface; the cost of replenishing any items destroyed (lawns, bushes, etc.); and any inconvenience or interruption during installation and later maintenance. Detailed market analysis may be completed to determine the value of the easement. Usually, 1 percent of the fair market value is adequate compensation for property taken. It may be higher when subsurface property has considerable disruption factors. (6) Oil, gas, pipeline and powerline easements crossing property can be determined by two approaches. The appraiser can find comparable sales of land and narrow strips of land that have been sold or purchased in the market and tabulate the prices received and paid, or use the before and after values as set out in paragraph (b) of this section. Most landowners realize that a taking agency should pay no more than what it has paid others to acquire similar easements needed in the same area or what other landowners have accepted as compensation for the same kind of rights. (b) Appraising property subject to easements. (1) When there is an established traditional market for properties containing conservation or other easements, value of the property subject to the easement can be determined through the normal appraisal process outlined in \u00a7 1922.207 of this subpart.(2) If there is no established traditional market (market value for the easement) for properties containing conservation or other easements, value of the property subject to the easement can be determined as outlined ,i paragraph (d) of this section. When there is an existing easement on the subject property, the before valuation will be completed assuming there is no easement on the property. The after valuation will be the market value of the property subject to an easement. (c) Appraising property with no established market for easements. In most cases, there is no established traditional market for conservation easements or other easements. These interests must be valued indirectlythrough the Before and After method of appraisal. The Before and After method is used to determine whether, and the degree to which, an easement changes a property's use and value. The value of property after the imposition of the easement is subtracted from the value of the property before the imposition of the easement to estimate the value of the easement. Each value conclusion is made as of the same date. The following steps will be used to determine the value of easements to the subject property being appraised, i.e., if there is. no traditional market for the easement available: (1) Before valuation. (i) Apply highest and best use principles. (A) Determine the property's highest and best use in its current condition unrestricted by the easement (the \"Before\" value). Generally, in this step the appraiser considers the suitability of the property's current use under existing zoning and market conditions and estimates the reasonable likelihood of a change in use (and the associated direct and indirect costs and delay), absent the easement, to realize a more profitable economic use. (B) Evaluate potential for continuation of existing use and alternative uses. Under this step the appraiser estimates the property's potential for continuation of existing use, if its existing use or realistic alternative uses generate greater value. Alternative uses may include, if appropriate, either existing improvements or as vacant land which may include the following: Subdivision, Redevelopment, Renovation, Flooding, or Timbering. (C) Estimate remoteness of eventual zoning changes. Under this analysis, the appraiser must consider future changes in zoning. The quantification for the supported future probability of a change must be recognized in the market place 44752 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 163 I Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations and supported by quantification-both statistical and anecdotal. Hypothetically, value added to land by possibilities of development is not an appropriate pre-easement consideration, unless factually supported in the report. (ii) Apply the three recognized approaches to value. This will be accomplished as set out in \u00a7 1922.207 of this subpart. The appraiser will apply, as appropriate, the three approaches to the \"Before\" value to estimate the value of the property without restrictions or not being encumbered by the easement. Comparable properties used should not be encumbered by the easement. All factors must be analyzed in view of the current local market, which if necessary, reflects foreseeable trends reflected in the market place, such as rezonings, demolition permits, subdivision approvals, leases, etc. The three approaches should be used whenever possible to estimate the value of an easement. For each method not used, the appraiser must explain why the omitted method is not applicable. (2) After valuation. (i) Determining highest and best use by comparing easement covenants to existing zoning regulations and other controls. The appraiser must analyze the easement terms and covenants, individually and collectively, and compare them to existing zoning regulations and other controls to estimate whether, and the extent to which, the use restrictions contained in the easement will affect current and alternate future uses of the property. Examples of pre-existing controls include local regulations, such as agricultural or historic district zones; statewide regulations, such as land-gain taxes to deter land speculation; and Federal limitations, such as flood plain controls or the necessity to obtain environmental or historic preservation reviews for federally licensed or assisted projects encumbered or restricted by the easement. (ii) Changes in highest and best use. Easement restrictions may be reflected in the three approaches to value even without a change in highest and best use. Under the Comparable Sales approach to value, a well informed purchaser would consider the immediate and long term costs of complying with the easement and pay less for a restricted property than for otherwise comparable unrestricted properties. Similarly, the Cost and Income approaches may indicate immediate and long term value impairment attributable to the easement. The change in market value attributable to an easement is frequently greater on properties in those agricultural,recreational, residential, or commercial areas that are experiencing a change in highest and best use. Where current use is commensurate with highest and best use, an easement perpetually limiting use of the property to current use may have nominal value. (iii) Apply the three approaches to value. This will be accomplished as set out in \u00a7 1922.207 of this subpart. The appraiser will apply the Comparable Sales, Cost, and Income approaches as appropriate to estimate the value of the property as encumbered or restricted by the easement. Comparable properties used would be subject to the type of easement appraised. Market abstractions, market analysis as well as feasibility analysis should be made part of this report. The three approaches should be used whenever possible to estimate the value for an easement. For each method not used, the appraiser must explain -vhy the omitted method is not applicable. (d) Arriving at the estimated value of the easement. The Recommended Market Value of the property arrived at from the After valuation is subtracted from the Before valuation to arrive at the estimated value of the easement. (e) Arriving at the Recommended Market Value of the property subject to an easement. The Recommended Market Value of the property will be the .Recommended Market Value of the property arrived at from the After valuation approach. \u00a7\u00a7 1922.210-1922.250 [Reserved] 5. 7 CFR chapter XVIII is amended by revising the numerals \"422-1\" to read \"1922-1\" in the following places: a.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule implements the penalty provisions contained in section 153 of title 23, United States Code, as enacted by section 1031 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Section 153 provides that a State that fails to adopt and put into effect motorcycle helmet and safety belt use laws before October 1, 1993 is subject to having the Secretary of Transportation transfer funds apportioned under the State's Federal-aid highway programs to its apportionment under the section 402 highway safety program. This rule sets forth the criteria to be use to determine a State's compliance with the Act and the mechanism by which NHTSA and FHWA (the Agencies) will inform States of their compliance status. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 24, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary Butler, Office of Regional Operations, room 5238, NHTSA, 400Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202-366-2674) or John Donaldson, Office of the Chief Counsel, room 5219, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202-366- 1834). Also, Mila Plosky, Office of Highway Safety, room 3407, FHWA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202-366-6902) or Wilbert Baccus, Office of Chief Counsel, room 4230, FHWA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202-366-0780). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Wearing safety belts and motorcycle helmets are two of the most effective actions the motoring public can take to reduce the incidence of death and serious injury from highway crashes. Section 1031 of the Intermedal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-240) (the Act) adds a new section 153 to title 23 of the United States Code which authorizes a three year incentive grant program designed to promote the passage of, and compliance with, motorcycle helmet and safety belt laws. To be eligible for funding under the Act in the first year, a State must have in effect both a law requiring all individuals on a motor cycle to wear helmets and a law requiring individuals in the front seat of passenger vehicles to wear safety belts (or be secured in child passenger safety systems). Continued eligibility for the grants is conditioned upon meeting specific compliance rates. To be eligible in the second year a State must achieve at least 75 percent compliance with its motorcycle helmet law and 50 percent compliance with its safety belt law. For the third year, a State must achieve at least 85 percent compliance with its motorcycle helmet law and 70 percent compliance with its safety belt law. If a State fails to adopt and put into effect motorcycle helmet and safety belt laws before the first day of fiscal year (FY) 1994 (October 1, 1993), section 153(h) directs the Secretary ofTransportation to transfer funds from the State's Federal-aid highway programs under each subsections 104 (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of title 23, United States Code, to the State's highway safety program under section 402 of that title. The transfer will take place in the fiscal year succeeding the year in which the State is in non- compliance. A State not in compliance throughout FY 1994 will experience a transfer of 11/z percent of its Federal highway construction funds for FY 1995. For non-compliance in FY 1995 and beyond, the transfer will rise to 3 percent for FY 1996 and thereafter. Any obligation limitation applicable to the transferred Federal-aid highway funds prior to transfer will apply, proportionately, to those funds after transfer. The transferred funds may be used for projects in any 402 program area approved in the State's Highway Safety Plan, without Federal earmarking of any amounts or percentages for specific program activities. In accordance with section 153, the Federal share of the cost of any project carried out under section 402 with the transferred funds will be 100 percent. Proposed Compliance Criteria To regulate the transfer process for FY 1995 and later years, the Agencies published a joint notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (58 FR 4622) on January 15, 1993. The NPRM proposed to apply criteria derived from those that the agency employed in awarding incentive grants for FY 1992. A State that qualified for an incentive grant for FY 1992 would be considered in compliance for transfer purposes and any State not meeting those criteria on October 1, 1993, would be in non- compliance and subject to the transfer. The law provides that, in order to avoid the transfer of funds, a State must have in effect by October 1, 1993 a law which makes unlawful throughout the State the operation of a motorcycle if any individual on the motorcycle is not wearing a motorcycle helmet and a law Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44755 which makes unlawful throughout the State the operation of a passenger vehicle whenever an individual in a front seat of the vehicle (other than a child who is secured in a child restraint system) does not have a safety belt properly fastened about the individual's body. Section 153(i) contains the following definitions: Motorcycle means a motor vehicle which is designed to travel on not more than 3 wheels in contact with the surface; Motor vehicle means any vehicle driven or drawn by mechanical power manufactured primarily for use on public highways, except any vehicle operated exclusively on a rail or rails; Passenger vehicle means a motor vehicle which is designed for transporting 10 individuals or less, including the driver, except that such term does not include a vehicle which is constructed on a truck chassis, a motorcycle, a trailer, or any motor vehicle which is not required on the date of the enactment of this section under a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard to be equipped with a belt system; Safety belt means: (a) With respect to open-body passenger vehicles, including convertible, an occupant restraint system consisting of a lap belt or a lap belt with a detachable shoulder belt; and (b) with respect to other passenger vehicles, an occupant restraint system consisting of integrated lap shoulder belts. Except for children in child restraint systems, the statute does not provide for any exemptions from application. However, the Agencies acknowledged in the NPRM that all States have exemptions written into one or both of their motorcycle helmet and safety belt laws. The Agencies stated that Congress' intent to aid States in their efforts to achieve higher safety belt and motorcycle helmet use and to enact and maintain use laws would not be served by reading the statute so literally as to impose a penalty upon all States whose laws contain any exemptions. On the other hand, some exemptions are either incompatible with the language of the statute or would so undermine the safety considerations underlying the statute that States whose laws contain such exemptions should be subject to the penalties contained in the Act. The Agencies reviewed existing State safety belt laws and proposed in the NPRM to permit exemptions covering persons with medical excuses; postal, utility and other commercial drivers who make frequent stops in the course of their business; emergency vehicleoperators and passengers; persons riding in positions not equipped with safety belts; persons in public and livery conveyances; persons riding in parade vehicles; persons in the custody of police; persons in vehicles not required to have shoulder belts in front, and passengers of certain larger, heavier. vehicles. The Agencies also proposed to permit exemptions from motorcycle helmet laws, such as for riders in enclosed cabs. The Agencies explained that these exemptions would apply in situations of very low risk or where exigent justifications exist. The Agencies proposed to consider the following exemptions incompatiblewith the statute: 1. Motorcycle helmet laws of less than universal application, such as laws which apply only to minors or novice motorcycle operators; 2. Safety belt laws which exempt vehicles equipped with air bags. The agency reasoned that a motorcycle helmet law exempting a significant percentage of riders from its coverage is wholly inconsistent with the statute, and would result in large numbers of riders being exposed to serious risk. Similarly, a law exempting persons in vehicles equipped with air bags would leave large numbers of persons at risk in side impact and rollover crashes---crashes for which air bags provide little or no protection-and would diminish occupant protection even in frontal crashes. The Agencies further proposed that any State considering an exemption other than one identified as acceptable should anticipate that the agency would review the exemption in accordance with these principles. As an example of an unacceptable exemption, the Agencies described a provision calling for secondary enforcement of a motorcycle helmet law. Under such a system, a rider may not be cited for failure to wear a helmet unless stopped by a law enforcement officer for another reason. The Agencies states that they would consider a State helmet law with only secondary enforcement provisions non-complying because it is likely that helmet use in a jurisdiction with such a law would be significantly lower than that typical in a State with a primary enforcement law. Notification of Compliance The Agencies proposed to notify all States of initial assessments of compliance with section 153 for FY 1994 by September 30, 1993. Each State initially found not to comply would have an opportunity to rebut this initial determination. The Agencies wouldnotify all States by January 31, 1994 of their final determinations of compliance or non-compliance with section 153 for FY 1994. For FY 1995 and beyond, the Agencies proposed to notify States of initial assessments of compliance by September 15 of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which compliance was being assessed. Each State initially found not to comply would have an opportunity to rebut this initial determination. The Agencies would notify all States by October 10 of the fiscal year for which compliance was being assessed of its final determinations of compliance or non- compliance with section 153 for that fiscal year. None of the commenters to the NPRM questioned the Agencies' proposed procedures for informing the States of their compliance status. However, in order to simplify the Federal notification procedures, the Agencies have made some changes. These changes are for the administrative convenience of the Agencies, and will not result in any additional burden to the States. For FY 1994, the States will continue to be notified of initial assessihents of compliance and have the opportunity to contest negative initial determinations, in accordance with the procedures and the timeframes set forth in the NPRM. However, notification of final compliance status will be provided only to those States initially found to be in non-compliance. Those States initially found to be in compliance will receive no additional notice, and may rely on the initial notice as a final determination. For FY 1995 and beyond, the relevant information will be provided through the various notices of apportionment required under section 104(e) of title 23, United States Code. This process has been used successfully in regulations implementing the National Minimum Drinking Age Law (23.U.S.C. 158), which is structured similarly to section 153. Discussion of Comments The Agencies received responses to the NPRM from advocacy organizations and associations, State government agencies, members of Congress, and individuals. Commenters focused on the differences between safety belt laws and helmet laws, the impacts on the \"rights\" of States and individuals, and the desirability of various exemptions. The discussion of comments is organized under topic headings below. 44756 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 I Wednesday, August 25, 1993 I Rules and Regulations Differing Treatment of Safety Belt and Motorcycle Helmet Laws In the NPRM, the Agencies proposed, consistent with the grant application procedures distributed to the States, that a State motorcycle helmet law with only secondary enforcement provisions would not comply with the requirements of section 153. In contrast, the Agencies have previously accepted safety belt laws with secondary enforcement provisions, when evaluating State laws for compliance with the requirements of section 153. Many commenters criticized this difference in enforcement approach. Several commenters argued that the statutory language does not support such a different treatment. Others questioned why the Agencies' argument that a primary enforcement law for helmets would be more effective than a secondary enforcement law could not be applied equally to safety belts. One commenter argued that the assumption of lower helmet use under a secondary enforcement law was purely speculative, since no such laws exist on which to base that assumption. Many commenters complained that requiring a primary enforcement approach for helmet laws, but not for safety belt laws, unfairly discriminates against motorcycle riders. Citing 1990 statistics from NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System, some of these commenters'stated that there were 15 times more fatal crashes involving passenger cars and light trucks than those involving motorcycles. Relying on these statistics, they argued that. maintaining the primary/secondary enforcement distinction between the two laws \"ignores the true traffic fatality problem as shown by the statistics.\" Moreover, they pointed out that safety belts, for which the Agencies allow a less stringent standard of enforcement, offer a greater degree of protection (head, chest, abdomen, and extremities) than do helmets (head only). The commenters varied in their proposed solution, some urging that secondary enforcement provisions be acceptable for both laws, others seeking a uniform primary enforcement standard, and still others supporting the agencies' proposal in the NPRM. A few commenters were fundamentally opposed to the requirements and any accompanying enforcement provisions. One commenter supporting primary enforcement for both laws argued, with respect to helmet laws in particular, that there was no rationale for a secondary enforcement provision, because compliance with the law is visuallyapparent without the need for investigative activity. Another commenter disagreed with any requirement for safety belt use, regardless of the enforcement level, arguing that buckling up has not decreased the absolute number of deaths and injuries, but merely shifted the distribution from the non-belted to the belted population. Still another commenter stated that driver and rider education concerning vehicle control and alcohol and drug use is more important to achieving highway safety gains than are safety belt and helmet laws. The authors of section 153, Representative Jim Cooper and Senator John Chafee, pointed out that prior to the existence of section 153 both primary and secondary enforcement safety belt laws existed, and each of these had a proven record of increasing safety belt use. However, there was no record to demonstrate the effectiveness of secondary enforcement helmet laws, as no State had passed such a law. In support of the Agencies' proposal, they argued that the intent of the legislation was to require each State to pass a universal motorcycle helmet law that is enforced under all circumstances and that, in their view, secondary enforcement provisions would be as ineffective as age specific laws in attaining this goal. The Agencies have carefully considered each of these comments in light of the statutory provision and the circumstances surrounding its enactment. In drafting section 153, Congress was guided by existing State safety belt and helmet laws. Helmet laws were on the books long before the first safety belt law, and all existing helmet laws are primary. They are readily enforceable since helmet use is easily observed without the need to stop the vehicle. Conversely, States evolved the concept of secondary enforcement for safety belt laws because belt use is not easily observed from outside the vehicle. Lawmakers were concerned that, in enforcing primary safety belt laws, police would make too many \"false\" stops. In short, the reasons underlying the choice of enforcement mechanism have historically been different for the two laws, and should not be ignored. Helmet use in States that currently have universal laws (all are primary enforcement laws) is at the 95 to 100 percent level. There is precedent, however, that a weakening of Federal requirements could reduce this usage. In 1975, 47 States and the District of Columbia had passed primary enforcement laws requiring every riderto wear a helmet. With the 1976 removal of Federal sanction authority for States' failure to adopt highway safety standards (including motorcycle safety), 28 States weakened (e.g., by introducing age-specific limitations) or repealed their motorcycle helmet laws between 1976 and 1980. Comparing 1980 to 1975 (the year before repeals began), motorcycle fatalities increased 61 percent while motorcycle registrations increased only 15 percent. Based on past precedent, the Agencies are concerned that the acceptance of secondary enforcement helmet laws would result in a reduction in safety, compared to what could be achieved with primary enforcement helmet laws. We agree with Representative Cooper and Senator Chafee that the difference between primary and secondary enforcement helmet laws would likely be measurable in numbers of helmets worn, and consequently in deaths, injuries, and health care costs. To reiterate a point made in the NPRM, every percentage point in lost helmet usage represents riders who will be at greater risk of fatal or serious injury. The comment that there were 15 times (the correct figure, based on 1990 data from the Fatal Accident Reporting System, is actually 11 times) more fatal crashes involving cars and light trucks than those involving motorcycles in 1990 needs to be placed in perspective. This disparity follows naturally from the fact that there are many more cars and light trucks on the road than there are motorcycles. Motorcycles make up only 2 percent of all registered vehicles in the United States and account for only 0.5 percent of all vehicles miles traveled. However, per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclists are about 20 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle crash than are passenger car occupants. Moreover, though motorcyclists were involved in only 1 percent of all police- reported motor vehicle crashes in 1991, they accounted for 8 percent of all occupant fatalities and almost 7 percent of total traffic fatalities. Clearly, riding a motorcycle is a very high risk form of transportation in the normal traffic environment, and it is even more risky without a helmet. NHTSA estimates that an unhelmeted motorcyclist is 40 percent more likely to incur a fatal head injury and 15 percent more likely to incur a non-fatal head injury than a helmeted motorcyclist when involved in a crash. In light of the overwhelmingly disproportionate involvement of motorcycle riders in fatal crashes, as compared to occupants of other motor vehicles, the Agencies do not believe44756 Federal Register / Vol. 58,No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44757 that requiring helmet laws to be primary enforcement laws, while accepting secondary epforcement provisions for safety belt laws, unfairly discriminates against motorcyclists. Moreover, given past precedent, the Agencies are concerned that secondary enforcement helmet laws will result in substantially reduced compliance from that which could be achieved with primary enforcement helmet laws. Consequently, the Agencies will not accept secondary compliance helmet laws -as complying with section 153. The comment regarding the relative degree of protection offered by safety belts, as compared to motorcycle helmets, is irrelevant to this determination, as the two safety devices are unique to the vehicles in which they are employed. The argument that safety belt use has merely shifted deaths and injuries from the non-belted to the belted population obscures the lifesaving record of safety belts. Such a shift is to be expected as more people buckle up. Indeed, if 100 percent of motorists wore safety belts, 100 percent of the observed fatalities would consist of belted victims. However, the important point is that there has been a consistent correlation between safety belt use and lives saved or serious injuries a-voided. Numerous research studies confirm that lap and shoulder safety belts worn by front seat passenger car occupants reduce the risk of fatal injury by 45 percent and the risk of moderate to critical injuries by 50 percent. The Agencies agree with the comment that driver and rider education can have an important role in reducing crashes and injuries. Indeed, motorist education programs have always played an important role in achieving NHTSA's mission. However, the purpose of this rule is to implement those provisions of section 153 concerning the adoption of safety belts and motorcycle helmet laws. The States are free to pursue education programs in further achievement of traffic safety objectives, and may even do so under the incentive grant provisions of section 153. States'Rights and Individual Freedom Several commenters argued, variously, that the proposed provisions interfere with the States' right to determine the best laws for their citizenry, trample on individuals' freedom of choice or privacy interests, overreach Congressional intent, or impose an unreasonable mandate on State legislatures. There is little question that safety laws impose some degree of control on the lives of individuals, because they require actions that some people do nottake voluntarily. Nevertheless, the legitimacy of most traffic laws (e.g., driving on the right side of the road, speed limits, traffic signals) is readily accepted, because we recognize that -failure to obey these laws results in serious risks to ourselves and to others. Similar risks exist when individuals fail to buckle up or wear motorcycle helmets, because traffic crashes have many victims-family, friends, employers, and taxpayers-all of whom bear some measure of the human and economic cost. Arguments concerning individual freedom or States' rights fail to recognize the tremendous costs to society and to the nation associated with the carnage on our highways. Motor vehicle crashes cost society more than $137 billion each year, and are the leading cause of death for persons aged 6 to 33. In 1992, alone, 21,366 people died in passenger cars and 2,394 people died riding motorcycles. Many of these deaths might have been prevented, had the victizns been belted or helmeted. Congress recognized this terrible toll when it enacted section 153. Indeed, in the broader context, the effect of traffic safety laws is to help individuals achieve the freedom to pursue greater challenges and liberties. The courts have consistently recognized that safety belt and helmet laws do not violate the right to privacy and other due process provisions of Federal or State constitutions, and are a proper exercise of police power because of the public interest involved. For example, in affirming the constitutionality of Iowa's safety belt law, the Iowa Supreme Court stated: We fail to see how Hartog's claimed right to decide whether to buckle up resembles those liberty interests the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized to be part of the right of privacy implicit in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. Granted, Iowa's seat belt law does restrict Hartog's freedom of choice and, in that sense, does affect his interest in liberty. The law, however, does not regulate those intimate decisions relating to marriage, procreation, child rearing, education or family that have heretofore been recognized as deserving the heightened constitutional protection. State v. Hartog, 440 N.W.2d 852, 855 (1989). In addition, studies have shown that society pays when people crash, and societal costs are greater when individuals are unprotected. The General Accounting Office, in a 1991 report reviewing a broad array of published and unpublished effectiveness studies on helmets and helmet laws, highlighted the societal costs implicated, stating that:The additional deaths and serious head injuries resulting from the nonuse of helmets impose a substantial cost burden on society. Society bears direct costs related to the treatment and rehabilitation of accident victims and indirect costs consisting primarily of lost or reduced productivity. The studies we evaluated showed that nonhelmeted, riders were more extensive users of medical services and long-term care, and were more likely to die or lose earning capacity through disability. In one sense, the care of accident victims represents a claim on society's resources regardless of how payment is made. The studies we evaluated also indicated, however, that much of the actual payment for care is made by society through tax-supported programs or insurance premiums. In light of the broad societal interests at stake, and the minimal impacts on the rights of States or individuals, the Agencies do not believe that the requirements related to acceptable safgty belt or helmet laws impose an unreasonable burden or are otherwise improper. Exemptions Several commenters suggested a different treatment of exemptions than that proposed in the NPRM. One commenter, citing an unfair burden to motorcyclists, for which the Agencies specified only one exemption, argued that similar standards should apply to both helmet and safety belt laws. That commenter believed, for example, that an exemption for medical reasons should apply under helmet laws as well as safety belt laws. Another commenter was concerned that the exemption for commercial drivers who make frequent stops might not be deemed to cover newspaper delivery persons, and requested that such persons be specifically included. There were opposing views concerning the desirability of an exemption for motorcyclists in enclosed cabs. One commenter urged against the exemption, noting the special danger to parking enforcement officials who often use such vehicles, and that manufacturers of motorcycles with enclosed cabs recommend wearing helmets. That commenter also expressed concern about liability issues and the undermining of State efforts to require helmets in enclosed cabs. A second commenter supported the exemption, pointing out that three-wheeled electric vehicles often exhibit the safety characteristics of motor vehicles. This latter commenter suggested that a driver of such a vehicle be deemed a \"rider in an enclosed cab,\" even if the vehicle is in the convertible mode, with the cab enclosure removed, if the other safety features of the vehicle remain unaltered. No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Alternatively, the commenter suggested that a new class of vehicles be defined for the purpose of accommodating such an exemption. Two commenters sought more specificity in the Agencies' approach to exemptions. One urged that the Agencies address certain unanswered questions concerning helmet law requirements, such as whether they would apply to motorcycles ridden on private property, public rights-of-way (adjacent to public streets), public lands, non-Federal and State roads (e.g., county and private roads), or to motorcycles not in motion. The other commenter suggested that the Agencies publish in an appendix to the final rule, and update as necessary, each specific provision in State law would be found compatible with the provisions of section 153. After careful consideration of these comments, the Agencies have decided not to expand upon the exemptions identified as acceptable in the NPRM. The Agencies do not accept the notion that each of the exemptions applicable to safety belt laws should, under concepts of fairness, be applied to helmet laws, because the two laws present different problems that cannot be address by common exemptions. The Agencies also decline to change the exemption for \"commercial drivers making frequent stops.\" The existing characterization is sufficiently broad to cover a wide range of individuals engaged in bona fide stop-and-go commercial work activities, including newspaper delivery persons. Motorcyles with enclosed cabs represent a very small proportion of the motorcycle fleet and have an enclosure that helps to protect the occupant. Because of these factors, the Agencies believe that the exemption from the requirement to wear helmets would not result in the exposure of a large group of persons to serious risk. Consequently, the Agencies will accept the exemption for motorcycles with enclosed cabs. However, the acceptance of the exemption for the purpose of compliance with section 153 is in no way intended to discourage States, in the exercise of their legislative judgment, from requiring helmets to be worn in these situations. The Agencies declined to adopt the suggestion that a new class of vehicles be defined to accommodate three- wheeled electric vehicles exhibiting the safety features of motor vehicles. The universe of such vehicles is presently quite small, and the Agencies believe that special purpose vehicles of this nature should remain subject to the requirements imposed on motorcycles.Moreover, should the cab section of such a vehicle be removed, the exemption from wearing a motorcycle helmet would no longer apply, as allowing its continued application without the presence of the enclosed cab would render it essentially meaningless. Finally, the Agencies do not believe it is appropriate to specify, in an appendix or otherwise, an exhaustive list of all the exemptions of agency would find acceptable under section 153. The variety of State laws that might be passed, and the combinations of exemptions that might be encountered, make the creation of such a list problematic at best. However, the Agencies do believe that certain exemptions, which have consistently been found either acceptable or not acceptable under past practice, should be specified in the rule. Consequently, we have inserted a new \u00a7 1215.5, identifying certain exemptions discussed in the NPRM as either complying or not complying with the provisions of section 153. (Subsequent sections and cross-references are renumbered accordingly.) The new section also provides that exemptions not specifically enumerated will be carefully reviewed for compatibility with section 153. The Agencies have not included\"persons in vehicles not required to have shoulder belts in front\" or\"passengers of certain larger, heavier vehicles\" in new \u00a7 1215.5, though these provisions were referenced in the NPRM. The former provision has been deleted as unnecessary, since there is no statutory requirement to use a shoulder belt in a passenger vehicle not required to be manufactured with such a device. The latter provision is insufficiently specific to qualify as an absolute exemption for inclusion in the body of the rule. The Agencies will need to review individual State laws to determine what classes of \"larger, heavier vehicles\" are being excluded, in order to make an informed determination as to compliance. In any event, exemptions for larger, heavier vehicles falling outside the statutory definition of passenger vehicle would be acceptable. New \u00a7 1215.5 also provides that the Agencies will carefully review all other exemptions not enumerated to determine their compatibility with section 153. The Agencies do not believe that any additional specificity concerning scope or exemptions is appropriate. Consequently, details regarding the application of helmet laws on public lands and rights-of-way, State and county roads, and the like, are notarticulated in the rule. Rather, the Agencies intend that the reach of helmet laws be universal and broad, to the maximum extent of State enforcement authority. Moreover, should any of the specific exemptions identified as acceptable in this rule prove, in practice, to undermine the purposes of section 153, the Agencies will alleviate this situation in a new rulemaking procedure. Miscellaneous The Agencies wish to provide a clarification relevant to the use of transferred funds. Section 153 penalty funds are to be transferred to-a State's apportionment under section 402 of title 23, United States Code (the section 402 program) and, except where prohibited by Federal law, administered in accordance with regulations implementing the section 402 program. One such regulation (23 CFR 1252.5(a)) limits the Federal contribution for State Planning and Administration activities to a maximum of ten percent of the total funds the State receives under 23 U.S.C. 402. The impact of this provision on transferred funds is arguably ambiguous. A similar question arises with respect to the impact of the statutory requirement that 40 percent of the Federal Funds for the section 402 program are to be expended by political subdivisions of States. To clarify that both the ten percent and the 40 percent figures are to be based on all funds available for use under the section 402 program, including transferred funds, the Agencies have added a new paragraph (d) to \u00a7 1215.8 of this rule. Federalism Assessment This action has been analyzed in accordance with Executive Order 12612, concerning Federalism. The rule's provisions may affect the allocations of States' resources, the way they measure their success in traffid law enforcement, relationships among State agencies, and the distribution of Federal funds between States' highway construction and safety programs. All of these effects may fairly be regarded as Federalism impacts. However, the basic requirements of the rule (i.e., the potential redistribution of Federal funds) are mandated by statute, so the agencies do not have discretion to mitigate these impacts. The agencies have carefully considered the comments of State agencies in shaping the details of the rule. Economic and Other Effects The Agencies have analyzed the effect of this action and have determined that it is not \"major\" within the meaning of44758 Federal Register / Vol. 58, Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44759 Executive Order 12291, but that it is -\"significant\" within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. A Final Regulatory Evaluation describing in detail the expected costs and benefits from the implementation of the Act has been prepared and placed in the docket. The Agencies estimate that if all of the States without safety belt or helmet laws were to pass such laws to avoid the transfer of funds, 271 lives would be saved and there would be 5,722 fewer injuries, including 2,597 fewer moderate to critical injuries, each year. States with conforming laws will incur no costs as a result of this rulemaking action. States penalized will accrue a loss of highway construction funds, but these monies will remain in the State to be used in the State's section 402 program. For many States this will result in a doubling (or more) of the State's available section 402 funding. In any event, any costs to States resulting from the fund transfer are avoidable by passage of the requisite usage laws. The Agencies have evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The preparation of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is, therefore, unnecessary. The Agencies have also analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act. The Agencies have determined that this action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

ACTION: Notice of revisions to FHA maximum loan and mortgage limits for high-cost areas. SUMMARY: This document amends the list of areas eligible for high-cost loan and mortgage limits under certain of HUD's insuring authorities under the National Housing Act (NHA) by increasing the mortgage limits for some Counties and by adding new Counties to the list. This document also corrects several omissions and errors related to the Annual Update of Changes to the Maximum Mortgage Limits published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13950).Loan and mortgage limits are adjusted in an area when the Secretary determines that middle- and moderate- income persons have limited housing opportunities because of high prevailing housing sales prices. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 25, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For single family: Morris Carter, Director, Single Family Development Division, room 9272; telephone (202) 708-2700. For manufactured homes: Robert J. Coyle, Director, Title I Insurance Division, room B-133; telephone (202) 755-7400, for both: TDD, (202) 708-4594; 451 Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC 20410. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The National Housing Act (NHA), 12 U.S.C. 1703 and 1709 et seq., authorizes HUD to insure loans and mortgages for single family residences (from one- to four-family structures), condominiums, manufactured homes, manufactured home lots, and manufactured homes and lots in combination. The NHA permits HUD to adjust the maximum loan and mortgage limits under most of these programs to reflect regional differences in the cost of housing. In addition section 214 of the NHA provides for special high-cost limits for insured mortgages in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands. This document increases the high-cost loan and mortgage limits for Addison and Lamoille Counties, Vermont; Bucks County, Pennsylvania; St. Mary's County, Maryland; Augusta County, Virginia and the Cities of Waynesboro and Staunton, Virginia; Charlotte and Collier Counties, and Routt Counties, Colorado; County, Summit Washington Counties, Utah; Flathead County, Montana; Maui County, Hawaii; the San MSA; Amador and Tuolumne Counties, California; and Kootenai County, Idaho; and adds to the list of high cost areas: Jackson County, Georgia; Sumter County, South Tooele County, Utah; and Walla Walla County. Washington. Part I of this document provides a revised method for computing high-cost area limits for manufactured home and lot loans and lot-only loans insured under Title I of the National Housing Act. This revised computation method is a consequence of the basic dollar limits being increased from $54,000 to $64,800 for manufactured home and lot Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44761 loans, from $13,500 to $16,200 for lot- only loans, and from $40,500 to $48,600 for home-only loans. The new dollar limits were published in the Federal Register on July 30, 1993 (58 FR 40996) and became effective on August 30,' 1993. The revised computation method for Title I manufactured home loans is applicable to high-cost areas identified in this document and to high-cost areas listed in the Annual Update of Changes to the Maximum Mortgage Limits published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13950). The last comprehensive list of high- cost areas was published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13590) listing all areas eligible for \"high-cost\" loan and mortgage limits under certain of HUD's insuring authorities under the National Housing Act, and the applicable limits for each area. These high-cost limits are effective August 25, 1993 and supersede other published amounts in effect, to the extent they are inconsistent with figures appearing in this document. List of Subjects 24 CFR Part 201 Health facilities, Historic preservation, Home improvement, Loan programs-housing and community development, Manufactured homes, Mortgage insurance, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.24 CFR Part 203 Hawaiian Natives, Home' improvement, Loan programs-housing and community development, Mortgage insurance, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Solar energy. 24 CFR Part 234 Condominiums, Mortgage insurance, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. These amendments appear in two parts. Part I explains how the high-cost limits are calculated for manufactured home and lot loans insured under Title I of the National Housing Act. Part II lists each high-cost area, with applicable limits for single family residence (including condominiums) insured sections 203(b), 234(c) and 214 of the National Housing Act. Accordingly, the Department publishes the revised dollar limitations as follows: National Housing Act High Cost Mortgage Limits Part I. Method of Computing Limits Under Title 1, National Housing Act. A. Combination manufactured home and lot (excluding Alaska, Guam and Hawaii): To determine the high-cost area limit for a combination manufactured home and lot loan, multiply the dollar amount in the \"one- family\" column of Part II by 96%. However, in no case may this high-cost area limit exceed $119,880 (185% of the basic limit of $64,800). For example,Addison County, VT has a one-family limit of $93,100. The combination home and lot loan limit is $89,376 (96% of $93,100), which is less than the cap of $119,880. B. Lot only (excluding Alaska, Guam and Hawaii): To determine the high-cost area limit for a combination manufactured home lot loan, multiply the dollar amount in the \"one-family\" column of Part H by 24%. However, in no case may this high-cost area limit exceed $29,970 (185% of the basic limit of $16,200). For example, Addison County, VT has a one-family limit of $93,100. The lot-only loan limit is $22,344 (24% of $93,100), which is less than the cap of $29,970. C. Alaska, Guam and Hawaii limits: Section 2(b)(2) of the National Housing Act limits the maximum loan amounts for all types of manufactured home loans insured under Title I of the Act to 140% of the basic limits. Therefore, the dollar limits for Alaska, Guam and Hawaii are as follows: 1. For manufactured homes: $64,040 (140% of $48,600). 2. combination manufactured homes (140% $64,800). 3. For lots only: $22,680 (140% of $16,200).

[FR Doc. 93-20442 Filed 8-24-93; 8:45 am] BILING CODE 4210-21--M DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Minerals Management Service 30 CFR Part 250 RIN 1010--A34 Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations In the Outer Continental Shelf; Data and Information To Be Made Available to the Public AGENCY: Minerals Management Service, Interior.ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Minerals Management Service's (MMS) regulations governing oil and gas and sulphur operations in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) include provisions for release of data and information to the public. This final rule ensures that the items of data and information submitted on Forms MMS- 1866, Request for Reservoir Maximum Efficient Rate (MER); MMS-1867, Request for Well Maximum Production Rate (MPR); MMS-1868, Well Potential Test Report; MMS-1869, Quarterly Oil Well Test Report; and MMS-1870, Semiannual Gas Well Test Report, that are made available for public inspection are clearly identified in the regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 24, 1993. FORFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:Kumkum Ray, Engineering and Standards Branch, telephone (703) 787- 1600. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The rules at 30 CFR part 250 governing offshore oil and gas and sulphur operations, which were published in the Federal Register on April 1, 1988, included provisions in \u00a7 250.18 governing the release of data and information to the public. Section 250.18 specifies periods of time when certain geological and geophysical data and information will be protected from disclosure to the public. Section 250.18(d) identifies specific items of data and information on Forms MMS-330, MMS-331, and MMS-331C that are to be protected from disclosure for specified time periods. The release of data and information on other MMS reporting forms is not Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44763 mentioned in 30 CFR part 250. This apparent inconsistency makes it necessary to determine whether data and information submitted on Forms MMS-1866, MMS-1867, MMS-1868, or MMS-1870 should be available for public inspection when the same data or information is protected from disclosure under \u00a7 250.18 when submitted on Forms MMS-330, MMS-331, or MMS- 331C. Under OCS Order No. 12, Public Inspection of Records, which was rescinded by a Federal Register notice published April 1, 1988 (53 FR 10596), lessees were advised regarding the specific data and information that would be protected from disclosure for specified time periods. The provisions of \u00a7 250.18 are not as inclusive as OCS Order No. 12. Under revised part 250, the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region issued further guidance in the form of a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL). The NTL 88-03 was issued on June 29, 1988, and provided an interpretation on the data and information to be made available to the public. To provide additional specificity in the regulations, MMS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32316). The proposed rule would have amended \u00a7 250.18 to identify those items of data and information submitted on MMS reporting Forms MMS-1866 and MMS- 1868 that would be subject to protection from disclosure and the timetables for release of the protected data and information. The proposed rule also provided that all data and information submitted on Forms MMS-1867, MMS- 1869, and MMS-1870 would be available for public inspection upon receipt. Following the public comment period, the comments received were reviewed, further analysis conducted within MMS, and a decision was made to propose a revised rule that more closely follows the framework of OCS Order No. 12. The revised proposed rule published in the Federal Register on June 18, 1991 (56 FR 27929), modified the previously published proposal to provide that, with the exception of summary of the porous zones, all information on Forms MMS- 330, MMS-331, and MMS-331C will be released when the well goes on production. Data and information on Forms MMS-1867, MMS-1868, MMS- 1869, and MMS-1870, which are not submitted until after the well is on production, will be released upon receipt of the forms. Although Form MMS-1866 is submitted after the well is on production, most of the data on theform is used to estimate the reserves and will not be available for public inspection without the consent of the lessee for the same periods as those provided for in paragraph (b) of \u00a7 250.18. The MMS believes that returning to the basic approach of releasing certain information when a well goes on production will provide a balance between the commercial interests of the lessees to protect data and information from disclosure and the interests of the public to have access to data and information concerning public lands. Timely comments were received from two commenters and an analysis is presented in the discussion section. Differences Between Proposed and Final Rules Language changes made to the rule since its publication as a proposed rule are italicized. The final rule clarifies the availability of information for Form MMS-1866 which will be subject to the requirement of \u00a7 250.18, paragraph (b), only. The revision with reference to Form MMS-330 clarifies that the summary of porous zones is item 35 on the form. Item 36, geologic markers, is identified as an additional item of data and information on Form MMS-330 that would be subject to protection from disclosure. On Form MMS-1868, static bottomhole pressure information will only be available to the public upon commencement of production or 2 years after submittal, whichever comes first. Discussion of Comments One commenter requested that special considerations be given for the protection of data and information from deepwater (greater than 400 meters) leases. The MMS disagrees with the change suggested by this commenter that pertains to Form MMS-1866, whereby items 1-33 would be withheld from public disclosure for \"10 years or when leases are no longer in effect.\" First, items 1-31 will be withheld from the public. Items 32 and 33 (Gas Oil Ratio and Water Oil Ratio, respectively) will not be withheld because they are calculated data from other public information sources of production data such as Oil and Gas Operations Report Forms. Further, the suggested time period of 10 years after submission to MMS is inordinately long. We believe a reasonable time period for nondisclosure of the information is 2 years after submission. Form MMS- 1866 is required for producing reservoirs; therefore, the 2-year period extends beyond first production.Another commenter requested that \u00a7 250.18(d) be revised to read, \"Data and information identified in paragraph (d) (1) through (3) of this section shall not be available for public inspection without the consent of the lessee for the same periods as those provided in paragraph (b) of this section or until the well goes on production, whichever is earlier. Data and information identified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall not be available for public inspection without the consent of the lessee for the same periods as those provided in paragraph (b) of this section.\" (Emphasis added). We agree with this suggested language because it would help to clarify the release of Form MMS-1866 information per \u00a7 250.18(d)(4) which is not contingent upon first production of a well but rather the requirements found in 30 CFR 250.172. A minor change identifying the item number for \"porous zones\" was also suggested. We agree with the modification and additionally include the related item \"geologic markers.\" Section 250.18(d) is revised to read, ..except that item 35, summary of porous zones and item 36, geologic markers, on Form MMS-330, Well (Re)Completion Report ....\"(Emphasis added). Additional Changes The following language change was made to clarify the protection of static bottomhole pressure information. In \u00a7 250.18(d), a clause is added to the end of the paragraph to state, \". .. .. except static bottomhole pressure information on Form MMS-1 868 in paragraph (d)(6).'\" (Emphasis added). In \u00a7 250.18(d)(6), the words \"are available for public inspection\" are removed. A clause is added at the end of the paragraph to state, \". ..except static bottomhole pressure information are available to the public upon commencement of production or 2 years aftersubmittal, whichever occurs first.\" (Emphasis added). In an effort to reduce the burden associated with information collection, MMS continuously reviews forms on which information is developed. In response-to this review, MMS has developed revisions to several MMS forms. These revisions have been described in Federal Register notices published on August 9, 1990 (55 FR 32484-32502), and August 13, 1990 (55 FR 32973). When new forms are adopted, information will be protected from being released based on the type of information. Accordingly, although this final rule pertains to item numbers on forms currently in use, information will No. 163 / Wednesday. August 25, 1993 1 Rules and Regulations be protected on new forms based on requirements due to revisions resulting from this notice.

IFR Doc. 93-20495 File4 8-24--93: 8:45 No. Glycol; Glycerol- Propylene Oxide Polymer; Tolerance Exemptions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of trimethylolpropane; tetradocanamine, N,N dimethyl-, N-oxide; tall oil diesters with polypropylene glycol; and glycerol-propylene oxide polymer. when used as inert ingredients (components of water-soluble films) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only.

Office location and telephone number, 2800 Crystal Dr., 6th Fl., North Tower, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308- 8320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27974), EPA issued a proposed rule announcing that Chris Craft Industrial Products, Inc., 407 County Line Rd., Gary, IN 46403-2699, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 3E4217) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) to the Federal44764 Federal Register / Vol. 58, Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44765 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of trimethylolpropane; 1-tetradecanamine, N,N-dimethyl-, N-oxide; tall oil diesters with polypropylene glycol; and glycerolpropylene oxide polymer, when used as inert ingredients (components of water-soluble films) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers clay thickeners such as carrageenan and and \"inert\" is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The proposed exemptions were based - on the Agency's review of the contents of the Chris Craft polyvinyl alcohol water-soluble films. The Agency reviewed all of the components of the films and determined that many of the components did not require the establishment of a tolerance exemption because they constituted less than 0.1% of the film and therefore would not be detectable in food under reasonable worst-case conditions. However, four components, trimethylolpropane; 1- tetradecanamine, NN-dimethyl-, N- oxide;tall oil diesters with polypropylene glycol; and glycerol- propylene oxide polymer could leave detectable residues in food. These four chemicals were reviewed by the Office of Pollution, Prevention, and Toxic Substances (OPPT) Structure Activity Team (SAT). The SAT determined that 1-tetradecanamine, N,N-dimethyl-, N-oxide; tall oil diesters with polypropylene glycol; and glycerol-propylene oxide polymer were not expected to be absorbed by any route based upon a review of their chemical structures, thus eliminating concerns for toxicity including carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and developmental toxicity. The SAT indicated a low-to-moderate concern for developmental toxicity for trimethylolpropane. This concern was based on a general concern for developmental toxicity in branched-chain alcohols as a chemical class. Based on a worst-case dietary exposure assessment of valproic acid and the expected use rate of trimethylolpropane, the Agency determined that this chemical would not pose a risk to human health under the proposed conditions of use, which included a limit of not more than 5% in the film. Two comments were received in response to the proposed rule. The first comment concerned the proposed limit for trimethylolpropane. The commentor requested that the Agency raise the limit from 5% to 10%. This comment will be addressed in a separate Federal Register document. The second comment involved several issues concerning (1) the amount of data submitted in support of the tolerance exemptions; (2) the review conducted by the SAT; (3) the bases of approval referencing FDA food additive regulations as basis for the establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance; and (4) the accuracy of the Agency's worst-case analysis demonstrating that components present in the film at less than 0.1% would not be detectable on food and would therefore not require a tolerance exemption. (1) Although little data was received in support of the tolerance exemption, the four chemicals were reviewed on the basis of their chemical structures and behavior by the SAT. The review was notbased on a blind application of the Office of Pesticides, Pollution and Toxic Substances Polymer Exemption Rule (40 CFR 723.50), which identifies polymers that are relatively unreactive, stable, and not readily absorbed and thus of no risk. Each chemical was reviewed and judged with respect to its potential biological activity. This type of review process is typical for inert ingredients, since the level of data required is not the same as for active ingredients. Although a minimum base set of data is required for all new nonfood and food-use inert ingredients, certain data requirements may be waived based on other available information. (2) Frequently, prior FDA food additive regulations are listed in tolerance exemption documents. The Agency is aware that these FDA uses may result in different exposures than the pesticide uses and have various amounts of supporting data. Therefore, the tolerance exemption does not rely solely on the FDA food additive regulations listed in the notice, as the commentor implied, but rather supplements them with toxicological/ risk assessments conducted by Agency. (3).The Agency is not permitting the use of unknown components as inertingredients in pesticides applied to food as stated in the comment. The Agency initially identified and reviewed each of the components contained in the films to determine if any component was known to be of toxicological concern. If any compound present, at any percentage, was a known toxicant, a further review would have been conducted. Although for several of the components in the films EPA deemed it unnecessary to establish tolerance exemptions because as minor components of the films they were unlikely, even under worst-case scenarios, to be detectable in foods, should any toxicological concern arise concerning any of these components EPA has the authority to regulate these components as part of the pesticide chemical under either a tolerance or exemption from tolerance. (4) The commentor provided a worst- case analysis indicating that detectable residues would result from components present at less than 0.1%. The analysis was reviewed by the Agency and was determined to be incorrect because it did not account for commodity yield, that is, it did not divide the amount applied to the field by the amount of crop produced to determine the amount that would remain on the crop after harvesting. The analysis provided by. the commentor also suggested a use rate of 20 bags per acre, which the Agency deemed to be an unreasonable method of application. Although it is impossible to account for every possible use, the Agency is confident that its worst-case analysis is reasonable and that it is a good representative worst case. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that tolerances are not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemptions are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 44766 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 178.27.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34972), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419, hadsubmitted pesticide petition (PP) 5F3177 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a[e)), propose to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a tolerance for residues of the insect growth regulator cyromazine (N-cyclo-propyl-1.3,5-triazine-2,4.6- triamine and its metabolite melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4.6-triamine). calculated as cyromazine, in or on the raw agricultural commodity mushrooms at 10.0 parts per million (ppm) There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44767 tolerance is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

ACTION: Policy statement. SUMMARY: By this action, the Commission makes certain adjustments to its Policy Statement, Standards for Assessing Forfeitures. On its own motion, the Commission reviewed the application of'the Policy Statement in actual cases and decided modifications were appropriate. The significant changes include: Reducing certain base amounts; incorporating new statutory authority and rule violation categories; and allowing a presumption of diminished ability to pay in certain services for individuals. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 3, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Beth Richards, Field Operations Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632-7090. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Policy Statement Adopted: August 3, 1993; Released: August 12, 1993. By the Commission: Commissioner Barrett concurring in the result.1. In this Policy Statement, we make certain adjustments to. our Policy Statement, Standards for Assessing Forfeitures, 6 FCC Rcd 4695 (1991), modified in part on recon., 57 FR 24986 (June 12, 1992), 7 FCC Rcd 5339 (1992), petition for review pending sub nom. USTA v. FCC, No. 92-1321 (D.C. Cir. filed July 30, 1992) (1991 Policy Statement). 2. The Commission released the 1991 Policy Statement to establish general, non-binding guidance that may be used in assessing forfeitures. The Commission retained discretion in specific cases to deviate from the 1991 Policy Statement. The Commission has been operating under the 1991 Policy Statement guidelines since August, 1991. During that time, we have been able to review how it is functioning in practice. In light of that experience, we believe it is appropriate to make various modifications. Our most significant changes seek to ensure that the most significant penalties are applied to violations that implicate health or safety concerns; seek to ensure that forfeiture amounts are consistent for similar types of offenses; add certain violation categories; reiterate in the Appendix our and the staff's discretion not to follow the Policy Statement in specific cases, including by not issuing a forfeiture at all in appropriate cases; clarify that the upward adjustment factor for repeated or continuous violations is not necessarily applied on a per violation or per day basig; state that issuing a citation prior to a forfeiture is not required for tower owners who have received notice of their regulatory obligations; find that financial hardship may be presumed to exist in certain cases involving individuals; and reflect a change in the statutory amount applied to cable equal employment opportunity (EEO) violations. The modifications are set forth below, which supersedes prior versions of the Appendix., 3. Accordingly, it is ordered that this Policy Statement is adopted, to be effective August 3, 1993. 4. The notice and comment and effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to this Policy Statement. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A), (d)(2).

In addition, for continuing violations involving a single act or failure to act, there is an overall limit of $1,000,000 for common carriers or applicants, $250,000 for broadcasters and cable operators or applicants, and $75,000 for all others.

Unless Commission authorization is required for the behavior involved, a section 503 forfeiture proceeding against a non-licensee or non-applicant who is not a cable operator or is not operating in the radio control or citizens band radio service can only be initiated for a second violation, after issuance of a citation in connection with a first violation. 47 U.S.C. 503(b)(5). However, a citation is not required for non-licensee tower owners who have previously received notice of the obligations imposed by section 303(q) from the Commission or the permittee or licensee who uses that tower.

A minor violation is the opposite of \"egregious misconduct.\" eAs noted above, the Commission is required by the Communications Act to' take ability to pay into consideration in assessing forfeiture amounts. 47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)(D). The application of a downward adjustment for inability to pay is based upon a showing of substantial financial hardship. Inability to pay would generally be considered as a downward .adjustment factor only upon a specific showing by the entity against whom forfeiture action is taken. However, in cases involving violations by individuals who are not in the business of providing radio services, e.g., recreational licensees, fingncial hardship may be presumed to exist in appropriate-cases prior to a specific showing.

SUMMARY: The Commission adopted this Report and Order to amend rules governing the provision of interstate pay-per-call services to conform with the requirements of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (TDDRA). This action was taken to amend the Commission's existing rules pertaining to interstate pay-per-call services to implement the requirements of the TDDRA. The rules adopted in the Report and Order are intended to maximize telephone subscribers' protection against fraudulent and abusive practices without unduly burdening common carriers and providers of legitimate pay-per-call services.

Summary of Report and Order I. Introduction 1. On July 15, 1993, the Commission adopted a Report and Order (R&O) in CC Docket No. 93-22 (released Aug. 13, 1993, FCC 93-349), summarized here, which replaces the Commission's existing pay-per-call regulations with new rules which have been drafted to meet the statutory requirements of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act, Public Law 102-556 (1992) (TDDRA). 1. Background 2. Pay-per-call services (also known as\"audiotext\" or \"900\" services) provide telephone users a variety of information services for which they are charged rates different from, and usually higher than, the normal transmission rates charged for ordinary telephone calls. In 1991, the Commission established pay-per-call regulations aimed at protecting telephone subscribers from abusiye practices which had been associated with the provision of such services. Under the TDDRA both this Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) were charged with adopting new rules to implement the required obligations and constraints to be imposed on common carriers, information providers (IPs), and other entities involved in the provision of interstate pay-per-call services. On -February 11, 1993, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Notice of Inquiry, 57 FR 14371 (Mar. 17, 1993) (NPRM/NOI), which proposed to amend exiting pay- per-call regulation in response to the statutory mandate of the TDDRA. In response to the NPRM/NOI, 35 comments and 18 reply comments were filed by interexchange carriers (IXCs), local exchange carriers (LECs), IPs, state regulatory and law enforcement entities, and consumer interest groups. III. Discussion A. Definitions (Section 64.1501) 3. In \u00a7 64.1505, the Commission adopted the statutory definition of pay- per-call services contained in the TDDRA. Although some commenters suggested that the definition be modified or amplified, the Commission 44770 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations concluded that the statutory definition reflects a consideration and balancing of interests by Congress that should not be disturbed. 4. The TDDRA specifically removes from the definition of pay-per-call \"any service for which users are assessed charges only after entering into a presubscription or comparable arrangement with the provider of such service.\" Most commenters urged the Commission to define explicitly the term \"presubscription or comparable arrangement.\" In the interests of preventing circumvention of legitimate regulation while at the same time permitting mutually beneficial business arrangements between IFs and consumers, the Commission adopted a definition that requires a fully informed and legally responsible consumer to enter into a presubscription arrangement prior to any call for which charges are incurred. The consumer must also be informed of any future rate increases and be required to use an identification number or some other means designed to prevent unauthorized access to the service. 5. The Commission agreed with several commenters that the legislative history of the TDDRA provides evidence of congressional intent to leave credit and charge card transactions outside the scope of the TDDRA. Thus, \u00a7 64.1501(b) recognizes that an arrangement\"comparable\" to presubscription is established when a caller to an information service disclosed a credit or charge card number and authorizes charges to that number as long as the credit or charge card is subject to the dispute resolution procedures of the Truth in Lending and Fair Credit Billing Acts, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. B. Limitations on the Provision.of Pay- Per-Call Services (Section 64.1502) 6. The Commission adopted a broad compliance requirement requiring that any common carrier who assigns telephone numbers for pay-per-call purposes must require by contract or tariff that IPs utilizing such numbers comply with the TDDRA and any implementing regulations prescribed by the FTC and FCC The Commission. determined that the language of this rule, and others covering the relationship between common carriers and IPs, encompasses all situations in which an IP is assigned a pay-per-call telephone number, regardless of whether that assignment is made- directly by a common carrier or through a service bureau.C. Termination of Pay-Per-Call Programs (Section 64.1503) 7. Under the TDDRA, a common carrier that has assigned a telephone number to a pay-per-call program is compelled to \"terminate\" that program if the carrier knows or reasonably should know that the program is not being offered in compliance with titles II and III of the TDDRA and related FTC regulations. Section 64.1503 specifies that carriers acting under that rule cannot terminate a pay-per-call program until at lqast seven and no more than 14 days after the IP has received written notice from a carrier citing the particular violation of law upon which a termination decision is based. An IP can avoid termination by responding with corrective action during the notice period. In addition, IPs believing that a termination decision is unwarranted can seek to enjoin a carrier from executing the decision. The Commission thus concluded that the due process rights of IPs would be fully protected. 8. The Commission declined to extend the grounds for required termination to include violations of state law in light of the TDDRA's clear designation of violations of federal law and rules as the only basis for mandatory termination. The Commission also rejected a suggestion that carriers immediately suspend pay- per-call programs upon an appearance of unlawfulness. 9. Finally, the Commission affirmed the view expressed by several carriers and IPs, alike, that the termination obligation does not require carriers to monitor pay-per-call programs or initiate investigations in the absence of a complaint. The Commission declined to specify a particular number of complaints upon which a carrier reasonably should know of illegal behavior but emphasized that carriers are expected to investigate each complaint of unlawfulness. D. Restrictions on the Use of 800 Numbers (Section 64.1504) 10. The Commission's consideration of 800 number restrictions incorporated the record established in a separate rulemaking proceeding (RM-7990) which had been initiated in 1992 pursuant to a petition filed by the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) concerning the interplay between 800 number services and pay-per-call services. The NOI/ NPRM encouraged commenters in CC Docket No. 93-22 to discuss the manner in which the TDDRA's provisions regarding 800 numbers differed from NAAG's proposals.11. In the R&O, the Commission adopted \u00a7 64.1504 to codify the TDDRA's restriction on the use of 800 numbers for pay-per-call purposes. The statutory language was adopted almost unchanged to prohibit charges being assessed in connection with calls to 800 numbers except in the limited situation where the caller has established a presubscription or comparable arrangement. The Commission concluded that there are no constitutional impediments to the 800 number restrictions since they are content-neutral, leave other avenues of communication open to parties seeking to exercise First Amendment rights, and are narrowly tailored to serve the legitimate governmental interest in protecting consumers from deceptive practices. E. Restrictions on Collect Telephone Calls (Section 64.1505) 12. In response to numerous comments suggesting that all collect information services be prohibited, the Commission reexamined the TDDRA to discern the proper regulafory treatment of such services. Upon review, the Commission concluded that, taken together, 47 U.S.C. 228(i)(1) (A)-(B) and 228(b)(5) effectively prohibit collect information services calls charged above a tariffed transmission rate, and that this prohibition should be explicitly reflected in pay-per-call regulations. Section 64.1505, thus, specifies that common carriers cannot transmit or bill for interstate collect information services calls carrying charges beyond the tariffed transmission rate. 13. The Commission observed that collect information services billed at a tariffed rate would be permissible under the regulatory system established by the TDDRA since tariffed services are explicitly exempted from the statutory requirements. Although the Commission could not predict to what extent IPs will seek to use tariffed services to provide information services on a collect basis, the Commission preserved in \u00a7 64.1505 the requirement that charges cannot be incurred in connection with tariffed collect information services calls unless. a called party takes affirmative action indicating acceptance of charges. F. Number Designation (Section 64.1506) 14. The TDDRA requires that all audio information or audio entertainment services and various other calls for which a caller incurs charges beyond the charge for transmission of the call be offered only through telephone numbers with area codes or prefixes designated by the Commission. The Commission Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44771 adopted \u00a7 64.1506 to require that all such pay-per-call services offered on an .interstate basis be confined to telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access code. In so ruling, the Commission concluded that any initial costs of relocation of pay-per-call services would be significantly outweighed by the increased ability of consumers to recognize particular numbers as belonging to pay-per-call services and carrying charges beyond normal telephone rates. Given state regulation of intrastate pay-per-call services, the Commission did not impose any number designation requirements upon intrastate services. G. Prohibition on Disconnection or Interruption of Service for'Failure To Remit Pay-Per-Call or Similar Service Charges (Section 64.1507) 15. In \u00a7 64.1507, the Commission adopted virtually verbatim the TDDRA's prohibition against disconnection of basic telephone services for failure to pay pay-per-call charges. In addition, the prohibition was expanded to cover non-payment of charges for (1) information services offered under a presubscription or comparable arrangement and (2) tariffed collect information services when the subscriber has disputed such charges. The Commission agreed with carriers who noted that they could not guarantee compliance with an absolute prohibition against disconnection associated with non-payment of tariffed collect information services charges since there is no clear means of differentiating such calls from ordinary tariffed collect calls. Thus, the Commission specified that the disconnection prohibition applied to tariffed collect information services calls only when charges have been disputed. H. Blocking Access to 900 Service (Section 64.1508) 16. The Commission adopted \u00a7 64.1508 to codify the TDDRA's requirement that where technically feasible LECs must offer their subscribers the option of blocking access to 900 services. The rule incorporates that requirement that such blocking must be offered to all subscribers at no charge for a period of 60 days after the new pay-per-call regulations take effect and to all new subscribers for a period of 60 days after new service is established. The Commission noted that this rule did not preclude states from mandating more generous terms under which subscribers may obtain free blocking or carriers from voluntarily extending the freeblocking option. In addition, the Commission concluded that the blocking obligation should encompass only an across the board block of all 900 services since selective blocking of - individual 900 numbers is neither technically nor economically feasible at this time. Finally, the Commission required LECs to file their pay-per-call blocking tariffs with the Commission. I. Disclosure and Dissemination of Pay- Per-Call Information (Section 64.1509) 17. Under the TDDRA, common carriers who assign telephone numbers for pay-per-call purposes must provide to interested parties the name, address, and customer service telephone number for individual IPs whose programs are transmitted by that carrier, a list of all pay-per-call numbers that have been assigned by that carrier along with a brief description of each service represented by such numbers. Common carriers who not only assign pay-per- call numbers but also provide pay-per- call billing and collection services have additional consumer education obligations. Such carriers must establish local or toll free telephone numbers to answer questions and provide information on subscribers' rights and responsibilities with respect to use of pay-per-call services. Names and mailing addresses of IPs using the carrier's facilities are to be available over this number. In addition, billing carriers must provide to each subscriber, within 60 days after effectuation of the Commission's pay-per-call rules, a disclosure statement explaining the rights and obligations of both the subscriber and carrier, including the subscriber's rights to obtain blocking and not to be billed for any programs not offered in compliance with the TDDRA and the Commission's and FTC's implementing regulations. The Commission incorporated these statutory requirements in section 64.1509. 18. In addition, to ensure that consumer are adequately informed with respect to pay-per-call services, the Commission expanded carriers' disclosure obligations to require that the mandated disclosure statement also include an explanation of the possibility of involuntary blocking of 900 access for failure to pay legitimate pay-per-call charges and the prohibition against disconnection of basic communications services for failure to pay pay-per-call and similar charges. The Commission also found that one-time provision for the disclosure statement was insufficient to ensure that consumers are adequately educated. Thus, disclosure statements must bedistributed annually. The Commission declined to require carriers to undertake additional efforts with respect to consumer education or cooperation with state law enforcement or regulatory authorities, which had been requested by some commenters. J. Billing and Collection of Pay-Per-Call and Similar Services Charges (Section 64.1510) 19. The TDDRA establishes a prohibition against carriers billing subscribers for pay-per-call charges when it is known or reasonably should be known that the pay-per-call service was not offered in compliance with the TDDRA. Billing carriers are also required to show pay-per-call charges in a portion of the bill separate from ordinary telephone charges and include (1) the amount of the charges, (2) the type of service being charged for, and (3) the date, time and duration of the call. Section 64.1510 includes these provisions with the caveat that when pay-per-call charges are not time-based, the duration of the call need not be shown. 20. The Commission also expanded the TDDRA's billing requirements so that telephone bills that include pay- per-call charges must contain a brief statement explaining basic pay-per-call rights and responsibilities. The Commission concluded that neither segregation of pay-per-call charges on a telephone bill nor provision of an annual disclosure statement would ensure that subscribers billed for pay- per-call services possessed the basic information necessary to make an informed choice whether to pay or contest such charges. However, the Commission found that inclusion of additional information, such as the IP's name or address, on the telephone bill was unnecessary. 21. Finally, because of the apparent difficulty in distinguishing tariffed collection information service calls from other types of collect calls, the Commission modified the NPRM/NOI proposal so that segregation of charges associated with collect information services is not an absolute requirement but required whenever \"possible.\" Segregation of charges is similarly required when a common carrier bills for information services offered under a presubscription of comparable arrangement. K. Forgiveness of Charges and Refunds (Section 64.1511) 22. Numerous commenters objected to the Commission's proposed rule codifying the TDDRA requirement that procedures be established to ensure that No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations carriers and other parties provide refunds to subscribers who have been billed for pay-per-call services offered in violation of federal law. Accordingly. the rule was redrafted and the R&O clarifies that the refund obligation does not require carriers to undertake wholesale actions, but instead applies to individual subscribers who have disputed charges. In addition, the Commission emphasized that carriers are not obligated to monitor pay-per-call programs in the absence of a complaint or to examine federal laws not directly applicable to the provision of pay-per- call service. Under \u00a7 64.1511, carriers are afforded discretion to set standards for determining when subscriber complaints merit forgiveness, refund, or credit of pay-per-call charges, provided that such adjustments must be made if the carriers investigation of disputed charges reveals that the services were not offered in compliance with federal law or such a finding of unlawfulness is made by this Commission, the FTC, or a court of competent jurisdiction. The Commission rejected some commenters suggestions that the scope of violative behavior necessary to prompt the refund obligation be expanded to include violations of state law. L. Involuntary Blocking of Pay-Per-Call Services (Section 64.1512) 23. Section 64.1512 recognizes the rights of common carriers and IPs to employ involuntary blocking of pay-per- call services to protect themselves against subscribers who have failed to pay legitimate pay-per-call charges. While particular procedures for involuntary blocking were not adopted, the rule specifies that a subscriber's access to pay-per-call services cannot be involuntarily blocked while that subscriber has a pay-per-call complaint pending under dispute resolution procedures mandated by the FTC. However, once a complaint has been resolved in the IP's favor, involuntary, blocking may be accomplished regardless of whether the subscriber files additional separate complaints. M. Verification of Charitable Status (Section 64.1513) 24. Section 64.1513 codifies the TDDRA's requirement that a carrier assigning a pay-per-call number to an EP that it knows, or reasonably should know, is engaged in soliciting charitable contributions must obtain proof of the tax exempt status of any person or organization for which contributions are solicited. The Commission did not impose any investigatory obligation upon common carriers in connection with this requirement, finding that thelegislative history of the TDDRA does not support commenters who would require carriers to question IPs as to their possible solicitation activities prior to assigning a pay-per-call telephone number. In addition, the Commission declined to require submission of documentation demonstrating compliance with state solicitation laws. N. Recovery of Costs (Section 64.1515) 25. While the TDDRA recognizes the rights of common carriers to recover their costs of complying with the TDDRA, the statute expressly prohibits carriers from recovering such costs from local or long distance telephone ratepayers. Most commenters expressed the belief that this prohibition could be honored without a Commission- mandated cost recovery system or revisin of general accounting or jurisdictional separations rules. Accordingly, \u00a7 64.1515 simply restates- the statutory prohibition against recovery of TDDRA compliance costs from general telephone ratepayers. 0. Preemption 26. The TDDRA requires the FTC to adopt rules requiring IPs to begin their pay-per-call programs with an introductory message, or preamble, to inform callers about the nature and cost of the services they have reached. In light of that requirement, the Commission deleted its own preamble rule and ended preemption of inconsistent state-imposed preamble requirements on jurisdictionally mixed traffic. The Commission emphasized that Congress has expressly placed preambles matters within the FTC's regulatory authority and that it could not be assumed that such action was taken without appreciation of the extent of the FTC's jurisdiction, which is different from the Commission's. The Commission thus rejected arguments by some commenters that its preemption should continue. IV. Notice of Inquiry Regarding Application of Pay-Per-Coll Regulations to Data Services 27. Under the TDDRA, the Commission must report to Congress regarding the desirability of extending pay-per-call regulations to \"persons that provide, for a per-call charge, data services that are not pay-per-call services.\" In light of the comments gathered in CC Docket No. 93-22 and its own experience that complaints of. fraudulent and deceptive practices in the pay-per-call industry apply virtually without exception to audio service, the Commission concluded that such extension was unnecessary at this time.V. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 28. The Commission received no comments in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis contained in the NPRM/NOI. The Commission carefully considered all comments that were filed in CC Docket No. 93-22 with respect to the proposed rules to implement the requirements of the TDDRA and, upon review, concluded that the rules adopted by the R&O represent the most reasonable course of action to implement the requirements of the TDDRA and to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive practices associated with interstate pay-per-call services and ensure that they are provided with adequate information to make educated choices about their use of such services. VL Conclusion 29. In the R&O, the Commission adopted rules to implement the TDDRA in a manner that will maximize consumers' protection against abusive practices with minimal disruption to common carriers and providers of lawful and legitimate pay-per-call services. VII Ordering Clauses 30.

(b) Such term does not include directory services provided by a common carrier or its affiliate or.by a local exchange carrier or its affiliate, or any service the charge for which is tariffed, or any service for which users are assessed charges only after entering into a presubscription or comparable arrangement with the provider of such service. (1) Presubscription or comparable arrangement means a contractual agreement in which: (i) The service provider clearly and conspicuously discloses to the consumer all material terms and conditions associated with the use of the service, including the service provider's name and address, a business telephone number which the consumer may use to obtain additional information or to register a complaint, and the rates for the service; (ii) The service provider agrees to notify the consumer of any future rate changes; (iii) The consumer agrees to utilize the service on the terms and conditions disclosed by the service provider; and (iv) The service provider requires the use of an identification number or other means to prevent unauthorized access to the service by nonsubscribers. (2) Disclosure of a credit or charge card number, along with authorization to bill that number, made during the course of a call to an information service shall constitute a presubscription or comparable arrangement if the credit or charge card is subject to the dispute resolution procedures of the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Billing Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. No other action taken by the consumer during the course of a call to an information service, for which charges are assessed, can be construed as creating a presubscription or comparable arrangement. \u00a764.1502 Limitations on the provision of pay-per-call services. Any common carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of interstate pay-per-call service shall require, by contract or tariff, that such provider comply with the provisions ofthis subpart and of titles II and III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (Pub. L. No. 102-556) (TDDRA) and the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to thosd titles. \u00a764.1503 Termination of pay-per-call programs. Any common carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of interstate pay-per-call service shall specify by contract or tariff that pay-per call programs not in compliance with \u00a7 64.1502 shall be terminated following written notice to-he information provider. The information provider shall be afforded a period of no less than seven and no more than 14 days during which a program may be brought into compliance. Programs not in compliance at the expiration of such period shall be terminated immediately. \u00a764.1504 Restrictions on the use of 800 numbers. Common carriers shall prohibit, by tariff or contract, the use of any telephone number beginning with an 800 service access code, or any other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free, in a manner that would result in: (a) The calling party or the subscriber to the originating line being assessed, by virtue of completing the call, a charge for the call; \\ (b) The calling party being connected to a pay-per-call service; (c) The calling party being charged for information conveyed during the call unless the calling party has a presubscription or comparable arrangement; or (d) The calling party being called back collect for the provision of audio or data information services, simultaneous voice conversation services, or products. \u00a764.1505 Restrictions on collect telephone calls. (a) No common carrier shall provide interstate transmission or billing and collection services to an entity offering any service within the scope of \u00a7 64.1501(a)(1) that is billed to a subscriber on a collect basis at a per-call or per-time-interval charge that is greater than, or in addition to, the charge for transmission of the call. (b) No common carrier shall provide interstate transmission services for any collect information services billed to a subscriber at a tariffed rate unless the called party has taken affirmative action clearly indicating that it accepts the charges for the collect service.Federal Register / Vol. 58, 44774 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations \u00a764.1506 Number designation. Any interstate service described in \u00a7 64.1501 (a)(1) through (a)(2) shall be offered only through telephone numbers beginning with a 900 service access code. \u00a7 64.1507 Prohibition on disconnection or Interruption of service for failure to remit pay-per-call or similar service charges. No common carrier shall disconnect or interrupt in any manner, or order the disconnection or interruption of, a telephone subscriber's local exchange or long distance telephone service as a result of that subscriber's failure to pay: (a) Charges for interstate pay-per-call service; (b) Charges for interstate information services provided pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement; or (c) Charges, which have been disputed by the subscriber, for interstate tariffed collect information services. \u00a764.1508 Blocking access to 900 service. (a) Local exchange carriers must offer to their subscribers, where technically feasible, an option to block access to services offered on the 900 service access code. Blocking is to be offered at no charge, on a one-time basis, to: (1) All telephone subscribers during the period from November 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993; and (2) Any subscriber who subscribes to a new telephone number for a period of 60 days after the new number is effective. (b) For blocking requests not within the one-time option or outside the time frames specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and for unblocking requests, local exchange carriers may charge a reasonable one-time fee. Requests by subscribers to remove 900 services blocking must be in writing. (c) The terms and conditions under which subscribers may obtain 900 services blocking are to be included in tariffs filed with this Commission. \u00a7 64.1509 Disclosure and dissemination of pay-per-call Information.

(b) Any common carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of interstate pay-per-call services and offering billing and collection services to such provider shall: (1) Establish a local or toll-free telephone number to answer questions and provide information on subscribers' rights and obligations with regard to their use of pay-per-call services and to provide to callers the name and mailing address of any provider of pay-per-call services offered by that carrier, and (2) Provide to all its telephone subscribers, either directly or through contract with any local exchange carrier providing billing and collection services to that carrier, a disclosure statement setting forth all rights and obligations of the subscriber and the carrier with respect to the use and payment of pay- per-call services. Such statement must include the prohibition against disconnection of basic communications services for failure to pay pay-per-call charges established by \u00a764.1507, the right of a subscriber to obtain blocking in accordance with \u00a7 64.1508, the right of a subscriber not to be billed for pay- per-call services not offered in compliance with federal laws and regulations established by \u00a7 64.1510(a)(iv), and the possibility that a subscriber's access to 900 services may be involuntarily blocked pursuant to \u00a7 64.1512 for failure to pay legitimate pay-per-call charges. Disclosure statements must be forwarded to: (i) All telephone subscribers no later than 60 days after these regulations take effect; (ii) All new telephone subscribers no later than 60 days after service is established; (iii) All telephone subscribers requesting service at a new location no later than 60 days after service is established; and (iv) Thereafter, to all subscribers at least once per calendar year, at intervals of not less than 6 months nor more than 18 months. \u00a764.1510 Billing and collection of pay-per- call and similar service charges. (a) Any common carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of interstate pay-per-call services and offering billing and collection services to such provider shall: (1) Ensure that a subscriber is not billed for interstate pay-per-call services that such carrier knows or reasonably should know were provided in violation of the regulations set forth in thissubpart or prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to titles II or III of the TDDRA or any other federal law; (2) In any billing to telephone subscribers that includes charges for any interstate pay-per-call service: (i) Include a statement indicating that: (A) Such charges are for non- communications services; (B) Neither local nor long distances services can be disconnected for non- payment although an information provider may employ private entities to seek to collect such charges; (C) 900 number blocking is available upon request; and (D) Access to pay-per-call services may be involuntarily blocked for failure to pay legitimate charges; (ii) Display any charges for pay-per- call services in a part of the bill that is identified as not being related to local and long distance telephone charges; (iii) Specify, for each pay-per-call charge made, the type of service, the amount of the charge, and the date, time, and, for calls billed on a time- sensitive basis, the duration of the call; and (iv) Identify the local or toll-free number established in accordance with \u00a7 64.1509(b)(1). (b) Any common carrier offering billing and collection services to an entity providing interstate information services pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement, or for interstate tariffed collect information services, shall, to the extent possible, display the billing information in the manner described in paragraphs (a){2)(i) through (a)(2)(ii) of this section. \u00a7 64.1511 Forgivehess of charges and refunds. (a) Any carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of interstate pay- per-call services or providing transmission for interstate tariffed collect information services or interstate information services offered under a presubscription or comparable arrangement, and providing billing and collection services for such services, shall establish procedures for the handling of subscriber complaints regarding charges for those services. A billing carrier is afforded discretion to set standards for determining when a subscriber's complaint warrants forgiveness, refund or credit of interstate pay-per-call or information services charges provided that such charges must be forgiven, refunded, or credited when a subscriber has complained about such charges and either this Commission, the Federal Trade Commission. or a court of competent jurisdiction has found or the Federal Register / Vol. 58, No 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 1 Rules and Regulations 44775 carrier has determined, upon investigation, that the service has been offered in violation of federal law or the regulations that are either set forth in this subpart or prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to titles II or IMl of the TDDRA. Carriers shall observe the record retention requirements set forth in \u00a7 42.6 of this chapter except that relevant records shall be retained by carriers beyond the rqquirements of part 42 of this chapter when a complaint is pending at the time the specified retention period expires. (b) Any carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of interstate pay- per-call services but not providing billing and collection services for such services, shall, by tariff or contract, require that the provider and/or its billing and collection agents have in place procedures whereby, upon complaint, pay-per-call charges may be forgiven, refunded, or credited, provided that such charges must be forgiven, refunded, or credited when a subscriber has complained about such charges and either this Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or a court of competent jurisdiction has found or the carrier has determined, upon investigation, that the service has been offered in violation of federal law or the regulations that are either set forth in this subpart or prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to titles 11 of III of the TDDRA. \u00a7 64.1512 Involuntary blocking of pay-per- call services. Nothing in this subpart shall preclude a common carrier or information provider from blocking or ordering the blocking of its interstate pay-per-call programs from numbers assigned to subscribers who have incurred, but not paid, legitimate pay-per-call charges, except that a subscriber who has filed a complaint regarding a particular pay- per-call program pursuant to procedures established by the Federal Trade Commission under title III of the TDDRA shall not be involuntarily blocked from access to that program while such a complaint is pending. This restriction is not intended to preclude involuntary blocking when a carrier or IP has decided in one instance to sustain charges against a subscriber but that subscriber files additional separate complaints. \u00a764.1513 Verification of charitable status. Any common carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of interstate pay-per-call services that the carrier knows or reasonably should know is engaged in soliciting charitable contributions shall obtain verificationthat the entity or individual for whom contributions are solicited has been granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. \u00a764.1514 Generaton of signalling tones. No common carrier shall assign a telephone number for any pay-per-call service that employs broadcast advertising which generates the audible tones necessary to complete a call to a pay-per-call service. \u00a7 64.1515 Recovery of costs. No common carrier shall recover its cost of complying with the provisions of this subpart from local or long distance ratepayers.

In the amended list in this document, errors in the names of two Alfa Romeo lines and two Mercedes- Benz models are corrected, two Mercedes-Benz models, the 300 SEL and 380 SL, are removed, and the following are added: Three Mercedes-Benz models, the 300 SDL, the 300 SE, and the 300 TD; a General Motors line, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo; and a Mitsubishi line, the Mitsubishi 3000GT. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 25, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Barbara Gray, Office of Market Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Ms. Gray's telephone number is (202) 366-1740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NHTSA is correcting errors in the final list of high theft vehicle lines for Model Year (MY) 1993, that appeared in the Federal Register on January 12, 1993 (58 FR 3850). This correction document incorporates updated information brought to NHTSA's attention subsequent to the publication of the final list for MY 1993. The following arecorrections to appendix A of 49 CFR part 541, the Theft Prevention Standard: The Alfa Romeo lines, erroneously listed as \"Milano 141\" and \"Fiat 144\" The \"380 SL\" is removed, as it is an erroneous listing of the 300 SL. which is already listed in Appendix A-I, under Mercedes-Benz, as part of the 129 line. The \"300 SEL\" is removed, as it is duplicative of the \"300 SEL/500 SEL.\" In addition, the following three models are added to Mercedes-Benz's listing in Appendix A: the 300 TD, the 300 SE, and the 300 SDL lines. The General Motors line, \"Chevrolet Monte Carlo\", and the Mitsubishi Motors line, the \"Mitsubishi 3000GT\", were inadvertently left out in the final list for MY 1993, and are added in this document. Since the corrections made by this document only inform the public of previous agency actions, and do not impose any additional obligations on any party, NHTSA finds for good cause that the revisions made by this notice should be effective as soon as it is published in the Federal Register.

This action is necessary to conform to the preseason announcement of the 1993 management measures and is intended to ensure conservation of coho salmon. DATES: Effective at 2400 hours local time, August 10, 1993. Comments will be accepted through September 8, 1993. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Rolland A. Schmitten, Director, Northwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., BIN C15700-Bldg. 1, Seattle, WA 98115-0070. Information relevant to this notice has been compiled in aggregafe form and is available for public review during business hours at the office of the NMFS Northwest Regional Director. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson at (206) 526-6140. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations governing the ocean salmon fisheries at 50 CFR 661.21(a)(1) state that \"When a quota for the commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon species in any portion of the fishery management area is projected by the Regional Director to be reached on or by a certain date, the Secretary will, by notice issued under \u00a7 661.23, close the commercial or recreational fishery,L or both, for all salmon species in the portion of the fishery management areato which the quota applies as of the date the quota is projected to be reached.\" In its amended emergency interim rule (58 FR 31664, June 4, 1993), NMFS announced that the 1993 overall recreational catch from Cape Falcon, Oregon, to the U.S.-Mexico border would be limited to a catch quota of 68,000 coho salmon. When this coho salmon quota is reached, all recreational fisheries between Cape Falcon and Humbug Mountain, Oregon, will close. The recreational fishery between Cape Falcon and Humbug Mountain was open on May I through June 6, then reopened on July 13 and was scheduled to continue through the earlier of September 7 or the projected attainment of the overall coho quota south of Cape Falcon. Beginning July 13, the fishery was open Sunday through Tuesday only. Based on the best available information on August 12, 1993, the recreational fishery catch south of Cape Falcon was estimated to be 61,000 coho salmon through August 10. The 7,000 fish remaining in the overall coho quota were projected to be caught by the recreational fisheries south of Humbug Mountain during the rest of their scheduled seasons. Therefore, the recreational fishery between Cape Falcon and Humbug Mountain, Oregon, which closed as regularly scheduled at midnight Tuesday, August 10, 1993, was not reopened on its next scheduled opening date of Sunday, August 15, 1993, and will remain closed for the remainder of the season. The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific Fishery Management Council and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife regarding this closure. The State of Oregon will manage the recreational fishery in state waters adjacent to this area of the EEZ in accordance with this Federal action. In accordance with the inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.23, actual notice to fishermen of this action was given prior to 0001 hours local time, August 15, 1993, the time of the next scheduled opening, by telephone hotline number (206) 526- 6667 or (800) 662-9825 and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts on Channel 16 VHF-FM and 2182 Khz. Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce has determined that good cause exists for this notice to be issued without affording a prior opportunity for public comment. This notice does not apply to other fisheries that may be operating in other areas.Classification This action is authorized by 50 CFR 661.21 and 661.23 and is in compliance with Executive Order 12291.

ACTION: Announcement of reserve allocation to the 1993 Harpoon category quota. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that it is taking action, pursuant to authority in implementing regulations, to allocate 7 metric tons (mt) from the 1993 reserve to the Harpoon category. This action is being taken to extend the season for the Harpoon category, thereby assuring additional collection of biological data, providing additional fishing opportunities for this traditional fishery during the late summer when the weather is usually good and, thereby, increasing the economic benefits from this fishery. This action results in a total 1993 Harpoon category quota of 60 mt and a remaining reserve of 3 mt. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 20, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kevin B. Foster, 508-281-9260, or Aaron E. King, 301-713-2347. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations promulgated under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 et seq.) regulating the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommended U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories. Under the implementing regulations at 50 CFR 285.22(f, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has the authority to allocate any portion of44776 Federal Register / Vol. 58, INo. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 44777 the reserve amount to any fishing category after. considering the following factors: (1) The usefulness of information obtained from catches of the particular category of the fishery for biological sampling and monitoring the status of the stock; (2) the catches of the particular gear segment to date and the likelihood of closure of that segment of the fishery if no allocation is made; (3) the projected ability of the particular gear segment to harvest the additional amount of Atlantic hluefin tuna before the anticipated end of the fishing season; and (4) the estimated amounts by which quotas established for other gear segments of the fishery might be exceeded. Allocating 7 mt from the reserve to the Harpoon category responds to the foui criteria listed above as follows: (1) Harpoon landings allow collection of biological data (weight, length, area harvested, etc.) from the harpoon fishery; (2) 1993 Harpoon category catches have been high relative to recent years at this date in the season, and it would be necessary to close this category of the fishery within the next few days unless additional quota allocation is made; (3) given the importance of fishing in good weather conditions normally occurring in the late summer (late August and earlySeptember), but very unpredictable after that, the Harpoon category will be able to harvest the additional amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna; and (4) new quota monitoring techniques (e.g., daily faxing of dealer reports) will improve NMFS' 'ability to keep all categories within assigned quotas. Since 1993 is the second year of the biennial quota, and one of the stated management objectives is to maximize use of the available ICCAT quota, NMFS believes it is preferable to allocate some of the reserve early in the 1993 season. rather than later. Allocation of the reserve beforehand will enable fishermen to plan better for fishing activities, will reduce the likelihood of a disruptive August closure when weather is usually good, and may distribute fishing opportunities more fairly than could be accomplished later in the season. Furthermore, the late summer fishery would allow Harpoon category fishermen to benefit from higher market prices. At the present harvest level and rate of catch, NMFS estimates that the Harpoon category could reach its quota of 53 mt by August 24, 1993. Therefore, NMFS announces that it is taking action to allocate 7 mt from the 1993 reserve to the Harpoon category. It is estimated that this action will prolong theHarpoon category season by at least 5 days. The intent of this action is to prevent overharvest of the western Atlantic bluefin tuna catch quota established for this fishery for the 1992- 93 biennial period, while providing continued collection of biological data, helping continue traditional late summer fisheries, maximizing the use of the available resource, and distributing the fishing opportunity and beneficial economic impacts among many businesses and users for a longer period of time. Additionally, this helps provide a reasonable opportunity for U.S. fishermen to harvest the 1992-93 quota, as required by the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA).

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 351 RIN: 3206-AF5O Reduction In Force Assignment Rights AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing regulations that would expand employees' assignment rights in reduction in force (RIF) competition. These proposed regulations broaden the\"retreat\" right, a form of \"bumping\" within the same retention subgroup that is limited to positions formerly held by a competing employee, to encompass additional positions held by other employees with less service in the same subgroup. The expanded retreat right would be mandatory for all RIF actions effected 6 months after the publication date of final regulations. DATES: Written comments will be considered if received no later than October 25, 1993. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver written comments to: Associate Director for Career Entry, room 6F08, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas A. Glennon or Edward P. McHugh, (202) 606-0960; FAX (202) 606-2329. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The present provisions covering RIF assignment rights are set forth in subpart G of 5 CFR 351. Competing employees in retention tenure Groups I and II with current performance ratings of at least \"Minimally Successful\" who have been released from their competitive levels are entitled to an offer of RIF assignment if they have \"bumping\" or \"retreating\" rights to an available position in the same competitive area. The available position must be within three grades or grade-intervals (or equivalent) of the employee's present position. However, an employee who is a preference eligible for purposes of this part and who has a compensable service- connected disability of 30 percent or more has a retreat right to positions up to five grades or grade-intervals (or equivalent) of the employee's present position. Section 5 CFR 351.701(b) covers employee \"bumping\" rights. Bumping means displacing an employee in a lower tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the released employee's own tenure group. Although the released employee must be qualified for the position, it may be a position that the employee has never held. Sections 5 CFR 351.701(c) and (d) cover\"retreat\" rights. Retreating means displacing an employee with less service within the released employee's own tenure group and subgroup (i.e., a limited form of bumping within the same retention group and subgroup). The position must also be the same position or essentially identical to a position held by the released employee in any Federal agency on a permanent basis. An employee with a current annual performance rating of \"Minimally Successful\" only has retreat rights to positions held by an employee with the same or lower ratings. Section 5 CFR 351.701(b) is revised to provide competing employees with a broader retreat right. An employee would have the right to retreat by displacing a lower-standing employee within the same group and subgroup when the agency could not make an equal offer of assignment using the bumping provisions. To exercise the expanded reti-eat right, the released employee must be qualified for the position. However, the retreat right would no longer be limited to a position that is the same or essentially identical to a position previously held by the released employee. This basic provision is presently an option set forth in 5 CFR 351.705(a)(1)..Under the revised 5 CFR 351.701(c), a preference eligible employee for purposes of this part with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more would have retreat rights to positions up to five grades or grade intervals (or equivalent). In conforming changes, present 5 CFR 351.701(d) is deleted and 5 CFR351.701(e) is redesignated 5 CFR 351.701(d). Finally, 5 CFR 351.705(a)(1) is revised to provide that, at its option, an agency may allow bumping within the same subgroup in all actions without first considering whether the offer is equivalent to a bump offer under 5 CFR 351.701(b). E.O. 12291 Federal Regulation I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because It only affects Federal employees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background. The Fruits and Vegetables regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 et seq. (referred to below as the regulations) impose restrictions on the importation of fruits and vegetables in order to prevent the introduction and dissemination of certain injurious insects, including fruit and melon flies, that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United States. Paragraphs (e) and () of \u00a7 319.56-2 contain requirements for the importation of certain fruits and vegetables based on their origin in a definite area or district. The definite area or district must meet certain criteria, including criteria designed to ensure that the area or district is free from all or certain injurious insects. Paragraph (h) of \u00a7 319.56-2 lists municipalities in Sonora, Mexico, that meet the criteria with regard to five listed insect pests: Ceratitis Apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines from municipalities in Sonora, Mexico, listed in paragraph (h) may be imported into the United States without treatment for the five listed insect pests. We are. proposing to add San Luis Rio Colorado to the list of municipalities in Sonora, Mexico, determined to be free from the five listed fruit flies and from which apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines may be imported into the United States without treatment of these pests. We believe that' San Luis Rio Colorado meets all the criteria contained in \u00a7 319.56-2(e)(4) and (f). Specifically, we have determined that: 1. Within the past 12 months, the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources has performed trapping surveys that show San Luis Rio Colorado to be free of the five listed fruit flies-including the Mexican fruit fly- and that the methods employed in these surveys met the requirements approvedby the Administrator as adequate to detect these infestations. 2. The Mexican government has adopted and is enforcing requirements to pr@vent the introduction into San Luis Rio Colorado of injurious insects known to attack fruits and vegetables; these requirements have been deemed by the Administrator to be at least equivalent to those requirements imposed under chapter III, title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations to prevent the introduction of injurious insects into the United States and the interstate spread of injurious insects. 3. The Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resource has submitted to the Administrator written detailed procedures for the conduct of surveys and the enforcement of requirements under paragraph (f) of \u00a7 319.56-2 to prevent the introduction of injurious insects into San Luis Rio Colorado. We are also proposing to make other nonsubstantive changes for the sake of clarity. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, and we have determined it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by theDepartment, we have determined that this rule would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million, would not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment. investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The action would allow the importation of apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines from San Luis Rio Colorado into the United States, without treatment for the five listed fruit flies. This action could increase imports of these articles into the United States, since import costs will be lowered through the elimination of treatment costs. The small entities that could be affected by this action include funiigators at the Mexican border, importers of the above-listed fruits, and domestic growers, distributors, and retailers of these fruits. The economic impact on these entities should be insignificant, since the amount of fruit imported into the44779 7 44780 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules United States from San Luis Rio Colorado is expected to be very small. Based on available information, we anticipate that only imports of oranges, peaches, and possibly grapefruit may increase as a result of this rule. Further, if imports of oranges and peaches from Sonora and imports of grapefruit from Mexico in general were to increase 10 percent from 1992 levels, this increase would amount to less than one percent of total U.S. production and less than one percent of total U.S. imports of these commodities. Consequently, we do not estimate any changes in prices or costs of fresh oranges, peaches, or grapefruit as a result of this rule. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule would allow fruit to be imported into the United States from San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico. If this proposed rule is adopted, State and local laws and regulations regarding fruit imported under this rule would be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and would remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If this proposed rule is adopted, no retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file'suit in court challenging this rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 966 (7 CFR part 966), both as amended, regulating the handling of tomatoes grown in Florida. The marketing agreement and order are authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. This rule has been reviewed by the Department of Agriculture (Department) in accordance with Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and the criteria contained in Executive Order 12291 and has been determined to be a \"non- major\" rule. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this proposed rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 50 handlers of Florida tomatoes that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 250 producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the tomato handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. This action proposes revising \u00a7 966.3 23 of Subpart-Administrative Rules and Regulations and is based on a recommendation of the Committee and other available information. In accordance with \u00a7 966.323, Handling Regulation, of the order's rules and regulations, fresh market shipments of Florida tomatoes sold within the regulated area must meet grade, size and inspection requirements. Fresh market shipments of tomatoes to points outside of the regulated area must also meet grade, size and inspection requirements, as well as container requirements. The regulated area is defined as that portion of the State of Florida which is bounded by the Suwannee River, the Georgia border, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Basically, it is the entire State of Florida, except for the panhandle. The production area is part of the regulated area. In recent years, the Committee has recommended various changes to this handling regulation in an attempt to improve returns to Florida tomato producers and provide consumers with a quality product. The Committee recommends that these regulations no longer apply to handlers shipping fresh tomatoes within the regulated area. According to the Committee, many handlers who sell tomatoes within the regulated area are small handlers who purchase the right to enter tomato fields and glean from them tomatoes that were picked over or missed by regular harvesting crews. These small handlers do not qualify as\"registered handlers\" under the marketing order. Registered handlers are defined as persons who have adequate facilities for grading tomatoes for market and who assume initial responsibility for compliance with inspection, assessment, and other regulatory requirements on the handling of 'tomatoes grown in the production area. These small handlers lack permanent, non-portable facilities to grade, size and pack tomatoes.In the past, the industry had marketing problems with poor quality tomato shipments within-the regulated area. The Committee indicates that this is no longer a problem. Tomatoes shipped within the regulated area normally are more ripe than those shipped outside that area, and cannot withstand shipment to more distant markets. Most tomatoes produced in Florida are shipped fresh to markets outside the regulated area. Hence, the Committee recommended that grade, size and inspection requirements implemented under the order only apply to shipments of fresh tomatoes made outside the regulated area. This action would modify the introductory paragraph by eliminating the reference to tomatoes shipped within the regulated area. There are also minor changes proposed in the regulation to clarify and conform with current industry practices. In the size provision, clarification is being proposed to show that size requirements would apply to all ,tomatoes packed by a \"registered\" handler. Currently the word\"registered\" is not included in the regulation. In addition, clarification is proposed to show that containers or \"lids\" shall be marked with the proper size. Currently, the word \"lids\" is not included in that language. To conform with current industry practices, this language should be changed as recommended. Regarding the provisions on special purpose shipments and safeguards, the Committee has recommended including authority for a special purpose shipment exemption for tomatoes for \"pickling\". Pickling is a common method of processing tomatoes and the Committee believes that pickling should be included in this provision. Under \u00a7 966.323(d)(2), the Committee recommended changing, from 60 pounds to 50 pounds, the minimum quantity of tomatoes that may be handled per day exempt from the handling regulation. Thirty-pound tomato boxes are no longer used. Twenty-five-pound cartons are the most common size shipped and the intent of the Committee is to exempt up to two boxes of tomatoes per day from the requirements of \u00a7 966.323. This recommended change is included in this proposed rule. With regard to container requirements of \u00a7 966.323(a)(3), the committee recommended a minor correction to the reference to the United States Standards for Grades of Fresh Tomatoes. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A 15-day comment period is provided to allow interested persons an opportunity to respond to this proposal. The Committee would like the proposed changes to be effective before October 10, 1993. That is the beginning of the period of regulation for the 1993-94 crop year. The Committee believes this action should be implemented at the beginning of the crop year.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the National Poultry Improvement Plan (the Plan) and its auxiliary provisions by providing new administrative and laboratory procedures for examining and testing participating flocks and preventing and responding to disease outbreaks. The proposed changes were voted on and approved by the voting delegates at the Plan's 1992 Biennial Conference. These changes would keep the provisions of the Plan current with changes in the poultry industry, allow the use of state-of-the-art laboratory procedures, and allow the Plan to better respond to disease emergencies. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before September 24, 1993. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 92- 151-1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays.

Rhorer, Senior Coordinator, Poultry Improvement Staff, National Poultry Improvement Plan, VS, APHIS, USDA, room 205, Presidential Building, 6525 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-7768. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The National Poultry Improvement Plan (referred to below as \"the Plan\") is a cooperative Federal-State-industry mechanism for controlling certain poultry diseases. The Plan consists of a variety of programs intended to prevent and control egg-transmitted, hatchery- disseminated poultry diseases. Participation in all Plan programs isvoluntary, but flocks, hatcheries, and dealers must qualify as \"U.S. Pullorum- Typhoid Clean\" before participating in any other Plan program. Also, regulations in 9 CFR 82.34 require that no hatching eggs or newly hatched chicks from egg-type chicken breeding flocks may be moved interstate unless they are classified \"U.S. Sanitation Monitored\" under the Plan or they meet the requirements of a State classification plan determined by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to be equivalent to the Plan, in accordance with 9 CFR 145.23(d). The Plan identifies States, flocks, hatcheries,- and dealers that meet certain disease control standards specified in the Plan's various programs. As a result, customers can buy poultry that has tested clean of certain diseases or that has been produced under disease- prevention conditions. The regulations in 9 CFR parts 145 and 147 (referred to below as \"the regulations\") contain the provisions of the Plan. APHIS amends these provisions from time to time to incorporate new scientific information and technologies within the Plan. We are proposing to amend the regulations by: 1. Adding definitions of Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, serial, and suspect flock 2. Clarifying the recordkeeping requirements for flocks maintained primarily for the production of hatching eggs; 3. Providing for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) approval of pullorum-typhoid tube agglutination antigens; 4. Allowing a sample of at least 500 birds, in lieu of the entire flock, to be tested by the State Inspector to qualify certain succeeding flocks for participation in the Plan's pullorum- typhoid program; 5. Removing provisions that allow two consecutive generations in egg-type chicken breeding flocks, meat-type chicken breeding flocks, and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks to go without testing for pullorum-typhoid; 6. Providing for the Plan to investigate any multi-State outbreak of a Plan disease; 7. Allowing the use of a federally licensed Salmonella enteritidis bacterin to vaccinate birds in egg-type chicken multiplier breeding flocks; 8. Providing for various sample sizes of live birds for bacteriological examination under the U.S. SanitationMonitored program for egg-type chickens; 9. Changing the name of the U.S. Sanitation Monitored program for egg- type chickens to U.S. S. enteritidis Monitored; 10. Adding a USDA-approved polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA procedure as a method of diagnosing mycoplasma; 11. Adding the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a basic screening test for mycoplasma; 12. Adding an alternative laboratory procedure for mycoplasma hemagglutination inhibition testing using a microtiter technique; 13. Providing for the most contemporary laboratory methods for use in environmental sample selection, Salmonella isolation, examination of Salmonella reactors, and program monitoring procedures for egg-type chicken breeding flocks, meat-type chicken breeding flocks, and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks; and 14. Amending the procedure for determining the status and effectiveness of sanitation monitored programs. These proposed amendments are consistent with the recommendations approved by the voting delegates to the National Plan Conference that was held from June 29 to July 2, 1992. Participants in the National Plan Conference represented flockowners, breeders, hatcherymen, and Official State Agencies from all cooperating States. The proposed amendments are discussed in greater detail below. Definitions We are proposing to add three definitions to \u00a7 145.1, which contains definitions for various terms used within the Plan. First, we would add definitions of Administrator and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. These terms are used in the regulations but are not defined. The definitions we would add are the same definitions used for the terms in other parts of 9 CFR chapter I. We would also add a definition of serial, a term that is used in this document in a proposed amendment to \u00a7 145.14. When used in connection with biological products, a serial is defined as the \"total quantity of completed product which has been thoroughly mixed in a single container and identified by a serial number.\" We have taken the definition from 9 CFR part 101, which contains definitions for terms used in regulations concerning viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules Finally, we would add a definition of suspect flock. A flock would be considered to be a suspect flock for the purposes of the Plan if any evidence exists that it has been exposed to a communicable poultry disease. The term would be useful in the event of an outbreak of a Plan disease, when even the slightest evidence that a flock may be exposed to a disease would demand investigation in order to ensure that the disease does not spread. Inspections Section 145.12 requires that the records of all flocks maintained primarily for the production of hatching eggs be examined annually, but does not specify which records are to be maintained or the length of time they are to be kept. We would amend \u00a7 145.12(b) to specify that the records shall include VS Form 9-2, \"Flock Selecting and Testing Report;\" VS Form 9-3, \"Report of Sales of Hatching Eggs, Chicks, and Poults;\" set and hatch records; egg receipts; and egg/chick orders or invoices. We would require the records to be maintained for 3 years. Keeping the records for 3 years is necessary to ensure the availability of complete records due to the differences between calendar years, hatching years (May to April), and reporting years (July to June). The records will provide the State Inspector with sufficient information to determine whether the flockowner is in compliance with the sanitation, blood testing, and other provisions of the Plan programs for which the flocks have, or are being, qualified. Blood Testing Section 145.14 contains requirements for the blood testing of poultry. The official blood tests for pullorum-typhoid set forth in \u00a7 145.14(a)(1) are the standard tube agglutination test, the microagglutination test, the ELISA test, and the rapid serum test for all poultry, and the stained antigen, rapid whole- blood test for all poultry except turkeys. The regulations require that all microtest antigens and ELISA reagents be approved by the Department, but does not require Department approval for tube agglutination antigens. The tube agglutination test is used for screening and to retest serum from positive reactions to the rapid whole-blood test in the field, If the reaction to this retest is positive in dilutions of 1:50 or greater for the standard tube agglutination test, additional examination of the bird and flock will be performed. It is, therefore, critical that the tube agglutination antigens be effective, so we are proposing to require that the tubeagglutination antigens, like the microtest antigens and ELISA reagents, be submitted to the Department for approval. The antigen producer would be required to submit a sample from each serial of antigen upon its manufacture and, because some serials of antigen may last more than a year, once a year thereafter as long as antigen from that serial continues to be made available for use. This would ensure the effectiveness of all antigens and reagents used in official tests for pullorum-' typhoid. Testing of Succeeding Flocks Section 145.14(a)(6) contains the pullorum-typhoid testing requirements that must be met for infected and succeeding flocks to qualify for participation in the Plan. Following the discovery of reactors in blood or serum from any flock, or the isolation of Salmonella pullorum or Salmonella gallinarum organisms in baby poultry or in fluff samples produced from hatching eggs, the infected flock must have two consecutive negative results to an official blood test for the flock to qualify for participation in the Plan. The succeeding flock, which is a flock brought onto the premises during the 12 months following the removal of an infected flock, must test negative to one official blood test. When the succeeding flock contains more than 5,000 birds, 100 percent testing of the flock is time-consuming and costly. To help save some of that time and cost, we are proposing to allow a sample of at least 500 birds from a succeeding flock of more than 5,000 birds to be tested in lieu of the entire flock. In some cases, the circumstances of an outbreak and the improbability of horizontal transmission, along with the cleaning and disinfection measures that are prescribed following an outbreak, make it unlikely that the disease could have been passed on to a succeeding flock. In such situations, 100 percent testing of the succeeding flock would not be required to ensure a disease-free flock, so a smaller sample would be appropriate. Each Official State Agency would retain the authority to order 100 percent testing if there is known to be infected progeny that originated from the infected flock, and the smaller sample would be allowed only with the agreement of the Official State Agency, the flockowner, and the Administrator.- This change in the regulations would give Official State Agencies a degree of flexibility in handling the testing of succeeding flocks, thus reducing the time and money spent on the testing of succeeding flocks following an outbreakof pullorum-typhoid in commercial flocks. Terminology and Classification; Flocks and Products Under the U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean program, a breeding flock composed of progeny of a primary breeding flock that is intended solely for the production of multiplier breeding flocks may qualify for U.S. Pullorum- Typhoid Clean status without being required to undergo blood testing for pullorum-typhoid. However, pullorum disease and/or fowl typhoid can be introduced, and infection can be established, at any level of primary breeding flock following lapses in basic biosecurity. If two generations of infected breeding flocks are allowed to go untested, pullorum disease and/or fowl typhoid could become widely distributed before being detected. Therefore, we would amend the provisions of the U.S. Pullorum- Typhoid Clean program for egg-type chickens, meat-type chickens, and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds (\u00a7\u00a7 145.23(b)(3), 145.33(b)(3), and 145.53(b)(3), respectively) to remove an exemption that allows two consecutive generations of breeding flocks to qualify for U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean status without undergoing blood tests for pullorum-typhoid. Investigation of Disease Outbreaks The U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean program also requires that Official State Agencies promptly investigate all reports of Salmonella pullorum or Salmonella gallinarum isolations from poultry to determine the origin of the infection. That requirement does not, however, provide for a coordinated investigation in the event of a multi- State disease outbreak. In order to facilitate the containment and eradication of such an outbreak, we are proposing to amend \u00a7\u00a7 145.23(b)(3)(v), 145.33(b)(3)(v), 145.43(b)(3)(v), and 145.53(b)(3)(v) to require that the Plan conduct an investigation of any outbreak of a Plan disease if the infection involves more than one State or if there is exposure to poultry in another State from the positive flock. Vaccination of Egg-Type Chicken Multiplier Breeding Flocks We are proposing to amend \u00a7 145.23(d) to allow birds in egg-type chicken multiplier breeding flocks to be vaccinated with a federally licensed Salmonella enteritidis bacterin. Section 145.23(d)(1)(v) currently requires that environmental samples be collected from the flock for testing when the birds in the flock are at least 4 months of age.44783 44784 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules We would amend \u00a7 145.23(d)(1)(v) to require that the environmental samples be collected from the flock sooner, when the birds are 2 to 4 weeks of age. We would add a new paragraph stating that after the samples have been tested and it has been confirmed that the flock is free of Salmonella enteritidis, the flock, except for 350 chickens, could be vaccinated with a licensed Salmonella enteritidis bacterin. The 350 chickens from the flock that were not vaccinated would be banded and set aside to serve as sentinel birds until the flock reaches 4 months of age. At that time, 300 of the sentinel birds would be officially tested with pullorum antigen, as described in current \u00a7 145.23(d)(1)(vi). Following negative serological and bacteriological testing, the banded, non-vaccinated birds would be vaccinated. Section 145.23(d)(3) requires that blood samples from 300 birds be tested every 30 days if Salmonella enteritidis is isolated from an environmental sample collected from the flock. Because blood samples taken from birds vaccinated with a Salmonella enteritidis bacterin would have positive reactions when tested with pullorum antigen, we would amend the requirement so that the requirement would apply only to non-vaccinated birds. Allowing egg-type chicken multiplier breeding flocks to be vaccinated with a federally licensed Salmonella enteritidis bacterin would provide protection for those flocks from chance sources of Salmonella enteritidis infection, such as infected wild birds, contaminated feed or waste, and infected personnel. This would also give added assurance that all chicks would remain free of Salmonella enteritidis. Testing of Egg-Type Chicken Flocks Section 145.23(d)(2) states that if Salmonella enteritidis is isolated from an environmental or other specimen collected from an egg-type chicken breeding flock, then a 60-bird random sample must be taken from the flock for laboratory analysis. If only one specimen bird from that 60-bird sample is found positive for Salmonella enteritidis, the Plan participant may request another 60-bird sample be bacteriologically examined. The size of these samples is standard, regardless of whether the flock contains 200 birds or 200,000. This can place an unfair burden on small hatcheries, which are required to sacrifice as many birds as a large hatchery. Therefore, we would amend \u00a7 145.23(d)(2) to set the required sample size at 60 birds for flocks containing 5,000 birds or more and 30 birds for flocks with fewer than 5,000 birds. If the participant requests that asecond sample be examined, that sample would be equal in size to the first sample. This revision would ease the burden on the owners of smaller flocks while still providing an adequate statistical sample of birds for testing. Salmonellosis Prevention and Control Programs As explained in \u00a7\u00a7 145.23(d) and 145.33(d), the U.S. Sanitation Monitored program for the breeding-hatching industry is intended to be the basis from which the industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of Salmonellosis. The classification \"U.S. Sanitation Monitored\" is currently used for both egg-type chickens and meat-type chickens, even though the requirements for each type of chicken are vastly different. We are proposing to amend \u00a7 145.23(d) to change the name of the program as it applies to egg-type chickens to \"U.S. S. enteritidis Monitored.\" This would eliminate the potential for any confusion between the programs. Testing of Mycoplasma Reactors Section 147.6 contains the procedure for determining the status of flocks that have reacted to tests for Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Mycoplasma meleagridis. The procedure calls for the use of an official test, either a macroagglutination test or a microagglutination test, as a basic screening test for mycoplasma. We are proposing to add a Department- approved PCR-based procedure as a supplemental means of identifying mycoplasma. The current laboratory procedures for determining the status of mycoplasma reactors require the isolation of the causative agent or the identification of antibodies produced by the birds in response to the infection. These techniques can be time-consuming and lack the desired degree of accuracy. The PCR-based procedure provides the ability to identify mycoplasma rapidly and accurately by its molecular structure, rather than by indirect measurements based on what the mycoplasma does in cell culture. Additionally, the ability to automate the PCR-based procedure for testing large numbers of samples should help achieve greater efficiency in terms of cost, accuracy, and reliability. Standard Test Procedures for Mycoplasma In \u00a7 147.7, the serum plate agglutination test and the tube agglutination test are identified as basic screening tests for mycoplasma antibodies. Which test is selecteddepends on preference, laboratory facilities, and the availability of antigen. We are proposing to add the EUSA test to \u00a7 147.7 as a third basic screening test for mycoplasma antibodies. Many breeders already use ELISA tests to monitor their flocks for a number of diseases. The ELISA test appears to be more accurate than the serum plate and tube agglutination tests, delivering fewer false positive and false negative results. Alternative Procedure for Microtiter Hemagglutination Inhibition Testing Section 147.7(e) contains the procedure for the mycoplasma hemagglutination inhibition test using microtiter technique. We are proposing to add an alternative method of conducting the test that would use a single 4-HA dilution of antigen for all serum dilutions, rather than the 8 HA units and 4 HA units of antigen called for by the current method. The alternative method would also have serial dilutions of serum samples made prior to the addition of 4 HA units of antigen to all dilutions. The current procedure adds 8 HA units of antigen to the first dilution (highest antibody concentration) and serially dilutes the antigen-antibody mixture into tubes or wells containing 4 HA units of antigen. The proposed alternative test is the same as the current test, with the exception of the different dilution, and appears to be just as effective. The new test, however, is easier to perform and can be conducted in half the time as the current test. Adding this alternative procedure would give laboratories the option of using either method, since both are scientifically sound. Bacteriological Examination Procedures Section 147.11 contains the recommended laboratory procedures for the bacteriological examination of salmonella reactors. We are proposing to add a new set of procedures to \u00a7 147.11 for use with egg-type chickens, meat- type chickens, and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds. (During the 1992 Plan conference, representatives of the turkey industry unanimously requested that turkeys be removed from consideration for this particular proposal. Because some of the techniques in the proposed procedure regarding salmonella do not apply to the examination of turkeys, the existingprocedures in \u00a7 147.11 would be retained for use with turkeys only.) The new procedures appear to provide more clarity and detail regarding the collection and handling of organ and intestinal samples from suspects or Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules serological reactors cultured in the Plan's Pullormn-Typhoid and Sanitation Monitored programs. Scientific bacteriological techniques for culturing these samples in both the Pullorum- Typhoid Program and the Sanitation Monitored Program would be provided in a pair of flow charts that would be included in the revision. The two charts update, and are intended to clarify, the earlier Plan specifications. Procedures to Determine Status and Effectiveness of Sanitation Monitored Program Section 147.14 contains monitoring procedures that may be applied at the discretion of the Official State Agency to determine the status and effectiveness of a sanitation monitored program. One of the procedures involves the culturing of samples from dead-in-shell eggs. We are proposing to amend that procedure to add a recommendation that the eggs be cultured in a preenrichment broth supplemented with ferrous sulfate prior to subculture into a tetrathionate selective enrichment. The ferrous sulfate would be added to egg preenrichients to counteract the salmonella-inhibiting characteristics of egg conalbumin and ovotransferrin. The proposed amendment to S 147.14 would also provide further direction on the culture techniques presented in the illustrations that would accompany the proposed addition to \u00a7 147.11 discussed above. This proposed amendment to \u00a7 147.14 would make the procedure for culturing dead-in-shell eggs consistent with recommendations presented in American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians and American Association of Avian Pathologists laboratory manuals. Miscellaneous In addition to the proposed changes discussed above, we would also make several nonsubstantive editorial changes. We would redesignate many of the footnotes in parts 145 and 147 so that the footnotes are numbered consecutively by part, instead of by section. We would also revise or amend some of the footnotes for the sake of clarity or to update information. Finally, we would amend \u00a7\u00a7 145.21,145.31, 145.41, 145.51, and 147.41, all of which contain definitions applicable to their respective subparts, by removing the paragraph designation for each definition and arranging the definitions in alphabetical order. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order12291, and we have determined that it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this proposed rule would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The proposed changes contained in this document are based on the recommendations of representatives of member States, hatcheries, dealers, flockowners, and breeders who took part in the Plan's 31st Biennial Conference. Because participation in the Plan is voluntary, individuals are likely to remain in the program as long as the costs of implementing the program are lower than the added benefits they receive from the program. The proposed changes would keep the provisions of the Plan current with changes in the poultry industry, allow the use of state- of-the-art laboratory and testing procedures, and allow the Plan to better respond to disease emergencies. Of the proposed amendments, only two are expected to have more than a negligible effect on Plan participants. The proposal to allow, in certain cases, a 500-bird sample to be tested in lieu of the entire flock would result in a cost savings for affected Plan participants because fewer tests would be required to qualify certain multiplier breeding flocks and succeeding flocks for participation in the Plan's pullorum- typhoid program. It is likely, however, that those savings would be offset by the amendment that would increase testing requirements by removing, for all poultry except turkeys, provisions that allow two consecutive generations of breeding flocks to go without testing for pullorum-typhoid. The remaining items, because they are either administrative or procedural in nature, are not expected to have a significant economic impact. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject toExecutive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget.

Purpose: To test for antibodies to avian mycoplasma byhemagglutination inhibition (HI). The test uses the constant antigen, titered- sera method for measuring antibodies toM. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, or M. meleagridis. (i) Materials needed. (A) M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and/or M. meleagridis HI antigens. (B) Positive and negative control sera. (C) Phosphate buffered saline (PBS). (D) Microtiter plates, 96-well, U- bottom. 5 For additional information on mycoplasma testprocedures, refer to the following references: Proc.77th Annual Meeting, U.S. Animal Health Association, 1973; Isolation and Identification ofAvian Pathogens, 2nd Edition; Methods for Examining Poultry Biologics and Quantifying Avian (G) Pipette tips. (H) 0.5 percent homologous red blood cells (RBC's) in PBS (use RBC's from the same species being tested). (I) Plate-sealing tape. (J) Mirrored plate reader. (ii) Microtiter hemagglutination (HA) antigen titration. (A) Perform standard hemagglutination test (HA) on mycoplasma antigen to determine titer of antigen. (1) Dispense 50 il of PBS into each well of 3 rows of a 96-well microtiter plate. (2) Dispense 50 91l of stock antigen into the wells of 2 rows. (3) Perform serial two-fold dilutions (50 gl) using a 12-channel pipettor. The dilution series will be from 1:2 to 1:4096. (4) Add 50 jIl of 0.5 percent homologous RBC's to each well of all 3 rows. The row with no antigen serves as an RBC control. (B) Incubate at room temperature (approximately 30 minutes) until the control RBC's give tight buttons. The HA titer is read as the last well to give a complete lawn (hemagglutination). The desired endpoint is 4 HA units. The well containing the 1:4 dilution should give a complete HA while the 1:8 dilution should show less than complete HA. (C) Dilute stock antigen to 4 HA units for the HI test. The dilution required togive 4 HA units is calculated by dividing the stock antigen HA titer by 8. (Example: 1:320 HA units + 8 = 40, dilute stock antigen 1:40.) (iii) Hemagglutination inhibition assay. (A) Label one column (A to H) of a 96- well, U-bottom microtiter plate for each sample, each positive and negative control sera, antigen backtitration, and RBC control. (B) Add 40 tl of PBS to the top row of wells (row A) of the plate. (C) Add 25 jil of PBS to all remaining wells of the plate. (D) Add 10 ttl of each test sera to well A of each column (making a 1:5 sera dilution). (E) Serially dilute 25 p1 from well Athrough H using a 12-channel pipettor. Discard the final 25 gl. Row A=1:5...row H=1:640. (F) With an Oxford doser, add 25911 of 4 HA unit antigen to wells B through H. Well A serves as sera control. (G) Prepare an antigen backtitration by adding 25 91l of PBS to each well of one column. Add 25 W1 of diluted antigen to well A and serially dilute 25 91l from wells A to D. This prepares 1:2,1:4, 1:8, and 1:16 dilutions. (It is recommended that the antigen control backtitration be performed before the diluted antigen is used in the assay. Dilution problems could be detected and corrected before the inappropriately diluted antigen is used in the assay.) (H) Leave a column of wells blank for an RBC control. (I) Agitate gently and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. (J) Add 50 91 of 0.5 percent RBC's to all wells. Note: Do not agitate after RBC's have been added (agitation may result in false positive reactions by causing the RBC's to fall, resulting in \"false\" buttons). (K) Cover the plate with sealing tape. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes or until control RBC's give a tight button. (L) Read the reaction on a mirrored plate reader(iv) Results. (A) The titer is reported as the reciprocal of the last dilution to give a tight button of RBC's. The final dilution scheme includes the antigen in the dilution calculation be valid: (1) The positive control sera must give a result within one dilution of the previously determined titer. (2) The negative control sera must be negative. 3) The backtitration of the antigen must be 1:4 or 1:8. (4) The RBC control must give tight, non-hemolyzed buttons. (5) Sera controls (well A of each test sera) must not have non-specific agglutination or hemolysis. If agglutination or hemolysis\" non-specific agglutination or hemolysis\" or treat the serum to remove the non-specific agglutination and repeat the test. (See paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section.) (v) Treatment to remove non-specific agglutination. (A) Purpose. Treatment of serum to remove non-specific agglutination that is interfering with HI assays. (B) Specimen. Serum. (C) Materials. Homologous RBC's (chicken or turkey), 50 percent solution PBS, centrifuge, incubator, 4C (refrigerator). (D) Procedure. (1) Prepare a 1:5 dilution of test serum by adding 50 911of serum to 200 1 of PBS. (2) Prepare a 50 percent solution of RBC's by adding equal volumes of packed RBC's to PBS. Mix well. (3) Add 25 91 of 50 percent RBC solution to the serum dilutions. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules (4) Vortex gently to mix. (5) Incubate at 40 C for 1 hour. (6) Centrifuge to pellet the RBC's. (7) Use the supernatant to perform the HI assay. Modify the dilution scheme in the assay to consider the initial 1:5 dilution prepared in the treatment. For the 1:5 dilution scheme, do not add PBS to row A. Add 50 p1 of the 1:5 treated supernatant to row A. Serially dilute 25 lil from rows A through H. This prepares a serum dilution of 1:10 through 1:640 in rows B through H. 22.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Small Business Administration (SBA) is proposing to establish an alternate size standard criterion for its Business Loan (7(a)) Program which would allow a concern to qualify if it satisfied the $6.0 million net worth and $2.0 million net income tests presently used for its Certified Development Company Program or financing under the Small Business Investment Company Program. The proposal will simplify size standards by extending the \"alternate standard\" to the Business Loan Program. However, a firm may still continue to qualify as a small business pursuant to the size standard applicable to its primary industry, even if it does not meet this alternate standard. The primary purpose of this proposal is to solicit additional comments for the Agency's consideration and review prior to a final decision on the alternate size standard that was temporarily in effect between December 31, 1992 and March 4, 1993 for the 7(a) Loan Program. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before October 25, 1993. ADDRESSES: Send Comments To: Gary M. Jackson, Director, Size Standards Staff, 409 3rd Street, SW-suite 8150, U.S. Small Business Administration, Washington, DC 20416. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carl Jordan or Robert N. Ray, Size Standards Staff, (202) 205-6618. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 31, 1992, the SBA had adopted, on an interim final basis (57 FR 62477), this proposed alternate size standard criterion for its General Business Loan (7(a)) Program. However, the incoming Administration directed that all recently published but not finalized rules were to be thoroughly reviewed, and all Government Agencies were to determine their implications (Office of Management and Budget Memorandum on Regulatory Review, dated January 22, 1993 to Heads and Acting Heads of Federal Agencies). The SBA withdrew the alternate size standard criterion on March 4, 1993 (58 FR 12334) so it could further evaluate the implications of such a standard. The newly appointed SBA Administration has completed its review of the previously published rule, and believesthe reasons for the alternate 7(a) size standard have continued merit and deserve consideration by SBA and the public. Hence, SBA is publishing this rule as a proposed (and not as an interim final rule) to afford the public additional opportunity to comment on the alternate size standard prior to any final Agency decision. A concern currently applying for a 7(a) loan must meet its current applicable industry size standard, unless and until this proposed rule becomes final. SBA's regulations currently allow a concern applying for either a loan under the Certified Development Company (504) Program or financing under the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program to qualify as a small business if, together with its affiliates, its net worth does not exceed $6.0 million and it has an average of not more than $2.0 million in net income (after Federal Income Taxes) measured over the concern's preceding two completed fiscal years (13 FR \u00a7 121.802(a)(2)). A firm that exceeds those net worth or net income levels (hereinafter the \"alternate standard\") can also be considered an eligible small business if its size is at or below the separate numerical size standard established for its industry (\u00a7 121.601). Under this proposed rule, the two- part alternate standard test would also be applied to SBA's General Business Loan (17(a)) Program. As such, a concern applying for a 7(a) loan could elect to meet either the alternate standard or the single employee- or receipts-based standard that is specified for its industry. However, it should specifically be noted that this is a proposed rule and as such, a concern currently applying for a 7(a) loan does not have the option of meeting the alternate standard. As indicated above, SBA's regulations allow a business to be considered small for purposes of two of the Agency's financial programs, but not the 7(a) Program. Because of this situation, a business may, for example, qualify as a small business and obtain financing pursuant to the 504 Program (to construct a building), but not be able to obtain a loan under the 7(a) Program (to purchase inventory). This anomalous situation is exacerbated by the current economic climate in which businesses, and in particular small businesses, are having great difficulty obtaining credit in the private market. To resolve this situation, SBA is proposing this alternate size standard criterion noting that it merely expands the types of financing for which small businesses that already qualify as \"small44793 44794 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules businesses,\" under the alternate standard for other purposes, are eligible. This change would also benefit small business by simplifying the size standards applicable to applicant firms. A two-part alternate standard applicable to every firm, regardless of its type of business activity, reduces the burden and confusion as to whether or not the firm is a small business, which can be encountered in determining the size standard for its primary industry. Most firms eligible as small businesses under the industry size standard will also be eligible under the alternate standard. In those few cases where the firm exceeds the net worth and net income test, the firm would ascertain Wjhether it is an eligible small business undei the more complicated industry size standards. Thus, this change greatly simplifies the determination of the size standard for a loan applicant. SBA specifically invites comment, including from the commentators on the December 31, 1992 Interim Final Rule (57 FR 62477), on the appropriateness of these alternate size standards expressed in net worth and net income terms. SBA is seeking comment both as to its proposal to use these measures as alternate measures to its standard industry specific size standards for its 7(a) Business Loan Program and the appropriate magnitude (either higher or lower) of these measures if the commentor(s) believe these alternative measures should be used. SBA is willing to consider industry data and other information prior to making a final decision on a size standard. Comments on this standard or suggesting other standards should address the questions of: .The interaction of this size standard with SBA's programs; 9 The relative levels of participation at different size standards; e The effect of this proposed size standard or other alternative size standards on business firms within these industries; * The prospect of significant new entrants into these industries in response to this program; and * The impact of higher size standard on smaller-sized businesses. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12291, 12612 and 12778, and the. Paperwork Reduction Act General SBA considers that this proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities for purposes of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.). In addition, this proposed rule constitutes a major rule for the purpose of Executive Order 12291. Immediately below SBA has set forth a summary regulatory impact analysis and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of this pruposal. (1) Description of Entities to Which the Rule Applies For purposes of financial assistance, SBA estimates that about 47,000 firms currently defined as small businesses for the 504 and SBIC Programs will be eligible to seek financial assistance offered by the SBA's 7(a) Business Loan Program, provided they meet other program requirements for assistance. The vast majority of the firms gaining eligibility for the 7(a) Program because of this rule operate in the retail trade and services industries; almost no firms in manufacturing or mining will gain eligibility for the 7(a) Program because of this rule. The proposed size standard would not impose a regulatory burden because it does not regulate or control business behavior. (2) Description of Potential Benefits of the Rule Under this proposed rule small firms which are already eligible for other SBA financial assistance, will be eligible for the 7(a) Business Loan Program. This may result in job creation or retention in certain areas and localities, with associated benefits in consumer spending and tax revenue, but such benefits are difficult to quantify. Direct benefits in terms of number and volume of loans can be estimated, however. SBA accordingly estimates that about 450 firms each year should receive approximately $200 million in loans that would otherwise not be guaranteed under the existing size standards. Another real but unquantifiable benefit would be the saving in time to potential borrowers and SBA personnel who may consult a simple, streamlined size standard instead of the lengthy table and associated Standard Industrial Classification codes and their descriptions that must now be examined before each anticipated or actual loan transaction. (3) Description of Potential Costs of the Rule This proposed rule should not result in any extra costs with respect to SBA's loan programs. The competitive effects of size standards revisions differ from those normally associated with regulations affecting key economic factors such as the price of goods andservices, costs, profits, growth, innovation, mergers, and foreign trade. The change to size standards is not anticipated to have any appreciable effect on any of these factors. (4) Description of the Potential Net Benefits From the Rule From the above discussion, SBA believes that, because the potential costs of this proposed rule are minimal, the potential net benefits would approach fairly closely the potential benefits. The impact of the new size standard will appear exclusively in the Federal business lending area to which it is targeted. (5) Description of Reasons Why This Action Is Being Taken and Objectives of the Rule SBA has provided above a statement of the reasons why the new alternate standard for the Business Loan Program is being proposed and a statement of the reasons for and objectives of this proposal. (6) Legal Basis for the Proposed Rule The legal basis for the proposal is sections 3(a) and 5(b) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632(a), 634(b)(6), 637(a), and 644(c). (7) Federal Rules There are no Federal rules which duplicate, overlap or conflict with this proposed rule. SBA has statutorily been given exclusive jurisdiction in establishing size standards. (8) Significant Alternatives to the Proposed Rule This proposed rule will establish the most appropriate standards by which to define those small businesses that are eligible for SBA's financial assistance programs. There are no significant alternatives to defining a small business. SBA certifies that this proposed rule will not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. SBA further certifies that this proposed rule will not add any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C., Chapter 35. For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this proposed rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of that order.

Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Corporate Jets Limited Model BAe 125-800A and -1000A series airplanes. The CAA advises of reports of exfoliation corrosion of the wing leading edge skins at the interface with the wing anti-ice fluid distribution panel (TKS panel). Exfoliation corrosion is due to the ingress of moisture through gaps in the sealant that have developed during service. Exfoliation corrosion, if not detected and corrected, could reduce the structural integrity of the interface joint, which could adversely affect the flight characteristics of the airplane. Exfoliation corrosion also could cause in-flight separationf airplane components. Corporate Jets Limited has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 57-77, dated May 20, 1993, that describes procedures for conducting a one-time detailed visual inspection to detect corrosion of the wing leading edge skins, including the TKS panel rebate and radius, and a one- time dye penetrant inspection to detect exfoliation corrosion of the TKS panel rebate and radius. This service bulletin also describes procedures for removing corrosion from the wing leading edge skins, including the TKS panel rebate and radius, and subsequent enhanced protective treatment of TKS panel rebate and radius on the top and bottom leading edge skin section on each wing. Exfoliation corrosion is indicated by short, fine lines flowing in the direction of the grain. (This service bulletin references Corporate Jets Limited Repair Instruction Letter.25WS279, dated April 30, 1993, and Corporate Jets Limited44795 44796 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules Repair Instruction Letter 25WS294. dated June 5, 1993, for additional service information.) The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of \u00a7 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA. reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States. the proposed AD would require a one-time detailed visual inspection to detect corrosion of the wing leading edge skin, and repair of the wing leading edge skins, if necessary. It would also require a detailed visual inspection and a dye penetrant inspection to detect exfoliation corrosion of the TKS panel rebate and radius on the top and bottom leading edge skin section on each wing, and removal of corrosion, if necessary. Finally, this proposed rule would require the application of a corrosion protection treatment on the TKS panel rebate and radius on the top and bottom leading edge skin section on each wing. The inspections, removal of corrosion, and corrosion protection treatment wouldio required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 154 Corporate Jets Limited Model BAe 125-800A and -1000A series airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. that it would take approximately 50 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $423,500, or $2,750 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a \"significant, rule\" under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact. positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: Advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is announcing its intention to publish regulations governing the establishment of financial responsibility for offshore oil facilities and gas facilities with concurrent gas condensate production, and requests comments from interested parties. This action is necessary to ensure that parties responsible for offshore oil and gas facilities are able to meet the financial responsibility requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). These regulations will establish a level of financial responsibility at $150 million for all offshore facilities in, on, or under the navigable waters of the United States (U.S.). DATES: Comments should be received or postmarked by October 25, 1993 to receive full consideration. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed or hand delivered to the Department of the Interior; Minerals Management Service, Mail Stop 4700; 381 Elden Street; Herndon, Virginia 22070-4817; Attention: Chief, Engineering and Standards Branch. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William S. Cook, Chief, Inspection and Enforcement Branch, telephone (703) 787-1610 or FAX (703) 787-1575. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Minerals Management Service (MMS) isdeveloping new regulations to implement Title I and section 4303 of OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. 2701) for offshore facilities in navigable waters of the U.S. These regulations will: * Establish the amount of oil spill financial responsibility that must be evidenced by responsible parties at $150 million; o Establish requirements for certification of financial responsibility for all \"offshore facilities\" (as defined in OPA 90) including those in, on, or under any navigable waters, including inland waters, of the States of the U.S., territories, and possessions, and facilities subject to U.S. jurisdiction in, on, or under any other waters. o Define acceptable methods available to demonstrate evidence of oil spill financial responsibility; a Define procedures to be used to submit evidence of oil spill financial responsibility; a Define responsibilities, liabilities, and defenses of guarantors; * Establish the maximum civil penalties to which responsible parties are subject as $25,000 per day of violation; and * Establish civil penalties procedures. The MMS solicits information and comments on OPA 90 issues, and MMS' preliminary interpretation of the OPA 90 requirements. Commentors should propose solutions to any problems they anticipate in complying with the OPA 90 requirements. The MMS is also seeking information on the effect of the new OPA 90 requirements on the oil, financial, and insurance industries; how MMS can best utilize the administrative expertise and experience of State regulatory agencies; and the concerns of environmental groups and other interested parties. In August 1990, Congress passed OPA 90 which contains various provisions aimed at: o Strengthening oil spill prevention, response capability, and cleanup efforts. o Ensuring payment of damages resulting from oil spills. Title mI of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (OCSLAA 78) was repealed and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 were amended by OPA 90. To implement the authority under OPA 90, Executive Order (E.O.) 12777 was signed by the President on October 18, 1991, and was published in the Federal Register on October 22, 1991 (56 FR 54757). The E.O. delegated certain responsibilities to the Secretary of the Interior, including responsibilities relative to ensuring evidence of financial responsibility for companies operating offshore facilitieson the OCS and other U.S. navigable waters. The Secretary subsequently redelegated these responsibilities to the Director, MMS. A similar function was previously performed by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) on OCS waters under the authority of Title III of OCSLAA 78, and implemented by 33 CFR part 135 provides that the regulations in 33 CFR part 135 be continued effective until new offshore financial responsibility regulations are promulgated. On October 1, 1992, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was signed transferring the personnel, equipment, and files associated with the function to the MMS in furtherance of the delegations in E.O. 12777. Affected Facilities The definition of \"facility\" in OPA 90 (section 1001(9)) includes all structures, equipment, or devices, other than vessels and deep water ports, used for the purposes of exploring for, drilling for, producing, storing, handling, transferring, processing, or transporting oil. This term specifically includes pipelines. For the purposes of administering section 1016 of OPA 90, the MMS will apply financial responsibility requirements, in the case of offshore facilities other than pipelines, to the lessee or permittee of the area in which the facility is located or the holders of a right of use and easement granted under applicable State law or the OCS Lands Act for the area in which the facility is located. In the case of pipelines, the MMS will apply financial responsibility requirements to any person owning or operating pipelines located in, on, or under the navigable waters of the U.S. Under E.O. 12777, the responsibility for Deepwater Ports has been assigned to the Department of Transportation. Geographic Jurisdiction The financial responsibility requirements for offshore facilities under OPA 90 apply to all-U.S. navigable waters. The law (OPA 90) defines U.S. navigable waters as the waters of the U.S. including the territorial sea. This includes all of the States of the U.S., the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession of the U.S. Also, these new authorities and responsibilities apply to offshore facilities that the MMS currently regulates for oil and gas operations in the OCS.I I I I44797 44798 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules Through its definition of the terms\"navigable waters of the United States,\" and \"offshore facility\" in section 1001(22), OPA 90 extends its provisions concerning offshore facilities to facilities in, on, or under navigable waters of the U.S. and any facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. in, on, or under other waters. Thus, for example, a company operating a petroleum pipeline that crosses the Ohio River below Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, would be subject to the $150 million financial responsibility provisions of this rule, as would the operator of an oil well in the Great Lakes. Implementation Procedures In developing regulations to implement the oil spill financial responsibility requirements of OPA 90, the MMS will need to determine whether the following concepts in the existing regulations at 33 CFR part 135 can be used to address the responsibilities delegated under E.O. 12777: 9 Evidence of financial responsibility may be provided by one or more Guarantors for one or more offshore facilities of a particular responsible WVhere multiple responsible parties own an offshore facility, evidence of financial responsibility may be established and maintained on behalf of all of the parties by that party- designated as the lead responsible party. SWhen evidence of financial responsibility is established in a consolidated form, the proportional share of each Guarantor must be shown. e Each responsible party of an offshore facility Is subject to civil penalties and/or referral to the Department of Justice if the required evidence of financial responsibility is not established and maintained. * Evidence of financial responsibility may be established and maintained by any one or any combination of acceptable methods. * Individual insurance underwriters, indemnitors, and bonding companies are subject to direct action to the extent of their contracts, indemnity coverage, or bond. Solicited Information Responses to the following questions are requested to assist MMS in formulating the requirements to implement OPA 90. In addition, to help fulfill its responsibilities for determining the economic effects of regulations, MMS requests information that can be used to determine the potential economic effect of thisrulemaking on the oil and gas, the pipeline, the insurance, the fishing, the tourism, and other industries. 1. The MMS solicits information on the types and locations of facilities that may be subject to the offshore financial responsibility requirements of OPA 90. The OPA 90 defines an offshore facility as any facility of any kind located in, on, or under any of the navigable waters of the U.S., and any facility of any kind which is subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. and is located in, on, or under any other waters, other than a vessel or a public vessel. In addition, OPA 90 defines a facility as any structure, group of structures, equipment, or device (other than a vessel) which is used for one or more of the following purposes: exploring for, drilling for, producing, storing, handling, transferring, processing, or transporting oil. This term includes any motor vehicle, rolling stock, or pipeline used for one or more of these purposes. Comments are invited on whether or not, and if not why not, this definition includes: -Pipelines crossing over bodies of water on bridges, piers, breakwaters, berms, or similar structures. -Fuel storage tanks, piping, and hoses installed in, on (i.e., in contact with or supported above), or under navigable waters, including those facilities in private marinas. -Pipelines in, on, or under inland navigable waters but not crossing the inland navigable waters. -Pipelines that cross in, on, or under both land masses and inland navigable waters. -Pipelines that cross under inland navigable waters in tunnels or are surrounded by other impermeable barriers. -Pipelines that cross the waters of the U.S. and the waters of another country. -Drill strings, flow lines, or production casing extending under navigable waters but originating from land- based drilling and production facilities. -Other structures to which the applicability of OPA 90 may be unclear. 2. Section 1016(e) of OPA 90, and 33 CFR part 135 enumerate the following potential ways of demonstrating of the above methods.What additional methbds of demonstrating evidence of the $150 million level of financial responsibility exist to enable responsible parties and guarantors to meet the requirement? Do all of these methods provide equal assurance that all claims will be paid in a timely manner? 3. Section 1019 of OPA 90 states, \"A State may enforce, on the navigable waters of the State, the requirements for evidence of financial responsibility under section 1016.\" The MMS is seeking comments on: -Existing State programs that can be demonstrated to be equivalent to OPA 90. --Other State programs that address oil spill financial responsibility. -How States expect to administer evidence of financial responsibility programs consistent w'ith OPA 90. -What relationships can exist between MMS and States that do and States that do not have their own evidence of financial responsibility programs. -How MMS can verify that a State program satisfies the requirements of OPA 90. -What contact and coordination mechanisms MMS can establish with States. -To what extent MMS may be allowed to defer offshore facility financial responsibility under OPA 90 to a State program. 4. The oil and gas industry has expressed concerns regarding the availability of insurance for those responsible parties that cannot self- insure. Insurers attribute their problem to claimant direct action, duplicative liability under State law, and determinations of covered damages. The MMS is seeking comments regarding: -Whether and how direct action, language limiting liability, uncertain scope of damage provisions, and lack of preemption provisions in OPA 90 affect the availability of insurance. -What regulatory approaches are available under OPA 90 that may improve the availability of an, insurance market. 5. Section 1016(e) of OPA 90 authorizes MMS, as the agent of the President, to specify policy or other contractual terms, conditions, or defenses which are necessary, or which are unacceptable, in establishing evidence of financial responsibility. The MMS is seeking comments regarding: -What defenses should be available to a Guarantor to ensure the availability of affordable bonds, insurance, or other forms of guarantees. --On what terms and conditions, if any. should bank letters of credit be -. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday,. August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules acceptable as evidence of financial responsibility. --On what terms and conditions, if any, should third party guaranties be acceptable as evidence of financial responsibility. -On what terms and conditions should a lessee/operator be allowed to self- insure for financial responsibility obligations under OPA 90. 6. Self-insurance, as well as insurance, re-insurance, and other indemnity mechanisms have been identified as methods to achieve the $150 million oil spill financial responsibility requirement of OPA 90. The MMS is seeking comments regarding: -What organizational structures could be used for other indemnity mechanisms. -What limitations are appropriate for these indemnity mechanisms to ensure that adequate financial responsibility coverage exists for all participating responsible parties. -To what extent can a single indemnity mechanism be acceptable as evidence for a number of responsible parties or their offshore facilities. -Should the utilization of a single indemnity mechanism be limited by a maximum number of offshore facilities or a maximum volume of oil handled by the offshore facilities. If not, why not. -What financial tests or criteria should be used to judge applications for self- insurance. 7. For the purposes of administering section 1016 of OPA 90, the MMS interpretation of the definition for \"oil\" in section 1001(23) of OPA 90, excludes facilities that handle or produce only dry natural gas. The MMS recognizes that some quantity of natural gas liquids may be produced with the gas. Facilities handling at any one time 1,000 barrels or less of these highly volatile, light end petroleum fractions were exempted from the USCG financial responsibility regulations (33 CFR part 135) because these liquids posed significantly less environmental risk than crude or refined oil. The MMS is seeking comments and the basis for those comments regarding: -Should offshore facilities that store or process only dry natural gas be exempt from the financial responsibility requirements of OPA 90. -Should offshore facilities that store or process a de minimis quantity of natural gas condensate be exempt from the financial responsibility requirements of OPA 90.-What are appropriate de minimis quantities. 8. The oil and gas industry has claimed that the requirement for $150 million in financial responsibility may result in premature abandonment of wells and preclude their transfer to smaller companies. The MMS Is seeking comments regarding: -What information is available to substantiate this claim. -How regulations can be structured to avoid premature abandonment of producing wells. Persons choosing to respond to this notice should send comments to the address shown in the addresses section. Following the analysis of comments received, proposed rules governing oil spill financial responsibility for offshore facilities will be developed and published in the Federal Register.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the nationalambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical'expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the Federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these smallbusiness assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 oftitle V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. The State of North Dakota has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 507. In order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. H. Analysis The State of North Dakota has met all of the requirements of Section 507 by submitting a SIP revision thatimplements all required PROGRAMelements. The North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories (the Department) formally adopted the proposed SIP revision on October 23, 1992, which outlines the establishment of a PROGRAM. N.D.C.C. Sections 23-25-02 and 23-25-03 grant the the Department the authority to undertake the elements of the PROGRAM. Executive Order 1992-5 dated May 21, 1992, issued by the Governor of North Dakota, established a Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of North Dakota. 1. Small Business Assistance Program Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements I that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by committing in its proposed SIP revision Section 12.5 to \"act as an information clearinghouse by referring small businesses to State technical experts within the Department who are trained to handle specific questions relevant to achieving compliance with the CAA.\" Section 12.5.1 further describes how this will be accomplished. A toll-free hotline will be established to direct calls from small businesses, the SBAP will be advertised through various methods, and informational packets will be distributed. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The State has met this requirement by committing in its proposed SIP revision Section 12.5 that the SBAP will collect and disseminate information to small businesses on pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention. Section 12.5.2 further commits to promote the goals of pollution prevention through training programs, workshops, and seminars, and to makeavailable to small businesses I A seventh requirement of section.507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section.information on the prevention and detection of accidental releases. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the Actin a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by committing in its proposed SIP revision Section 12.5 to collect and disseminate information to small businesses on determining applicable requirements under the CAA through the SBAP. Section 12.5.3 further commits to\"provide direct and timely, one-on-one assistance to small businesses in * * * identifying applicable rules, determining the need for a permit, and identifying alternative methods or procedures for achieving compliance with the applicable rules.\" The fourth and fifth requirements are to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights and obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. This must be done in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the Act. The State has met these requirements by committing in its proposed SIP revision Section 12.5 to collect and disseminate information on small business' rights and obligations under the CAA, and on audit programs and procedures. Section 12.5.4 further states that the Department will notify small businesses of their rights in a timely manner through ,pamphlets, public service announcements, word-of-mouth from field inspectors, and by making presentations at trade or chamber of commerce meetings. In Section 12.5.5, the Department commits to maintaining a list of environmental consulting companies qualified to conduct audits, and making that list available upon request. For sources that do not have the resources to hire an independent consultant, the Department will, upon request, \"conduct a consultation audit to assess the need for control measures and/or a Permit to Operate.\" The Department will also conduct an auditin conjunction with the initial inspection for those sources required to obtain a Permit to Operate to ensure thatthe source is in compliance. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement by committing in its proposed SIP revision Section 12.5 to \"consider requests from a small business stationary sources for modifications of work practices, technological methods of compliance, or compliance procedures and provide guidance as necessary.\" Section 12.5.6 further details the procedures for requesting a modification of work practices or alternate control methods. 2. Ombudsman Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. The State has met this requirement by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office of the Chief of the Environmental Health Section effective April 6, 1992, as stated in its proposed SIP revision Section 12.3. 3. Compliance Advisory Panel Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The State has met this requirement by establishing the CAP under Executive Order 1992-5 issued by the Governor on May 21, 1992, and through its proposed SIP revision Section 12.4 which outlines how the members will be determined, which is consistent with the method described above. In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, andthe Regulatory Flexibility Act; 2 (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements by outlining in its proposed SIP revision Section 12.4 the functions of the CAP which is consistent with those stated above. 4. Eligibility Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term \"small business stationary source\" as a stationary source that: (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Btsiness Act; (C) Is not a major stationary source; (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. The State of North Dakota has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA. The State of North Dakota has also provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants, and for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. Section 12.2 of the proposed SIP revision states that the SBAP \"will be available to all small business stationary sources as defined by section 507(c) of the 1990 CAAA and all such eligible sources will not be excluded from the program without prior EPA approval.\" 2 Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since State agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes.M. Action In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision submitted by the State of North Dakota. The State of North Dakota has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the CAA. Section 12.3 of the State's proposed SIP revision states that the Small Business Ombudsman was established on April 6, 1992, and details what the role and duties of the Ombudsman will be. The CAP was established under Executive Order 1992-5 issued by the Governor on May 21, 1992. Section 12.4 of the State's proposed SIP revision outlines the duties of the CAP and how its members will be chosen. A schedule for implementation of the State's SBAP submitted in a letter by the State dated January 18, 1993, indicates that the legislature will appoint panelists to the CAP by January 31, 1993, and that the first meeting will be April 1, 1993. This implementation schedule further indicates that the small business hotline will be installed by July 1, 1993. EPA is therefore proposing to approve this submittal. This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989., the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By this action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. This program does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to44801 44802 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

H. Analysis The State of Utah has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required PROGRAMelements. House Bill 129 was passed to amend the Utah Air Conservation Act to add Section 19-2-109.2, which authorizes establishment of a SBAP, and creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel. The State of Utah proposes to amend the Utah SIP to include Section 17, which is a plan for implementation of the SBAP. R307-2 of the Utah Air Conservation Rules incorporates this proposed SIP amendment by reference. 1. Small Business Assistance Program Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements, that the State must meet to have an-approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by committing in its regulations Section 17.3.3 to \"develop a library of information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources.\" The State has the authority to establish a toll-free hotline to address questions regarding compliance. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The State has met this requirement by including a commitment in its regulations Section 17.3.2 to \"answer questions from small business stationary sources about pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention * * * alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.\" The State has the authority to establish a toll-free hotline for such purposes. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by committing in its regulations Section I A seventh requirement of section 507(a). establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules 17.3.5 to establish programs and work with trade associations and state and local governments to inform small businesses of new and existing state and federal rules. In Section 17.3.2 of its regulations, the State commits to help small businesses fill out permit application and emission inventory forms. The State has the authority to establish a toll-free hotline which would enable small businesses to ask questions about air quality rules. The fourth and fifth requirements are to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of its rights and obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. This must be done in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the Act. The State has met these requirements by committing in Section 17.3.4 of its regulations to \"provide timely information to small businesses concerning their rights and obligations under the State and Federal Clean Air Act\" and to \"perform audits of the operations of small businesses\" or \"refer that small business stationary source to qualified auditors.\" The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of (A) any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement by committing in Section 17.3.6 of its regulations to\"consider requests from a small business stationary source for modifications of any work practice or technological method of compliance, or the schedule of milestones for implementing these modifications.\" The State has the authority to consider the technologicaf and financial capability of small businesses making such requests. 2. Ombudsman Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. The State has met this requirement by locating the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman inthe Department of Environmental Quality, Office of the Executive Director, as stated in Section 17.5.1 of its regulations. This section commits to fund the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman with air pollution emission fees. 3. Compliance Advisory Panel * Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The State has met this requirement by committing in Section 17.4.1 of its regulations to appoint the members of the CAP as stated above. In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report ta EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act;2 (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements by committing in Section 17.4.2 of its regulations to: (1) \"Render advisory opinions to the Executive secretary concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered, and the degree and severity of enforcement\";\" (2) makereports to EPA * * * concerning the compliance of the SBAP with the requirements of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Equal Access to Justice Act to the extent these laws apply to the state program\"; (3) \"to review information prepared by the SBAP * * * to make sure the information is understandable by the layperson\"; and to (4) \"monitor the progress of the SBAP and make suggestions to the Air Quality Board through the Executive Secretary to 2 Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However; since State agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the.SBAP Is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes.improve the effectiveness of the program.\" 4. Eligibility Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term \"small business stationary source\" as a stationary source that: (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (C) Is not a major stationary source; (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. The State of Utah has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA. This mechanism is contained in Section 17.2.1 of the State's regulations. The State of Utah has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1) (C), (D), and (E) of the CAA but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants. This provision is contained in Section 17.2.2 of the State's regulations. The State of Utah has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. This provision is contained in Section 17.2.3 of the State's regulations. III. Action In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision submitted by the State of Utah. The State of Utah has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the CAA. Section 17.6 of the State's regulations is a schedule for implementation of its SBAP. By July 1, 1993, the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman will be designated in the Department of Environmental Quality. By November 15, 1993, the members of the Compliance Advisory Panel will be appointed. By November 15, 1994, or date of approval of its Operating Permit Program, if earlier, the SBAP will be44803 44804 Federal Regisler / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules fully implemented. EPA is therefore proposing to approve this submittal. This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Tables 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By this action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. This program does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses. I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. Authori. 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. Dated: August 10, 1993.

Introduction The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region I announces its intent to delete the Plymouth Harbor/Cannons Engineering Corporation Site, Plymouth, Massachusetts. from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on this deletion. The EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare. or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance Superfund Response Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to \u00a7 300.425 (e)(3) of the NCP. any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if conditions at the site warrant such action. The EPA will accept comments concerning this site for thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register. Section I1 of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses how the site meets the deletion criteria. II. NPL Deletion Criteria The NCP establishes criteria that the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e), sites may be deleted from or recatagorized on the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making a determination to delete a site from the NPL. EPA will consider, in consultation with the Commonwealth. whether any of the following criteria have been met: 1. The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate; or 2. All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate: or Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules 3. Responsible or other parties have implemented all appropriate response actions required. III. Deletion Procedures In the NPL rulemaking published on October 15, 1984 (49 FR 40320), the Agency solicited and received comments on whether the notice of comment procedures followed for adding sites to the NPL should also be used before sites are deleted. Comments were also received in response to the amendments to the NCP proposed on February 12, 1985 (50 FR 5862). Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. The * NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management'in activities such as allocating Fund resources 'among releases. EPA Region I will accept and evaluate public comments before making a final decision to delete. The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments from the local community may be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of this site: 1. EPA region I has recommended deletion and has prepared the relevant documents. 2. EPA and the Commonwealth conducted a joint inspection of the site on September 18, 1992, five years after the commencement of the remedial action. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has concurred with the deletion decision. 3. Concurrent with this National Notice of Intent to Delete, a local notice has been published in local newspapers and has been distributed to appropriate Federal, state and local officials, and other interested parties. This local notice announces a thirty (30) day public comment period on the deletion package, which starts two weeks from the date of the notice, August 25, and will conclude on October 6, 1993. 4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repository. The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before the final decision to delete. The Region will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, which will address the comments received during the public comment period. The deletion will occur after the EPA Regional Administrator places a notice in the Federal Register. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next finalupdate following the notice. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary will be made available to the local community by Region I. IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion The Cannons Engineering Corporation-Plymouth Harbor Site (CEC-Plymouth Site or Site) is located in an industrial park known as Cordage Park in the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The CEC-Plymouth'Site is one of four separate but related sites which form the Cannons Engineering Corporation Superfund Sites. The others are the Cannons Engineering Corporation Bridgewater Site in Bridgewater, Massachusetts; the Tinkham's Garage Site in Londonderry, New Hampshire; and the Gilson Road Site in Nashua, New Hampshire. All four sites are being handled under one enforcement effort. The CEC-Plymouth Site consists of approximately 2.5 acres which is bordered on the northeast perimeter by Plymouth Harbor and on the southeast perimeter by a tidal stream. The site previously contained three above- ground storage tanks, each surrounded by an earthen berm measuring 6 to 8 feet in height.Tanks No. 1 and No. 2 each had a storage capacity of 250,000 gallons and tank No. 3 had a storage capacity of 500,000 gallons. The tanks were originally used for the storage of No. 6 fuel oil and bunker C oil until 1974 when this practice was discontinued. In 1975, the Cannons Engineering Corporation (CEC) leased the tanks for storage of waste oils and liquid hazardous substances, utilizing the gross storage capacity of tanks No. I and No. 2. Tank No. 3 was never utilized by CEC, though it was being prepared for similar use. In 1979, CEC was licensed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to store wastes at its Plymouth Facility. On June 12, 1980, the Commonwealth issued an Order of Revocation alleging that CEC had violated hazardous reporting regulations by falsifying documents. CEC was ordered to cease operations immediately. From 1980 to 1983, site inspections by the EPA and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE), currently the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP), indicated that the two smaller tanks, No. 1 and No. 2, were leaking a mixture of hazardous wastes from several seams, contaminating soils below. The tanks, which then were approximately 60 years old, were located about 20 yards from Plymouth Harbor.The site was ranked according to EPA's Hazard Ranking System (HRS) which prioritizes sites for inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund Sites. The CEC-Plymouth Site received a score of 54.82 and was proposed for listing on the NPL in December 1982. The NPL site listing was finalized in September 1983. When CEC was shutdown by the Commonwealth in 1980, approximately 500,000 gallons of liquid hazardous substances stored in tanks No. 1 and No. 2 were abandoned at the Plymouth facility. A consent agreement between EPA and Salt Water Trust, the site owner, was entered into in August 1983 which required the Trust to drain and clean one of the two tanks containing waste. In September 1983, Jetline Services, Inc., under contract to Salt Water Trust, drained and cleaned the contents of tank No. 1. In January 1984, an EPA contractor, Clean Harbors, drained and cleaned the second tank, tank No. 2, completing the stored liquids removal. Both tanks were steam cleaned after emptying. There were no abandoned liquid hazardous substances stored in tank No. 3 at the Plymouth facility, because CEC never made use of this tank. A Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) was completed in June 1985. In general, on-site soils were found to be relatively free of volatile organic compounds. Poly- nuclear aromatic'hydrocarbons (uPAHs), lead, and pesticides were detected in on-site soils, but were not distributed in high concentrations in a uniform manner laterally or vertically. Groundwater was evaluated and found to be free of organic contaminants. Low levels of inorganics were detected in some samples. A Record of Decision (ROD) was issued for the site in September 1985 which specified the following actions: 1. Dismantling and disposal of the three storage tanks and associated piping at an appropriate off-site facility. 2. Supplemental sampling in order to confirm the pattern of contamination identified in the RI, and to characterize the contaminant distribution located underneath the storage tanks. Supplemental samples were to be taken from soils under the dismantled tanks; surface and subsurface soil locations outside the tank berms; five on-site groundwater monitoring wells; and surface water and sediments located in the tidal seep. 3. Preparation of a site specific Floodplain Assessment.A plan for future action set forth in the 1985 ROD indicated that data generated from the supplemental sampling and floodplains44805 IIllllll 44806 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules assessment would be evaluated to assess the need for an amended ROD. Following implementation of the ROD and evaluation of the sampling data, however, EPA, in consultation with the Commonwealth, determined that the only necessary further response action at the site was a removal of stained soils. As required in the ROD, a Floodplains Assessment was completed in January 1986. The Floodplain Assessment concluded that the CEC-Plymouth site lies within the 100 year floodplain. Several recommendations were presented in the Floodplains Assessment based on the specific remedial alternative selected. These recommendations were complied with during the subsequent response actions. In April 1987, a detailed Work Plan and a Field Operations Plan (FOP) were completed for the site by an EPA contractor which called for the dismantling and disposal of the storage tanks and the performance of a Supplemental Sampling Program. Prior to tank dismantling and disposal. the site was fenced in June 1987 to restrict uncontrolled access. The three storage tanks were inspected, decontaminated, demolished and disposed of off-site by EPA contractors during the Fall of 1987. During the course of the tank dismantling and disposal, an area of stained soils was identified adjacent to the former location of tank No. 1. The tank dismantling subcontractor excavated and drummed approximately 3 cubic yards of stained soil. The drummed soil was transferred off-site with the rest of the manifested wastes. It was estimated that up to 180 cubic yards of soil contaminated with oily materials and hazardous substances remained within the bermed area of tank No. 1. As required by the ROD. a supplemental sampling program was conducted by an EPA contractor in the Fall of 1987. The supplemental sampling program confirmed almost all of the contaminant characterization ofthe RI. On-site soils were free of VOC contamination, but were found to contain PAHs, lead and low levels of pesticides. In the one finding that differed from the results in the RI, no pesticides were found in the tidal seep sediments. Pursuant to a consent decree, in September 1988, a removal of the stained soils identified adjacent to tank No. 1 was conducted by the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs). Approximately 200 tons of soil contaminated with oily materials and hazardous substances were excavated and disposed of at a Subtitle C hazardous waste facility. In addition. the top 6\"-12\" of soil from the interior of each of the three bermed areas where the tanks were previously located, approximately 50 tons, was excavated and disposed of along with the stained soils. The sources of concentrated hazardous substances have been removed from the site. Evaluations of groundwater and soil residuals indicate that the site does not have the potential to significantly degrade air media, groundwater, or adjacent surface water bodies. Therefore, the existing site conditions are currently protective and will not present an ongoing threat to human health and the environment for future commercial/industrial applications of the property. Based on the residual levels of PAHs and lead in on-site soils, the Endangerment Assessment (April 1989) concluded that the site can not be developed residentially unless further studies and/or subsequent remedial actions indicate that uses for the site other than commercial/industrial are appropriate. Since the protectiveness determination is based upon continued commercial/industrial uses of the site, institutional controls, in the form of deed restrictions, are necessary. The declaration of restrictions, recorded on April 21, 1992, provides in part that:1. The site property will not be used for residential, school, hotel, motel, community and/or recreational purposes unless a study conducted by a qualified engineering or environmental consulting firm with risk assessment capabilities indicates to EPA and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that there is no public health threat presented by conditions associated with residential, school, hotel, motel, community and/or recreational usage of the property; or 2. Response actions are undertaken and EPA and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certify that residential. school, hotel, motel, community and/or recreational usage of the site is appropriate under remediated conditions. The requirements of OSWER Directive 9355.7-02 dated May 23, 1991, provide that EPA will conduct five-year reviews as a matter of policy at sites for which the remedy was selected prior to the passage of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) where hazardous substances will remain on- site above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. Since residual contamination is being left on-site and future use of the site is limited, compliance with the five- year reviews will be maintained. The first five-year review for the site was completed on December 4, 1992. EPA, with concurrence from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, has determined that all appropriate responses under CERCLA at the Plymouth Harbor/Cannons Engineering Corporation Site have been completed, and that no further cleanup is appropriate.

ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: Proposed Action. The Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District, has been authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 1986), and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the U.S. House of Representatives, Docket No. 2252, August 8, 1984, to investigate the flood and related problems of those lands lying below the plain of mean higher high water along the San Francisco Bay shoreline in the Town of Corte Madera, Marin County, California. The Corps of Engineers has completed the Reconnaissance Study and Environmental Assessment and is proceeding to the Feasibility Study and Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) planning stage. The Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), will prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement as part of feasibility studies. The local sponsor, Town of Corte Madera, is the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, contact Ms. Linda Hyde, USAED, 211 Main Street, San Francisco, California 94105-1905; (415) 744-3039. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Reconnaissance Study and Environmental Assessment identified seven possible project Alternatives. The conclusion of these studies was a recommendation that three Alternatives and the No Action Alternative be furtherinvestigated during the Feasibility Study and Draft Environmental Impact Statement phase of the NEPA process. These Alternatives are discussed below. The purpose of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and Feasibility Study is to investigate tidal and related fluvial flooding problems within the San Clemente Creek drainage basin in the vicinity of Corte Madera, Manin County, California. The study area includes two residential subdivisions known as Mariner Cove and Marina Village. The subdivisions are located in the low lying areas of Corte Madera east of U.S. Highway 101 and north of Paradise Drive. These areas face a flood hazard that is caused by either an extreme rainstorm coinciding with high tides in San Francisco Bay, or by extreme storm surges and coincident bigh tides. Other physical processes exacerbate the flood damage potential in the subdivisions and adjacent areas. Subsidence of the land surface in the subdivisions is occurring due to ongoing consolidation of the underlying bay muds. Sea level rise is increasing the total height of high tides and storm surges in San Francisco Bay. Construction of the subdivisions disrupted the natural equilibrium of sediment flows between San Clemente Creek and the bay, increasing siltation of the creek channel. This siltation has restricted the creek's flood storage capacity and navigability. The combined effects of these processes expose the area to greater flood damage potential. The Reconnaissance Study identified potential solutions to the flooding problems and determined a Federal interest in proceeding to the Feasibility Phase. The Feasibility Study will examine the following possibilities as alternative solutions: Alternatives -Tidal barrier with tide gate. This alternative provides an offshore barrier and tide gate. Levee raising, pump stations and/or dredging for storage would also be included as part of the plan. This alternative would provide an optimum degree of flood protection primarily by controlling tidal and fluvial flows. -Tidal barrier with lock structure. This alternative provides an offshore barrier, navigation lock and raising levees. A navigation lock is used Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices instead of a tide barrier. The storage capacity and navigability of San Clemente Creek would be increased. This is the locally preferred alternative. There are two interior storage choices within this alternative, one which would not pond Marta's Marsh, a tidal marsh adjacent to San Clemente Creek and northward, and another which would result in periodic ponding of Marta's Marsh. This alternative would provide an optimum degree of flood protection and improve navigation in San Clemente Creek. -Modified tide gate. This utilizes a system of floodwalls and improved levees in conjunction with a tide gate on San Clemente Creek. This alternative would provide an optimum degree of flood protection. -The No Action alternative is the study area without a Federal project. Environmental Issues The Environmental Assessment prepared during the Reconnaissance identified the following environmental significant issues associated with the DEIS: Endangered species impacts Wetland impacts and mitigation Water quality impacts Aquatic resources (including dredging and disposal) impacts Socioeconomic impacts Navigation impacts Transportation impacts Air quality impacts Recreational impacts Esthetic impacts Visual impacts Scoping: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District, and the Town of Corte Madera, with the support of the Matin County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, invite federal, state, and local agencies and members of the public to provide comments on the proposed project. A public scoping meeting has been scheduled for Thursday, September 29, 1993; in San Clemente School Multipurpose Room, 330 Golden Hinde Passage, Town of Corte Madera, California at 7 p.m. Scoping comments should clearly describe specific environmental issues or subjects which the commentor wishes to be addressed.

[FR Doc. 93-20616 Filbd 8-24-93; 8:45 aml 13LUNo CODE 3810-o1-W Air Force Policy on Factory Simulation The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition proposes to publish the following policy on factory simulation. If approved, the policy would apply to all new contracts for Air Force Acquisition Category I and II Programs, and on other programs for which Air Force System Program Directors determine it is necessary. Our present methods of estimating risks are not adequate in the evolving world of system acquisition. We have entered a period where our senior managers have become more risk averse while at the same time searching for new technologies that offer greater military leverage at reduced unit costs.We will be pushed to make large jumps in technology with only limited experience in actually producing that technology. Requiring our contractors to simulate and analyze their current and proposed factory processes will help us meet these challenges. The potential for simulation of factory operations covers a broad range of applications from detailed models for the design and optimization of a single production process to an overall simulation of the complete factory process required for the final product. DODI 5000.2 places a major emphasis on ensuring the feasibility of production operations as an integral part of the systems engineering process. Recent experience by a prime contractor in simulating the factory process flow demonstrated the feasibility and utility of such a model. By accounting for the statistical variation of major operations in final assembly and test, including supplier reliability (delivery) and quality, the model was able to demonstrate that the existing factory process was incapable of supporting contract delivery rates. It also provided the ability to evaluate the improvements required to achieve rate production. - Because of this and other successful experiences we are convinced of the need to emphasize the use of factory simulation as a risk reduction tool. Effective immediately, System Program Directors (SPDs) shall require their contractors to simulate their factory process flow throughout the system development and production process for all ACAT I and II programs and other programs as they believe necessary. This requirement only applies to new contracts. SPDs are encouraged but not required to implement this on existing contracts. During source selection, SPDs shall evaluate the contractor's proposed approaches to using factory simulation to manage and reduce risk. They will structure their source selection criteria to encourage.the contractors to take a proactive approach to identifying and reducing manufacturing risk. The level of detail in the simulation should reflect the program phase, initial risk assessments, and the need to break constraints identified in earlier simulations. Additionally, thoroughly understanding the critical constraints in conjunction with factory simulation offers a structured decision making approach to system evaluation. Logically, we should focus our * improvement efforts on those few constraints that most limit system performance, as improvements in nonconstraint areas do not yield commensurate improvements in overall44808 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August-25. 1993 1 Notices system performance. This will allow us to rank order our improvement opportunities based on a consistent set of evaluation criteria. SPDs should consider offering contractual incentives to encourage the early use of factory simulation during system development. For programs that are already in or are about to enter production, cost saving ideas identified through factory simulation may qualify for value engineering (VE) incentives. To be accepted as a Value Engineering Change Proposal, the ideas must result in a reduction in the overall project cost to the government and meet the requirements of FAR part 52.248-1. SPDs should consider setting aside funds to pay for VE proposals generated from factory simulation. SPDs may use VE savings to pay for other unfunded requirements. By increasing this emphasis, the contractor industrial base will be encouraged to optimize planned production operations and reduce risk. The simulation should be run at not only the planned production rate but also at reduced and accelerated rates. However, in applying these analytical tools, we must not lose sight of the true purpose of the factory, which is to produce high quality products for our users, on time and at minimum cost. Factory efficiency should not be blindly pursued to the detriment of our goal of improving product quality by reducing variability. SPDs should encourage contractors to continually balance product quality and efficient factory operations through a structured decision making process. The factory process - flow simulation forms the basis for identification of constraints on production operations, which may include technology shortfalls, technology insertion opportunities, and management policies and practices, including those imposed by the government. This will act as a catalyst for identifying targets of opportunity for shared responsibility in improving the industrial base.

[FR Doc. 93-20525 Filed 8-24-93; 8:45 aml BILLING CODE 4000-014M DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Floodplain Statement of Findings for Proposed Interim Remedial Actions at Waste Area Grouping 13 AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Floodplain statement of findings. SUMMARY: This is a floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed interim remedial actions at Waste Area Grouping (WAG) 13 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), prepared in accordance with 10 CFR part 1022. DOE proposes to perform interim remedial actions in a floodplain located in Anderson County, Tennessee. DOE prepared a Floodplain Assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. DATE: Comments are due to the address below by September 9, 1993. ADDRESS: Mail comments to: Mr. Robert Sleeman, Director, Environmental Restoration Division, Oak Ridge Operations Office, U.S. Department of Energy, Post Office Box 2001, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831-8541. (615) 576-0715; Fax comments to: (615) 576- 6074. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information on general DOE floodplain environmental review requirements, contact: Ms. Carol Borgstrom, Office of NEPA Oversight, (EH-25), U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. (202) 586-4600 or (800) 472-2756. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for interim remedial action at WAG 13, prepared in accordance with 10 CFR part 1022. A Notice of Floodplain Involvement was published in the Federal Register on December 7, 1992,57 FR 57828. WAG 13 contains eight treatment plots that were used as part of nuclear weapons fallout simulation experiments. A portion of WAG 13 lies in the 100-year floodplain of the Clinch River. The north-northeast corner of plot 7 lies within the 100-year floodplain, and the north-northeast corner of plot 6 intersects the edge of this same floodplain. The proposed action consists of excavation and disposal of the material at WAG 6. On the basis of the Floodplain Assessment, DOE has determined that no practical alternative to the proposed action exists and that the action would be designed to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the floodplain of the Clinch River. Other alternatives, such as the no-action, installation of shielding over the plots, and excavation and storage of the material at the Interim Waste Management Facility in WAG 6, were considered and evaluated in making this determination. The eight treatment plots are encircled by metal sheeting that extends 18 inches below the surface and 24 inches above the surface. Four of the eight plots (plots 2, 4, 6, and 7) are contaminated with cesium-137. DOE is proposing to excavate the top layer of soil in each of the four contaminated plots to a depth of approximately 1 foot and remove the metal perimeter sheeting. A total of approximately 5200 ft 3 of soil would be excavated; 2600 ft 3 of soil would be removed from plots that partially lie within the floodplain. All contaminated soil and metal sheeting would be placed in B-25-rated steel boxes that meet all DOE requirements for storage of low-level radioactive waste. The boxed soil and sheeting would then be disposed of within the boundaries of WAG 6. Following excavation and removal of the contaminated soil from WAG 13, a geotextile liner would be placed in the bottom and on the sides of the hole to prevent cross contamination of the new fill. Following installation of the liner, the excavation would be backfilled with clean fill and topsoil. Vegetation would then be established to prevent erosion at the site. The floodplain assessment shows that removing the contaminated soil and metal sheeting from WAG 13 would have no significant environmental impact; would have no adverse impact on the floodplain; would not cause impacts such as backwater effects or inundation of land, property, or individuals, and would not promote development in the floodplain. The proposed action has been designed to conform to applicable State or local floodplain protection standards.44810 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 /Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the Statement of Findings prior to implementing the proposed action.

ACTION: Notice of financial assistance award in response to an unsolicited financial assistance application. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.14 is announcing its intention to award a cost sharing grant to Pacific International Center for High Technology Research (PICHTR) to identify, evaluate, and develop a plan for alternative energy uses and high value co-products from sugarcane land and facilities in Hawaii. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden CO 80401, Attention: John W. Meeker, Contract Specialist. The Contracting Officer for this action is Dr. Paul K. Kearns. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The PICHTR application was determined to be meritorious based on the innovative' approach employed by the applicant, and the immediate need to develop a viable plan to utilize existing, but presently unused, facilities and land for the social and economic benefit to the State of Hawaii, particularly in the area surrounding the Hamakua refinery on the island of Hawaii. The overall objectives of the grant will be to identify and evaluate options and alternative energy uses for sugarcane land and facilities in Hawaii. Once the evaluation process has been completed, the final product is expected to be a sustainable development pathway for crops and land uses for the production of energy and complementary higher value co-products. Specific objectives are addressed in the Statement of Work for the grant and include the following: Task 1. Communication and Integration: Establish communication with all interested parties providing inputs to the sustainable biomass products development and evaluation project for the Hamakua Region of the Island ofHawaii; Task 2. Potential Crop Assessment: Work with the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) State Department of Agriculture (DOA), and Hawaii's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) to identify a list of crops and agricultural and processing practices that may be appropriate under the physical and economic conditions that exist in the region; Task 3. Land Capability Assessment: The project team will work with the State DOA and Department of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii and Hawaii County to identify land areas that are most suitable for production of alternative crops and products; Task 4. Inventory of Available Facilities for Technology Demonstration and Evaluation: Review technological process and evaluate the suitability of the facilities for the purposes of demonstrating and ultimately developing the appropriate technologies; Task 5. Process Options: Evaluate process options that begin with crops or other raw materials and result with energy as a primary product and other by-products; Task 6. Options to Produce Electricity: Evaluate the various options which would provide a major contribution to the power generation requirements of Hawaii Electric Light Co. (HELCO) over the next 5 to 10 years; Task 7. Options to Produce Ethanol: Conduct an evaluation of the potential for part of the released land area to be allocated to an ethanol production option that would utilize existing infrastructure and assets of Hamakua Mill to help meet the fleet fuel requirements on the island of Oahu; Task 8. Complementary Activities: Evaluate the most appropriate process technologies to determine what by- products are available and the market value; Task 9. Economical and Technical Evaluations: Determine the costs of production of energy (electricity and ethanol) of the most promising technologies; Task 10. Market Survey: Evaluate the potential market for primary products and co-products along with the price sensitivities; Task 11. Sustainability Assessment: Examination of environmental, social and economic impacts of proposed options; Task 12. Identification of Barriers: Regulatory, -environmental, financial, technical, and social barriers will be identified and addressed; and Task 13. Proposal for Further Actions: A proposal, based on the findings of this study, will be prepared for private sector review for the development of both near and medium term options.The Department of Energy considered the likelihood of achieving the above listed objectives to be high due to the level of experience and expertise held by PICHTR and the other members of the project team. The technique of utilizing appropriate governmental agencies and private entities with specialized expertise will provide the broad coverage necessary to ensure all variables are addressed and to identify the most appropriate development plan. The program will be managed under the leadership of Andrew Trenka, Vice President for Operations, PICHTR. The day to day program activities will be managed by Dr. Robert Shleser. Dr. Shleser holds a B.S. in Agriculture, an M.S. in Genetics, and a Ph.D. in Biophysics from Purdue University.

ACTION: Notice of tentative determination on application of state of Arkansas for full program adequacy determination, public hearing and public comment period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate \"permit\" programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/ Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirerents. In addition, States/Tribes, may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved44819 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site- specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. Arkansas applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA has reviewed Arkansas' MSWLF application and made a tentative determination that all portions of Arkansas' MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Arkansas' application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/ Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled a public hearing on this determination and will hold the hearing if a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in the hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. If a public hearing is held, it will take place on the date given below in the \"DATES\" section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition, anyone who .wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the'person listed in the \"CONTACTS\" section below. DATES: All comments on Arkansas' application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on September 24, 1993. If a public hearing is held, it will be scheduled for October 12, 1994 in Little Rock, Arkansas. State of Arkansas officials will participate in the hearing, if held by EPA.

Background On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop \"adequate\" programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdicti6n. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/ Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.B. State of Arkansas On June 30, 1993, Arkansas submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA has reviewed Arkansas' application and has tentatively determined that all portions of Arkansas' subtitle D program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. On June 4, 1993, the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission passed a rule adopting 40 CFR part 258 by reference (as it was published on October 9, 1991, at 56 FR 50978) and incorporated it as an amendment to Chapter 4, Regulation 22 of the Arkansas Solid Waste Management Code. By adopting by reference 40 CFR part 258, as promulgated on October 9, 1991, Arkansas' regulations provide for certain exemptions for owners and operators of small community landfills in arid and remote areas [40 CFR part 258.1(f)(1)]. On May 7, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court (Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA) directed EPA to eliminate an exemption from ground water monitoring for small landfills in arid and remote locations. Under 40 CFR part 258, this exemption is available to a landfill that is located in an area that annually receives twenty- five inches or less of precipitation. There are no portions of Arkansas which receive twenty-five inches or less of precipitation annually. Thus, there are no landfills in Arkansas which qualify for the small arid landfill exemption under 40 CFR part 258(f)(1). The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until September 24, 1993. Copies of Arkansas' application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the \"ADDRESSES\" section of this notice. If there is sufficient public interest, the Agency will hold a public hearing on its tentative determination on October 12, 1993 at 10 a.m. at the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology in Little Rock, Arkansas. Comments can be submitted as transcribed from the discussion of the hearing or in writing at the time of the hearing. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Arkansas' program. EPA's final determination notice will include a summary of the reasons for44820 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices the final determination and a response to all major comments. Arkansas' solid waste program is not enforceable on Indian lands. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). COMPLIANCE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER 12291: The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. CERTIFICATION UNDER THE REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT: Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and 'requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide for interaction betweenthe State/Tribe and the MSWLF owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/ operators located in State/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. Texas applied for a partial determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA has reviewed Texas' MSWLF application and made a tentative determination of adequacy for those portions of the Texas MSWLF permit program that are adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Texas plans to revise the remainder of its permit program to ensure complete compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria and gain full program approval. Texas' application for partial program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/ Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled a public hearing on this determination and will hold the hearing if a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in the hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice.

Background On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. EPA intends to propose in STIR that it will allow partial approvals if: (1) The Regional Administrator determines that the State/Tribal permit program largely meets the requirements for ensuring44821 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, -August 25, 1993 / Notices compliance with 40 CFR part 258; (2) changes to a limited narrow part(s) of the State/Tribal permit program are needed to meet these requirements; and, (3) provisions not included in the partially approved portions of the State/ Tribal permit program are a clearly identifiable and separable subset of 40 CFR part 258. These requirements, if promulgated, will address the potential problems posed by the dual State/Tribal and Federal Programs that will come into effect on October 9, 1993, in those States/Tribes that only have parietal approvals of their MSWLF programs. On that date, federal rules covering any portion of a State/Tribe's program that has not received EPA approval will become enforceable. Owners and operators of MSWLFs subject to such dual programs must be able to understand which requirements apply and comply with them. In addition, the pieces of the Federal program that are in effect must mesh well enough with the approved portions of the State/Tribal program to leave no significant gaps in regulatory control of MSWLF's. Partial approval would allow the Agency to approve those provisions of the State/ Tribal permit program that meet the requirements and provide the State/ Tribe time to make necessary changes to the remaining portions of its program. As a result, owners/operators will be able to work with the State/Tribal permitting agency to take advantage of the Criteria's flexibility for those portions of the program which have been approved. As provided in the October 9, 1991, municipal landfill rule, EPA's national subtitle D standards will take effect on October 9, 1993, in any State/Tribe that lacks an approved program. Consequently, any remaining portions of the Federal Criteria which are not included in an apprbved State/Tribal program by October 9, 1993, would apply directly to the owner/operator. EPA intends to approve portions of State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop \"adequate\" programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.Finally, EPA believes that the State/ Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement aut~orities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an \"Adequate\" program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. EPA also is requesting States/Tribes seeking partial program approval to provide a schedule for the submittal of all remaining portions of their MSWLF permit programs. EPA notes that it intends to propose to make submission of a schedule mandatory in STIR. B. State of Texas On August 4, 1993, Texas submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA has reviewed Texas' application and has tentatively determined that all portions of Texas' subtitle D program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria, except for those listed in the following paragraphs Not ai States/Tribes will have existing permit programs through which they can ensure compliance with all provisions of the revised Federal Criteria. Were EPA to restrict a State/ Tribe from submitting its application until it could ensure compliance with the entirety of 40 CFR part 258, many States/Tribes would need to postpone obtaining approval of their permit programs for a significant amount of time. This delay in determining the adequacy of the State/Tribal permit program while the State/Tribe revises its statutes or regulations could impose a substantial burden on owners and operators of landfills because the State/ Tribe would be unable to exercise the flexibility available to States/Tribes with permit programs which have been approved as adequate. On May 7, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court (Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA) directed EPA to eliminate an exemption from ground water monitoring for small landfills in arid and remote locations [40 CFR 258(0(1)). Texas adopted changes to its Municipal Solid Waste Regulations to incorporate the 40 CFR part 258 standards in a final rule published on June 18, 1993, (effective October 9,1993). As adopted, Texas rules currently provide for exempting certain small landfills in arid and remote regions from ground water monitoring requirements. To ensure compliance with all of the revised Federal Criteria, Texas must revise one aspect of its permit program to remove the aforementioned ground water monitoring exemption. To allow Texas to begin exercising some of the flexibility allowed in States/Tribes with adequate permit programs, EPA is proposing to approve all other aspects of the Texas program. EPA has reviewed Texas' proposal and believes it is reasonable because Texas has stated that they \"intend to modify our rules to reflect the court's decision, as adopted by EPA in a final rule,\" in a letter to EPA, dated August 4, 1993. Therefore, EPA has tentatively determined that Texas' application is consistent with the Federal Criteria, (with the exception of the exemption provided under 40 CFR'258(f)(1), which has been vacated by the U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court, and will make a final determination of partial adequacy following the public comment period and public hearing, if held. The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until September 24, 1993. Copies of Texas' application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the \"ADDRESSES\" section of this notice. If there is sufficient public interest, the Agency will hold a public hearing on its tentative determination on October 12, 1993 at 10 a.m. at the Texas Water Commission in Austin, Texas. Comments can be submitted as transcribed from the discussion of the hearing or in writing at the time of the hearing. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during the public hearing, if held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Texas' program. EPA's final determination notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments. Texas' MSWLF permitting program can not be enforced on Indian Lands. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with44822 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / N6tices provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria.

Introduction Section 6(0(1) of FIFRA provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide registrations be amended to delete one or more uses. The Act further provides that, before acting on the request, EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the Federal Register. Thereafter, the Administrator may approve such a request. I. Intent to Delete Uses This notice announces receipt by the Agency of applications from registrants to delete uses in the two pesticide registrations listed in the following Table 1. These registrations are listed by registration number, product names andthe specific uses deleted. Users of these products who desire continued use on crops or sites being deleted should contact the applicable registrant before November 23, 1993 to discuss withdrawal of the applications for amendment. This 90-day period will also permit interested members of the public to intercede with registrants prior to the Agency approval of the deletion.

Hollins, at the address given above, postmarked before November 23, 1993. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation will apply only to the applicable 6(f(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements. V. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1-year after the date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as prescribed in Federal Register No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made ila product poses a risk concern, or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call- in. In all cases, product-specificdisposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed, sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions to these general rules will be made in specific cases when more stringent restrictiofts on sale, distribution, or use of the products or their ingredients have already been imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has identified significant potential risk concerns associated with a particular chemical.

[FR Dec. 8:45 am] 4634-11 Cancellation of Pesticides for Non- Payment of 1993 Registration Maintenance Fees AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Section 4(i)(5)(A) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) has requires each registrant of a pesticide to pay an annual maintenance fee to keep their pesticide registrations in effect. The fee due on January 15, 1993, has gone unpaid for about 1,050 registrations, Section 4(i)(5)(D) of FIFRA provides that the Administrator may cancel these registrations by order and without a hearing; orders to cancel all but a few of them have been issued within the past few days. The Agency is deferring cancellation for certain of these registrations, however, to permit time for affected users to explore alternatives to cancellation directly with the registrants. DATES: Reports of agreements to support continued registration or transfer of the registrations for which cancellation is being deferred must be received by November 23, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: To report agreements to support continued registration of any of the products for which cancellation has been deferred, for instructions on payment of44828 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices delinquent maintenance fees for these products, or for further information on the maintenance fee program in general, contact by mail: John Jamula, Office of Pesticide Programs (H7504C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Room 226, Crystal Mall No. 2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway South, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305-6426. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction Section 4(i)(5) of FIFRA as amended, requires that all pesticide registrants pay an annual registration maintenance -fee, due by January 15 of each year, to keep their registrations in effect. This requirement applies to all registrations granted under section 3 as well as those granted under section 24(c) to meet special local needs. (Uses registered under section 24(c) are deemed to be registered under section 3 for all purposes of FIFRA, except as otherwiseF rovided in section 24(c)). Registrations or which the fee is not paid are subject to cancellation by order and without a hearing. The 1990 Farm Bill amended FIFRA to allow the Administrator to reduce or waive maintenance fees for minor agricultural use pesticides when she determines that the fee would be likely to cause significant impact on the availability of the pesticide for the use. The Agency has waived the fee for 18 minor agricultural use registrations at the request of the registrants. The Agency has identified 26 other registrations for which the maintenance fee was not paid and for which no waiver was requested that fall into this category, and is deferring cancellation of these registrations for a period of 90 days. Section III contains a list of these registrations and their vulnerable minor uses, along with instructions for preventing their cancellation. In late December, 1992, all registrants were sent lists of their active registrations, along with forms and instructions for responding. They were asked to identify which of their registrations they wished to maintain in effect, and to calculate and remit the appropriate maintenance fees. Most responses were received by the statutory deadline of January 15; a supplemental notice was sent in February, however, to registrants who had not responded after acknowledging receipt of the original notice. A notice of intent to cancel was also sent in mid-March to registrants who still did not respond and to registrants who responded, but did not pay the fee for all of their registrations. Late payments of the fees were accepteduntil April 15, when the actual process of cancellation was begun. Since mailing the notices, EPA has maintained a toll-free inquiry number through which the questions of affected registrants have been answered. Maintenance fees have been paid for about 17,400 section 3 registrations, or about 95 percent of the registrations on file in December. Fees have been paid for about 2,500 section 24(c) registrations, or about 93 percent of the total on file in December. Cancellations for non-payment of the maintenance fee affect about 850 section 3 registrations and about 200 section 24(c) registrations. H. Product Cancellations not Affecting Status of Active Ingredient Our analyses indicate that many of these cancellations are unlikely to affect pesticide markets or users. For example, more than 60 percent of the section 3 registrations for which no fee was paid are no longer in production, and their disappearance from the market will cause no adverse impact. Although we do not have comparable production data for them, we believe most of the canceled 24(c) registrations for special local needs to be similarly obsolete. Over 60 percent of them were originally issued before 1987-most for a finite period which has long since expired. We also know that a large proportion have been made obsolete by subsequent section 3 registrations for the same uses. The remaining cancellations, 490 section 3 registrations and 117 section 24(c) registrations issued in the past 5 years, have been the principal focus of our further impact analyses. We anticipate two types of impact for the bulk of these cancellations. First, some of these disappearing registrations will be survived in the market by substantially identical registrations. These substantially identical products may not, however, be readily available wherever a disappearing product was sold, so there may be local or regional disruptions while distribution patterns are adjusted. We expect these disruptions to be minor and temporary. The cancellation orders generally permit registrants to continue to sell and distribute existing stocks of the canceled products until the due date for the next annual registration maintenance fee, January 15, 1994. Existing stocks already in the hands of dealers or users, however, can generally be distributed, sold or used legally until they are exhausted. Existing stocks are defined as those stocks ofa registered pesticide product which are currently in the U.S. and which have been packaged, labeledand released for shipment prior to the effective date of the action. The exceptions to these general rules are cases where more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of the products have already been imposed, through Special Reviews or other Agency actions. These general provisions for disposition of stocks should serve in most cases to cushion the impact of these cancellations while the market adjusts. Second, in some cases unique non- agricultural uses will disappear, although the active ingredients will remain available for different uses in other products. When this situation occurs, there may be more serious impacts on users of the canceled products. Once again, existing stocks of the canceled products already in channels of trade will be usable to mitigate these impacts in the short term. For the longer term the mechanisms of section 3 amendments and 24(c) registrations will remain available to obtain replacement registrations. Neither of these types of impact leaves users without the means to replace lost registrations; neither is considered to justify further deferral of cancellations for non-payment of the maintenance fee. Thus all these registrations for which the active ingredient will remain in other products have been canceled. III. Cancellations Leading to Disappearance of Minor Agricultural Uses A third type of impact arises in cases where unique agricultural uses would disappear. The 1990 Farm Bill amended FIFRA to allow the Administrator to reduce or waive maintenance fees for minor agricultural uses when she determines that the fee would be likely to cause significant impact on the availability of the pesticide for the use. The Agency waived the fee for 18 registrations at the request of the registrants. The Agency has also identified 26 more registrations for minor agricultural uses for which the maintenance fee was not paid and for which no waiver was requested, and will defer cancellation of these registrations for 90 days to permit affected users to explore alternatives to cancellation. If the Agency is notified within 90 days of this notice at the address given above either (1) that the registrant will continue to support the registration, or (2) that an agreement has been reached to transfer the registration to another party, we will waive the 1993 maintenance fee and retain the registration in full active status. It should be emphasized, however, that44829 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday.

The full names and addresses of the current registrants appear in Table 3 below.IV. Cancellations Leading to Disappearance of Active Ingredients A final type of impact arises if an active ingredient that is now or has recently been available in the marketplace disappears. The Agency has identified 14 registered active ingredients in this category. No production has been reported for seven of these active ingredients during the past three years; after deleting these 7 from the list of 14, 7 active ingredientsremain. Three of the 7 active ingredients none subject to prior regulatory action, and all likely to disappear as a consequence of these cancellations are used in agriculture; two are disinfectants; one is used for aquatic treatment, and one is a flea and tick insecticide for use on dogs. These 7 ingredients, grouped by these same general categories of use patterns, are listed along with the EPA Company Number of their registrants in the following Table 2.44831 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices TABLE 2. -ACTIVE INGREDIENTS WITH RECENT PRODUCTION PENDING CANCELLATION OF ALL PRODUCTS FOR NON-PAYMENT OF 1993 REGISTRATION MAINTENANCE FEES, IN SEQUENCE BY BROAD USE PATTERN Chemical Name Registration Product Name No. A. Shampoo with Lindane 00192 Because these active ingredients are likely to disappear with their product registration, and because FIFRA does not provide for fee waivers for these non-minor and non-agricultural uses, the Agency has deferred for 90 days the cancellation of these 12 registrations. During that time those registrants or other affected persons may make arrangements to continue the registration. We encourage individual users or user groups who are concerned about the potential loss of these active ingredients to work directly with the registrant identified by the first 6 digits of the Reg. No. in Table 2 to persuade them to continue to support the ingredient, or to identify third parties who would be willing to support the ingredient if the registration were transferred to them. The full names and addresses of current registrants appear in Table 3 below. We also encourage users to consult with the Cooperative Extension Service or other local sources to identify alternatives to these active ingredients. If the Agency is notified within 90 days of this notice at the address given above either (1) that the registrant will continue to support the registration, or (2) that an agreement has been reached to transfer the registration to another party, we will retain the registration in full active status as soon as the delinquent maintenance fee payment is received. It should be emphasized, however, that any such registrations would still be subject to all requirements for reregistration, including reregistration fees (except as they may be reduced through the statutory provisions for small businesses or low volume uses).

[FR Doc. 93-20304 Filed StatefTrbe Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of tentative determination on application of Kansas for full program adequacy determination; public hearing and comment Period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRAj as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HWSA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which mayreceive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria, 56 FR 50978-51119 also referred to as 40 CFR part 258. RCRA section 4004(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate \"permit\" programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/ Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, State/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an importantEPA Com- / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/ operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/ operators located in State/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site specific flexibility provided by Part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. Kansas applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA has reviewed Kansas' MSWLF application and made a tentative determination that all portions of Kansas' MSWLF permit program are adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Kansas' application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/ Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on-this determination. If a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on the date given below in the \"DATES\" section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the \"CONTACTS\" section below. DATES: All comments on Kansas' application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on September 24, 1993, or, if a public hearing is scheduled, at the close of the public hearing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under Part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. EPA intends to approve State/Tribe MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for the States or Tribes to develop \"adequate\" programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/ Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an \"Adequate\" program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteriafor evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. B. The State of Kansas On July 26, 1993, Kansas submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA reviewed Kansas' application and tentatively determined that all portions of the Kansas Subtitle D program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until September 24, 1993, or, if a public hearing occurs, until the conclusion of the public hearing. Copies of Kansas' application are available for inspection and copying at the locations -indicated in the \"ADDRESSES\" section of this notice. The State of Kansas' landfill permit program is not enforceable on Indian lands. Not all States/Tribes will have existing permit programs through which they can ensure compliance with all provisions of the revised Federal Criteria. Were EPA to restrict a State/ Tribe from submitting its application until it could ensure compliance with the entirety of 40 CFR part 258, many States/Tribes would need to postpone obtaining approval of their permit programs for a significant amount of time. This delay in determining the adequacy of the State/Tribe permit program while the State/Tribe revises its statutes or regulations could impose a substantial burden on owners and operators of landfills because the State/ Tribe would be unable to exercise the flexibility available to States/Tribes with permit programs which have been approved as adequate. Kansas is adopting the Federal Criteria by reference, with some minor, practical changes (e.g. all references to\"an approved State\" were replaced with \"the Director\"). The Kansas regulations do not include the exemption from ground-water monitoring for small landfills, consistent with the current Federal regulations as a result of Sierra Club v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 992 F.2d 337 (D.C. Cir. 1993), which vacated the exemption. In addition, Kansas will be using the flexibility afforded in 40 CFR 258.54(a)(1) and (2), to specify a - different list of Appendix I monitoring parameters that are more appropriate for the landfills in Kansas; Appendix H will be the same as the Federal Appendix II. If Kansas adopts 40 CFR part 258, as stated above, before EPA makes a final44834 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 /'Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices determination, and their adopted regulations are effective on or before the relevant effective dates of the Federal Criteria, then EPA proposes to fully approve Kansas' MSWLF program. If Kansas does not adopt 40 CFR part 258, then EPA proposes to deny approval of Kansas' program. Region VII will hold a public hearing, if significant requests are received within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, on its tentative decision on October 12, 1993, at 1:30 p.m. at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment's office at Forbes Field, Building 740, Conference Room A, in Topeka, Kansas. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for determination of inadequacy for Kansas' program. EPA will make a final decision on whether or not to approve Kansas' program by October 9, 1993 and will give notice of it in the Federal Register. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all significant comments. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF Criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF Criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substintial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

ACTION: Notice of withdrawal of effectiveness. SUMMARY: The Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (\"ASC\") announces the withdrawal of its Revised Guidelines Regarding State Certification and Licensing of Appraisers (\"Revised Guidelines\"). The Revised Guidelines were adopted by the ASC on May 29, 1991, and were published in the Federal Register at 56 FR 26088 Oune 6, 1991) and made effective on that date. The ASC recently adopted and issued Policy Statements Regarding State Certification and Licensing of Real Estate Appraisers (\"Policy Statements\") to replace theRevised Guidelines. The ASC intends that the Policy Statements serve the same purpose as the now superseded Revised Guidleines. DATES: Withdrawal of the Revised Guidelines is effective August 25. 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edwin W. Baker, Executive Director, or Marc L. Weinberg, General Counsel. Appraisal Subcommittee, 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., suite 200; Washington, DC 20037, or at (202) 634- 6520, from whom copies of the newly issued Policy Statements are available, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform. Recovery. and Enforcement Act of 1989. as amended.1 the ASC, among other things, is charged with monitoring the certification and licensing programs for real estate appraisers in each State to determine whether the State's policies. practices and procedures are consistent with title XI and enforcing the State's compliance with the requirements of title XL Title XI, as well as other Federal statutes and regulations 2 requiring the use of State certified or licensed appraisers, necessarily relies on the States to perform their real estate appraiser related duties in a responsible manner. In exercising its ovemight responsibilities, the ASC reviews each State's overall appraiser regulatory program to determine compliance with title XI. State appraiser regulatory agencies (\"State agencies\") generally need to take appropriate steps to ensure that each person seeking to become a State certified or licensed appraiser has demonstrated his or her competency and that certified or licensed appraisers continue to perform in a competent and ethical manner. On August 4, 1993, the ASC approved the Policy Statements to assist the State agencies in the continuing development and maintenance of appropriate organizational and regulatory structures for certifying, licensing and supervising real estate appraisers. The ASC also determined that it is necessary to publish this Notice in the Federal 'Pub. L. 101-73.103 Stat. 511 1989, as amended by Pub. L. 102-233.105 Stat. 1761, 1792 (1991), Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2330, 2386 (1991), Pub. L 102-550. 106 Stat. 3672 1992). and Pub. L. 2771 U.S.C. and 12 U.S.C. 1708(e)(B), currently require the use of State certified or licensed real estate appraisers, as do certain Federal regulations and policies such as the Department of Transportation's regulations implementing the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A- 129 and Bulletin No. 92-06,and the Uniform Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions.Register announcing the withdrawal of the Revised Guidelines and the adoption of the Policy Statements. The ASC determined that the format change from Revised Guidelines to Policy Statements was appropriate because of the small number of regulatees--only 57 jurisdictions are directly subject to ASC oversight under title Xl--and the need for regulatory flexibility and comity in dealing with these sovereign entities. The Policy Statements, however, are intended to serve the same purpose as the now superseded Revised Guidelines by providing the States and their appraiser regulatory agencies with the ASC's expectations regarding compliance with title XI.

[FR Doc. 93-20532 Filed 8-24-93; 8:45 aml BIM CODE 62101-F BankAmerica Corporation, San Francisco, California; Application to Engage in Nonbanking Activities BankAmerica Corporation. San Francisco, California (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and \u00a7 225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage de novo through its wholly owned subsidiary. BA Securities, Inc., Seattle. Washington (formerly Security Pacific Securities. Inc.) (Company), a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.), and engage to a limited extent in underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments (bank- eligible securities), and in certain other types of debt securities (bank-ineligible securities), in the following securities- related activities: (1) Acting as agent in the private placement of all types of securities. including providing related advisory services; (2) Buying and selling all types of securities on the order of investors as a\"riskless principal\"; and (3) Providing securities brokerage and investment advisory services, both separately and in combination. I connection with this proposal, Applicant proposes to transfer certain securities-related businesses and activities from its lead bank. Bank of America NT&SA, San Francisco. California (Bank), to Company. Applicant would also transferownership and control of its direct wholly owned futures commission merchant subsidiary. BA Futures. Inc.. Chicago, Illinois (BA Futures). to Company. Upon such transfer, BA Futures would become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Company. Apptiant also proposes to transfer Company's principal place of business fom Seattle, Washington. to San Francisco, California, and to establish branch offices in Los Angeles. California. New York, New York. Atlanta, Georgia. and Dallas. Texas. Applicant would conduct the proposed activities throughout the United States and the world. Applicant also seeks a waiver from, or an interpretation regarding. one (Fireuall 13) of the conditions and limitations (Section 20 Firewalls) that the Board has imposed on bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries engaged in underwriting and deiling in bank-ineligible securities. See Citicorp, et al., 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473, 504 (1987) (Citicorp). Firewall 13 provides, among other things, that no bank or thrift affiliate of any underwriting subsidiary will act as agent for, or engage in marketing activities on behalf of, the underwriting subsidiary. Applicant proposes for a wholly owned broker- dealer subsidiary of Bank, BA Investment Services, Inc., to act as a riskless principal or broker for customers in buying and selling bank- eligible securities that Company underwrites or deals in. Applicant believes that Firewall 13 does not apply to securities that national banks, such as Bank, are authorized to underwrite or deal in (i.e., bank-eligible securities) but which are underwritten or dealt in by an underwriting affiliate, such as Company. for various business purposes. Alternatively, Applicant contends that Firewall 13 does not apply to the activity of a subsidiary of a national bank selling securities that are underwritten or dealt in by an underwriting affiliate, because that activity does not constitute a marketing activity. Applicant also argues. in the alternative, that the Section 20 Firewalls do not apply to subsidiaries of national banks. Applicant otherwise would continue to comply with the Section 20 Firewalls set forth in Citicorp, as modified subsequently by the Board. Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may. with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to bea proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second. the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. A particular activity may be found to meet the \"closely related to banking\" test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity: or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form. National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y. 49 FR 806 (1984). The Board previously has approved. by order, the proposed private placement and riskless principal activities, and Applicant has stated that it will conduct these activities using the same methods and procedures and subject to the prudential limitations established by the Board in its previous orders. See J.P. Morgan 8 Company Incorporated, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 26 (1990); Bankers Trust New York Corporation, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 829 (1989). The Board also has approved, by regulation, the proposed securities brokerage and investment advisory activities, and Applicant has stated that it will conduct these activities in accordance with the conditions and limitations set forth in the Board's Regulation Y. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4) and (15). In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test. section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes44838 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993/ Notices that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition. Applicant also believes that approval of this application will allow Company to provide a wider range of services and added convenience to its customers. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal.

Open committee discussion. The existence of unbiased clinical research is essential to FDA's assessment of the safety and effectiveness of new human and animal drugs, medical devices, and biologics. The soundness of FDA's premarket decisions depends on the reliability of the data submitted by sponsors. While there are a number of potential sources of bias, there is growing recognition that certain kinds of payment arrangements for clinical trials, such as those that implicitly result in a higher fee for a particularoutcome (e.g., equity, stock option, or royalty payments), have the potential to bias the outcome of trials. The Science Board will examine the broad concepts underlying the issue of disclosure of financial information by clinical investigators participating in clinical trials.

Comments and materials received are available on request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours, at the above Honolulu address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Karen W. Rosa, Fish and Wildlife Biologist, at the above Honolulu address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, criteria for recognizing the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and initial estimates of times and costs to implement the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires the development ofrecovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. Substantive technical comments will result in changes to the plans. Substantive comments regarding recovery plan implementation may not necessarily result in changes to the recovery plans, but will be forwarded to appropriate Federal or other entities so that they can take these comments into account during the course of implementing recovery actions. Individualized responses to comments will not be provided. The species being considered in this recovery plan is the Ka'u silversword, Argfoxiphium kauense. The areas of emphasis for recovery actions for this species are, the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the Keapohina area of Kahuku Ranch and the sub-alpine parkland of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii, Hawaii. Recovery efforts will focus on securing habitat and managing it to remove threats by feral ungulates, alien plants and predatory insects. Current populations will be augmented and new populations will be established. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified will be considered prior to approval of the plan. Authority The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

ACTION: Notice of receipt of a petition and proposed action. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the receipt of a petition from the Environmental Investigation Agency to suspend the import of African grey parrots from C6te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Benin to the United States under the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA). The Service hereby proposes to suspend the importation of African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus and all subspecies) from C6te d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, and Guinea, based on information in the petition and in other documents available to the Service. The petition has been found to present substantial information indicating that suspending the import of African grey parrots is warranted under the WBCA, and that the trade in African grey parrots from these countries is detrimental to the species' survival. Through the issuance of this notice, the Service requestsadditional data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific and conservation communities, industry groups, or any other concerned interested party regarding the status of African grey parrots. DATES: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will consider comments and information received by September 24. 1993 in making a final decision on this proposed action. ADDRESSES: Comments and information should be sent to: Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, c/o Mr. Marshall P. Jones, Chief, Office of Management Authority. 4401 N. Fairfax Dr., room 420C, Arlington VA 22203. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Susan S. Lieberman, Office of Management Authority, at the above address, telephone (703) 358-2093. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 4901-4916) was signed into law. The purposes of the WBCA include promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: Ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic birds are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to inhumane treatment; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in countries of origin. Pursuant to section 105(b) of the WBCA (16 U.S.C. 4904), \"Emergency Authority to Suspend Imports of Listed Species,\" the WBCA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the importation of exotic birds of any species that is listed in any Appendix to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES, or Convention), if the Secretary determines that: \"1. Trade in that species is detrimental to the species, 2. There is not sufficient information available on which to base a judgement that the species is not detrimentally affected by trade in that species, or 3. Remedial measures have been recommended by the Standing Committee of the Convention that have not been iniplemented; and 4. The suspension might be necessary for the conservation of the species.\" This proposed action is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies. All documents on which this proposed action is based are on file in the Service's Office of Management Authority, and are available on request.On February 22, 1993, the Service received a letter from G.A. Punguse, Chief Game and Wildlife Officer for Ghana. requesting that the United States stop African grey parrot shipments from Togo to the United States and stating that no African grey parrot populations are found in Togo and that all of the birds exported from Togo are actually smuggled from Ghana. On April 12, 1993, the Environmental Investigation Agency submitted a petition to the Service requesting the Secretary to suspend imports cf African grey parrots from CMte d'Ivoire. Togo, and Benin to the United States. On April 15, 1993. the Service received a letter from the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland noting that a CITES report (Dandliker, 1992) on the grey parrot in Ghana indicates that the majority of the specimens that are exported from C6te d'Ivoire are in reality smuggled into C6te d'Ivoire from Ghana and other countries. The letter further noted that the Secretariat had corresponded with the Government of C6te d'Ivoire, expressed its concerns that a large number of birds may have been smuggled from Ghana, and recommended that C6te d'Ivoire stop exports of African grey parrots until populations could be surveyed. At the eighth meeting of the CITES Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, Resolution Conf. 8.9 was adopted. The Resolution, entitled \"The Trade in Wild-Caught Animal Specimens,\" established a process whereby the CITES Animals Committee would communicate primary and secondary recommendations to CITES Parties regarding species that had been identified as high-priority species. The African grey parrot is such a species. The resolution established a process whereby the CITES Secretariat would assess whether a party had implemented specific recommendations: any failure to- so demonstrate would be brought to the attention of the Standing Committee. The Secretariat sent recommendations from the Animals Committee to several CITES Parties in June 1992; those that did not reply were sent reminders in October 1992 and January 1993. Based on the report of the Secretariat to the March 1993 meeting of the CITES Standing Committee in Washington, DC, the Standing Committee unanimously recommended to all Parties that imports be suspended for a number of species, including the African grey parrot from Guinea. On April 20. 1993, the CITES Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties No. 737, which notified the Parties of the Standing Committee's44847 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices recommendation to suspend imports of Psittacus erithacus from Guinea. On May 7, 1993, the CITES Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties No. 746, which \"strongly recommended\" that Parties \"not accept any comparable documentation from C6te d'Ivoire for trade in specimens of African grey parrots (P. erithacus), including the subspecies P. e. erithacus and P. e. timneh.\" This recommendation remains in effect until the CITES Secretariat is satisfied that the government of CMte d'Ivoire has \"completed surveys on its wild populations of African grey parrots and based on those surveys, establishes a management plan for sustainable international trade; and has taken appropriate measures to prevent the illegal import of grey parrots from other countries, and to ensure that shipments of grey parrots that are exported from C6te d'Ivoire do not include birds that have been imported illegally.\" The Notification notes that a CITES report on the grey parrot in Ghana indicates that the majority of P. erithacus erithacus exported from CMte d'Ivoire are birds that are smuggled from Ghana and other countries. The African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) is a medium-sized parrot endemic to Africa. It is distributed in Central Africa from the Gulf of Guinea Islands and the west coast east to western Kenya and northwestern Tanzania; it possibly ranges to Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania (Forshaw, 1989). They are primarily birds of lowland forests. There are three subspecies recognized: Psittacus e. erithacus, P. e. princeps, and P. e. timneh (Forshaw, 1989; Howard and Moore, 1991). The nominate subspecies, P. e. erithacus, is widespread in equatorial Africa. It ranges from southeastern C6te d'Ivoire to western Kenya and south to northern Angola, southern regions of Zaire and to northwestern Tanzania. P. e. princeps is restricted to the islands of Principe and Bioko in the Gulf of Guinea; while P. e. timneh is confined to southern Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the westernmost parts of C6te d'Ivoire. The nominate subspecies, P. e. erithacus (\"Redtail\"), can be distinguished from P. e. timneh (\"Maroontail\") by morphological characteristics. \"Red-tailed African grey parrots\" have an all-black bill and a bright red tail, whereas \"Maroon-tailed African grey parrots\" have a pale upper bill, a much darker maroon-red (often witl a lot of dark-brown) tail, their general body color is darker, and on avelage, they are about 15% smaller in size than Red-tailed African grey parrots (Dak.dliker, 1992). Within the Red-tailedAfrican grey parrots. (P. e. erithacus), there exists a gradient in body size between western and eastern populations (Dandliker, 1992). Traders distinguish between the \"Ghanaian Redtails\" and the or Cameroonian Redtails.\" \"Congo Red- tailed African grey parrots\" are larger and heavier than those from the western parts of the range. Although African grey parrots have long been popular in the pet bird trade, very little scientific data on the status, population sizes, and demography of wild populations exists. The trade in this species has long been an issue of concern. Between 1983 and 1989, 346,782 African grey parrots were exported from 20 African countries, including two (S6ndgal and Togo) which are not believed to be range states (Environmental Investigation Agency 1993). In 1991, 10,651 Psittacus erithacus and 3,976 P. e. timneh were imported into the United States. As of June 20, 1993, 6,421 Psittacus erithacus and 2,138 P. e. timneh had been imported into the United States since the WBCA was enacted, under the quota established by the WBCA and published in the Federal Register (58 FR 19840). A CITES Report (Dandliker, 1992) estimated the total population of Red- tailed African grey parrots (P. e. erithacus) in West Africa to be between 40,000 and 100,000 birds. The largest population of Red-tailed African grey parrots occurs in Ghana, where the population is estimated to be between 30,000 and 80,000 birds (75%-80% of the total West African population) (Dandliker, 1992). Since 1980, Ghana has banned the export of its African grey parrots. This ban was found to be necessary by the Ghana Department of Game and Wildlife \"because of the large number of birds exported annually without scientific information to determine a sustainable off-take which would ensure the survival of the species in the wild\" (Letter from G. Punguse, 1993). The recent CITES Secretariat-sponsored survey of African grey parrots in Ghana (Dandliker, 1992) concluded that the majority of the wild populations of Red- tailed African grey parrots are found in Ghana, with a few populations along the C6te d'Ivoire eastern boundary with Ghana and none in Togo. The CITES report (Dandliker, 1992) found that the majority of African grey parrots (P. e. erithacus) exported from CMte d'Ivoire are, in reality, birds that are smuggled into C6te d'Ivoire from Ghana, and all the African grey parrots exported from Togo come from Ghana. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA, 1993) studies the illegaltrade in African grey parrots from Ghana, at the request of the Ghanaian Government. Statements made by traders to EIA appear to further substantiate the findings of the CITES Report concerning the illegal trade in African grey parrots from C6te d'Ivoire. Statements made by traders to EIA also point to illegal trade in African grey parrots from Benin, which originated in Ghana. After a review of the petition from the Environmental Investigation Agency, the aforementioned Notifications from the CITES Secretariat, and other information available, the Service concludes the petition did present substantial scientific and commercial information indicating that the suspension of imports of African grey parrots imports from C6te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Guinea is warranted. Information related to imports of African grey parrots from Benin is more limited, and the Service is interested in any information regarding trade in African grey parrots originating in or reexported from Benin. Information available to the Service indicated that in Ghana, although the African grey parrot' is protected from export, it has been depleted by the \"laundering\" of smuggled birds through exports of the species from C6te d'lvoire, Togo, and possibly Benin. Therefore, the Service finds that the trade of African grey parrots from CMte d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo, and Guinea may be detrimental to the species in Ghana; a suspension of imports from these countries is proposed, in the interest of the conservation of the species in Ghana. Effects of the Rule The Service has determined that this action is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291, nor does it have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. The estimated number of birds that may be made unavailable to the wild bird market totals 2,000. In October 1993, importation of this species will be prohibited by the Wild Bird Conservation Act; this action would impose the ban prior to October. This rule does not contain any information collections for which Office of Management and Budget approval is required under 44 U.S.C. 3501. Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that any final decision resulting from this Notice will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any comments or data from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific or conservation communities, trade44848 Federal Register / Vol. 58.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of section 337 violations in the importation, sale for importation, and sale after importation of sputtered carbon coated computer disks (\"sputtered disks\") and products containing such disks, including disk drives, on May 5, 1993. Complainant Aine alleges infringement of claims 23, 24, 25, 26, and 29 of U.S. Letters Patent Re 32,464 (\"the '464 patent\"). Aine's complaint alleges that Maxtor assembles overseas and imports into the United States disk drives containing sputtered disks that infringe the pertinent claims of the '464 patent. In its motion for summary determination, Maxtor asserted that the disks that it purchases for installation in its disk drives are either manufactured in the United States or manufactured overseas by a licensee of complainant Aine. Consequently, it argued that it is entitled to summary determination because its purchasing activities are either outside the jurisdiction of section 337, insofar as they concern domestically-manufactured disks, or non-infringing, insofar as they concern the disks manufactured by the licensee. Maxtor asserted that the jurisdictional * issues raised by its motions were identical to those in several previous motions for summary determination or partial summary determination filed by other respondents to the investigation which the ALJ granted in an ID issued on May 28, 1993 (\"the May 28 ID\"). In that ID, the ALJ concluded that the Commission does not have section 337 jurisdiction over domestically- manufactured articles. Complainant Aine opposed the Maxtor motion. In the July 26 ID, the ALJ granted the Maxtor summary determination motion on the basis of the May 28 ID. On June 30, 1993, the Commission issued a notice indicating that it would review the May 28 ID. Additionally, on July 21, 1993, the Commission issued a notice indicating that it would review an ID on jurisdictional issues issued on July 2. 1993, (\"the July 2 ID\") on a'consolidated44851 Federal Register / Vol. 58.

Aine and Maxtor have filed Petitions for Review of the July 26 ID and have requested that it be reviewed on a consolidated basis with the May 28 and July 2 IDs. Having reviewed the record in this investigation, including the ID, the Commission has determined to review the July 26 ID. Review of the July 26 ID will be consolidated with review of the May 28 and July 2 IDs. The parties have already filed with the Commission opening briefs on the jurisdictional issues under review pursuant to the June 30, 1993, notice of review. Consequently, the Commission does not request briefing from the parties beyond that permitted under the June 30, 1993, notice. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337, and Commission interim rules 210.55 and 210.56, 19 CFR 210.55, 210.56.

General Program Description A. Purpose Ensuring high-quality scientific research, effective development of new technologies, internationally competitive manufacturing, protection of the environment, and other high technology activities requires well- educated science and engineering- technicians. To achieve this goal, recognition is growing that improvement in the qualify of our workforce depends on strong and innovative science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at associate degree granting institutions. To best serve the nation, technological education programs require partnerships among two- and four-year colleges, universities, secondary schools, business, government, and industry. The purpose of the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) is to promote exemplary improvement in advanced technological education at the national and regional level through support of curriculum development and program improvement at the undergraduate and secondary school levels, especially for technicins being educated for the high performance workplace of advanced technologies. Curriculum development encompasses the design and implementation of new curricula, courses, laboratories, and instructional materials. Program improvement encompasses faculty and teacher development, student academic support, and formal cooperative arrangements among institutions and other partners. ATE projects will result in major improvements in advanced technological education, serve as models for other institutions, assure that students acquire strong backgrounds in mathematics and science, and yield nationally-usable educational products. The program is managed in the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) in cooperation with the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education (ESIE). The level of support provided will depend on availability of funds in FY 1994. B. Scope of the Program To carry out the goals above, the ATE program willestablish Centers of- Excellence in Advanced Technological Education to provide systemic approaches to technological education and projects which emphasize one or, two aspects of this systemic activity. The ATE program thus features three components: National/Regional Centers of Excellence for Advanced44857 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices Technological Education, projects which focus on one or more aspects of advanced technological education, and special projects. In FY 1994, the ATE program expects to support: * Planning grants for Centers to serve as national and regional models and clearinghouses for model curricula, instructional materials, and methods; * Up to five Centers; \" Projects which focus on one or more aspects of curriculum development, faculty or teacher enhancement, instructional materials development, or instrumentation and laboratory improvement; and 0 Conferences, workshops, symposia, design and planning projects, studies, and other special projects that will lead to better understanding of issues in advanced technological education. The number and distribution of Centers and projects depends on the availability of funds and quality of proposals received. C. Eligibility Eligible Programs: The object of this section is to characterize advanced technological education for the purposes of the current announcement. Technician education in general is the occupation-driven education of persons to use complex technologies. Advanced technological education programs are those technician education programs aimed at strategic advanced-technology fields. To qualify for NSF support, curricula and work experiences in these programs must emphasize and be based on scientific, mathematical, and engineering principles. Advanced engineering technological fields include, but are not limited to, aeronautical, architectural, chemical, civil, communications, computer, electrical and electronic, industrial, manufacturing, materials, mechanical, marine, nuclear, and systems. Advanced science technological fields include, but are not limited to, biotechnology, chemical. environmental, hazardous waste, marine science, and optics, Technicians in such fields enhance productivity in manufacturing, telecommunication, transportation, and other commercial activities important to national economic and security interests. Students enrolled in advanced technological programs in two-year colleges typically earn an associate degree in engineering technology or science technology which qualifies them for employment or for transfer to a four-year institution. Through the ATE program, NSF is interested in supporting development of science and mathematics courses inboth core and advanced technology areas. This is especially important in two-year colleges because it is expected that all associate degree advanced technological education programs have an appropriate and strong mathematics and science core of courses to serve as prerequisites and co-requisites for specialized technology courses. The ATE program is also interested in the development of advanced science and engineering technology course which assume that students have such skills and principles. It is expected that development of courses be cooperative efforts among faculty and appropriate industry staff (such as technicians and research staff) in mathematics, science, engineering, and technical fields. An important feature of advanced technological education is opportunities for apprenticeships, cooperative education experiences, and internships which are oriented to specific jobs or skills. NSF support, through this announcement, can cover course development and program improvement, with proposing institutions and industry jointly providing support for technician training through apprenticeship and internship opportunities. Eligible Institutions: Proposals are invited from two-year colleges, other associate degree granting institutions, two-year college systems, and consortia of two-year colleges as well as consortia of two-year colleges with other appropriate organizations and institutions such as four-year colleges and universities, secondary schools, professional societies, and non-profit, educational research and development groups. Proposals from a formal consortium should be submitted by the consortium; proposals from an informal consortium should be submitted by one member of the consortium. Eligible Costs: NSF support extends to those items that represent new design or development costs. NSF funds may not be used to support expenditures that would normally be undertaken in the absence of an award. II. National/Regional Centers of Excellence for Advanced Technological Education A. Development of Centers Closing Dates: Preproposals: November 1, 1993 Formal Proposals: March 22, 1994 Formal Proposals for Planning Grants: November 1, 1993 or March 24, 1994 Purpose The ATE program will support up to five National/Regional Centers ofExcellence. in FY 1994. Centers will serve as national and regional models and clearinghouses for the benefit of both colleges and secondary schools. Model curricula, instructional materials, and teaching methods will be developed at and through these Centers and then disseminated through publishers, seminars, workshops, publications, electronic networks, and other appropriate means. The Centers may vary in size, complexity, disciplinary coverage, and extent of the region served. An essential feature of Centers is active participation in the educational process by both academia and the -private and public sectors served by the educational system. Centers must be cooperative efforts among two-year colleges, four-year colleges and universities, secondary schools, industry, business, and government. Proposals should involve a three- pronged alliance of support from: * NSF for curriculum development, including core courses and laboratories in science, mathematics, engineering, science technology, and engineering technology and for program improvement, including faculty and teacher development, and formal cooperative arrangements among partners; * The proposing educational institution(s) or consortium for other laboratory-driven experiences, student services, and other courses such as technical writing to support the programs; * Local business, industry, and government agencies and laboratories for apprenticeships, cooperative educational experiences, and internships for students, faculty enhancement, loan of technical professionals to teach, and other modes of active cooperation in the Center.

Development of Projects Submission Dates: Preproposals: November 1, 1993 Formal Proposals: March 22, 1994 * Purpose Technological education represents a variety of programs in the education system which prepare students for careers which use technology. While Centers are expected to be comprehensive projects as described in the previous section, projects in advanced technological education at the two-year college and secondary school level supported through the ATE , program may focus more narrowly on curriculum development, faculty or teacher enhancement, faculty or teacher preparation, instructional materials development, or instrumentation and laboratory improvement. They should however be placed in the context of a more comprehensive program. Curriculum and materials development projects are expected to produce laboratory manuals, textbooks, videos, CD-ROMs, software, and other educational materials of potentially national benefit including conference presentations and journal articles. Because of the nature of advanced technological education programs, where appropriate, projects should build on alliances of associate degree granting institutions with four-year colleges and universities, secondary schools, business, industry, and government. Projects that cut across two or more of the boundaries listed below are especially encouraged. 1. Curriculum and Instructional Materials The ATE program supports model projects to improve the quality of courses and curricula in the basic mathematics, science, and engineering core underlying programs in advanced technological education as well as more specialized science and engineeringtechnology courses which build on this core. It encompasses activities affecting the learning environment, content, and experience of instruction. Technological education is field dependent and driven by applications. There should be a match between what work requires and what students are taught. The education component should provide understanding to make the technician more insightful about the work environment and more flexible about receiving additional training whiclf may be job and/or skill related. The Advanced Technological Education program seeks projects that envision major changes at the two-year college and secondary school level and that result in widely disseminated products such as textbooks, laboratory experiments and manuals, software, videos, CD-ROMs, and other educational products including conference presentations and journal articles. Projects may range from revision of existing materials to creation of entirely new ones; from a few modules at a single instructional level to comprehensive curricula for multiple years; and from a single subject to integration of several disciplines. Of particular interest are projects that are designed to produce major changes and significant improvement beyond the recipient institution and which will produce materials used regionally or nationally. Curriculum projects that integrate mathematics, science, and' technology, and are developed by teams of educators, scientists, and in industry participants are especially sought, as are projects which implements the national mathematics and science standards in a technological context and which help produce two-year college students for technological programs. Curriculum projects that prepare future teachers and faculty for advanced technological programs are encouraged. Curriculum and instructional materials projects may vary from the development of supplemental course materials to the development of full comprehensive courses. Projects of varying types are encouraged, and requests will normally range from $50,000 to $500,000 per year for one to five years depending on the complexity of the project. 2. Teacher and Faculty Enhancement Faculty and teachers are key elements in advanced technological education. It is critical that they be intellectually vigorous and excited about their disciplines, that their knowledge of recent development in their fields be up-to-date, and that they regard teaching as an important and rewarding activity.To this end, the ATE program provides support to maintain currency and vitality of faculty and teachers and to assist them in enhancing their disciplinary capabilities and teaching skills. Successful projects emphasize both content and pedagogy, help faculty and teachers develop and exercise leadership qualities, and provide opportunities for continuing professional growth. Faculty and teachers need to be familiar with recent advances in their fields, with new experimental techniques, with new pedagogical strategies, and with ways of incorporating all of these into advanced technological education. Faculty and teachers also need to be familiar with new instrumentation and the opportunity to evaluate its suitability for instructional use. They need opportunities to synthesize knowledge that cuts across their own and other disciplines. Finally, they also need opportunities to interact intensively with experts in the field and with colleagues who are active scientists. technicians, engineers, and mathematicians, both during the course of the project, and in a continuing way after the project. Typical projects for teacher and faculty enhancement under the ATE program include conferences, seminars, short courses, institutes, and workshops, or a series of such activities. Sessions for college faculty may vary in length from a few days to several weeks. Follow-up activities to affect long-term change normally span at least one academic year. Teacher enhancement institutes are typically funded for at least two years with at least three weeks of intensive instruction each summer and follow-up during the academic year. These institutes provide major support for classroom and school change in implementing'advanced technological education curricula as well as improved integrated mathematics and science to support technological education. Projects in which two-year college faculty work with four-year college or university faculty and/or secondary school teachers are encouraged. Teacher and faculty enhancement projects will normally range from $25,000 to $500,000 per year for one to five years depending on the complexity and length of the activities, the number of teachers and faculty involved, and the follow-up support provided. 3. Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Laboratory or field experiences with suitable modern equipment are crucial elements of advanced technological4t4860 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices education, especially at the two-year college level. The ATE program seeks projects aimed at the development of innovative methods for using laboratory exercises to improve student understanding of basic principles and for use of modern instrumentation, new technologies, or applications of instruments that extend the instructional capability of the equipment. The ATE program encourages the establishment of equipment-sharing through consortia or centers. Because the ATE program focuses on improving the quality of technological education through laboratory improvement, projects based primarily on financial need or replacement of equipment at the same level of capability are not appropriate. Equipment funds must be matched by non-federal dollars equal to or greater than funds requested from NSF. The maximum NSF request is $100,000. Institutions have 30 months during which the requested equipment must be acquired and the development plan implemented. B. Preparation and Submission of Preproposals and Formal Proposals Preproposals for projects should follow the same guidelines given in Section II part C(1) \"Preproposals for Centers.\" Formal proposals for projects should follow the same guidelines given in Section II part C(2) \"Formal Proposals for Centers\" and Section V \"Preparation and Submission of Proposals.\" Planning Grants will not normally be given for projects. IV. Workshops, Conferences, Seminars, Studies, and Other Special Projects The ATE program expects to support a few special projects such as conferences, workshops, symposia, studies, and other activities that will lead to a better understanding of issues in advanced technological education. Requests should normally be made at least 9 months in advance of the date of the scheduled activity. Individuals or groups wishing to submit such a request should contact an ATE Program Director at (202) 357-7051 before September 24, 1993 and (703) 306-1668 after September 24, 1993 before preparing a two- to three-page preliminary proposal. Following an initial discussion, a preliminary proposal which includes a project outline, description of personnel involved, and approximate budget should be sent to an ATE Program Director. NSF staff will review these preproposals and encourage selected formal proposals.Formal proposals for such activities should include: (1) A summary indicating the objectives of the project; (2) statement of the need;-(3) names and qualifications of key personnel organizing and leading the activity including vitae of principal investigators; (4) lists of participants to be invited or other persons to be involved in the project; (5) information on probable dates of workshops or meetings or duration of other type projects; (6) budget, detailing the requested NSF contribution and support requested or available from other sources. Because proceedings are normally published, requests for support can also include publication costs. I Preproposals and proposals for these special projects should be sent directly to an ATE Program Director at the National Science Foundation, Division of Undergraduate Education, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22230 after October 25, 1993 and the Washington address before October 25, 1993, not the Rockville, Maryland address.

IFR Doc. 93-20587 Filed 8-24-93; 8:45 am) G:LUNG COOE 759O-O1-U [Docket No. 50-82] Entergy Operations, Inc., (Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit No. 3); Exemption Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), is the holder of FacilIty Operating License No. NPF-38, which authorizes operation of the Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit No. 3 (Waterford). The license provides, among other things, that Waterford is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory * Commission (the Commission) now and hereafter in effect. The Waterford facility consists of a pressurized water reactor located in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. II. \u00b0 In its letter dated May 7, 1993, the licensee applied for an amendment to Operating License No. NPF-38 to change certain provisions of the Waterford Technical Specifications (TSs). The licensee in this letter also requested an exemption from the Commission's regulations. The subject exemption is from a requirement in appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 that a set of three Type A tests (Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Tests, or CILRTs) be performed, at approximately equal intervals, during each 10-year service period. The Type A test is defined in 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, Section II.F, as a \"test intended to measure the primary reactor containment overall integrated leakage rate (1) after the containment has been completed and is ready for t operation, and (2) at periodic intervals thereafter.\" The 10-year service period begins -with the inservice date. TS4.6.1.2.a requires that the Type A tests be condilcted during shutdown at 40\u00b110 month intervals in each 10-year service period. This TS incorporates the requirements of Section II.D.1.(a) of appendix J with regard to performing three Type A tests at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period. The first CILRT testing interval was 32 months, and the second was 36 months. The time interval between CILRTs should be about 40 months based on performing three such tests at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period. Since refueling outages do not necessarily occur at 40-month intervals, a permissible variation of 10 months (25 percent variation) is typically authorized in the technical specifications issued with an operating license to permit flexibility in scheduling the CILRTs. The proposed revision to the Waterford TSs associated with the licensee's May 7, 1993, request for a one-time exemption would change the TSs by extending the surveillance requirements of TS 4.6.1.2.a and its associated Bases. The extension would allow the third Type A CILRT within the first 10-year service period to be conducted during the Cycle 7 refueling outage. This TS change is a one-time schedular extension of the third maximum interval from 50 months to 54 months. It does not affect the second 10- year service period. With respect to the subject exemption. request, the NRC staff notes that the first and second CILRTs of the set of three tests for the first 10-year service period for Waterford were conducted in May 1968 and.May 1991. This represefits testing intervals of 32 and 36 months from the inservice date of September 1985. The third of the first set of three CILRTs will be scheduled for Refueling Outage 7, projected to start in October 1995, pending approval of the exemption request. The current third test period in the first 10-year service period will actually be exceeded by approximately 4 months. Data from the first (May 1988) and second (May 1991) CILRT at Waterford 3 indicates that most of the measured leakage is from the containment penetrations and not from the containment barrier. The \"as-left\" leakage rate was well below the 10 CFR part 50 appendix J limit. Both appendix J and TS requires that the leakage rate be less that 75% of L. to allow for deterioration in leakage paths between tests. The allowable leakage rate, L., is 0.5 wt.%/day. Therefore, the established acceptable limit is <0.375 wt.%/day. The \"as-left\" leakage rates for the first44863 , Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices two CILRTs were 0.116 and 0.0731 wt.%/day, which is well below the acceptance limit. The Type B and C test (Local Leakage Rate Test or LLRT) program also provides assurance that containment integrity has been maintained. LLRTs demonstrate operability of components and penetrations by measuring penetration and valve leakage. Additionally, there have been no modifications made to the plant that could adversely affect the test results. The licensee further notes that the performance of a fourth test in the first 10-year service period to meet the requirements of the TSs and appendix J would result in additional radiation exposure to personnel. Omitting the test will result in additional dose savings by eliminating contamination and by reducing exposure from venting and draining and from setups and restorations of instrumentation required to perform the test. These factors and the costs associated with a fourth test for a 4-month difference in interval time are not offset by the benefits of the fourth test. For the reasons set forth above, the NRC staff concludes that this deviation from the 10-year service period ending September 1995 is not significant in terms of complying with the safety or scheduling requirements of Section llI.D.l.(a) of appendix J. Accordingly, the staff finds that the additional test would not provide substantially different information and that the intent of appendix J is met. Therefore, the subject exemption request meets the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), in that the fourth test is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2). Further, the staff also finds that extending the service period will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety; since the licensee has justified the leaktight integrity of the containment based on previous leakaged test results, the staff concludes that a one-time extension of approximately 4 months beyond the maximum permitted third test interval within the first 10-year service period will not have a significant safety impact. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, and exemption is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest and hereby grants the following exemption with respect to a requirementof 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, Section For the Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit 3. the current third test period within the first 10-year service period may be extended by approximately 4 months, so that the third periodic Type A test may be performed during the Cycle 7 refueling outage. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of the subject exemption will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (58 FR 34829). This Exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 12th day of August 1993. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Jack W.

Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Act\"), notice is hereby given that on August 12, 1993, the Options Price Reporting Authority (\"OPRA\") submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\" or \"Commission\") an amendment to the Plan for Reporting of Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and Quotation Information (\"Plan\"), extending until November 1, 1994, the pilot program providing for the dissemination of certain implied volatility quotations on selected foreign currency options to vendors outside of the OPRA system. OPRA has designated this proposal as concerned solely with the administration of the plan,, permitting it to become effective upon filing, pursuant to Rule lAa3-2(c)(3)(ii) under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendment. I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment OPRA requests an extension of the pilot program that was the subject of the amendment previously filed on May 14, 1992,1 providing for the dissemination of certain implied volatility quotations in foreign currency options directly by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange(\"PHLX\") through selected vendors, rather than through the OPRA network. A request for an extension of the pilot program was filed with the Commission on April 2, 1993,2 and expires September 1, 1993. The purpose of the pilot program is to permit PHLX to accommodate those institutional investors in foreign currency options who desire to receive indications of the current state of the foreign currency options market expressed in implied volatility quotations. These quotations serve only as indications of the state of the market; actual trading in foreign currency options continues to be conducted through bids and offers expressed in terms of the prices at which options may be bought or sold which continue to be disseminated over the OPRA system. Because the existing specifications of the OPRA system were not designed to accommodate implied volatility quotations, OPRA has consented to PHLX's arranging for the transmission of this information through selected vendors. As originally filed, the pilot program was approved by the Commission for an initial period of six months from the date that one or more of the vendors first transmitted implied volatility quotations. Volatility quotations were first transmitted on October 5, 1992, and because OPRA does not yet have the capability to transmit implied volatility quotations through the OPRA network, it is necessary to extend the pilot program to insure the continued availability of these quotations. OPRA has been giving consideration to whether and how the OPRA network might be utilized to disseminate these implied volatility quotations and at a meeting held on April 22, 1993, OPRA authorized the extension of the existing pilot through November 1, 1994, while it continues to study this matter. ii. Solicitation of Comments' Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)3), the amendment is effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission may summarily abrogate the amendment within 60 days of its filing and require refiling and approval of the amendment by Commission order pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(2), if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a National I Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30906 (July 2 Securities Exchange ActRelease No. 32154 16, 1992), 57 FR 3154Q.

On June 16, 1992, pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Act\"),' The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") a proposed rule change establishing the honest broker program. On July 29, 1992, the Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register to solicit comment from interested persons.2 The Commission did not receive any comments. DTC received seven comment letters in response to a notice regarding the proposed procedures that was distributed to its participants before 115 U.S.C. 788(b){1) (1988). z Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30948 (July 22, 1992), 57 FR 33533.44865 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices this filing was made.3 This order approves the proposal. I. Description The proposed rule change establishes procedures to facilitate the liquidation of securities-held for a participating bank and broker experiencing financial or operational difficulties, particularly in-those cases when one or more DTC participants have an interest in those securities.4 The procedures will be known as the \"honest broker\" program. DTC will activate the honest broker program upon a pledgor's request, principally when more than one pledgee bank is unwilling to return pledged securities directly to a single pledgor, and .only after consultations with the Commission and other interested regulators.5 Prior to activating the honest broker program, DTC will notify pledgees and DTC participants by a broadcast message over the Participant Terminal System (\"PTS\") that the honest broker program will be activated. DTC will advise its participants that they may receive deliveries in settlement of their transactions with the pledgor from the DTC honest broker account. If a large number of participants are to be 3 DTC received comment letters from Alex, Brown & Sons, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., Citicorp Mabon Securities Corporation. Nations Bank, New York Clearing House Association, and U.S. Trust Company. The commentators generally supported the proposal. For a discussion of these comment letters, see Section I1 infra. 4 The National Securities Clearing Corporation (\"NSCC\") acts on behalf of its members to clear trades with other members in eligible securities which include most corporate, municipal and mutual fund securities. NSCC's members include (directly or indirectly) almost all registered broker- dealers, which allows NSCC to net to a single delivery or receive obligation in each eligible security all of a merfiber's trades in those securities and to a single payment or collect obligation monies payable or receivable across all trades. At the end of each day, all long or short positions that do not settle are marked-to-the-market and carried forward to the next settlement day. In the Continuous Net Settlement (\"CNS\") System, NSCC interposes itself as the counterparty of its members' trades, i.e., NSCC becomes the buyer to a member's sell obligations and the seller to a member's buy obligations. NSCC maintains a settlement account at DTC in which settlement of member trades occurs by book-entry movement. On October 13, 1992, NSCC filed a proposal with the Commission to authorize it to coordinate with DTC in regard to this program. Among other things, NSCC will provide DTC with the information to ensure that open short positions in NSCC's CNS system will be covered prior to other open short positions at DTC. The Commission is approving NSCC's and DTC's proposals concurrently. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32760 (August 17, 1993) [File No. SR-NSCC-92-12.] s Among other things, DTC will review with regulatory officials whether activation of the honest broker program is appropriate and what steps have been taken to coordinate with other interested self- regulatory organizations.notified, DTC also will issue an Important Notice. A pledgee bank may notify DTC by written notice, or by facsimile or telephone followed by a written notice, that it intends to participate in the honest broker program. Pledgees will have until 10 a.m., eastern time, on the day of settlement to provide such notice to DTC. In the notice to DTC, the pledgee bank must identify the account number to be used for delivering positions to the honest broker account. Participating pledgees will use DTC's \"Demand of Collateral\" procedures for pledged positions that the pledgee bank intends to deliver to the DTC honest broker account.6 A non-participant pledgee that utilizes DTC's pledge facilities under DTC Rule 2, Section 3, also may utilize the honest broker program by signing a written agreement that subjects the pledgee to DTC's By-Laws and rules.7 In addition, the non-participant pledgee must request that DTC establish a participant account number so that DTC may allocate to the non-participant pledgee its share of the proceeds from the liquidated positions and any securities that have not been redelivered from the honest broker account.6 For transactions that the pledgor wishes to settle through the honest broker program on the next business day,9 the pledgor will send to each affected pledgee bank and to DTC a PTS message identifying each issue of securities that the pledgee bank will deliver to the honest broker account. In addition, the pledgor will provide to DTC the quantity, price, settlement amount, and the DTC participant account to which each redelivery will be made. DTC will make the information available to the pledgee banks over PTS on the next business day.io a Under DTC's Demand of Collateral procedures a pledgee bank may move securities from the pledgee's DTC pledge account to the general account of arly DTC participant (other than the pledgor) including the DTC honest broker account or the bank's own participant account. 7 Under DTC Rule 2, Section 3. a non-participant pledgee may utilize DTC's services for the purpose of facilitating loans to DTC participants and effecting the pledge of DTC participants' securities held by or on behalf of DTC. A non-participant pledgee, however, may not receive a pledge of securities versus payment. See DTC Rule 2, Section 3. B Letter from Jack Weiner, Associate Counsel, DTC, to Sonia Burnett, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 2, 1992). 9 DTC plans to enhance the honest broker facility in the next few months to enable the pledger to provide information regarding transactions that will settle the same day. 1s Depending on operational considerations and to ensure orderly settlement, it may be necessary to vary the deadline for receipt of this information,On the morning of settlement day, DTC will notify the pledgee banks of the total settlement amount and the per share price of short positions in each transaction. Based on this information, each pledgee bank will determine whether to deliver pledged positions to the DTC honest broker account and will notify the pledgor and DTC accordingly. The pledgor will advise the DTC participants to whom deliveries are to be made that they should expect those deliveries from the DTC honest broker account. Deliveries to settle open short positions in NSCC's CNS system will be made first. DTC will make the remaining deliveries in descending order, with the highest price-per-share deliveries being made first.e1 All settlement credits will be made to the DTC honest broker account. For each issue, DTC will allocate proceeds received from the redeliveries and any securities that have not been redelivered from the honest broker account on a pro rata basis to pledgee banks that delivered securities to the honest broker account.12 In operating the honest broker program, DTC will act exclusively as agent for participating pledgee banks. DTC will assume no liability other than that arising from its own gross negligence. II. Discussion The Commission believes DTC's proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act.1n Those sections require a clearing agency to be organized and its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance. and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible. Section 17A(b)(3)(F) further provides that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and to protect investors and the public interest. As discussed below, the possibly by requiring notification by the pledgor and affirmation by the pledgee bank as early as the day prior to settlement. II DTC will not process any free deliveries through the honest broker program. 121f sufficient shares are not received to complete a delivery, the transaction will be dropped unless the delivery is to settle open CNS positions, in which case a partial delivery will be acceptable. For example, if the deliver order is for 10,000 shares, and only 9,000 shares are delivered to the honest broker account by pledgee banks, the transactions would drop. If, however, the deliver order is from NSCC to settle open CNS positions, DTC will deliver the 9,000 shares. 1315 U.S.C. 78q-l(b(3) (A) dnd (F) (1988).44866 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with those provisions. Uncertainty concerning the ability of a major market participant to settle its trading obligations could disrupt the smooth functioning of the national clearance and settlement system. In the unlikely event of such a crisis, DTC's proposal will reduce the possibility that a loss of confidence in the ability of a financially troubled firm to settle transactions and satisfy its settlement obligations to counterparties will not swell into a widespread crisis of confidence in the national clearance and settlement system. In this regard, the Commission believes that DTC's proposal will inure to the benefit of public investors by maintaining the integrity of the national clearance and settlement system in volatile markets and in times of financial crises. The proposed rule change will facilitate the liquidation of securities positions that have been pledged by book-entry in DTC. The need for such a mechanism became apparent during the winddown of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc. and its broker-dealer subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. (\"Drexel\"). As described more fully in the Commission's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,14 near gridlock developed in the mortgaged- backed securities market and in the corporate debt and equity markets where Drexel was an active participant. Drexel had significant positions in mortgage-backed securities that required physical delivery of certificates to settle and also in corporate equity and debt that could be liquidated by book-entry transfer. Lenders and counterparties, however, were reluctant to release both physical certificates and book-entry securities to Drexel. Those counterparties were concerned that the delivery of securities to Drexel against the promise of payment at the end of the day might result in the deliverer's inability to retrieve the securities if the deliverer did not receive payment because of an intervening event, such as the filing of a petition for bankruptcy by or against Drexel, or the assertion of a lien or set-off by one or more financial institutions handling those funds or securities.15 Resolution of open 14 The issues Surrounding the Collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Hearings before the United States Congress, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1990) (testimony of Richard C. Breeden, Chairman, Commission) (\"Drexel testimony\"). 1Ordinarily, lenders who accept securities in DTC's ledge program release those securities to the debtor's control without requiring full payment ofpositions was complicated by the need to coordinate the interests and actions of as many as ten banks with loans outstanding to Drexel, and was further complicatedby the need to account for settling trades with NSCC.16 In order to resolve the gridlock that this uncertainty created, Drexel and its lenders, in consultation with the Commission and federal bank regulatory staff, created a mechanism by which the pledgee bank delivered its collateralized securities to a third party financial institution that guaranteed that the pledgee bank would receive a pro rata share of the proceeds from any liquidated positions and the return of any securities that remained in the account at the end of the day.17 DTC's proposal codifies this mechanism to facilitate efficient clearance and settlement of pledged ositions. The Commission therefore elieves the proposal will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by providing pledgee banks a safe and secure method to liquidate securities held as collateral and by providing pledgors an efficient method to settle transactions during times of financial crises.The proposal provides for DTC to allocate securities that are released from pledgee banks first to open short CNS positions at NSCC. This aspect of the rule change will promote confidence in the national clearance and settlement system by facilitating the orderly and timely settlement of CNS positions. Nevertheless, the Commission outstanding loans, provided payment (including refunding through new pledge loans) occurs before the end of the day. This permits the debtor (typically, a broker-dealer) to deliver the pledged securities against payment to another participant or to NSCC during both of DTC's delivery processing cycles. Because settlement of transactions typically starts with delivery of securities, with the deliverer assuming the risk that payment will be made at or before the end of the day, release of pledged collateral can help maximize the number of trades that settle while shifting some credit risk to the deliver's bank. When Drexel experienced financial difficulties, however, its lenders and counterparties took steps to reduce their credit risk exposure to Drexel. In particular, because of concern about what might happen during the day or the quality of collateral that might be posted at the end of the day, lenders insisted upon repayment before release of securities, which meant Drexel could not settle open transactions even as it was winding down its portfolio. See Drexel testimony at 47. 16 While NSCC's CNS system provides important efficiencies and safeguards. Drexel's lenders were concerned that release of securities for delivery to NSCC could result in no net reduction of loans to Drexel because NSCC might apply the money due Drexel for those securities to meet other Drexel purchase or payment obligations. 17Although the Drexel experience involved both physical and book-entry deliveries, the honest broker proposal only addresses the liquidation of book-entry pledges.recognizes that some pledgee banks may not wish to have the securities allocated in this manner. A pledgee bank may decide not to deliver securities to the honest broker account if the pledgee bank believes the funds generated from the settlement of open short CNS positions at NSCC will not cover the outstanding loan. To facilitate pledgee planning, DTC will notify each pledgee bank of the total settlement amount and the share price for CNS and non-CNS open positions. If a pledgee bank does not deliver securities to the honest broker account, the pledgee bank may liquidate the securities outside of DTC's system,'5 DTC received seven comment letters concerning the proposed rule change.19 Two commentators inquired about the effect of the proposal on a pledgee's perfected security interest in securities or the proceeds of the sale of securities held at DTC when the securities have been released by the pledgee to the DTC honest broker account, i.e., whether the pledgee's perfected security interest would remain perfected in the event of a bankruptcy ruling or court-imposed stay. In response to this concern, DTC obtained a legal opinion stating, in pertinent part, that a pledgee that holds a perfected security interest in pledged securities that is not subject to avoidance under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable statutory provisions of federal or New York law prior to implementation of the honest broker procedures will continue to hold a perfected and non-avoidable security interest in the pledged securities after the implementation of the honest broker procedures and until the securities are delivered to the purchaser.2o One commentatbr questioned how DTC would account for dividends and, interest that accrued on transactions settled through the honest broker account. At the end of each day, all securities delivered to the honest broker account will be redelivered or returned on a pro rata basis to pledgee banks. ,aThe Commission notes that DTC is providing a mechanism for delivery/receipt against payment for liquidation of pledged collateral held by banks. The proposal is not intended to alter the respective rights and obligations of the pledgor and pledgees under the terms of agreements between those parties. \"9See note 3 supra. 20 Letter from Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, to DTC (November 2, 1992). In addition, in the event a bankruptcy petition is filed against a pledgor, the receipt by a pledgee of a pro rata portion of pledged securities will not be subject to avoidance by a pledgor, trustee or receiver for the pledgor appointed under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. U.S. federal, or New York state law. In addition, DTC will not, on its own behalf, own, or hold a security interest ir, ,he pledged securities before they are transferred to a purchaser, Id.44867 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices Since DTC will not hold securities positions in the honest broker account overnight, it is not necessary for DTC to trace or credit dividend and interest payments that accrue to securities processed in the honest broker account. Another commentator requested that DTC ensure that it could process large volumes of transactions over several days in the honest broker program. DTC expects that the honest broker processing will account for less than 1,000 transactions per day.21 DTC's processing capacity is now twice the level of October 1987. and the results of tests performed for the proposed program applications were satisfactry.22 Thus, DTC has represented that its processing system is capable of handling the additional volume of transactions.23 III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR- DTC-92-09) be, and hereby is. approved.

In recent years, the Local Quotations Program has been phased-out by the NASD and the specified NASD Committees created under the Local Quotations Program have ceased to function. Under current practice, the NASD provides certain news media organizations and other market data vendors with two electronic data lines on information regarding all Nasdaq National Market System (\"Nasdaq/ NMS\") securities and Nasdaq SmallCap Market (\"Nasdaq SmallCap\") Securities contained in the Nasdaq System., One data line provides bid/ask quotes for all Nasdaq Stock Market securities, and the other data line providei last sale information for all Nasdaq Stock Market securities. Most news media organizations currently receive quotation information regarding all Nasdaq Stock Market securities from a media organization or market data vendor that has access to the NASD data lines. Determinations regarding customized publication lists of Nasdaq SmallCap and Nasdaq/NMS securities are currently made by individual news media organizations based on their respective publication criteria. The NASD, therefore, proposes to delete Part IX of Schedule D to the NASD By- Laws.2 The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act a which requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to facilitate transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest in that the proposed rule change deletes rule language regarding an outdated NASD practice of providing the news media of specific communities with securities quotations of local interest. Deletion of I The Nasdaq System is comprised of both Nasdaq SmalCap and Nasdaq/NMS securities. 2 The Commission recently approved a proposed rule change to delete Part V to Schedule D of the NASD By-Laws regarding publication and dissemination of quotations to the news media. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32246 (April 30, 1993), File No. SR-NASD-93-14. The NASD notes that the rationale for deleting Part V is very similar to the Association's rationale for the proposed deletion of Part IX to Schedule D. 315 U.S.C. 78o-3.Part IX to Schedule D reflects the NASD's determination to end the practice of only disseminating information about certain securities to the local news media pursuant to the Local Quotations Program in favor of the current practice whereby two electronic data lines disseminate information on all Nasdaq System securities to certain media organizations and market data vendors. Most news media. organizations currently receive quotation information regarding all Nasdaq Stock Market securities from a media organization or market data vendor that has access to the NASD data lines. Determinations regarding customized publication lists of Nasdaq SmallCap and Nasdaq/NMS securities are currently made by individual news media organizations based on their respective publication criteria. The NASD's electronic data lines provide greater market information to the public than the procedures provided for under the Local Quotations Program contained in Part IX to Schedule D. The dissemination of quotes over the NASD electronic data lines, therefore, help perfect a free and open market and a national market system, and help to protect investors and the public interest. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the Act, as amended. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III.

McFarland, Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Participants Trust Co. Relating to a Modification of PTC's Method of Paying Principal and Interest to Participants August 19, 1993. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Act\"),1 notice is hereby given that on August 3, 1993, the Participants Trust Company (\"PTC\") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") the proposed rule change as described in Items 1, 11, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the self- regulatory organization. On August 16, 1993, PTC filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.2 The 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(bl(1). 2 Amendment No. 1 corrects Exhibit A, Text of the Proposed Rule Change, removing Section 1A of Article I1, Rule 2. Section 1A was the subject of a 1990 proposed rule change that PTC later withdiew. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29533 (August 7. 1991), 56 FR 40930 (withdrawing Continued Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change amends PTC Article Ill, Rule 2 regarding PTC's method of paying principal and interest (\"P&I\") to its participants. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change in ;t.- filing with the Commission, the self-reguialury organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change ano aiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item tV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the. Statutory Basis for, the Proposed -Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to modify the requirement that payments of P&I from PTC to participants and limited purpose participants be made by means of a credit to the applicable Cash Balance of the participant or limited purpose participant, to permit PTC to make such payments either by means of such credit or by intraday Fedwire transfer of immediately available funds, as FTC may determine from time to time. It is expected that after this rule change is effective, PTC will proceed with a pilot program to make fifty percent of P&I on GNMA I securities available to participants, at their option, on or about noon on P+1, the usual day for such P& disbursement. Each of PTC's participants holds its securities on deposit at PTC in one or more Master Accounts, each of which consists of one of more of the following processing subaccounts: Agency Account, Agency Segregation Account, Proprietary Account, Proprietary Segregation Account, Pledgee Account, and Limited Purpose Account. PTC maintains a cash balance for each Proprietary Account (including any associated Proprietary Segregation proposed Section 1A). Letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, Vice President, General Couasl. and Secretary, PTC. to Judith Poppalardo, Assistant Director. Division of Market Regulation. (ommission, dated August 13, 1993.Account), Agency Account, Agency Segregation Account, Pledgee Account, and Limited Purpose Account. PTC posts credits and debits to the Cash Balances intraday in connection with certain securities transactions and funds transfers processed through PTC, in accordance with PTC's Rules and Procedures. Cash Balances are settled at the end of the business day, when participants wire the amount of any Debit Balances to PTC's settlement account, after which PTC pays participants the amount of any end-of- day Credit Balances. PTC's Rules and Procedures currently provide that PTC disburse P&I on securities deposited at PTC by means of a credit to the participant's applicable Cash Balance, resulting in the participant's receipt of available funds in the amount of the P&I, net of any account debits and/or credits, at the end of the day. The proposed rule change will eliminate that requirement, permitting PTC to make payment of P&l either by intraday Fedwire transfer of immediately available funds or by means of a credit to the applicable Cash Balance, as PTC deems advisable from time to time. PTC disbursed a total of over $111 billion in P&I payments to its participants in 1992, of which approximately $104 billion constituted disbursement of P&I on GNMA I securities. The crediting of P&I to the Cash Balance defers the receipt of available funds by participants until completion of PTC's settlement cycle, at the end of the business day. The release of P&I funds to participants by Fedwire transfer will enable participants to receive those funds earlier in the day and to apply those funds elsewhere, as needed. Disbursement of immediately available funds during the business day may ease liquidity pressures on participants in other financial markets or in other settlement systems, thereby promoting smoother functioning of the financial markets in general. PTC anticipates that it may generally disburse a portion of the P&I intraday by Fedwire transfer of immediately available funds, with the balance being distributed by means of a credit to the applicable Cash Balance. The relative amounts of such disbursements will be determined over time, taking into account P&I collection and disbursement experience, the impact of intraday disbursement of P&I by Fedwire transfer on PTC's settlement cycle, and participant response. Initially, PTC intends to permit participants to elect to receive 50% of the P&I payment made with respect to GNMA I securities by means of anintraday Fedwire transfer of immediately available funds at approximately.12 noon, with the balance of the P&I payment distributed by means of a credit to the applicable Cash Balance for disbursement at end- of-day. These percentages and the ability of participants to select the method of payment may change with respect to the initial month or in subsequent months. The proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder because the prompt, release of P&I funds to participants upon disbursement facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and promotes the mechanism of a national clearance and settlement system. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition PTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others PTC has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on this proposed rule change. PTC has not received any unsolicited comments from participants or other interested parties. M. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

Petition for Exemption From the Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard; General Motors Corp. AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Grant of petition for exemption. SUMMARY: This document grants in full the petition by General Motors Corporation (GM) to exempt the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Aurora from the parts marking requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard. The petition is granted pursuant to 49 CFR part 543, Exemption from Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, for Model Year 1995 and beyond. The petition is granted because the agency has determined that the antitheft device to be placed on the car lines as standard equipment is likely to be as effective in deterring and reducing motor vehicle theft as compliance with parts marking requirements. DATES: The exemption granted by this notice is effective beginning with the 1995 Model Year. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Barbara A. Gray, Office of Market Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Ms. Gray's telephone number is (202) 366-1740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 21, 1993, the agency received a submission from General Motors Corporation (GM) requesting an exemption from the theft prevention standard for its Buick Riviera (Riviera) and Oldsmobile Aurora (Aurora) car lines, pursuant to 49 CFR part 543, Exemption From Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, for Model Year (MY) 1995 and beyond. GM did not request confidential treatment for any of the information provided in its petition. The information submitted by GM constitutes a complete petition, as required by 49 CFR 543.7, in that it meets the general requirements contained in \u00a7 543.5 and the specific content requirements of \u00a7 543.6. Accordingly, April 21, 1993 is the date on which the statutory 120 day period for processing GM's petition began. In its petition for the Riviera and Aurora car lines, GM requests an exemption from parts marking based on the inclusion of the \"PASS-Key II\" theft deterrent system as standard equipment for these car lines. GM noted that the \"PASS-Key II\" is a modification of the \"PASS-Key\" theft deterrent system. GM also noted that in August 1989 and on44872 Federal Register I Vol. 58. No. 163 / Wednesday, Augast 25, 1993 / Notices several occasions since, the agency has determined that the \"PASS-Key\" and \"PASS-Key 11\" systems, installed as standard equipment on various GM car lines, will likely be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the requirements of the theft prevention standard (see e.g., 54 FR 38655, August 15, 1989). In a February 7, 1992 letter to GM, the agency determined that the changes in \"PASS-ey II\" constituted a de minimis change in the \"PASS-Key\" system that was the basis for the agency's previous granting of a theft exemption for a car line that had, as standard equipment, the \"PASS-Key\" system. The \"PASS-Key 11\" theft deterrent system utilizes an ignition key, an ignition lock cylinder and a decoder module. When the proper key is inserted into the ignition lock cylinder. the decoder module recognizes the match, and permits the key to release the steering wheel and transmission shift lever locks. Before the vehicle can be started, the electrical resistance of a pellet embedded in the shank of the key must be sensed by elements in the lock cylinder and its value compared to a fixed resistance in the decoder module located in the instrument panel in the passenger compartment. If the key pellet has the proper resistance, the starter enable relay is eanegized and a discrete signal is transmitted to the engine control module. Recognition of the signal by the engine module allows fuel injector pulses to begin. If a key other than the one with proper resistance for that vehicle is inserted, the decoder module will shut down for a period of three minutes plus or minus 18 seconds. GM states that this period of time is controlled by a timer within the decoder module, and is not a programmable feature. Unlike \"PASS-Key.\" in \"PASS- Key I\" the timer for the decoder module does not reset to zero if further resistance comparisons are made while the decoder module is shut down. GM has stated that despite this difference, a similar level of performance will continue since the module, while shut down, will ignore any further attempts to start the vehicle by means of a key with an improper pellet resistance. GM claims that any process of trial and error using various keys with different resistance pellets, after the initial three minute shut down period, will result in the module shutting down again. The components are located in the passenger compartment behind the instrument panel with the exception of the starter solenoid/starter motor combination which is located in the engine compartment. GM states thatunlike many other theft deterrent systems, removing and subsequently reapplying vehicle power does not alter \"PASS-Key It\" performance. GM states that \"PASS-Key I\" is passive in that the system becomes fully functional once the ignition is turned off and the key is removed. No further operator action is required for activation. GM states that because \"PASS-Key II\" is fully operational once the engine has been turned off and the key removed, it has not provided specific visual or audio warnings, beyond the key warning buzzer, that unauthorized attempts have been made to enter or move the vehicles. However, the \"PASS-Key H\" system includes a starter interrupt function which, when activated, makes the vehicle inoperable. In order to draw attention to improper use of a key to start the vehicle, GM has installed a yellow \"Security\" light inside the passenger compartments of the Riviera and Aurora. This light is designed to activate if the proper key with a dirty or contaminated resistor pellet is used and the vehicle does not start. If this happens, it is necessary to clean the key and delay a further attempt to start the engine until the \"PASS-Key W' timer has run its course. The \"Security\" light is designed to illuminate also if a key with the proper mechanical but improper electrical code is used to try to start the vehicle. GM states that a premise for the , design of any theft deterrent system in its products has been that a failure in such a system would not affect a running vehicle. Although it may not be possible to restart a vehicle after such a failure, that failure would not stop an engine that has been started. That criterion has been met in \"PASS-Key IL\" Once an \"Engine Running\" signal has been identified by the engine controlmodule, a \"PASS-Key II\" failure will not cause the engine to stop. GM's analysis of the failure mode effects of the \"PASS-Key II\" system indicated that the component with the highest probability for failure was the ignition lock cylinder with its key, wiring, contacts, and rotational motion. A 52,500 cycle automated bench test of the key, ignition lock cylinder, wiring, and \"PASS-Key 11\" electronics module was conducted over a temperature range of approximately -40 degrees Fahrenheit to +212 degrees Fahrenheit. GM stated that each cycle consisted of inserting the key, rotating the cylinder to its \"Start\" position and then measuring the output from the electronics module to assure that the proper signals for the Starter Enable Relay and engine control module werepresent. The absence of eithersignal would terminate the test. GM states that the \"PASS-Key II\" decoder module has undergone other durability tests to ensure that the component meets or exceeds specified performance requirements over an equivalent of approximately 10 years of vehicle life. These other tests were: A power and temperature cycling test; high temperature endurance test; humidity test; moisture susceptibility test; and random vibration durability tests. As part of the validation process for the \"PASS-Key\" system, GM subjected the starter enable relay to testing to ensure component reliability. GM states that the same component is used in \"PASS-Key IF'. GM also states that during 203,705 miles of durability testing on preproduction MY 1995 Riviera and Aurora prototype and pilot vehicles equipped with \"PASS-Key IL\" there were no system failures. GM states that since \"PASS-Key H\" system failures have the potential to affect owner satisfaction, it will continue to carefully monitor warranty data and make any necessary changes to improve system reliability. Since the \"PASS-Key I\" system has been installed in GM vehicles as standard equipment only since the 1992 model year, GM states that directly relevant theft data are not yet available. GM asserts that since the \"PASS-Key ll\" system has been designed to provide the same kind of protection as the \"PASS- Key\" system, theft data for \"PASS-Key\" equipped vehicles can be used to form the basis for GM's belief that the \"PASS- Key II\" system will be effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft. The agency concurs that the data for \"PASS-Key\" equipped vehicles are probative of the likelihood of success of the \"PASS-Key Il\" system in reducing and deterring vehicle theft. To substantiate its statements on the \"PASS-Key\" antitheft system's effectiveness. GM provided data on Buick Riviera. Oldsmobile Toronado. Cadillac DeVille/Fleetwood and Cadillac Eldorado car line theft rates for MYs 1986 through 1990. \"PASS-Key\" was made standard on each of these four car lines beginning with MY 1990. The data provided by GM is reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center (NCIC), which is NHTSA's official source of theft data (See 50 FR 46666, November 12, 1985). The NCIC receives reports on all theft. The NCIC data reported by GM showed that the Riviera, Toronado. DeVille, and Eldorado theft rates (per thousand vehicles) by Model Year were:44873 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices For 1986, 3 99 for the Riviera, 2.25 for the Toronado, 7.11 for the DeVille, and 2.27 for the Eldorado; for 1987, 6.37 for the Riviera, 6.30 for the Toronado, 6.16 for the DeVille, and 3.90 for the Eldorado; for 1988, 6,15 for the Riviera, 5.58 for the Toronado, 7.91 for the DeVille, and 3.16 for the Eldorado; for 1989, 2.16 for the Riviera, 3.33 for the Toronado, 5.57 for the DeVille, and 2.35 for the Eldorado; and for 1990, 1.32 for the Riviera, 2.62 for the Toronado, 3.81 for the DeVille, and 2.48 for the Eldorado. GM stated a belief, based on the decreases in theft of the above four car lines during the 1990 model year, which occurred with the implementation of the \"PASS-Key\" as standard equipment, that the \"PASS-Key\" system is\"extremely effective in deterring motor vehicle theft.\" GM stated that based on the performance of \"PASS-Key\" on other models and its similarity of design and functionality to the \"PASS-Key II\" system, it believes that \"PASS-Key II\" will be at least as effective as the first generation \"PASS-Key\" system. NHTSA believes that there is substantial evidence indicating that the antitheft system to be installed as standard equipment on the Riviera and Aurora lines will likely be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the requirements of the theft prevention standard (49CFR part 541). This determination is based on the information GM submitted with its petition and on other available information. The agency believes that the device will provide all but one of the types of performance listed in \u00a7 543.6(a)(3); promoting activation; preventing defeat or circumventing of the device by unauthorized persons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability and durability of the device. The single exception is that the device lacks an alarm which would attract attention to unauthorized. entries. As required by section 605(b) of the statute and 49 CFR 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that GM has provided adequate reasons for its belief that the antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information GM provided on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by GM for the antitheft system and its components. GM pi'esented extensive data on the life cycle test results of the \"PASS-Key\" ignition lock system, and durability testing of prototype MY 95 Rivieras and Auroras equipped with \"PASS-Key II.\"The decision to grant this exemption is consistent with earlier agency ,exemption decisions. As the petitioner noted, the \"PASS-Key\" ignition lock system has been the basis of the agency's exempting, in part, several high theft GM car lines from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. The following GM car lines have the \"PASS- Key\" system as standard equipment, and have been exempted in part from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541: the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, beginning with MY 1990 (see 54 FR 3365, August 15, 1989); the Cadillac DeVille/Fleetwood and Oldsmobile 98, beginning with MY 1991 (see 55 FR 17854, April 27, 1990); and the Pontiac Bonneville and Buick Park Avenue, beginning with MY 1992 (see 56 FR 14413, April 9, 1991). NHTSA has also granted exemptions in part for the following GM car lines that have \"PASS-Key II\" as standard equipment: the Oldsmobile 88 Royale and Buick LeSabre, beginning with MY 1993 (see 57 FR 10517, March 26, 1992) and the Cadillac Eldorado and Cadillac Seville, beginning with MY 1994 (see 58 FR 11659, February 26, 1993). The agency had granted partial, rather than full, exemptions for the car lines listed above because neither the \"PASS- Key\" nor \"PASS-Key II\" antitheft systems include an audio or visual alarm system. As such, the GM systems lack, as standard equipment, an important feature that the agency has defined in its rulemaking on part 543 as one of several desirable attributes which contribute to the effectiveness of an antitheft system: Automatic activation of the device; an audible or visual signal that is connected to the hood, doors, and trunk and draws attention to vehicle tampering; and a disabling mechanism designed to prevent a thief from moving a vehicle under its own power without a key. Theft data experience for car lines incorporating \"PASS-Key\" have not shown that the lack of an audio and visual alarm has prevented the antitheft device from being effective. Since the introduction of \"PASS-Key\" in MY 1989, two years of theft data that assess the effectiveness of \"PASS-Key\" and \"PASS-Key II\" have been collected. The agency believes the data show that over time, despite the absence of the audio and visual alarm systems, \"PASS-Key\" and \"PASS-Key II,\" when placed on car lines as standard equipment, continue to be likely to be as effective in deterring and reducing motor vehicle theft as compliance with parts marking requirements. The agency arrived at this conclusion by examining theft data provided inGM's petition, and independently examining theft data for other car lines with \"PASS-Key\" as standard equipment. The data provided in GM's petition show a reduction in theft rates after placement of \"PASS-Key.\" In addition, the agency examined three years of data for the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro lines and found consistent reductions in theft rates. \"PASS-Key\" has been standard equipment on these two lines since MY 1989. For MY 1989, the Firebird's theft rate was 8.98 (per thousand vehicles), and the Camaro's theft rate'Was 8.68. By MY 1991 (based on preliminary theft data), the Firebird's theft rate was 6.36 and the Camaro's theft rate was 7.80. It appears that a 29 percent reduction in theft rates for the Firebird and a 12 percent reduction for the Camaro have been experienced. For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the MY 1995 Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Aurora car lines in full from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. If the \"PASS-Key II\" is placed as standard equipment on the two car lines, GM would not be required to mark any of the major parts of these lines. If GM decides not to use the exemptions for the MY 1995 Riviera and Aurora car lines, it should formally notify the agency. If such a decision is made, these car lines must be fully marked according to the requirements under 49 CFR 541.5 and 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts). NHTSA notes that if GM wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may have to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Section 543.7(d) states that a part 543 exemption applies only to vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption is based. Further, \u00a7 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions \"(t)o modify an exemption to permit the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in the exemption.\" The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which \u00a7 543.9(c) could place on exempted vehicle manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting part 543 to require the submission of a modification petition for every change in the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes could be de minimis. Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if GM contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be characterized as de minimis, then the company should44874 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices consuli the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to modify.

[FR Doc. 93-20499 Filed 8-24-93; 8:45 aml BILUNG CODE 4910-6-a UNITED STATES ENRICHMENT CORPORATION National Environmental Policy Act Procedure. AGENCY: United States Enrichment Corporation. ACTION: Notice of proposed National Environmental Policy Act procedure with request for comments. SUMMARY: The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) proposes to adopt a procedure for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The USEC has undertaken the uranium enrichment enterprise formerly conducted by the Department of Energy (DOE), effective July 1, 1993, pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The USEC proposes to adopt a procedure for implementing NEPA that is closely patterned on DOE's NEPA Implementing Procedures, with some modifications to reflect USEC's specific mission of operating the enterprise as a business enterprise on a profitable basis and eventually privatizing the enterprise. USEC proposes to voluntarily comply with NEPA as a reflection of the Corporation's commitment to environmental protection. Accordingly, USEC is proposing a NEPA procedure to incorporate analysis of environmental impacts into USEC's decisionmaking on proposals and is soliciting public comment on the proposed procedure. In addition, USEC is requesting that the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) review the proposed procedure for conformity with NEPA and CEQ's NEPA regulations. DATES: Written comments on the proposed procedure should be submitted on or before September 9, 1993. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the proposed procedure should be submitted to Robert J. Moore, General Counsel, United States Enrichment Corporation, 2300 M Street NW., 5th floor, Washington, DC 20037; or may be hand-delivered to the same address on business days between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Moore, General Counsel at (202) 835-7610, or Charles Martin, Environmental Compliance, at (202) 835-7646. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The United'States Enrichment Corporation was created by title IX of the Energy Policy Act, Public Law 102- 486 (42 U.S.C. 2297 et seq.). USEC was created to take over the uranium enrichment enterprise from DOE on July 1, 1993. 42 U.S.C. 2297b-14. Congress created USEC to operate the uranium enrichment enterprise \"as a business enterprise on a profitable and efficient basis\" and to \"maximize the long-term value of the Corporation to the Treasury of the United States.\" 42 U.S.C. 2297a (1) and (2). In addition, USEC is directed to develop a plan for the privatization of the uranium enrichment enterprise by transferring ownership of the Corporation to private investors. 42 U.S.C. 2297d. Congress also directed USEC \"Itlo continue at all times to meet the objectives of ensuring the Nation's common defense and security[,]\" [tlo help maintain a reliable and economical domestic source of uranium enrichment services[,]\" and \"Itlo comply with laws, and regulations promulgated thereunder, to protect.., the environment.\" 42 U.S.C. 2297a (8), (9), and (10). USEC is intended by Congress to operate as a profit-making corporation engaged in providing uranium enrichment services in a highly competitive worldwide market. Moreover, USEC is to function as an integral link between the former operation of this enterprise by a federal government agency and the future operation as a fully private corporation. NEPA applies to federal government agencies and does not directly impose requirements on private corporations. As a corporation which is eventually to be privatized, USEC is not a federal agency subject to NEPA. Nonetheless, USEC intends to conduct all its operations as a responsible corporate citizen, committed to maintaining a clean, safe and healthful environment. To help achieve that eiid USEC proposes, as a matter of voluntary corporate policy, to comply with the letter and spirit of NEPA and to incorporate NEPA procedures into corporate decisionmaking. Thus, USEC will ensure that potential environmental impacts are assessed before major proposals are adopted, that feasible alternatives are analyzed on the basis ofenvironmental impacts, and that mitigation measures are employed when appropriate. Also, USEC intends to incorporate NEPA's directives to involve federal agencies, state agencies, and the public in USEC'% decisionmaking process with respect to the environment, to the extent consistent with the legislation creating USEC. II. Purpose The purpose of the proposed NEPA procedure is to implement USEC's policy of voluntary compliance with NEPA and to provide guidance and a mechanism for incorporating NEPA into USEC's decisionmaking and day-to-day operations. Because the uranium enrichment enterprise was transferred by an Act of Congress from USEC to DOE, the proposed NEPA procedure is modeled on DOE's NEPA Implementing Procedures, 10 CFR part 1021. However, USEC's proposed NEPA procedure is also tailored to reflect the fact that DOE's mission is much broader than the uranium enrichment enterprise that was transferred to USEC and that USEC is directed to operate that enterprise \"as a business enterprise on a profitable and efficient basis.\" 42 U.S.C. 2297a(1). The proposed procedure is intended to implement USEC's voluntary decision to comply with NEPA to the - same extent as a federal government agency by:e Requiring the preparation and circulation of draft and final environmental impact statements (EISs) on proposals significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and that would be \"major federal actions\" if undertaken by DOE, for example, or another federal agency e Requiring the preparation of environmental assessments (EAs) to determine whether a proposed action would require the preparation of an EIS under the standard of section 102(2)(C) of NEPA. o Requiring the preparation of records of decision (RODs) and findings of no significant impact (FONSIs) to reflect the incorporation of EISs and EAs into USEC decisionmaking. Providing the public and federal and state agencies with access to information and an opportunity to provide meaningful comment on USEC proposals and the potential environmental impacts of such proposals. o Requiring compliance with the CEQ NEPA Regulations. In addition, USEC is voluniarily submitting this proposed procedure for review by CEQ for conformity with NEPA and the CEQ NEPA regulations44875 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 /.Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices (40 CFR 1507.3(a)). The proposed NEPA procedure will be adopted by USEC only after the opportunity for public comment offered by this notice and review by CEQ. This proposed procedure was developed in consultation with CEQ in accordance with the procedure set forth in the CEQ NEPA Regulations. 40 CFR 1507.3(a). USEC proposes to adopt a NEPA\"procedure,\" and not formal regulations, as permitted by the CEQ regulations. Id. Ill. Environmental Review The proposed procedure is modeled on existing DOE NEPA Implementing Procedures which applied to DOE's operation of the uranium enrichment enterprise before its transition to USEC on July 1, 1993. Its purpose is primarily to tailor DOE's department-wide NEPA procedure to USEC's specific operation of the uranium enrichment enterprise as a business enterprise on a profitable basis without substantially changing the effect of that operation on the environment. Thus, this proposed procedure is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning cfNEPA. IV. Review Under Executive Grder 12291 The proposed procedure implements the Corporation's NEPA policy and does not constitute proposed rulemaking. This proposal is not a \"rule\" or\"regulation\" within the meaning of Executive Order 12291., and no analysis thereunder is required. In any event, the proposed procedure would not be a\"major rule\" because it: (1) Does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) does not result in a major increase in the cost of financial institution operations or governmental supervision; and (3) does not have a significant adverse effect on competition (foreign or domestic), employment, investment, productivity or innovation within the meaning of E.O. 12291. Moreover, the proposed procedure would substantially adopt DOE's existing NEPA Implementation Procedures as they relate to the uranium enrichment enterprise formerly operated by DOE. Thus USEC's proposed NEPA procedure should have no incrementally greater impact on procurement, financial assistance, joint ventures, or marketing, which are the areas where any potential economic impact might be anticipated. Therefore, USEC has determined that the incremental impact, if any, of today's proposed procedure, if finalized, would not have effects on theeconomy of sufficient magnitude to bring the proposed procedure within the definition of a \"major rule.\" V. Regulatory Flexibility Act USEC is proposing to adopt a procedure for implementing the Corporation's NEPA policy, and is not proposing rulemaking. Accordingly, this proposal is not a \"rule\" within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2), and no regulatory flexibility analysis is required. In any event, the proposed procedure is closely patterned on DOE's NEPA Implementation Procedures which governed the uranium enrichment enterprise before July 1, 1993 and makes no substantive changes to requirements for any applicants for permits or licenses, or financial assistance, customers, or bidders for contracts, as related to NEPA compliance. VI. Review Under Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612 requires that policies be reviewed for Federalism effects on the institutional interest of state and local governments, and if the effects are sufficiently substantial and direct, that a Federalism assessment be prepared to assist senior policymakers. The proposed NEPA procedure will not have any substantial and direct effect on state and local governments within the meaning of the Executive Order. The final procedure will affect USEC's NEPA policy, which is not subject to state regulation. V 1.

Timbers, Jr., Transition Manager. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, USEC proposes to adopt the following NEPA procedure: United States Enrichment Corporation Policy For Adherence to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Table Of Contents Sec. 1.0 General 1.1 Purpose 1.2 Policy 1.3 Applicability 1.4 Definitions 1.5 Oversight of USEC NEPA Activities 2.0 USEC Planning and Decisionmaking 2.1 U)SEC Planning 2.2 IJSEC Decisionmaking 2.3 Interim Actions: Limitations on Actions During the NEPA Process2.4 Procurement, Financial Assistance. and Joint Ventures 3 0 Policy Implementation 3.1 General Requirements 3.2 Agency Review and Public Participation 3.3 Environmental Impact Statements 3.4 Environmental Assessments 3.5 Programmatic NEPA Documents 3.6 Mitigation Action Plans 3.7 Classified, Confidential, and Otherwise Exempt Information 3.8 Coordination with Other Environmental Review Requirements 3.9 Interagency Cooperation 3.10 Variances 4.0 Typical Classes Of Actions 4.1 Level of NEPA Review 4.2 Categorical Exclusion Requirements -4.3 Environmental Assessments (Actions Normally Requiring an EA) 4.4 Environmental Impact Statements (Actions Normally Requiring-an EIS) Appendix A: Environmental Effects Of USEC Actions Abroad; Effects On The Global Commons 1.0 General 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this document is to establish the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) policy for integration of environmental considerations into USEC planning and decisionmaking. It also establishes the criteria for determining USEC actions that are categorically excluded from requirements to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Applicable categorical exclusions (CX) are listed in section 4.2 of this policy. This USEC policy complies with and supplements the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations published at 40 CFR 1500- 1508. The CEQ regulations address the requirements for compliance with the procedural provisions of section 102(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)). 1.2 Policy It is USEC policy to comply with the letter and spirit of NEPA; adhere to CEQ regulations; and apply the NEPA process early in the planning stages for USEC proposals. In doing so, USEC will endeavor to ensure that wise use of the human environment is incorporated into its actions. The USEC will also endeavor to minimize the adverse impact of its actions on the human environment. This will be accomplished by identifying the significant .environmental impacts of USEC proposed programs and projects as early in the decisionmaking process as is practicable, and integrating those considerations throughout the planning and, ultimately, implementation of the proposed program and projects. The44876 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices objective is to ensure, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act and CEQ regulations, that environmental effects will be considered along with technical, economic and other factors in USEC decisionmaking processes. USEC will endeavor to ensure that the NEPA process parallels the decisionmaking process on major programs and proposals likely to have a significant effect on the human environment. USEC will integrate NEPA requirements with planning and environmental reviews required by law. USEC will accomplish this integration in a concurrent rather than consecutive manner. NEPA compliance is required for applicable USEC actions itnless existing law applicable to a specific action or activity prohibits, exempts or makes compliance impossible. USEC will endeavor to ensure that the alternatives considered in the decisionmaking process are within the range of alternatives considered in the relevant environmental documents and analyses. USEC policy will be to adhere to Executive Order 12114 and to incorporate into its environmental analyses, consideration of actions that may significantly affect the global commons, environments of other nations or ecological resources of global importance. Where consistent with national security requirements and United States foreign policy, an environmental planning and evaluation process as outlined in Appendix A of this policy will be implemented for proposed USEC actions that would .significantly affect those aspects of the worldwide environment. 1.3 Applicability 1.3.1 This section applies to all organizational elements of USEC. 1.3.2 This section applies to any USEC action affecting the quality of the human environment of the United States, its territories or possessions.

Section 2.3 of this USEC NEPA policy specifies how the NEPA process will be integrated with decision points for certain types of proposals (40 CFR 1505.1(b)).2.2.2 The objectives of USEC's NEPA process is to ensure that: (1) Planning and decisionmaking is accomplished such that the USEC decisionmaker is aware of the environmental consequences associated with implementation of the proposed action and is thus able to make an informed decision; (2) the policies and goals outlined in section 1.2 are implemented; and (3) delays and conflicts later in the process are minimized. 2.2.3 USEC shall complete its NEPA evaluations and analyses of a proposal under consideration before making a decision on the proposal except as provided in sections 2.3 and 2.4 of this policy (40 CFR 1506.1). 2.2A USEC will utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that ensures the integrated use of the natural and social sciences, planning and the environmental design arts in ensuring that all USEC decisionmaking that may impact the human environment achieves the policies and goals outlined in section 1.2 of this policy (Pub. L 91- 190; section 10212][A)). 2.2.5 It is USEC's intent that environmental effects and values of a proposed action be considered in sufficient detail along with other non- environmental analyses of the action (such as economic, engineering, and technical benefit:cost analyses) at the earliest possible time in the decision process. 2.2.6 During the decisionmaking process for each USEC proposal, USEC shall consider the relevant NEPA analyses and documentation, public and agency comments (if any) on those analyses and documents, and USEC responses to those comments, as part of its consideration of the proposal (40 CFR 1505.1(d)) and shall include such documents, comments, and responses as part of the administrative record (40 CFR 1505.1(c)). 2.2.7 If an EIS or EA is prepared for a USEC proposal, USEC shall consider the alternatives analyzed in that EIS or EA before rendering a decision on that proposal; the decision on the proposal shall be within the range of alternatives analyzed in the EA or EIS (40 CFR .1505.1(e)). USEC NEPA analyses documented in an EA or EIS shall highlight the preferred alternative as well as the other alternatives considered, and will outline the mitigation measures needed to reduce the significant environmental impacts of the preferred alternative. 2.2.8 When USEC uses a broad decision (such as one on a policy or program) as a basis for a subsequent narrower decision (such as one on a44878 FFederal Re-gister / Vol. 58., No; 163 /, Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices project or other site-specific proposal), USEC may use tiering (40 CFR 1502.20) and incorporation of material by reference (40 CFR 1502.21), in the NEPA review, for the subsequent narrower proposal. 2.3 Interim Actions: Limitations On Actions Miring The NEPA Process While USEC is preparing an EIS under section 3.0.of this policy, USEC shal take noaction concerning the proposal that is the subject of the EIS before issuing a ROD, except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1. Actions that are covered by, or are a part of, a USEC proposal for which an EIS is being prepared shall not be categorically excluded under section 4.0 unless they qualify as interim actions under 40 CFR 1506.1. 2.4' Procurement, Financial Assistance, And Joint Ventures 2.4.1 This section-applies to USEC competitive amd limited-source procurements, to awards of financial assistance by a competitive process, and to joint ventures entered into as a result of competitive solicitations, unless the action is categorically excluded from preparation of an EA or EIS under section 4.0 of this policy. Subsections 2.4.2, 2.4.3,,and 2.4.4 of this section apply as well to USEC sole-source procurements of sites, systems, or processes, to noncompetitive awards of financial. assistance, and to sole-source joint ventures, unless the action is categorically excluded from preparation of an EA or EIS under section 4.0. 2.4.2 USEC may require that offerors submit environmental data and analyses as a discrete part of the offeror's proposal (40 CFR 1506.5(a)). USEC shall specify in its solicitation document the type of information and level of detail for environmental data and analyses so required. 2.4.3 USEC shall independently evaluate and review the environmental data and analyses submitted by offerors, and will approve that information. USEC may utilize that information in USEC NEPA documents, either directly or by reference (40 CFR 1506.5(a)). 2.4.4 If an EA or ES is required, USEC shall prepare, consider and publish the EA or EIS in conformance with sections 3.3 and- 3.4 of this policy before taking any action pursuant to the award of a contract for financial assistance (except as provided at 40 CFR. 1506.1. and subsection 2.3 of these requirements), If the NEPA process is not completed before the award of the contract, financial assistance, or joint venture, then the contract, financial assistance, or joint venture shall becontingent on completion of the-NEPA process (except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1. and Subsection 2.3 of work the to be-completed in ad vance.of a go/no-go decision. 3.0 Policy Implementation, 3.1 General Requirements 3.1.1 USEC shall determine, under the procedures, in the CEQ Regulations and this Section of USEC policy, whether any USEC proposal has a significant impact on-the human environment by: (a) Preparation of an EIS; b) Preparation of an EA; or (c) Determination that the proposed action is categorically excluded from preparation of either-an EIS or an EA. USEC shall prepare any pertinent documents as required by NEPA, the CEQ Regulations, or this section of USEC policy. 3.1.2 USEC may prepare a NEPA analysis and documentation for any USECaction at any time in order to further the purposes of NEPA. This may be done to analyze the consequences of ongoing activities, support USEC planning, assess the need for mitigation, fully disclose the potential environmental consequences of USEC actions, or for any other reason. Documents prepared under this paragraph shall be prepared in the same manner as USEC documents prepared under Subsection 3.1.1 of this policy. When EAs and'EISs are undertaken,.the economic and social impact considerations will be incorporated into the analyses of environmental impacts. Economic abnd social impacts by themselves, in the absence of physical environmental impacts shall not,, however,,determine whether or not to prepare an EA or an EIS. 3.2 Agoncy Review And Public Participation 3.2.1 USEC shall make its NEPA documents available-to Federal agencies, states, local governments, American Indian tribes, interested groups, and the general public, in accordance with.40 CFR 1506.6. 3 2.2 Wherever feasible, USEC NEPA documents shall explain technical or sciehtific terms or measurements using terms familiar to the general public, in accordance with, 40 CFR 1502.8, 3.23 USEC shall notify the host state and host tribe of a USEC determination- to prepare anEA orEIS for a USEC proposal, and may notify any other state or American Indian tribe)that, in USEC's judgment, may be affected-by the proposal. 3.2.4 USEC may, at its discretion, adopt an agency's EIS, EA, or portions thereof,' if such documents encompass the proposed USEC action. 3.3 Environmental Impact'Statements USEC shall prepare and circulate EISs and related RODs in apcordance with the requirements- of the CEQ Regulations, as supplemented by this subsection of USEC policy. USEC may prepare an US on any USEC action at any time to assist USEC planning and decisionmaking; 33,1 Notice of intent and scoping. USEC shall publish a Notice of Intent (NOI.in the Federal Register and conduct the EIS scoping process in accordance with. 40 CFR 1501.7. Publication of the NOI in the Federal Register initiates the scoping process wherein USEC provides the public; Federal agencies, state, regional and local agencies, public interest groups and other interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed action early in the process and to affect the scope of the EIS. The NOI shall contain the elements specified in 40 CFR 1508.22 and will be published as soon as practicable after a decision is made to prepare an EIS except as provided at 40 CFR 1507.3(e). However, if there will be a lengthy period of time between its decision to prepare an EIS and the time of actual preparation, USEC may defer publication of the NOI until a reasonable time before preparing the EIS, provided that USEC allows a reasonable opportunity for interested parties to participate in the EIS process. Through the NOI, USEC shall invite comments and suggestions on the scope of the EIS. USEC shall disseminate the NOI in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6. 3.3.2 Publication of the NOI in the Federal Register shall begin the public scoping process. The public scoping process for a USEC EIS shall allow a minimum of 30 days for the receipt of public comments. 3.3.3 Except as provided in subsection 3.3.11 of this section, USEC may hold a public scoping meeting(s) as part of the public sioping process for a USEC EIS. USEC shall announce the location, date, and time of public scoping meetings in the NOI or by other appropriate means, such as.additional notices in the Federal Register, news releases to the local media, or letters to affected parties. If utilized by USEC, public scoping meetings shall not be held until at least 15 days after public notification. Should USEC change the location, date, or time of a public scoping meeting, or schedule additional44879. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices public scoping meetings, USEC shall publicize these changes in the Federal Register or in other ways as appropriate. USEC may also utilize other means of affording the public, Federal agencies, state, regional and local agencies and other interested parties the opportunity to comment during the scoping period. These other means may include measures such as notices and news releases in local media: direct letters to and contacts with affected parties; provision of copies of the NOI and other pertinent materials in reading rooms at USEC facilities and at public facilities such as libraries; and mail surveys within areas or regions affected by the proposed action. 3.3.4 In determining the scope of the EIS, USEC shall consider all comments received during the announced comment period held as part of the public scoping process. USEC may also consider comments received after the close of the announced comment period. 3.3.5 Public Review of Environmental Impact Statements. The public review and comment period on a USEC draft EIS shall be no less than 45 days (40 CFR 1506.10(c)). USEC may extend the period as provided in 40 CFR 1506.10(d) and/or 40 CFR 1507.3(d). Requests for extension of the comment period beyond 45 days will be evaluated. Requests may be granted as noted in 40 CFR 1502.19(d). Failure to file timely comments will not be a sufficient reason for an extension (40 CFR 1506.10(d)). The public comment period begins when EPA publishes a Notice of Availability of the document in the Federal Register. The host state and, as appropriate, adjacent state(s) will be provided copies of -the draft EIS. 3.3.6 USEC may hold a public meeting(s) on USEC draft EISs. Such public meetings shall be announced at least 15 days in advance. The announcement shall identify the subject of the draft EIS and include the location, date, and time of the public hearings. 3.3.7 Final Environmental Impact Statements. USEC shall prepare a final EIS following the public comment period and any public meetings on the draft EIS. The final EIS shall respond to oral and/or written comments received during public review of the draft EIS, as provided at 40 CFR 1503.4. Availability of the final EIS will be provided through an EPA Notice of Availability published in the Federal Register. 3.3.8 USEC shall use appropriate means to publicize the availability of draft and final EISs and the time and place for any public meetings on a draft EIS. The methods chosen should focus on reaching persons who may beinterested in or affected by the proposal and may include the methods listed in 40 CFR 1506.6(b)(3). The host state, affected American Indian tribes, and, as appropriate, the adjacent state(s) will be provided copies of the final EIS. 3.3.9 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statements. USEC shall prepare a supplemental EIS if there are substantial changes to the proposal or significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns, as discussed in 40 CFR 1502.9(c)(1). 3.3.10 USEC may supplement a draft EIS or final EIS at any time, to further the purposes of NEPA, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.9(c)(2). 3.3.11 USEC shall prepare, circulate, and file a supplement to a draft or final EIS in the same manner as any other draft and final EISs, except that scoping is optional for a supplement (40 CFR 1503.9(c)(4)). If USEC initiates a public scoping process for a supplement, the provisions of subsections 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 of this policy shall apply. If USEC decides to take action on a proposal covered by a supplemental EIS, USEC shall prepare a ROD in accordance with the provisions of subsection 3.7 of this section. 3.3.12 When applicable, USEC will incorporate an EIS supplement into any related formal administrative record on the action that is the subject of the EIS supplement or determination (40 CFR 1502.9(c)(3)). 3.3.13 Records of Decision. No decision may be made on a proposal covered by an EIS during a 30-day\"waiting period\" following completion of the final EIS, except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1 and 1506.10(b) and subsection 2.3 of these requirements. The 30-day period starts when the EPA Notice of Availability for the final EIS is published in the Federal Register. 3.3.14 If USEC decides to take action on a proposal covered by an EIS, a ROD shall be prepared as provided at 40 CFR 1505.2 (except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1 and subsection 2.3). No action shall be taken until the decision has been made public. 3.3.15 USEC RODs shall be published in the Federal Register and made available to the public as specified in 40 CFR 1506.6, except as provided in 40 CFR 1507.3(c) and subsection 3.7. 3.3.16 USEC may revise a ROD at any time, so long as the revised decision is adequately supported by an existing EIS. A revised ROD is subject to the provisions of subsections 3.7.2 and 3.7.3 of this section.3.4 Environmental Assessments USEC shall prepare and circulate EAs and related FONSIs in accordance with the requirements of the CEQ Regulations, as supplemented by this subsection of USEC policy. 3.4.1 Requirements for Environmental Assessments. As required by 40 CFR 1501.4(b), USEC shall prepare an EA for a proposed USEC action that is described in the classes of actions listed in section 4.3 of these procedures, and for a proposed USEC action that is not described in any of the classes of actions listed in section 4.0. An EA is not required, however, if USEC has decided to prepare an EIS. USEC may prepare an EA on any action at any time in order to assist USEC planning and decisionmaking. 3.4.2 Purposes. A USEC EA shall serve the purposes identified in 40 CFR 1508.9(a), which include providing sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or to issue a FONSI. 3.4.3 Content. A USEC EA shall comply with the requirements of subsection 3.4.4 of this policy and of those found at 40 CFR 1508.9. In addition to any other alternatives, USEC shall assess the no action alternative in an EA, even when the proposed action is specifically required by legislation or a court order. 3.4.4 Format. An EA is a concise analytical document prepared to determine the extent of potential environmental impacts of a project and decide whether or not those impacts are significant. The EA will incorporate by reference any baseline environmental documents, limiting descriptions and evaluations relevant to the environmental resources affected by the proposed action. An EA should consist of the following sections: 1. Purpose and need for action 2. Description of the proposed action and alternatives (including no-action) 3. Description of the affected environment 4. Environmental consequences of the proposed action and alternatives 5. Summary 6. List of agencies and/or individuals contacted 7. List of preparers 8. Appendices as necessary to support the EA. 3.4.5 Public Participation. Public scoping is not required for EA preparation, however, depending on the scope of the project and the potential environmental impacts of the proposed action, public scoping may be warranted. The scoping process44880 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August. 25, 1993 / Notices (Subsections 3.3.1 through 3.3.4. and 40 CFR 1501.7), if deemed necessary. should begin early in the EA preparation process to provide timely and pertinent public input which would be useful if a decision is reached'to prepare an EIS. 3.4.6 Distribution. Copies of the EA and FONS! will be provided to the host state, affected American Indian tribes. and, as appropriate, adjacent states. 3.4.7 Findings of No Significant Impact. USEC shall prepare a FONSI only if the related EA supports the finding that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the human environment. If a required USEC EA does not support a FONSI, USEC shall prepare an EIS and issue a ROD before taking action on the proposal addressed by the EA, except as permitted under 40 CFR 1506.1 and subsection 2.3 of this policy. 3.4.8 In addition to the requirements found at 40 CFR 1508.13, a USEC FONSI shall include the following: (a) A summary of the supporting EA. including a brief description of the proposed action and alternatives considered in the EA, environmental factors considered, and projected impacts; (b) Any commitments to mitigations that are essential to render the impacts of the proposed action not significant, beyond those mitigations that are integral elements of the proposed action, and a reference to the Mitigation Action Plan prepared under subsection 3.6 of this section; (c) The date of issuance; and (d) The signature of the USEC approving official. 34.9- USEC shall make FONSIs available to the public as provided at subsection 3.4.6, and 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(1) and 1506.6; USEC shall also make copies available for inspection in the appropriate USEC public reading room(s) or other appropriate location(s) [or a reasonable time. 3.4.10 In certain circumstances, WSEC shall issue a proposed FONSI for a public review and comment period of 30 days (except as provided for at 40 CFR 1507.3(d)), before making-a final determination on the FONSI. These circumstances are addressed at 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2) as supplementedby section 4.4 of these procedures. USEC may issue a proposed FONSI for public review and comment in other situations as well. 3.4.11 Upon issuance of the FONSI, USEC may proceed with the proposed action subject to any mitigation commitments expressed'in theFONSI, or as appropriate, the Mitigation Action Plan.34.12 USEC may revise a-FONSI at any time, so long as.the revision is supported by an existing EA. A revised FONSI is subject to all provisions of subsections 3.4.7 through 3.4.11 of this ;olicy. 3.5 Programmatic NEPA Documents 3.5.1 When required to support a USEC programmatic decision (40 CFR 1508.18((b)(3)), USEC shall EIS or EA CFR 1502.4). USEC may also prepare a programmatic EIS or EA at any time to further the purposes of NEPA. 3.5.2 A USEC programmatic NEPA document shall be prepared, issued, and circulated in accordance with the requirements for any other NEPA document, as established by the CEQ Regulations and this USEC policy. 3.5.3 USEC shall evaluate programmatic EISs prepared under this subsection at least every five years. USEC shall determine whether to prepare a new programmatic EIS or supplement the existing EIS, as appropriate. 3.5.4 USEC shall evaluate programmatic EAs at least every five years to determine whether the existing programmatic EA remains adequate, whether to prepare a new programmatic EA, revise the FONSI, or prepare a programmatic EIS,'as appropriate. 3.6 Mitigation Action Plans 3.6.1 Following completion of each EIS and its associated ROD, USEC shall prepare a Mitigation Action Plan that addresses mitigation commitments expressed in the ROD. If no mitigation commitments are made in the ROD, a MAP is not required. The Mitigation Action Plan shall be made available to the public and shall explain how the corresponding mitigation measures, designed to mitigate adverse environmental impacts associated with the course of action directed by the ROD, will be planned and implemented. The Mitigation Action Plan shall be prepared before USEC takes any action directed by the ROD that is the subject of a mitigatipn commitment. 3.6.2 For EAs, under certain circumstances as specified in subsection 3.4.8 of this policy, USEC shall also prepare a Mitigation Action Plan for commitments to mitigations that are essential to render the impacts of the proposedaction not significant. If such commitments are not necessary, a MAP is not required. The Mitigation Action Plan shall address all commitments to such necessary mitigations andexplain how mitigation will'be planned and implemented. The Mitigation Action Plan shall beprepared before the FONSIis issued and shall be referenced therein. 3.6.3 Each Mitigation Action Plan shall be as complete as possible, commensurate with the information available regarding the course of action either directed by the ROD or the action to be covered by the FONSI,.as appropriate. USEC may revise the Plan as more specific and detailed information becomes available. 3.6.4 USEC shall make copies of the Mitigation Action Plans available for inspection at the appropriate USEC site(s) or other appropriate location(s) for a reasonable time. Copies of the Mitigation Action Plans shall also be available upon written request to the point of contact noted in subsection 1.6. 3.7 Classified Confidential, and Otherwise Exempt Information 3.7.1 USEC shall not disclose classified, confidential, or other information that USEC otherwise would not disclose pursuant to title IX of the Energy Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 2297b-13) (Control of Information) or other applicable statutes, except as provided by 40 CFR 1506.6(f). 3.7.2 To the fullest extent possible. USEC shall segregate any information that is exempt from disclosure requirements into an appendix as provided for at 40 CFR 1507.3(c), to allow public review of the remainder of a NEPA document. 3.8 Coordination With Other Environmental Review Requirements 3.8.1 In accordance with 40 CFR 1500.4(k) and (o), 1502.25, and 1506.4. USEC shall integrate the NEPA process and coordinate NEPA compliance with other environmental review requirements to the fullest extent possible. 3.8.2 To the extent possible, USEC shall determine the applicability of other environmental requirements early in the planning process, in consultation with Federal agencies when necessary or appropriate, to ensure compliance and to avoid delays, and shall incorporate any relevant requirements as early in the NEPA process as possible. 3.8.3 USEC will integrate its NEPA requirements for hazardous waste remediation actions being conducted under CERCLA into the Feasibility Study (FS). When the FS is prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 300, a second NEPA document is usually not required. The cover and title page of the FS and ROD will indicate that the document is also intended to comply with NEPA. When an FS is not prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 300,44881 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices appropriate NEPA documentation will be prepared. 3.9 Interagency Cooperation For USEC programs that involve a Federal agency or agencies in related decisions subject to NEPA, USEC will comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6. As part of this process, USEC shall cooperate with the involved agencies in developing environmental information and in determining whether a proposal requires preparation of an EIS or EA, or can be categorically excluded from preparation of either. Further, where appropriate and acceptable to the involved agencies, USEC shall develop or cooperate in the development of interagency agreements to facilitate coordination and to reduce delay and duplication. 3.10 Variances. 3.10.1 Emergency Actions. USEC may take an action without observing all provisions of these procedures or the CEQ Regulations, in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.11, in emergency situations that demand immediate action. USEC shall consult with CEQ as soon as possible regarding alternative arrangements for emergency actions having significant environmental impacts. USEC shall document, including publishing a notice in the Federal Register, emergency actions covered by this paragraph; this documentation shall identify any adverse impacts from the actions taken, further mitigation necessary, and any NEPA documents that may be required. 3.10.2 Reduction of Time Periods. On a case-by-case basis, USEC may reduce time periods established in these procedures that are not required by the CEQ Regulations. If USEC determines that such reduction is necessary, USEC shall publish a notice in the Federal Register specifying the revised time periods and the rationale for the reduction. 4.0 Typical Classes of Actions 4.1 Level of NEPA Review 4.1.1 This section identifies USEC actions that normally: (a) Do not require preparation of either an EIS or an EA (are categorically excluded from preparation of either document) (Subsection 4.2 of this policy); (b) Require preparation of an EA, but not necessarily an EIS (Subsection 4.3 of this policy); or (c) Require preparation of an EIS (Subsection 4.3 of this policy). 4.1.2 Any completed, valid NEPA analysis and document, including thosecompleted by the U.S. Department of Energy for USEC facilities prior to July 1, 1993 does not have to be repeated, and no completed NEPA documents need to be redone, except as provided in Subsections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 of these procedures. 4.2 Categorical Exclusion Requirements 4.2.1 Categorical Exclusions encompass classes of actions which do not normally have, either individually or cumulatively, a significant impact on the quality of the human environment and require neither the preparation of an EA or EIS. USEC may, however, choose to prepare an EA or an EIS on any action at any time to aid USEC decisionmaking. For a project to be considered and assessed as a categorically excluded activity, it must satisfy the following conditions: (a) The proposed activity would not threaten a violation of applicable statutory, regulatory, or permit requirements for environment, safety, or health. (b) The proposed activity would not require siting and construction or major expansion of waste storage (> 90 days storage), disposal, recovery, or treatment facilities (including incinerators and facilities for treating wastewater, surface water, and groundwater). (c) The proposed activity would not disturb hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants preexisting in the environment such that there would be uncontrolled or unpermitted releases. (d) The proposed activity would not adversely affect environmentally sensitive resources including, but not limited to: (i) Property of historic, archaeological, or architectural significance designated by Federal, state, or local governments or property eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places; (ii) federally- listed threatened or endangered species or their habitat (including critical habitat), federally-proposed or candidate species or their habitat, or state-listed endangered or threatened species or their habitat; (iii) floodplains and wetlands; (iv) areas having a special designation such as federally- and state- designated wilderness areas, national parks, national natural landmarks, wild and scenic rivers, state and federal wildlife refuges, and marine sanctuaries; (v) prime agricultural lands; (vi) special sources of water (such as sole-source aquifers, wellhead protection areas, and other water sources that are vital in a region) and (vii) tundra, coral reefs, or rain forests.,Additionally, for a proposed action to be considered for a categorical exclusion, the following statement should be applicable: (e) This project would pose no significant individual or cumulative effect on the human environment. This project would not adversely affect any environmentally sensitive resources and is not part of a proposed action that is or may be the subject of an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement. There are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposed project. 4.2.2 Categorical Exclusions Applicable to General USEC Actions. The following types of actions are categorical exclusions applicable to general USEC actions. This does not, however, preclude these types of actions from the normal environmental oversight and monitoring that would occur as a routine part of USEC's environmental compliance activities. (a) Routine actions, such as rulemaking, necessary to support the normal conduct of corporate business such as administrative, financial, and personnel actions. (b) Sale, purchase, trade, import, or export of low enriched uranium (20 percent or less assay U-235). This includes the'shipment of LEU (or uranium hexafluoride) in DOT approved canisters and overpacks via common carrier. (c) Sale, purchase, trade, import, or export of natural and depleted Uranium materials. (d) Transfer, lease, disposition, or acquisition of property, if the use is to remain unchanged from current uses. (e) Award of contracts for technical support or personnel services.

USEC shall comply with all applicable DOT,44882 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Notices NRC, EPA, state, or local regulatory requirements. 4.2.3 Categorical Exclusions Applicable to Facility Operation. The following types of actions are categorical exclusions applicable to facility operations. This does not, however, preclude these types of actions frbm the normal environmental oversight and monitoring that would occur as a routine part of USEC's environmental compliance activities. (a) Installation of fencing within existing security areas .or facilities. (b) Routine maintenance activities and custodial services for buildings, structures, infrastructures (e.g., security fences), and equipment, during which operations may be suspended and resumed. Custodial services are activities to preserve facility appearance, working conditions, and sanitation, such as cleaning, window washing, lawn mowing, trash collection, painting, and snow removal. Routine maintenance activities, corrective (that is, repair), preventive and predictive, are required to maintain and preserve buildings, structures, infrastructures, and equipment in a condition suitable for a facility to be used for its designated purpose. Routine maintenance may result in replacement to the extent that the replacement performs the same or similar function and does not require major facility modifications. Routine maintenance activities include, but are not limited to: * Repair of facility equipment, such as lathes, mills, pumps and presses. e Door and window repair or replacement. * Wall, ceiling, or floor repair. \" Minor reroofing. * Plumbing, electrical utility, and telephone service repair. * Routine replacement of high- efficiency particulate air filters, and routine air filter cleaning. * Inspection and/or maintenance of currently installed utility poles. \" Repair of road embankments. \" Repair or replacement of fire protection sprinkler systems. * Road and parking area resurfacing, including construction of temporary access to facilitate resurfacing as long as the temporary access does not adversely affect environmentally sensitive areas. * Erosion control and soil stabilization measures (such as reseeding and revegetation). * Surveillance and maintenance of surplus facilities. e Repair and maintenance of transmission facilities, including replacement of conductors of the same nominal voltage, poles, circuit breakers, transformers, capacitors, crossarms,insulators, and downed transmission lines, in accordance, where appropriate, with 40 CFR part 761 (Polychlorinated Biphenyls Manufacturing, Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and Use Prohibitions). * Routine testing and calibration of facility components, subsystems, or portable equipment (including but not limited to, control valves, transformers, capacitors). * Routine decontamination and/or cleanup of spot or minor radiological contamination or hazardous/toxic materials on the surfaces of equipment, rooms, hot cells, or other'interior surfaces of buildings (by such activities as wiping with rags, using strippable latex, and minor vacuuming) and removal of contaminated intact equipment (labware) and other materials (e.g., gloves and other clothing). * Repair of fencing. * Modification of air conditioning systems. (c) Routine training exercises and simulations (including, but not limited to, firing-range training, emergency response training, fire fighter and rescue training, and spill cleanup training).

A-4.7.5 I an action that would constitute a major Federal action, if undertaken by DOE, for example, or another federal agency, having significant effects on the environment of the United States or the global commons requires preparation of an environmental impact statement by USEC and if the action is included in section A-2.1.2 or A-2.1.3 above as an action having significant effects upon the environment of a foreign nation, the environmental impact statement does not have to contain a review of these foreign impacts. The appropriate type of environmental review, as described in section A-2.1.2 or A-2.1.3 above, may be issued as a separate document. A-4.8 Miscellaneous Provisions The provisions of sectiops A-3.1 and A- 3.2 regarding exclusions or exemptions from these procedures do not apply to actions that would constitute major Federal actions, if undertaken by DOE, for example, or another federal agency, significantly affecting the environment of the global commons unless permitted by law. A-4.9 Definitions A-4.9.1 Environment means the natural and physical environment, and it excludes social, economic, and other environments. Social and economic effects do not give rise to any requirements under these guidelines. A-4.9.2 Federal Action means any action that is potentially subject to United States Government control and responsibility. It includes actions that are implemented, funded or approved directly or indirectly by the United States Government. It does not include actions in which the United States participates in an advisory, information gathering, representational or diplomatic capacity but does not implement, fund or approve the action or cause the action to be implemented. An action significantly affects the environment if it does significant harm to the environment even though on balance USEC believes the action to be beneficial to the environment. A-4.9.3 Foreign Nation means any territory under the jurisdiction of one or more foreign governments, including the territorial seas thereof. For the purpose of these procedures, actions having significant environmental effects on the resources of a foreign nation's continental shelf or, to the extent.its claim of jurisdiction is recognized by the United States, its fisheries zone, shall be considered to be actions having significant environmental effbcts on that foreign nation. A-4.9.4 United States means the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, the United States VirginIslands, Guam and the other territories and possessions of the United States, including the territorial seas thereof. For the purpose of these procedures, actions having significant environmental effects on the resources of the continental shelf of the United States, or on resources of United States Fisheries Conservation Zones subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, shall be considered to be actions having significant environmental effects in the United States. A-4.9.5 Global Commons is equivalent to areas outside the jurisdiction of any nation and means all areas not described in subsection A-4.9.3 and not described in Subsection A-4.9.4 above. A-4.10 Compliance These guidelines are intended for use by all persons acting on behalf of USEC in carrying out the provisions of Executive Order 12114. Any deviations from the guidelines must be soundly based and must have the advance approval of the Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Enrichment Corporation. -Annex 1-illustrative List for Determining Compliance With Section A-2.1.3 1.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The adopted rule completes the conversion of the Commission's rules to the International System of Units (metric system). This action is taken in order to comply with the provisions of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. This action is intended to enhance the international competitiveness of entities doing business with the Commission by encouraging their use of the International System of Units. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 24, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Wilson, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653-8138. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Order, FCC 93-184, adopted April 8, 1993 and released May 7, 1993. The full text of this decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies may also be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, Interuatiolial Transcription Services, at (202) 857-3800 or 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Summary of the Order 1. By this-action, the Commission essentially completes the conversion of its rules to the International System of Units (metric system) of measurement. This action is consistent with the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. That act designates the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce, and requires, to the extent economically feasible, certain Federal agencies to use the metric system in their procurements, grants, and other business-related activities, except when such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms.Discussion 2. The Commission has been converting its rules to the metric system of measurements as the rules have been routinely updated. However, not all existing rules have been converted. By this action, we are completing the conversion except as noted below. We are converting these rules in what we believe is a non-controversial manner. In particular, we have attempted to ensure that communications facilities previously in compliance with our rules do not become non-compliant as a result of metric conversion. To the extent possible, we have adopted metric units that are marginally less restrictive than those currently specified. To help make our metric standards convenient we have also used rounded units whenever possible. Each rule part was converted by the Commission bureau or office that is responsible for it, using the degree of precision the bureau or office believed was necessary, based upon its experience, to avoid significant controversy. 3. English units have been included in parentheses with many of our metric standards. The English units are for information purposes only, and in cases where the two figures are not precisely equivalent, the metric unit shall be considered as the sole requirement, except when a form requests information in English units. In such a case, the English unit shall be considered the sole requirement until such time as the form is changed to request metric units. It is estimated that all Commission forms will be converted to metric units within five years. 4. Currently licensed facilities and already authorized equipment will continue to be subject to the rules that were in effect prior to this action. Hence, license renewals will not be affected. However, licensees or grantees seeking to modify any technical parameter of their authorization must comply with the metric standard for that parameter. 5. In a few limited circumstances, we have not converted our rules to metric units. Exceptions include: (1) Rules that use non-metric units based on international convention; and, (2) rules that, if converted to metric units, would cause substantial confusion to long- standing industry practices and that, if not converted, would have no impact on international trade activities, e.g., tariff publications. Figures R3, 9, 10, and 11 in 47 CFR 73.190, the propagation curve in 47 CFR 80.767, and the shadow loss chart in 47 CFR 80.769 are not being converted in this order. They will be handled separately at a later datebecause the responsible bureaus are still developing the metric conversions for them. 6. This order does not change any of the Commission's forms, instruction manuals, bulletins, or information filing requirements, including those that require approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These items will be converted to metric units at the appropriate time consistent with Commission priorities and in accordance with our, and OMB's normal review processes. Therefore, applicants shall continue to report English units until such applicable filing forms are converted to metric units. Procedural Matters 7. Because the simple conversions implemented by this order do not significantly change the Commission's rules, this change constitutes a minor and non-controversial amendment to our rules in which the public is not likely to be interested. Therefore, we find for good cause that compliance with the notice and comment procedure of the Administrative Procedure Act is unnecessary. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Ordering Clause 8.-Accordingly, it is ordered that under the authority contained in sections 4(i), 302 and 303 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 CFR parts, 1, 2, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25, 36, 61, 63, 68, 69, 73, 74, 76, 78, 80, 87, 90 and 94 are amended as set forth below These rules and regulations are effective September 24, 1993.

Paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3)(iii) of \u00a7 36.2 are revised to read as follows: \u00a736.2 Fundamental principles underlying procedures. (a) * * * (3) In the development of \"actual use\" measurements, measurements of use are (i) determined for telecommunications plant or for work performed by operating forces on a unit basis (e.g., conversation-minute-kilometers per message, weighted standard work seconds per call) in studies of traffic handled or work performed during a representative period for all traffic and (ii) applied to overall traffic volumes, i.e., 24-hour rather than busy-hour volumes. (b)* * (3)* * * (iii) Conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation minutes is the basis for measuring the use of interexchange circuit plant and holding-time minutes is the basis for measuring the use of exchange trunk plant. While the use of holding-time-minute-kilometers is the basic fundamental allocation factor for interexchange circuit plant and exchange trunk plant, the use of conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation-minutes for the allocation of interexchange circuit plant and holding-time minutes for the allocation of exchange trunk plant are considered practical approximations for separations between state and interstate operations when related to the broad types of plant classifications used herein. * * * * 3.

(a) * * *(1) * * * (i) * * * (A) By section of cable, uniform as to makeup and relative use by categories. From an analysis of cable engineering and assignment records, determine in terms of equivalent gauge the number of pairs in use or reserved, for eachcategory. The corresponding percentages of use, or reservation, are applied to the cost of the section of cable, i.e., sheath meters times unit cost per meter, to obtain the cost assignable to each category. (B) By using equivalent pair kilometers, i.e., pair kilometers expressed in terms of equivalent gauge. From an analysis of cable engineering and assignment records, determine the equivalent pair kilometers in use for each category by type of facility, e.g., quadded, paired. The equivalent pair kilometers are then divided by a cable fill factor to obtain the equivalent pair kilometers in plant. The total equivalent pair kilometers in plant assigned to each category is summarized by type of facility, e.g., quadded and paired, and priced at appropriate average unit costs per equivalent pair kilometer in plant. If desired, thisistudy may be made in terms of circuit kilometers rather than physical pair kilometers, with average cost and fill data consistent with the basis of the facilities kilometer count. (ii) * * * (C) For use in the assignment of poles to categories, the equivalent sheath kilometers of aerial cable assigned to each category are determined. For convenience, these quantities are determined in connection with assignment of cable costs. * * * * (2)* * * (i) * * * (B) By pricing out each category by determining the pair meters of loaded pairs assigned to each category and multiplying by the unit cost per pair meter of loading by type. * * * * *[ (b)* \" (1) The cost of wire accounted for as exchange is assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories: The cost of wire accounted for as toll, which is used for exchange, is also assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories. The cost of the remaining wire accounted for as toll is assigned to the appropriate Interexchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories as described in \u00a7 36.156. For companies not maintaining exchange and toll subaccounts, it is necessary to review the plant records and identify wire plant by use. The cost of wire used for providing circuits directly assignable to a category is assigned to that category. The cost of wire used for providing circuit facilities jointly used fo exchange and interexchange lines is assigned to categories on the basis of therelative number of circuit kilometers involved. 4. Section 36.156 is revised to read as follows: \u00a736.156 Interchange Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF)-Category 3- apportionment procedures. (a) An average interexchange cable and wire facilities cost per equivalent interexchange telephone circuit kilometer for all circuits in Category 3 is determined and applied to the equivalent interexchange telephone circuit kilometer counts of each of the classes of circuits. (b) The cost of C&WF applicable to this category shall be directly assigned were feasible. If direct assignment is not feasible, cost shall be apportioned between the state and interstate jurisdiction on the basis of conversation-minute kilometers as applied to toll message circuits, TWX circuits, etc. 5. Paragraph (a)(1) of \u00a7 36.157 is revised to read as Hostftemota message Cableand Wire Facilities (C&WF)-Category 4- apportionment procedures. (a) * * * (1) The cost of host/remote message C&WF excluding WATS closed end access lines for the study area is apportioned on the basis of the relative number of study area minutes-of-use kilometers applicable to such facilities. 6.

The US customary units are shown in parentheses throughout this Subpart F. US customary units were the original dimensional units used in designing the plugs and jacks shown in the following pages. The dimensions shown without parenthesis are in SI units. The SI dimensional units are derived from the US customary units by mudtiplying \"inches\" -by .25.4\" to derive the exact conversion in millimeters with no rounding-off of the resulting decimal value. The number of decimal places to which the conversion is taken by adding a particular number of zeroes to the right end of the resulting SI value, where required, is governed by the concept that when the calculated SI dimensi6nal unit is divided by '\"25.4,\" the resulting \"inches\" calculation will be.exactly that shown in the parenthesis (the original design dindeiiion). The \" conversion to SI force units, newtons, is rounded off to a number of decimal places that will result in the calculated SI force value being within less than one percent of the original US customary force unit value located adjacent inparenthesis (the original design value). The rationale for this is that this will bring the force conversions to within the degree of accuracy of the force- measuring device and avoid the carrying of an unrealistic number of decimal places which would otherwise result from an exact conversion. The plugs and jacks described in this section represent the standard connections to be used for connections to the telephone network. The plug and jack designs shown are representative of generic types, and should not be interpreted as the only designs that may be used. Design innovation and improvement is expected; but for interchangeability to be maintained, alternative designs (the\"or equivalent\" permitted in \u00a7 68.104) must be compatible with the plugs and jacks shown. The interface dimensions between mating plugs and jacks must be maintained. Hardware used to mount, protect, and enclose standard jacks is not described. The only requirement on connecting blocks, housings, dust covers, outdoor boxes, and the like-that contain standard network jacks is that they accept standard plugs with cordage. For special purpose applications, plugs may be made longer than shown or adapted for direct use on equipment or apparatus without cordage. The sliding modular plug used on the-back of many modular wall telephone sets is an example of such a special purpose application. It is the responsibility of the designers and manufacturers of communication --equipment whQ use -suchiugs-to assure that they are compatible with the hardware used to mount standard jacks with which they plan to interface.

(4) In determining the average elevation of the terrain. theelevations between 3.2 km (2 mil and 16 km (10 mi) from the antenna site are employed. Profile graphs shall be drawn for a minimum of eight radials beginning at the antenna site and extending 16 km(10 mi). The radials should be drawn starting with true north. At least oe radil should be constructed in the direction of thenearest cooharmel and adjacent channel UHF televisionstations. The proie grp fo each radial shall be plrted ly wtotur intervals of from 1.2 m (40 ft) to 30.5 m (10 at) and, wherethe data permits, at least 50 points of elevation Igenerstly uniformly spaced) should be used for each radial. For very r ,ged terrain 61 m (200 f) to 122 m (400 ft) contour intervals may be used. Where the terrain is uniform or gently sloping, the smallest contour ieterval iidicated on the topographic chart 'may be used. The average elevation of the 12.8 km (8-mile) distance between 3.2 km (2 mo) and 18 km (10 mi) from the antenna site should be determined from the profile graph for each radial. This may be obtained by averaging a large number of equally spaced points, by using a planimetar, orby obtaining the median elevation (that exceeded by 5 percet i the distanc l in sectors and averaging those value. In the preparation of the profile graphs, the elevation orcontour intervals may ba taken from U.S. Geological Survey Topographic Maps, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Maps. -or Tennessee Valley Authority Maps.

The geographic coordinates listed in the table represent an average for each particular site; all locations within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the coordinates will be considered to be at that site.(c) Trunked systems authorized on frequencies in the Public Safety, Industrial/Land Transportation, Business and General Categories will be protected solely on the basis of predicted contours. Coordinators will attempt to provide a 40 dBu contour and to limit co-channel interference levels to 30 dBu over an applicant's requested service area. This would result in a distance separation of 113 km (70 miles) for typical system parameters. Applicants should be aware that in some arbas, e.g., Seattle, Los Angeles, and northern California, separations greater than 113 km (70 miles) may be appropriate. Separations may be less than 113 km (70 miles) where the requested service areas, terrain or other factors warrant reduction. In the event that the separation is less than 113 km (70 miles), the coordinator must indicate that the protection criteria have been preserved or that the affected licensees have agreed in writing to the proposed system.'Only co-channel interference between base station. operations will be taken into consideration. Adjacent channel and other types of possible interference will not be taken into account. \u00a7 90.623 [Amended] 37.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes revisions to the tenant selection preference provisions of regulations of several project-based assisted housing programs. The proposed rule would decrease the number of families that must be admitted on the basis of qualifying for a federal selection preference and would specifically authorize adoption of local selection preferences by housing agencies to be used in admitting some applicants. If a housing agency wants to use such local preferences, the proposed rule would require the agency to adopt ones that respond to local housing needs and priorities after conducting public hearings. The proposed rule also would disqualify from a selection preference for three years any Individual or family that has been evicted from certain HUD assisted housing for drug-related criminal activity. These revisions are being proposed to implement statutory changes to the United States Housing Act of 1937 affecting preferences for participation in public housing, Indian housing, and all phases of the Section 8 program for the Certificate and Voucher programs (which are covered by a separate rulemaking). DATES: Comment due date: October 25, 1993. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this rule to the Office of the General Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410-0500.

Timetable and Request for Comments This proposed rule is being issued pursuant to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3672, approved October 28, 1992). Section 104 of that Act requires that the Department give notice and opportunity for public comment before issuing a rule for effect. That section also requires issuance of a final rule to implement the tenant selection preference provisions originally enacted by the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101- 625, 104 Stat. 4079, approved November 28, 1990), no later than April 26, 1993, to take effect upon issuance. Although the deadline for issuance of a final rule has passed, the Department is issuing this rule as a proposed rule, as required by the statute, to solicit public comments on its content. A final rule will be published as expeditiously as possible after the end of the comment period. The changes in the preference provisions enacted in 1990 and 1992 are not effective until issuance of that final rule. B. Statutory Provisions Being Implemented The regulation will implement the following sections of the National Affordable Housing Act (\"NAHA\") of 1990: 501-Preference Rules, Public and Indian Housing 506-Public Housing Assistance for Foster Care Children 545-Preference Rules, Section 8 Housing and Section 202 Housing The regulation will also implement the following sections of the Housing F deral Rooster I Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules and Community Development Act (\"HCD Act\") of 1992: 104-Public Housing and Soction 8 (and Section 202) Housing Tenant Preference Rules (implement NAHA 501 and 5,45 within 1.8 days) 105(a)-Restriction on Selection of Higher Income Families to Local Preference Admissions 112-Public Housing Tenant Preferences (federal preferences minimum decreased from 70% to 50%) C. Affected Sctions of the U.S. Housing Act Public and Indian Housing 6ection 6jc)(4)(A) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (\"1937 Act\") was amended by section 501 of NAHA (change in minimum percentages, hearings for local preferences, drug- related evictions. and broad range of incomes); and by section 112 of the HCD Act (change in percentage). Section 6 was also amended by section 506 of NAHA to add a new paragraph (o) (subject to preferences, coordination with child welfare organizations permitted to facilitate adequate housing to avoid foster care). The section 112 changes do not apply to Indian Housing, although the section 501 and section 506 changes do. Section 16(c) of the 1937 Act was amended by section 105(a) of the HCD Act to exempt from a prohibition against selection of a family \"in an order different from the order on the waiting list for the purpose of selecting r.eltively higher income families for residence,\" those families selected by a housing agency for admission to public housing on the basis of local preferences adopted in accordance with the public hearing procedure. Section 8 (Including 202 Elderly Projects) Amendments concerning minimum federal preference percentages and public hearings to establish local preferences were made applicable by section 545 of NAHA to housing constructed or substantially rehabilitated with assistance provided under section 8(b}(2), as it existed before elimination of authority for the program on October 1, 1983, including projects financed under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (so-called 202 elderly pro't ). In adition, this rule covers Section 8 existing housing programs other than the Certificate and Voucher programs. It covers Section 8 Loan Management and Property Disposition programs administered under 24 CFR part 886 and the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program administeredunder part 882. These; program are subject to the same amendments as the New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation programs, and to the requirement that applicants be denied federal preference if they have been the subject of a drug-related eviction. .Affected Regulotio This regulation will amend: 24 CFR part 880-Section 8 New Construction 24 CFR part 881-Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation 24 CFR part M2-Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation 24 CFR part 883-State Housing Agencies 24 CFR part 886-Special Allocations 24 CFR part 889--Supportive Housing for the Elderly 24 CFR part 904-Turnkey III Homeownership 24 Homeownership CFR part 960-Public Housing A rule amending parts 882 and 887 and creating a new part 982 to replace most of those parts implements the changes in preferences for the Section 8 Certificate and Voucher programs. Therefore, those parts are not included in this rule, excapt for the subpart of part 882 that covers the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program. Previous statutory provisions concerning federal preferences have included changes to the statute authorizing the Rent Supplement program (12 US,C. 1701s). Neither NAHA nor the HCD Act of 1992 amended that statute. Consequently, the Department has no plans to make changes in the federal preference regulations covering that program (24 CFR part 215). E. Major Considerations The NAHA and HCD Act provisions: -Increase, for public housing, the percentage of non-federal preference holders who can be admitted from 10 percent to 50 percent. (NAHA 501 and HCD 112) -Increase, for Indian Housing and for the project-based Section 8 programs covered by this rule, the percentage of non-federal preference holders who can be admitted from 10 percent to 30 percent. (NAHA 501 and 545) -Provide specifically for local E references to be used as a separate asis for admission from fedaral preferences. These local prefevmncesam to be established by a heoing agency after a public, hearing. (NAHA 501 and 545) -Prohibit any individual or family evicted from housing assisted under the U.S. HousingAct because of drug- related criminal activity from having a federal or local preference for a period of three years for public housing, Indian Housing. and Section 8 moderate rehabilitation, loan management, and property disposition programs. (NAHA 501 and 545) F. Other Considerations The NAHA and HCD Act provisions also: -Amend the requirement that Housing Agency (HA) policies be directed toward achieving the broad range of income objective \"within a easonable period of time,\" to require, instead, that this objective be achieved *to the maximum extent feasible.\" (NAHA 501, amending setion 6(c)(4)(A) of the 1937 Act) -Allow HAs, in admitting families to public and Indian housing, to. consider the needs of families that would otherwise have to place children in foster care and of youth being discharged from foster care. (NAHA 506. adding section 6(o) to the 1937 Act) It permits HAs, subject to the preferences, to coordinate with local public agencies involved in child welfare to make available units to families-where lack of adequate housing is a primary factor requiring foster care placement or retention of children-and to youth-upon discharge from foster care where return to the family is not possible. This provision imposes no raquirements on HAs, and, therefore. this rule imposes none, HAs cau implement section 506 by adopting an appropriate local preference. While developing the method to implement statutory prefereuces, the Department has considered the potential for fraud in various methods and the means of HUD monitoring. The choice to limit qualification for the rent burden component of federal preferences to applicants who have paid more than 50 percent of family income for rent for at least 90 days is an example of a decision motivated by concern to limit the preference to families that are genuinely experiencing difficulty, and not just manipulating their situation with the sole intent of qualifying for the preference. The method of monitoring compliance with this preference rule will be to include oversight of this function during the normal management44969 44970 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules reviews and in the implementation of the tenant rental assistance certification system. U. Specific Provisions A. All Programs 1. Clarification of Percentage Limitations The statute requires that a minimum percentage of admissions must be based on federal preference. Any remaining admissions may be based on local preferences, adopted by the housing agency after conducting public hearings. Both NAHA and the HCD Act amended the preference provisions to permit a higher percentage of admissions to be based on local preference. The HCD Act, while continuing, for most of the assisted housing programs, the restriction against use of selection criteria whose purpose is the selection of higher income applicants, still permits it in the context of admissions to public housing, but now only when the admission is pursuant to a local preference. (Indian housing programs are not subject to this restriction.) These changes highlight the importance of the method of determining how the federal preference percentage is to be applied. One alternative is to apply the percentages only when a selection for admission involves a choice between selecting an applicant without a federal preference or an applicant with a federal preference. Another alternative is to apply the percentages to all admissions. In the latter case, each admission is categorized as either a federal preference admission or a local preference admission, to be counted against the applicable percentage. To simplify administration of the program and to assure that the exemption from the restriction on applying income range considerations is limited to local preference admissions in public housing, the Department has chosen the second alternative. The method for implementing this alternative would be somewhat simpler for the programs other than public housing, since they are not subject to the statutory exemption of section 16(c) of the 1937 Act, which requires more separation between federal preference admissions and local preference admissions. For these programs. the owner or HA would be permitted to count an admission as a federal preference admission if the applicant admitted was a federal preference holder. In addition, the admission could be counted as a federal preference admission even if the applicant were not a federal preferenceholder if none was available that qualified for the unit at the time of admission. For the public housing program, an admission could be counted as a federal preference admission if the applicant admitted was a federal preference holder and the selection was not based on a local preference whose purpose was to admit higher income families. In addition, the admission could be counted as a federal preference admission even if the applicant were not a federal preference holder if none was available that qualified for the unit at the time of admission, and the selection was not based on a local preference whose purpose was to admit higher income families. The regulation would permit local preference admissions for up to 50 percent (public housing) or 30 percent (Indian Housing and project-based Section 8) of admissions during the HA's fiscal year. For the Section 8 New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, local preference admissions (in accordance with the HA's Section 8 local preferences approved by HUD for the project) would be permitted for as much as 30 percent of the admissions. In any case, the HA or owner would be able to exercise discretion to use a higher percentage of federal preference admissions than the statute requires. So, for example, an owner could devote 100 percent of admissions to the federal preference category. 2. Effect on Current Waiting Lists The rule provides that an HA may adopt different local preferences for the Section 8 programs than for its public housing (or Indian housing) program. New local preferences will affect the status of new applicants and applicants already on the waiting list. New applicants will be given notice of the new preferences when they apply for assistance. Applicants already on the waiting list will be notified of the revised system and be given an opportunity to show that they qualify. The current public housing and Indian housing regulations provide for notice to applicants on a waiting list of a change in the preferences. The notice provision permits notification of less than the full waiting list under certain circumstances. This provision is preserved for these two programs and is added to the Section 8 program regulations.3. Possible Expansion of Current Definitions Since the initial implementation of federal preferences, some HAs have expressed interest in extending the definition of substandard housing to include overcrowding and families who are doubled up in the definition of overcrowding. HUID has decided to retain its current definition of substandard housing, which refers only to the physical dwelling, without regard to who may live in it. This limited definition keeps to a minimum the number of appiicants who qualify for the preference, and that therefore compete for very limited resources. HAs using the HUD definitions of these terms will not include overcrowding as a component of substandard housing, as clarified in this rule. However, in the public housing, Indian housing, and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation programs, HAs may adopt their own definitions of the three federal preference terms with HUD approval; this allows sufficient flexibility to deal with these issues locally. HAs also can address concerns like overcrowding or being doubled up by adopting a local preference for applicants in these situations. A local preference has the advantage of recognizing that there is a hierarchy of needs among applicants and that those who meet the federal preference provisions, as HUD defines them (e.g., in a substandard unit), are usually in greater need than those whose situations fall just outside HUD's definitions (e.g., overcrowded but in a standard unit). In the case of project-based Section 8 programs administered by project owners, the rule adds a provision that permits HUD to specify additional conditions, in a handbook or other administrative instructions, that would satisfy the definition of federal preference. The current handbook permits an applicant to qualify for a federal preference as involuntarily displaced in some cases when an extended family breaks up. (See the Occupancy Handbook for Multifamily Housing Programs, HUD 4350.3, chapter 2.) Editorial changes are proposed to the definition of involuntary displacement. These changes permit the use of the term by itself in the initial list of federal preferences, comparable to the other terms, and the expanded definition is found all in one place, in paragraph (c)(3) of the various regulations. The provision concerning involuntary displacement of a battered spouse would be modified in this rule in two Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules respects. First, it would describe the battered spouse as someone who has vacated \"the dwelling where he or she resides\" instead of \"his or her unit\". This change is intended to permit a battered SPOuse to qualify regardless of whether the person has a property right to the unit. (An applicant also can qualify as a victim of domestic violence if the applicant is still living in the housing unit with the perpetrator.) Secondly, the rule would permit the owner or HA to limit the preference based on this category to a family that will not include the abuser. This addition is made to encourage housing administrators to see that the preference category is not misused. Some HAs have suggested restricting the federal preference based on rent burden to those who have paid more than 50 percent of their income for rent for at least 12 months. This rule restricts qualification for the preference for rent burden to those affected for at least 90 days. In addition, an HA or owner may rank its applicants with federal preferences by duration of the rent burden condition. For example, an HA or owner may use a ranking preference to those who have paid more than 50 percent of income for more than 12 months but may not deny a federal preference to those who have paid more than 50 percent of income for at least 90 days. 4. Relationship of Preferences to Characteristics of Unit Under the current regulation, questions have been raised on the relationship between the federal preferences and the characteristics of the unit to which the applicant will be assigned. For example, would a two gerson family with a federal preference b assigned to a three-bedroom unit ahead of a six person family without a federal preference? No. (The size of unit would be a more important consideration.) Would an elderly family without a federal preference be selected for an elderly public housing project ahead of a non-elderly family with a federal preference? Yes. (The characteristics of the project would be a more important consideration.) The proposed rule provides that federal preferences, and any local preferences, would govern selection among families who qualify for a unit of a particular size under the occupancy policy of the HA or the Section 8 housing owner. The regulation would make clear that the preference to be accorded under the federal preferences and local preferences does not take precedence over other factors in selecting an appropriate tenant for a particular unit.The size of unit, as described above, must be considered first. Also, the regulation does not affect the statutory ranking of elderly, disabled, and displaced singles over other singles. Elderly, disabled, and displaced singles would have priority over other singles regardless of the individuals' particular preferences. [The applicability of local preferences to Section 8 housing constructed for occupancy by the elderly, however, is the subject of a pending rulemaking to implement section 655 of the HCD Act.] 5. Examples of Local Preferences Permitted The list of permissible local preferences stated in the statute is not exclusive--the list given is of examples. The rule simply requires that the HA follow the public hearing requirement, adopting preferences that respond to local housing needs and priorities and that do not conflict with nondiscrimination requirements. For example, an IHA may establish a local preference for Tribal member Indians over non-Tribal member Indians and non-Indians in -its Indian Housing programs: or an HA may establish a local preference for applicants who have at least one family member that is employed-providing that the preference satisfies nondiscrimination requirements. The rule does not repeat the examples given in the statute of appropriate local preferences but instead gives a cross- reference to the statute. The list of examples in the statute (NAHA section 501) is as follows: -Assisting very low-income families who either reside in transitional housing assisted under the McKinney Act or participate in a program designed to provide public assistance recipients with greater access to employment and educational opportunities; -Assisting families identified by local public agencies involved in providing for the welfare of children as having a lack of adequate housing that is a primary factor in the imminent placement of a child in foster care, or in preventing the discharge of a child from foster care and reunification with the child's family; -Assisting youth, upoh discharge from foster care, in cases in which return to the family or extended family or adoption is not available; and -Achieving other objectives of national housing policy as affirmed by Congress. For the Section 8 program, the list of examples includes a preference inproviding certificates and vouchers for persons displaced by the rental rehabilitation program. 6. Local Preferences for Objectives Affirmed by Congress In the list of examples of local preferences, the statute mentions, \"other objectives of national housing policy as affirmed by Congress.\" The objectives of national housing policy have been expressed most recently in section 102 of NAHA: \"(1) To ensure that every resident of the United States has access to decent shelter or assistance in avoiding homelessness; \"(2) To increase the Nation's supply of decent housing that is affordable to low-income and moderate-income families and accessible to job opportunities; \"(3) To improve housing opportunities for all residents of the Untied States, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities, on a nondiscriminatory basis; \"(4) To help make neighborhoods safe and livable; \"(5) To expand opportunities for homeownership; \"(6) To provide every American community with a reliable readily available supply of mortgage finance at the lowest possible interest rates; and \"(7) To encourage tenant empowerment and reduce generational poverty in federally assisted and public housing by improving the means by which self-sufficiency may be achieved.\" Another objective of national housing policy, and an element applicable to tenant selection policies with respect to public housing and Indian housing, under section 6(c)(4)(A)(iv) of the 1937 Act, is the obligation to ensure, to the maximum extent feasible, a broad range of incomes in particular projects, or in the HA's projects as a whole. 7. Residency Preferences Another category of preferences that has been used very frequently by HAs and owners is a local residency preference. The current rule for the Section 8 programs requires the owner to submit any residency preference to HUD but does not require prior approval. The current public housing and Indian housing rules do not require any HUD review of residency preferences, although they do impose limitations on the types of residency preferences that may be adopted. The treatment of residency preferences would be changed in this rule for all of the programs to require HUD approval44971. 44972 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1903 / Proposed. Rules before a residency prefemnce could be implemented, This change is proposed because the Department has found that residency preferences have had a negative impact on fair housing objectives, decreasing the availability of housing for applicants of racial/ethnic minorities in non- minority areas, in several areas of the country with respect to the Section 8 program and with respect to Section 202 projects. We are concerned that similar negative effects may be occurring in the public housing program, as well. The prior approval requirement will permit HUD to address with HAs how to revise any residency preference provision that would have a discriminatory impact before any family actually suffers from that type of discrimination. Residency requirements are not permitted in the Section 8 programs, and would not be permitted for program under the proposed rule. The public housing and Indian housing rules would be revised similarly in this rule, for uniformity of policy, so residency requirements would no longer be permitted in those programs. Although the statute requires tht t Section 8 project owners use the HA's local preferences to the extent they use a system of preferences other than the federal preferences (and any ranking preferences) as the basis for admission, the proposed rule contains a prdiision requiring HUD review of the HA's local preferefices with respect to any Section 8 project owner's project before ta owner implements the local preference system (see \u00a7 880.615(b). This prevision is included in the rule because of the Department's experience with local preferences that have operated in the case of particular projects to cause a violation of requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Fair Housing Act and of implementing HUD regulations. If HUD determines thot the local preference system violates these requirements, it would not approve the owner's use of the local preferences as a basis for admission. The Department specifically invites comments on this provision. 8. Public Hearings If an HA wants to make admissions not based on federal preference, it must hold a public hearing to determine what preferences would be responsive to local housing needs and priorities. It must hold eitch a hearing even if the HA plans only to use date and time to select applicants on a basis other than federal preference. When an HA decides to make additional changes in its local preferences, the rule requires a publichearing to be held to consider the proposed changes. If an HA does not want to axercise its discretion to make non-federal preference admissions, it does not need to hold a public hearing. In that case, the HA need not change its system of applying the federal preferences, unless it has been using a ranking preference for federal preference admissions based on income ranges or on residency. 9. Using Ranking Preferences To Select Among Federal Preference Holders Under current regulations, HAs and owners may use their own system to select among applicants who qualify for a federal preference. The use of these\"ranking preferences\" has allowed HAs and owners to address local objectives while meeting the statutory requirement to serve federal preference holders. This rule continues to permit selecting among federal preference holders according to ranking preferences. \"Ranking preferences\" is the term used in this rule and preamble for factors used only to distinguish among federal preference-holders. whereas \"local preferences\" is used to refer to those factors adopted after the hearing procedure to use in admitting applicants as an alternative to admission of federal preference holders. An HA may use a ranking preference that is the same as a local preference when making a federal preference admission. For example, if the HA had a local preference for veterans, an HA or owner would be able to select a federal preference holder who was a veteran over a federal preference holder who was not a veteran. Similarly, an owner or HA may use a ranking preference to select among local preference holders when making a local preference admission, and the ranking preference may be the same as a federal preference. The one exception to use of local preferences as ranking preferences when- making a federal preference admission is that, in the public housing program, in accordance with a recent revision to section 16(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, a local preference for admitting applicants with a broad range of income may not be used in federal preference admissions to admit a higher income applicant over a lower income applicant whose place on the waiting list is higher. Since section 16(c) does not apply to Indian housing or homeownership programs, this* exception does not affect those programs. 10. Status of Current Local Policies Are an HA's preferences for local residents and veterans affected by thesestatutory and regulatory changes? If the HA uses vateram status only ass ranin device to choose among applicants who qualify for a federal preference, it is not affected. However. if it is to be used for local preference admissions, as distinguished from federal prefenmce admissions, it must be reconsidered and adopted by an HA as a local preference in accordance with the hearing procedure. Residency preferences would now be subject to prior approval by HUD, regardless of whether they are used as a ranking preference for federal preference admissions or as the basis of local preference admissions. Many HAs and owners are operating under locally-adopted preferences that were not adopted in accordance with a public hearing, as now required by the statute. If an HA or owner intends to make only federal preference admissions-not using as ranking preferences eithersidency or income range-it does not need to be concerned about newly adopted local preferences. After the expiration of three months after the effective date of a final rule, if the HA has not adopted local preferences in accordance with the public hearing requirement, there will be no local preferences in effect (in accordance with SS 905.305, 960.213), and the federal preferences will be used exclusively-by owners and the HA. (along with any permissible ranking preferences they may use for selecting among federal preference-holders)--- until such time as the HA does duly adopt local preferences. If residency preference provisions have not been submitted by that time, they will not be permitted to be used-oven as ranking preferences. B. Public Housing, Indian Housing and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation This rule implements the statutory provision applicable to these programs that disqualifies from a federal or local preference for three years any individual or family that has been evicted from housing under a program of assistance under the 1937 Act because of drug-related criminal activity. The disqualification does not apply if the individual has completed a rehabilitation program approved by the HA. The HA has the authority to waive this disqualification. C. Public and Indian Housing The statute, at section 6(c)(4)(A)(iv), requires tenant selection criteria \"designed to assure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the projects of an agency will include families with a Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules broad range of incomes and will avoid concentrations of low-income and deprived families with serious social problems.\" This differs from the old requirement in two respects: (1) It uses the term \"to the maximum extent feasible\" rather than \"within a reasonable period of time,\" and (2) it says \"the projects of an agency will include\" rather than \"the project will include.\" The rule provides that these standards would continue to apply on a project by project basis, since the Department believes that is essential in avoiding\"concentrations of low-income and deprived families with serious social problems.\" The regulation would allow the HA to determine if it is feasible to attain occupancy by families with a broad range of income for any of its projects. This broad range of income concern is an overall objective of each housing authority, specifically required by the statute. An HA may choose to implement this objective by adopting an admission preference based on income range as a local preference, or by other means. (See discussion in section A9 above of the limitation on use of such a local preference in federal preference admissions.) Some other means that an HA could choose to implement the objective are to use outreach to higher income families (among the category of low income families eligible for these programs) or to stimulate income growth amon$ current residents. The provisions of part 960 covering tenant selection policies in public housing would be rearranged substantially to improve clarity, to make them more consistent with similar provisions of part 905 covering Indian housing, and to eliminate redundancy. One change would be to remove the nondiscrimination provision from the section on preferences (\u00a7 960.211) and to expand the existing discussion of the topic in \u00a7 960.203. The subject still would be covered in the same depth as it is currently, and reference to the Americans with Disabilities Act would be added. Section 960.204 would be revised to eliminate some provisions that were not found in the comparable provisions of the Indian housing provisions and that were not deemed necessary, such as paragraph (a). Other provisions, such as the language about avoiding concentrations of the most economically and socially deprived families, would be updated to reflect current statutory language, which includes a phrase modifying socially deprived families \"with serious social problems.\" The broad range of income provision isupdated, as described elsewhere. A provision that protects an applicant for the Section 8 program from losing its place on that waiting list when it applies for public housing has been removed, since that provision belongs in and is now proposedto be included in the appropriate Section 8 program regulation (see 58 FR 11292, 11299, 11334). A prohibition against denying admission based on attributes of a category of persons to which the applicant belongs would be removed because it also is found in \u00a7 960.205(a). A nondiscrimination provision would be removed, because that subject is addressed in its own section. A provision that the PHA's policies be consistent with the PHA's responsibilities as a public body would be eliminated, since it is vague, it does not derive from the governing statutes, and Its eiforceability by HUD is uncertain. Section 960.205(c) of the current public housing regulations also would undergo significant revision. The current rule anticipated implementation of the broad range of income objective after determining to what extent it is necessary to cover the costs of operating the HAs projects. It requires an HA to conduct studies of the income levels of lower income families in the area, in occupancy in its developments, and on the waiting list, as well as to determine operating costs and rents needed to cover those costs and rents that can be achieved based on the income of the families in those categories. This rule would remove those provisions, and would use the statutory language only. HAs may wish to conduct such studies, but the rule would not require it. D. Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation and Section 202 Housing for the Elderly 1. Applicability of HA-Adopted Local Preferences The provision that the owner use the HA's local preferences raises several questions: -Suppose the owner would prefer not to use local preferences at all? -What happens to any local preferences the owner may currently be usin g? -What iMfmore than one HA has jurisdiction in the area in which the housing is located? The regulation affirms that, if the owner chooses to make non-federal preference admissions, the owner must use the same local preferences adopted by the local HA for the Section 8 Certificate and Voucher programs for this purpose (as approved by HUD forthe project). However, the owner need not make any non-federal preference admissions and so would not have to adopt the HA's local preferences at all. A project owner may continue to use its own ranking p references for selecting among federal preference holders, as discussed above in section A9 of this preamble. If the owner's property is in an area with overlapping HA jurisdictions, the owner may choose which HA's local preferences to adopt for purposes of admitting an applicant that does not qualify for a federal preference. 2. Limitations on Using HA's Local Preferences What does the statute mean, in section 545(c)(2) of NAHA by \"to the extent that such preferences are applicable with respect to any tenant eligibility limitations for the housing\"? The Department interprets it to mean that the HA's local preferences are to be used to the extent that they are consistent with the requirements of the category of housing involved. If the housing was designed and operated for use by the elderly, as would be the case for housing financed under section 202, the preferences would be applied to elderly applicants. III. Findings and Certifications A. Impact on the Economy This rule does not constitute a \"major rule\" as that term is defined in Section I(b) of Executive Order 12291, Regulatory Planning Process. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies or geographic regions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. B. Impact on the Environment A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,42 U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying during regular business hours (7:30a.m. to 5:30 p.m.) in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, II44973 44974 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-0500. C. Federalism Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule have impact on States or their political subdivisions only to the extent required by the statute being implemented. The rule specifies to what extent preferences for admission of particular categories of applicants that are established by the local housing agency, in accordance with a statutorily- prescribed bearing procedure, may be used to admit participants. The only guidelines stated for the local agency's discretion are those required by the statute: the preferences are to respond to local housing needs and priorities. Since the rule merely carries out a statutory mandate and does not create any new significant requirements, it is not subject to review under the Executive Order.D. Impact on the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus is not subject to review under the Order. The rule merely carries out the mandate of federal statute with respect to admission preferences. (To the extent that an HA adopts a location preference for admitting families whose children would otherwise be put in foster care, as is suggested by the statute, there would be a positive impact on families. However, neither the statute nor the rule requires adoption of such a preference.) E. Impact on Small Entities The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significantImpact on a substantial number of small entities, because it does not place major burdens on housing authorities or housing owners. F. Regulatory Agenda This rule was listed as sequence number 1375 under the Office of the Secretary in the Department's Semiannual Regulatory Agenda published on April 26. 1993 (58 FR 24382, 24394), under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. G. Public Reporting Burden The Department has estimated the public reporting burden involved in the information collections contained in the rule as shown below. The public reporting burden for each of these collections of information is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

PART 880-SECTION 8 HOUSING, ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS PROGRAM FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION 1. The authority citation for part 880 would continue to read as follows: Section 880.603 would be amended by removing from the introductory text of paragraph (b)*the reference to \"\u00a7 880.613\" and adding in its place a reference to \"\u00a7\u00a7 880.613-615\"; by removing paragraph (b)(l); and by redesignating paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) as paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (3)..44975 44976 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules 3. Section 880.613 would be revised and new \u00a7\u00a7 880.614 and 880.615 would be added, to read as follows: \u00a7880.613 Selection preferences. (a) General. (1) Use of preference in selection process. (i) In selecting applicants for assistance under this part, owners must give preference, in accordance with this section, to applicants who are otherwise eligible and qualify for a federal preference, as described in \u00a7 880.614, or a local preference, as described in \u00a7 880.615. (ii) Before applying the federal preference and any local preferences, the owner will match other characteristics of the applicant with the type of unit available. For example, in selection of a family for a unit that has special accessibility features, the owner will give preference to families that include persons with disabilities who can benefit from those features of the unit (see 24 CFR 8.27 and 100.202(c)(3)). Also, in selection of a family for a unit in a project for the elderly, the owner will give preference to elderly families. (2) System. (i) The owner must establish a system for applying the preferences; must inform all applicants of the availability of the federal preferences, as described in \u00a7 880.614, and any local preferences, as described. in \u00a7 880.615; and must offer applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for a preference. For purposes of this paragraph, applicants include families on any waiting list maintained by the owner when this section is implemented or thereafter. ii) If the owner determines that the notification to all applicants on a waiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticable because of the length of the list, the owner may provide this notification to fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The owner, must, however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given time that, on the basis of the owner's determination of the number of applicants on the waiting list who already claim a federal preference and the anticipated number of project admissions: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the owner's framework for applying the preferences under paragraph (b) of this section and the federal preferences claimed by those already on the waiting list, any applicant who has not been so notified would receive assistance before those who have received notification.(iii) The owner must submit to HUD any selection preference system that uses a local residency preference, for review for-consistency with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section before implementation of such a system. (3) Nondiscrimination. Any selection preference that Is used by an owner must be established and administered in a manner that is compatible with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601- 19) and the implementing regulations at. 24 CFR parts 100, 108, 109, and 110; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-07) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 146; Executive Order 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107: the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101-12213) to the extent applicable; and other applicable Federal, State and local laws prohibiting discrimination and promoting equal opportunity. Such preferences must also be consistent with HUD's affirmative fair housing objectives and (where applicable) the owner's HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan. (4) Residency. Local residency requirements are prohibited. With respect to any residency preference, applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in the jurisdiction shall be treated as residents of the jurisdiction. (5) Income-based admission. The owner may not select a family for admission in an order different from the order on the waiting list for the purpose of selecting a relatively higher income family for admission. (b) Application of preferences. (1) Federal and local preferences generally govern selection among families who qualify for a unit of a particular size under the owner's occupancy policy. (2) In selecting tenants during each successive one-year period, the owner will apply the preferences as follows: (For at least seventy percent of the admissions, admit applicants that qualify for a federal preference before other applicants; and (ii) For any remaining admissions, admit first those applicants that qualify for a local preference (if any). (3) The percentage limitation is a factor in every admission. An owner may consider an admission as a federal preference admission that is counted towards the percentage in paragraph(b)(2)(i) of this section when either the applicant admitted qualifies for a federal preference or no family that qualifies for the available unit qualifies for a federal preference. Any other admissions are based on local preferences and count towards the percentage in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for local preference admissions. 5880.614 Federal preferences. (a) Definition. A federal preference is a preierence under federal law for selection of families that are: (1) Involuntarily displaced; (2) Living in substandard housing; or (3) Paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent. (b) Application of federal preferenices. In applying the federal preferences, the owner may determine the relative weight of the federal preferences through means such as: (1) Applying its own priorities, including ones that are the same as the housing agency's local preferences for the Section 8 Certificate and Voucher programs, to rank applicants who qualify for a federal preference (i.e., provide that applicants who qualify for a federal preference and a ranking preference take precedence over a federal preference holder who does not qualify for a local preference); (2) Aggregating the federal preferences (e.g., provide that two federal preferences outweigh one); (3) Ranking the federal preferences (e.g., provide that an applicant living in substandard housing has greater need for housing than--and, therefore, would be considered for assistance before--an applicant paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent); or (4) Ranking the definitional elements of a federal preference (e.g., provide that those living in housing that is dilapidated or has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of government have a greater need for housing than those whose housing is substandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family). (c) Certification and verification of qualification for a federal preference. (1) Certification. Applicants may claim qualification for a federal preference by certifying when they apply for assistance under this part (or thereafter until the time that they are offered admission) to the owner that the family qualifies. The owner must accept this certification unless it verifies that the applicant is not qualified for a federal preference. (2) Verification. Before an applicant is selected for admission on the basis of a Federal Register / Vol: 58, No. 163 /Wednesday, August 25, 1693 / Proposed Rules 4 federal preference, the owner must require the applicant to provide verification that the family qualifies for a federal preference by virtue of the applicant's current status. The , ' applicant's current status must be determined without regard to whether there has been a change in the applicant's qualification for a preference between the certification and selection for admission, including a change from one federal preference category to another. Once verified, the applicant's qualification for a federal preference need not be verified again, unless the owner determines that the length of time since verification makes it desirable or the owner has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant no longer qualifies for a federal preference. (d) Definition of involuntary displacement. (1) For qualification on the basis of involuntary displacement, the applicant must have been involuntarily displaced or be certain of displacement within no more than six months from the certification or verification (as appropriate), and must not be living in standard, permanent replacement housing. Standard, permanent replacement housing is housing that is decent, safe and sanitary; that is adequate for the family size; and that the family is occupying pursuant to a lease or occupancy agreement. Such housing does not include transient facilities, such as motels, hotels, or temporary shelters for victims of domestic violence or homeless families. and, in the case of domestic violence, does not include the housing unit in which the applicant and the applicant's spouse or other member of the household who engages in such violence live. (2) An applicant is or will be involuntarily displaced if the applicant has vacated or will have to vacate the dwelling where he or she resides as a result of one or more of the following actions: (i) A disaster, such as a fire or flood, that results in the uninhabitability of an applicant's unit; (ii) Activity carried on by an agency of the United States or by any State or local governmental body or agency in connection with code enforcement or a public improvement or development program; or , (iii) Action by a housing owner that results in an applicant's having to vacate his or her unit, where: (A) The reason for the owner's action is beyond an applicant's ability to control or prevent:* B) The action occurs despite an.applicant's having met all previously imposed conditions'of occupancy, and * (C) The action taken is other than a rent increase. (3) An applicant is also involuntarily displaced if- - (1) The applicant has vacated the dwelling where he or she resides as a result of actual or threatened physical violence directed against the applicant or one or more members of the applicant's family by a spouse or other member of the applicant's household; or (ii) The applicant lives in a housing unit with such an individual who engages in such violence. Eii For purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. the actual or threatened violence must, as determined by the owner in accordance with HUD's administrative instructions, have occurred recently or be of a continuing nature. The owner may limit use of this preference to a family that will not include the abuser. (4)(i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, reasons for an applicant's-having to vacate a housing unit include, but are not limited to, conversion of an applicant's housing unit to non-rental or non-residential use; closure of an applicant's housing unit for rehabilitation or for any other reason; notice to an applicant that the owner wants the unit for the owner's personal or family use or occupancy: sale of a housing unit in which an applicant resides under an agreement that the unit must be vacant when possession is transferred; or any other legally authorized act that results or will result in the withdrawal by the owner of the unit or structure from the rental market. (ii) Such reasons do not include the vacating of a unit by a tenant as a result of actions taken because of the tenant's refusal- (A) To -comply with applicable program policies and procedures under this part with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowded units; or (B) To accept a transfer to another housing unit in accordance with such policies and procedures under a HUD- approved desegregation plan. (e) Verification procedures for applicants involuntarily displaced. Verification of an applicant's involuntary displacement is established by the following documentation: (1) Certification, In a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government that an applicant has been or will be displaced as a result of a disaster, as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section:(2) Certification. in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government that an applicant has been or will be displaced by government action, as defined in paragraph (d)(1)[ii) of this section; .i (3) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from an owner or owner's agent that an applicant had to. or will have to, vacate a unit by a date certain because of an owner action referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section; or (4) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, of displacement because of the domestic violence referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, from the local police department, social services agency, or court of competent jurisdiction, or a member of the clergy, physician, or public or private facility that provides shelter or counseling to the victims of domestic violence. (f) Definition of substandard housing. (1) A unit is substandard if it: (i Is dilapidated; (ii) Does not have operable indoor plumbing; (iii) Does not have a usable flush toilet inside the unit for the exclusive use of a family; (iv) Does not have a usable bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of a family; (v) Does not have electricity, or has inadequate or unsafe electrical service; (vi) Does not have a safe or adequate source of heat; (vii) Should, but does not, have a kitchen; or (viii) Has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of government. (2) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a housing unit is dilapidated if it does nbt provide safe and adequate shelter, and in its present condition endangers the health, safety, or well-being of a family, or it has one or more critical defects, or a combination of intermediate defects in sufficient number or extent to require considerable repair or rebuilding. The defects may involve original construction, or they may result from continued neglect or repaii or from serious damage to the structure. (3) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, an applicant who is a \"homeless family\" is living in substandard housing. For purposes of the preceding sentence. a \"homeless family\" includes any individual or family who.; (i) Lacks a fixed,regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and (ii) Has a primary nighttime residence that is:44977 44978 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed. Rules (A) A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill); (B) An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized: or (C) A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. A \"homeless family\" does not include any individual imprisoned or otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of Congress or a State law. (4) For purposes of paragraph (0 of this section, Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing (as defined in 24 CFR 882.102) is not substandard solely because it does not contain sanitary or food preparation facilities (or both). (g) Verification procedures for applicants living in substandard housing. Verification that an applicant is living in substandard housing consists of certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government or from an applicant's present landlord that the applicant's unit has one or more of the deficiencies listed in, or the unit's condition is as described in, the definition of \"substandard housing\" in this section. In the case of a \"homeless family\" (as described in this section), verification consists of certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, of this status from a public or private facility that provides shelter for such individuals, or from the local police department or social services agency. (h) Definition of family income. For purposes of this section, family income is Monthly Income, as defined in 24 CFR 813.102. (i) Definition of rent. (1) For purposes of this section, rent is defined as: (i) The actual amount due, calculated on a monthly basis, under a lease or occupancy agreement between a family and the family's current landlord; and ii} In the case of utilities purchased directly by tenants from utility providers, (A) The utility allowance (if any) determined for the Section 8 Certificate program for tenant-purchased utilities (except telephone) and the other housing services that are normally included in rent; or (B) If the family chooses, the average monthly payments that it actually made for these utilities and services for the most recent 12-month period or, if information is not obtainable for the entire period, for an appropriate recent period.(2) For purposes of calculating rent, amounts paid to or on behalf of a family under any energy assistance program must be subtracted from the otherwise applicable rental amount, to the extent that they are not included in the family's income. (3) In the case of an applicant who owns a manufactured home, but who rents the space upon which it is located, rent includes the monthly payment to amortize the purchase price of the home, calculated in accordance with HUD's requirements. (4) In the case of an applicant who resides within the jurisdiction of an Indian Housing Authority (IHA) that is not administering a Section 8 Certificate program, the applicable utility allowance for purposes of calculating rent under this section, will be determined under 24 CFR part 905, sub part K. (5) In the case of members of a cooperative, rent under this section means the charges under the occupancy agreement between the members and the cooperative. (6) An applicant may not qualify for a federal preference under this provision: (i) If the applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income to rent a unit because the applicant's housing assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937, under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 (\"rent supplement program\"), or under section 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act (\"rental assistance payments\") with respect to that unit has been terminated as a result of the applicant's documented refusal to comply with applicable program policies and procedures with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowded units; or (ii) If the applicant has been paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent for less than 90 days. (j) Verification of an applicant's income and rent. The owner must verify that an applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent, as follows: (1) The owner must verify the family's income in accordance with the standards and procedures that it uses to verify income for purposes of determining applicant eligibility and Total Tenant Payment under 24 CFR - part 813.

If the public housing agency (PHA) thathas jurisdiction in the area where the housing is located establishes such a system of local preferences, the owner must use it for any admissions other than federal preference admissions. If more than one PHA has jurisdiction in the area, the owner may select which PHA's system follow. (2) Admission of an applicant based on qualification for a local preference (\"local preference admission\") is permitted until an admission would cause the owner's local preference selections for the year to exceed the percentage limitation for such admissions described in \u00a7 880.613(b)(2)(ii). (b) Approval of PHA local preferences. Before the owner implements the PHA-adopted section 8 local preferences, the owner must receive approval from the HUD Field Office.

(a) Admission policies. (1) The IHA shall establish and adopt written policies for admission of participants. The policies shall cover all programs operated by the housing authority and, as applicable, will address the programs individually to meet their specific requirements (Le., Rental, MH, or Turnkey III). A copy of the policies shall be posted prominently in the IHA's office for examination by prospective participants and shall be submitted to the HUD field office promptly after adoption by the IRA. (See \u00a7 905.416, with respect to Mutual Help admission policies.) (2) These policies shall be designed: (i) To assure that, to the maximum extent feasible, each project of the IRA will include families with a broad range of incomes and will avoid concentrations of low-income anddeprived families with serious social problems; (ii) To preclude admission of applicants whose habits and practices reasonably may be expected to have a detrimental effect on the participants or the project environment; (iii) To give a preference in selection of tenants and homebuyers to applicants who qualify for a federal or local preference, in accordance with S\u00a7 905.303-905.305; and (iv) To assure that selection by the IHA among otherwise eligible applicants is objective and reasonable. (3) The IHA admission policies shall include the following: (i) Requirements for applications and waiting lists, including requirement for selection from the top of the list; (ii) Description of the standards and procedures for selection of applicants, including any preferences to be applied: the federal preferences, as specified in \u00a7 905.304, the local preferences adopted by the IHA in accordance with \u00a7 905.305, and any ranking preferences it uses to distinguish among the federal preferences; (iii) Procedures for verification and documentation of information relevant to acceptance or rejection or an applicant; (iv) Procedures governing participant transfer between units, projects, and programs, including a requirement that a participant is not eligible for voluntary .transfer tmless all obligations under the current program have been met, including payment of charges to the IRA and completion of maintenance requirements; (v) Procedures to comply with 24 CFR part 750, which requires applicants and participants to disclose and verify social security numbers at the time eligibility is determined and at later income reexaminations; and (vi) Procedures to comply with 24 CFR part 760, which requires applicants and participants to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claims information from State wage and information collections agencies. (4) Residency provisions are subject to the following; (i) Residency requirements are not permitted; (ii) A residency preference may not be based on how long the applicant has resided in the jurisdiction; (iii) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in the jurisdiction shall be treated as residents of the jurisdiction; and (iv) They must be approved in advance by HUD.23. New \u00a7 905.303 and 905.304 would be added, to read as follows: 1 903 Selction prefrvesmn . (a) General. (1) Use of preference in selection process. (i) In selecting applicants for assistance under this part, the IHA must give preference, in accordance with this section, to applicants who are otherwise eligible and qualify for a federal preference, as described in \u00a7 905.304, or any* local preference, as described in \u00a7 905.305. (ii) Before applying the federal preferences and local preferences, the IHA will match other characteristics of the applicant with the type of unit . available. For example, in selection of a family for a unit that has special accessibility features, the IRA will give preference to families that include persons with disabilities who can benefit from those features of the unit (see 24 CFR 8.27 and 100.202(c)(3)). Also, in selection of a family for a unit in a project for the elderly, the IHA will give preference to elderly families (see \u00a7 905.301(e)). (2) System, (i) The IHA's system for applying the preferences, in accordance with its policies, must inform all applicants of the availability of the federal preferences and any local preferences, and must offer applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for a preference. For purposes of this paragraph, applicants include families on any waiting list maintained by the IHA when this section is implemented or thereafter. (ii) If the IHA determines that the notification to all applicants on a waiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticable because of the length of the list, the IHA may provide this notification to fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The IiA must, however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given time that, on the basis of the IRA's determination of the number of applicants on the waiting list who already claim a federal preference and the anticipated number of project admissions: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the IRA's framework for applying the preferences under paragraph (b) of this section and the federal preferences claimed by those already on the waiting list, any applicant who has not been so notified would receive assistance before those who have received notification. (3) Nondiscrimination. Any selection preference used by-an IRA must be Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules established and administered in a manner that is consistent with HUD's affirmative fair housing objectives. The Indian Civil Rights Act may apply to operations of the IHA. In addition, the following nondiscrimination requirements may apply: section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 100, 108, 109, and 110; title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-07) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 146; Executive Order 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107; the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101-12213) to the extent applicable; and other applicable Federal, State and local laws prohibiting discrimination and promoting equalopportunity.& Application of preferences. (1) Federal and local preferences generally govern selection among families who have been determined to qualify for a unit of a particular size under the IHA's occupancy policy. Date and time of application govern selection among families that qualify for the same housing unit size, the same federal preference status, the same local preference status, and any other applicable selection criteria. (2) In selecting tenants for units made available for occupancy during each successive IHA fiscal year, the IHA will apply the preferences as follows: (i) For at least seventy percent of the admissions, admit applicants that qualify for a federal preference before other applicants; and. (i) For any remaining admissions, admit first those applicants that qualify for a local preference (if any). .(3) The percentage limitation is a factor in every admission. The IHA may consider an admission as a federal preference admission that is counted towards the percentage in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section when either the applicant admitted qualifies for a federal preference or no family that qualifies for the available unit qualifies for a federal preference. Any other admissions are based on local preferences and count towards the percentage in paragraph (b)(2)(il) of this section for local preference admissions. (4)(i) A family may not be granted a federal or local preference if any member of the family is a person or member of a family evicted fromhousing assisted under the 1937 Act, during the past three years, because of drug-related criminal activity. \"Housing assisted under the 1937 Act\" means public or Indian housing, housing assisted with tenant-based or project- based assistance under Section 8 (24 CFR part 982), rental rehabilitation program housing, Section 23 rental assistance, housing development grant housing, and Turnkey II and Mutual Help housing. However, the family may qua lify for federal or local preference if each evicted person who engaged in such drug-related criminal activity who is a member of the family seeking admission to the program has successfully completed a rehabilitation program approved by the IHA. (ii) The IHA may waive the preference prohibition for drug-related criminal activity eviction. The IHA may waive the prohibition for an evicted person if the evicted person demonstrates to the IHA's satisfaction either that the evicted person clearly did not participate in and had no knowledge .of the drug-related criminal activity, or that circumstances leading to eviction no longer exist. \u00a7 905.;04 Federal preferences. (a) Definition. A federal preference is a preference under federal law for selection of families that are: (1) Involuntarily displaced; (2) Living in substandard housing; or (3) Paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent. (b) Application of federal preferences. (1) Unless the IHA submits alternative definitions for HUD's review and approval, the IHA must apply the definitions of the following terms in this section: applying the federal preferences, the IRA will use the verification procedures contained in this section, unless it has adopted verification procedures of its own. (2) In applying the federal preferences, the IHA may determine the relative weight of the federal preferences through means such as: (i) Applying ranking preferences (which may be the same as those adopted in accordance with \u00a7 905.305) as a way of selecting families from among those who qualify for a federal preference (i.e., provide that applicants who qualify for a federal preference and an lIA ranking preference take precedence over a federal preference holder who does not qualify for an lIA ranking preference);(ii) Aggregating the federal references (e.g., provide that two ederal preferences outweigh one); (iii) Ranking the federal preferences (e.g., provide that an applicant living in substandard housing has greater need for housing than--and, therefore, would be considered for assistance before-an applicant paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent); or (iv) Ranking the definitional elements of a federal preference (e.g., provide that those living in housing that is dilapidated or has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of government have a greater need for housing than those whose housing is substandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family). (c) Certification and verification of qualification for a federal preference. (1) Certification. Applicants may claim qualification for a federal preference by certifying when they apply for assistance under this part (or thereafter until the time that they are offered admission) to the IRA that the family qualifies. The IHA must accept this certification unless it verifies that the applicant is not qualified for a federal preference. (2) Verification. Before an applicant is selected for admission on the basis of a federal preference, the IHA must require the applicant to provide verification that the family qualifies for a federal preference by virtue of the applicant's current status. The applicant's current status must be determined without regard to whether there has been a change in the applicant's qualification for a preference between the certification and selection for admission, including a change from one federal preference category to another. Once verified, the applicant's qualification for a federal preference need not be verified again, unless the IHA determines that the length of time since verification makes it desirable or the IHA has reasonable grounds to - believe that the applicant no longer qualifies for a federal preference. (d) Definition of involuntary displacement. (1) For qualification on the basis of involuntary displacement, the applicant must have been involuntarily displaced or be certain of displacement within no more than six months from the certification or verification (as appropriate), and must not be living in standard, permanent replacement housing.

Such housing does not include transient facilities, such as motels, hotels, or temporary shelters for victims of domestic violence or homeless families, and, in the case of domestic violence, does not Include the housing unit in which the applicant and the applicant's spouse or other member of the household who engages in such violence live. (2) An applicant is or will be involuntarily displaced If the applicant has vacated or will have to vacate the dwelling where he or she resides as a result of one or more of the following actions: i) A disaster, such as fire or flood, that results in the uninhabitability of an applicant's unit; ii) Activity carried on by an agency of the United States or by any State or local governmental body or agency in connection with code enforcement or a public improvement or development program; or (iii) Action by an owner that results in an applicant's having to vacate his or her unit, where: (A) The reason for the owner's action is beyond an applicant's ability to control or prevent; (B) The action occurs despite an applicant's having met all previously imposed conditions of occupancy; and (C The action taken is other than a rent increase. (3) An applicant is also involuntarily displaced if- (I The applicant has vacated the dwelling where be or she resides as a result of actual or threatened physical violence directed against the applicant or one or more members of the applicant's family by a spouse or other member of the applicant's household; or (ii) The applicant lives in a housing unit with such an Individual who engages in such violence. (iii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. the actual or threatened violence must, as determined by the IMA in accordance with HUD's administrative instructions, have occurred recently or be of a continuing nature. The IHA may limit use of this preference to a family that will not include the abuser. (4)(i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, reasons for an applicant's having to vacate a housing unit include, but are not limited to, conversion of an applicant's housing unit to non-rental or non-residential use; closure of an applicant's housing unit for rehabilitation or for any other reason; notice to an applicant that the owner wants the unit for the owner'spersonal or family use or occupancy; sale of a housing unit in which an applicant resides under an agreement that the unit must be vacant when OSsession is transferred; or any other egally authorized act that results or will result in the withdrawal by the owner of the unit or structure from the rental market. (ii) Such reasons do not include the vacating of a unit by a tenant as a result of actions taken because of the tenant's refusal- (A) To comply with applicable program policies and procedures under this part with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowded units; or (B) To accept a transfer to another housing unit in accordance with such policies and procedures under a HUD- approved desegregation plan. (e) Verification procedures for applicants involuntarily displaced. Verification of an applicant's involuntary displacement is established by the following documentation: (1) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government that an applicant has been or will be displaced as a result of a disaster, as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section; (2) Certification. in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government that an applicant has been or will he displaced by government action, as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; (3) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from an owner or owner's agent that an applicant had to, or will have to, vacate a unit by a date certain because of an owner action referred to in paragraph (d)(1) iii) of this section; or (4) Certification, In a form prescribed by the Secretary, of displacement because of the domestic violence referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, from the local police department, social services agency, or court of competent jurisdiction, or a member of the clergy, physician, or public or private facility that provides shelter or counseling to the victims of domestic violence.

(5) In the case of members of a cooperative, rent under this section means the charges under the occupancy agreement between the members and the cooperative. (6) An applicant may not qualify for a federal preference under this provision: (i) f the applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income to rent a unit because the applicant's housing assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937, under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 (\"rent supplement program\"), or under section 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act (\"rental assistance payments\") with respect to that unit has been terminated as a result of the applicant's documented refusal to comply with applicable program policies and procedures with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowded units; or (ii) If the applicant has been paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent for less than 90 days. (j) Verification of an applicant's income and rent. The IHA must verify that an applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent, as follows: (1) The HA must verify the family's income in accordance with the standards and procedures that it uses to verify income for purposes of determining applicant eligibility and Total Tenant Payment under this part. (2) The IHA must verify the amount due to the family's landlord (or cooperative) under the lease or occupancy agreement: (i) By requiring the family to furnish copies of its most recent rental (or cooperative charges) receipts (which may include canceled checks or money order receipts) or a copy of the family's current lease or occupancy agreement, or (ii) By contacting the landlord (or cooperative) or its agent directly. (3] The HA must verify the amount paid to amortize the purchase price of a manufactured home: (i) By requiring the family to furnish copies of its most recent payment receipts (which may include canceled checks or money order receipts) or a copy of the family's current purchase agreement, or (ii) By contacting the lienholder directly. (4) To verify the actual amount that a family paid for utilities and other housing services, theHIA must require the family to provide copies of the appropriate bills or receipts, or must obtain the information directly from the utility or service supplier. (k) Notice and opportunity for a meeting where federal preference is denied. If the IRA determines that an applicant does not meet the criteria for receiving a federal preference, the IHAmust promptly provide the applicant with written notice of the determination. The notice must cmtain, a brief statement of the reasons for the determination, and state that the applicant has the right to meet with the IHA to review it. (See, for example, procedures specified in \u00a7 905.340.) The applicant also may exercise other rights, such as rights granted under Federal, State, or local civil rights laws, if the applicant believes that he or she has been discriminated against on prohibited bases such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or familial status. 24. Section 905.305 ,would be revised to read as follows: \u00a7 905.305 Local preforences. (a) General. In addition to its system of administering the federal preferences, the IHA may have a system for selection of families on the basis of local preferences. (b) Adoption of local preferences. (1) General. The HA system of selection on the basis of local preferences must be established to respond to local housing needs and priorities after the IHA conducts a public hearing on the subject. The preferences established after a public hearing and that are used for this purpose are those that are referred to throughout this subpart as \"local preferences.\" When the IHA wants to revise these local preferences, it must again conduct a public hearing on the subject. (2) Transition. After the expiration of three months after [Insert the effective date of the final rule], if the IHA has not adopted local preferences following a public hearing, no local preferences will be in effect, and the federal preferences will be used exclusively (in accordance with \u00a7 905.304), until such time as local preferences are duly adopted. Similarly, if the HA has not submitted its residency preference provisions for HUD approval by that time, the IHA will not be permitted to use residency preference for any purpose. (c) Examples of local preferences. Examples of local preferences an IHA might adopt are stated in section 6(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(cX4)(A(ii). Another example would be a local preference for admitting tenants with a broad range of incomes to each project. (d) Use of local preferences. Admission of an applicant based on qualification for a local preference (\"local preference admission\") is permitted until the admission would cause the IHA's local preference admissions for the year to exceed the44983 44984 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules percentage limitation for such admissions described in \u00a7 905.303(b)(2)(ii). 25. Section 905.416 would be amended by removing from paragraph (d) the phrase, \"Federal preference in accordance with \u00a7 905.305\", and adding in its place the phrase, \"federal or local preference, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 905.303-905.305\"; by removing from paragraph (f) the reference to \u00a7 905.305 and adding in its place the reference to \u00a7 905.304; and by revising paragraph (a)(3), to read as follows: %905.416 Selection of MH homebuyers. (a) * * * (3) Different standards for MH program. (i) The IHA's admission policies for MHi projects should be different from those for its rental or Turnkey M projects. The policies for the MH program should provide standards for determining a homebuyer's: .(A) Ability to provide maintenance for the unit; and (B) Potential for maintaining at least the current income level. (ii) The policies for the Mutual Help program must include procedures for determining the successor to a unit upon the death of a homebuyer (in the event that the homebuyer has not designated a successor or the successor fails to qualify). * * * * 26. In \u00a7 905.1008, the introductory text and the first sentence of paragraph (a) would be revised to read as follows: \u00a7905.1006 Purchaser eligibility and selection. Standards and procedures for eligibility and selection of the initial purchasers of individual dwellings shall be consistent with the following provisions: (a) Subject to the preference provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 905.303-905.305 and any additional eligibility and preference standards that are required or permitted under this section, a homeownership plan may provide for the eligibility of residents of public housing owned or leased by the seller IHA, and residents of other housing who are receiving housing assistance under Section 8 of the Act, under an ACC administered by the seller IHA; provided that the resident has been in lawful occupancy for a minimum period specified in the plan (not less than 30 days prior to conveyance of title to the dwelling to be purchased). * * * * * * *PART 906-SECTION 5(h) HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAM 27. The authority citation for part 906 would be revised to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437c(h), 1437d, and 3535(d). 28. In \u00a7 906.8, the introductory text and the first sentence of paragraph (a) would be revised to read as follows: \u00a7906.8 Purcheser eligibility and selection. Standards and procedures for eligibility and selection of the initial purchasers of individual dwellings shall be consistent with the following provisions: (a) Subject to the preference provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 960.211-960.213 (except for the restriction in \u00a7 960.212 against use of a ranking preference that would cause selection of a relatively higher income family and the limitation of \u00a7 960.213(d)(2)) and any additional eligibility and preference standards that are required or permitted under this section, a homeownership plan may provide for the eligibility of residents of public housing owned or leased by the seller PHA, and residents of other housing who are receiving housing assistance under Section 8 of the Act, under an ACC administered by the seller PHA; provided that the resident has been in lawful occupancy for a minimum period specified in the plan (not less than 30 days prior to conveyance of title to the dwelling to be purchased.) * * * * * * * * PART 960-ADMISSION TO, AND OCCUPANCY OF, PUBLIC HOUSING 29. The authority citation for part 960 would be revised to read as follows: Authority: 42 revised to read as follows: \u00a7960.203 Nondiscrimination requirements. The tenant selection criteria and requirements used by a PHA must be established and implemented in accordance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 100, 108, 109, and 110; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C.' 6101-6107) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 146;Executive Order 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107; the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101-12213) to the extent applicable; and other applicable Federal, State and local laws prohibiting discrimination and promoting equal opportunity. Any tenant selection preferences must also be consistent with HUD's affirmative fair housing objectives. 31. Section 960.204 would be revised to read as follows: \u00a7 960.204 Tenant selection policies. (a) Selection policies. (1) The PHA shall establish and adopt written policies for admission of tenants. (2) These policies shall be designed: (i) To assure that, to the maximum extent feasible, each project of the agency will include families with a broad range of incomes and will avoid concentrations of low-income and deprived families with serious social problems; (ii) To preclude admission of applicants whose habits and practices reasonably may be expected to have a detrimental effect on the participants or the project environment; (iii) To give a preference in selection of tenants to applicants who qualify for a federal or local preference, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 960.211-960.213; and (iv) To assure that selection by the PHA among otherwise eligible applicants is objective and reasonable. (3) The PHA tenant selection policies shall include the following: (i) Requirements for applications and waiting lists, including procedures for selection from the top of the list (see 24 CFR 1.4); (ii) Description of the standards and procedures for selection of applicants, including any preferences to be applied: the federal preferences, as specified in \u00a7 960.212, the local preferences adopted by the PHA in accordance with \u00a7 960.213, and any ranking preferences it uses to distinguish among the federal preferences; (iii) Procedures for verification and documentation of information relevant to acceptance or rejection of an applicant; and (iv) Procedures governing participant transfer between units, projects, and programs, including a requirement that a participant is not eligible for voluntary transfer unless all obligations under the current program have been met, including payment of charges to the PHA and completion of maintenance reuirements. These selection policies shall: Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules (1) Be duly adopted; and (2) Be publicized by posting copies thereof in each office where applications are received and by furnishing copies to applicants or tenants upon request. (c) Such policies shall be submitted to the HUD field office upon request from that office and, in any event, if they contain a preference for those living in the jurisdiction of the PHA at the time of application (residency preference). (d) Residency provisions are subject to the following: (1) Residency requirements are not permitted; (2) A residency preference may not be based on how long the applicant has resided in the jurisdiction; (3) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in the jurisdiction shall be treated as residents of the jurisdiction; and (4) They must be approved in advance by HUD. 32. In S 960.205, paragraphs (a) and (c) would be revised to read as follows: \u00a7 906206 Standrda for PHA tenant (a) The criteria to be established and information to be considered shall be reasonably related to individual attributes and behavior of an applicant and shall not be related to those which may be Imputed to a particular group or category of persons of which an applicant may be a member, such as families with children born out of wedlock. This prohibition shall not apply to selection criteria or preferences based on a family's employment status. (c) Subject to the requirements and limitations of part 913 of this chapter, the criteria to be established shall be reasonably related to achieving the basic objective of attaining, to the maximum extent feasible, a tenant body in each project composed of families with a broad range of income, generally representative of the range of income of lower income families In the PHA's area of operation, as defined in State law. PHAs shall develop criteria, by local preference (see \u00a7 960.213) or otherwise, which will be reasonably calculated to attain the basic objective. The criteria developed shall be sufficiently flexible to assure administrative feasibility. A dwelling unit should not be allowed to remain vacant for the purpose of awaiting application by a family falling within the appropriate range. * * * a t*e960.206 IAmnded 33. In \u00a7 960.206, the last sentence of paragraph (a) would be amended by removing the reference to \"\u00a7 960.211,\" and adding in its place the phrase, \"S 960.212, or a local preference under \u00a7 960.213,\". 1960.2D7 [Amended) 34. In \u00a7 960.207, paragraph (a) would be amended by removing \"\u00a7 960.211\"' and adding In its place \"S 960.212\"; and paragraph (b) would be amended by removing the second sentence, including the material designated as paragraphs (b)(l) and (b)(2). 35. Section 960.211 would be revised to read as follows: J 960.211 Selection peerme.. (a) General. (1) Use of preference in selection process. (i) In selecting applicants for assistance under this part, the PHA must give preference, in accordance with this section, to applicants who are otherwise eligible and qualify for a federal preference, as described in \u00a7960.212, or any local preference, as described In \u00a7 960.213. (ii) Before applying the federal preferences and local preferences, the PHA will match other characteristics of the applicant with the type of unit available. For example, in selection of a family for a unit that has special accessibility features, the PHA will give preference to families that include persons with disabilities who can benefit from those features of the unit (see 24 CFR 8.27 and 100.202(c)(3)). Also, in selection of a family for a unit in a project for the elderly, the PHA will give preference to elderly families (see subpart D of this part). (2) System. (i) The PHA's system for applying the preferences, in accordance with its regulations, must inform all applicants of the availability of the federal preferences and any local preferences, and must offer applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for a preference. For purposes of this paragraph, applicants include families on any waiting list maintained by the PHA when this section is implemented or thereafter. (ii) If the PHA determines that the notification to all applicants on a waiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticable because of the length of the list, the PHA may provide this notification to fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The PHA must, however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given time that, on the basis of the PHA's determination of the number ofapplicants on the waiting list who already claim a federal preference and the anticipated number of project admissions: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's framework for applying the preferences under paragraph (b) of this section and the federal preferences claimed by those already on the waiting list, any applicant who has not been so notified would receive assistance before those who have received notification. (b) Application of preferences. (I) Federal and local preferences generally govern selection among families who qualify for a unit of a particular size under the PHA's occupancy policy. Date and time of application govern selection among families that qualify for the same housing unit size, the same federal preference status, the same local preference status, and any other applicable selection criteria. (2) In selecting tenants for units made available for occupancy during each year, the PHA will apply the preferences as follows: (i) For at least fifty percent of the admissions, admit applicants that qualify for'a federal preference before other applicants; and (ii) For any remaining admissions, admit first those applicants that qualify for a local preference (if any). (3) The percentage limitation is a factor in every admission. The PHA may consider an admission as a federal preference admission that is counted towards the percentage in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section when the applicant admitted is a federal preference holder and the selection is not based on a local preference whose purpose was to admit relatively higher income families. In addition, the PHA may consider an admission as a federal preference admission if no family that qualifies for the available unit qualifies for a federal preference, and the selection was not based on a local preference who purpose is to select higher income families. Any other admissions are counted towards the percentage in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. (4)(i) A family may not be granted a federal or local preference if any member of the family is a person or member ofa family evicted from housing assisted under the 1937 Act, during the past three years, because of drug-related criminal activity. \"Housing assisted under the 1937 Act\" means public or Indian housing, housing assisted with tenant-based or project- based assistance under Section 8 (2444985 44986 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules CFR part 982). rental rehabilitation program housing, Section 23 rental assistance, housing development grant housing, and Turnkey M and mutual help homeownership housing. However, the family may qualify for federal or local preference if each evicted person who engaged in such drug-related criminal activity who is a member of the family seeking admission to the program has successfully completed a rehabilitation program approved by the PHA. (ii) The PHA may waive the preference prohibition for drug-related criminal activity eviction. The PHA may waive the prohibition for an evicted person if the evicted person demonstrates to the PHA's satisfaction either that the evicted person clearly did not participate in and had no knowledge of the drug-related criminal activity, or that circumstances leading to eviction no longer exist. 36. A new \u00a7 960.212 would be added, to read as follows: S960.212 Federal preferences. (a) Definition. A federal preference is a preference under federal law for selection of families that are: (1) Involuntarily displaced; (2) Living in substandard housing; or (3) Paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent. (b) Application of federal preferences. (1) Unless the PHA submits alternative definitions for HUD's review and approval, the PHA must apply the definitions of the following terms in this section: applying the federal preferences, the PHA will use the verification procedures contained in this section, unless it has adopted verification procedures of its own. (2) In applying the federal preferences, the PHA may determine the relative weight of the federal preferences through means such as: (i) Applying ranking preferences (which may be the same as those adopted in accordance with \u00a7 960.213)-except for any ranking preference the purpose of which is to select a relatively higher income applicant--as a way of selecting families from among those who qualify for a federal preference (i.e., provide that applicants who qualify for a federal preference and a PHA ranking preference take precedence over a federal preference holder who does not qualify for a PHA ranking preference);(ii) Aggregating the federal preferences (e.g., provide that two ederal preferences outweigh one); (iii) Ranking the federal preferences (e.g.. provide that an applicant living in substandard housing has greater need for housing than--and, therefore, would be considered for assistance before--an applicant paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent); or (iv) Ranking the definitional elements of a federal preference (e.g., provide that those living in housing that is dilapidated or has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of government have a greater need for housing than those whose housing issubstandard only because it does nothave usable bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family). (c) Certification and verification of qualification for a federal preference. (1) Certification. Applicants may claim qualification for a federal preference by certifying when they apply for assistance under this part (or thereafter until the time that they are offered admission) to the PHA that the family qualifies. The PHA must accept this certification unless it verifies that the applicant is not qualified for a federal preference. (2) Verification. Before an applicant is selected for admission on the basis of a federal preference, the PHA must require the applicant to provide verification that the family qualifies for a federal preference by virtue of the applicant's current status. The applicant's current status must be determined without regard to whether there has been a change in the applicant's qualification for a preference between the certification and selection for admission, including a change from one federal preference category to another. Once verified, the applicant's qualification for a federal preference need not be verified again, unless the PHA determines that the length of time since verification makes it desirable or the PHA has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant no longer qualifies for a federal preference. (d) Definition of involuntary displacement. (1) For qualification on the basis of involuntary displacement, the applicant must have been involuntarily displaced or be certain of displacement within no more than six months from the certification or verification (as appropriate), and must not be living in standard, permanent replacement housing. Standard, permanent replacement housing is housing that is decent, safe and sanitary; that is adequate for the family size; and thatthe family is occupying pursuant to a lease or occupancy agreement. Such housing does not include transient facilities, such as motels, hotels, or temporary shelters for victims of domestic violence or homeless families, and, in the case of domestic violence, does not include the housing unit in which the applicant and the applicant's spouse or other member of the household who engages in such violence live. (2) An applicant is or will be involuntarily displaced if the applicant has vacated or will have to vacate the dwelling where he or she resides as a result of one or more of the following actions: i) A disaster, such as a fire or flood' that results in the uninhabitability of an applicant's unit; (ii) Activity carried on by an agency of the United States or by any State or local governmental body or agency in connection with code enforcement or a public improvement or development proram; or (ii) Action by an owner that results in an applicant's having to vacate his or her unit, where: (A) The reason for the owner's action is beyond an applicant's ability to control or prevent; (B) The action occurs despite an applicant's having met all previously imposed conditions of occupancy; and (C) The action taken is other than a rent increase. (3) An applicant is also involuntarily displaced if- (i) The applicant has vacated the dwelling where he or she resides as a result of actual or threatened physical violence directed against the applicant or one or more members of the applicant's family by a spouse or other member of the applicant's household; or (ii) The applicant lives in a housing unit with such an individual who engages in such violence. (iii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the actual or threatened violence must, as determined by the PHA in accordance with HUD's administrative instructions, have occurred recently or be of a continuing nature. The PHA may limit use of this preference to a family who will not include the abuser. (4)(i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, reasons for an applicant's having to vacate a housing unit include, but are not limited to, conversion of an applicant's housing unit to non-rental or non-residential use; closure of an applicant's housing unit for rehabilitation or for any other reason; notice to an applicant that the owner wants the unit for the owner's Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules personal or family use or occupancy; sale of a housing unit in which an applicant resides under an agreement that the unit must be vacant when possession is transferred; or any other legally authorized act that results or will result in the withdrawal by the owner of the unit or structure from the rental market. - (ii) Such reasons do not include the vacating of a unit by a tenant as a result of actions taken because of the tenant's refusal- (A) To comply with applicable program policies and procedures under this part with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowded units; or (B) To accept a transfer to another housing unit in accordance with such policies and procedures under a HUD- approved desegregation plan. (e) Verification procedures for applicants involuntarily displaced. Verification of an applicant's involuntary displacement is established by the following documentation: (1) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government that an applicant has been or will be displaced as a result of a disaster, as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section; (2) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government that an applicant has been or will be displaced by government action, as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; (3) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from an owner or owner's agent that an applicant had to, or will have to, vacate a unit by a date certain because of an owner action referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section; or (4) Certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, of displacement because of the domestic violence referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, from the local police department, social services agency, or court of competent jurisdiction, or a member of the clergy, physician, or public or private facility that provides shelter or counseling to the victims of domestic violence. (f) Definition of substandard housing. (1) A unit is substandard if it: (i) Is dilapidated; (ii) Does not have operable indoor plumbing; (iii) Does not have a usable flush toilet inside the unit for the exclusive use of a family; (iv) Does not have a usable bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of a family;(v) Does not have electricity, or has inadequate or unsafe electrical service; (vi) Does not have a safe or adequate source of heat; (vii) Should, but does not, have a kitchen; or (viii) Has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of government. (2) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, a housing unit is not substandard because it is overcrowded or more than one family lives in the same unit. (3) For purposes of paragraph (fI(1) of this section, a housing unit is dilapidated if it does not provide safe and adequate shelter, and in its present condition endangers the health, safety, or well-being of a family, or it has one or more critical defects, or a combination of intermediate defects in sufficient number or extent to require considerable repair or rebuilding. The defects may involve original construction, or they may result from continued neglect or repair or from serious damage to the structure. (4) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, an applicant who is a \"homeless family\" is living in substandard housing. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a \"homeless family\" includes any individual or family who: (i) Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and (ii) Has a primary nighttime residence that is: (A) A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill); (B) An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized: or (C) A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. A \"homeless family\" does not include any individual imprisoned or otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of Congress or a State law. (5) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing (as defined in 24 CFR 882.102) is not substandard solely because it does not contain sanitary or food preparation facilities (or both). (g) Verification procedures for applicants living in substandard housing. Verification that an applicant is living in substandard housing consists of certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, from a unit or agency of government or from anapplicant's present landlord that the applicant's unit has one or more of the deficiencies listed in, or the unit's condition is as described in, the definition of \"substandard housing\" in this section, or that adopted by the PHA. In the case of a \"homeless family\" (as described in this section), verification consists of certification, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, of this status from a public or private facility that provides shelter for such individuals, or from the local police department or social services agency. (h) Definition of family income. For purposes of this section, family income is Monthly Income, as defined in 24 CFR 913.102. (i) Definition of rent. (1) For purposes of this section, rent is defined as: i) The actual amount due, calculated on a mostly basis, under a lease or occupancy agreement between a family and the family's current landlord; and (ii) In the case of utilities purchased directly by tenants from utility providers, (A) The utility allowance (if any) determined for the Section 8 Existing Housing program under 24 CFR part 882, subparts A and B, for tenant- purchased utilities (except telephone) and the other housing services that are normally included in rent; or (B) If the family chooses, the average monthly payments that it actually made for these utilities and services for the most recent 12-month period or, if information is not obtainable for the entire period, for an appropriate recent period. (2) For purposes of calculating rent, amounts paid to or on behalf of a family under any energy assistance program must be subtracted from the otherwise applicable rental amount, to the extent that they are not included in the family's income. (3) In the case of an applicant who owns a manufactured home, but who rents the space upon which it is located, rent includes the monthly payment to amortize the purchase price of the home, calculated in accordance with HUD's requirements. (4) In the case of members of a cooperative, rent under this section means the charges under the occupancy agreement between the members and the cooperative. (5) An applicant may not qualify for a federal preference under this provision: (i) If the applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income to rent a unit because the applicant's housing assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937, under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development44987 44988 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules Act of 1965 (\"rent supplement program\"), or under section 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act (\"rental assistance payments\") with respect to that unit has been terminated as a result of the applicant's documented refusal to comply with applicable program policies and procedures with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowded units; or (ii) If the applicant has been paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent for less than 90 days. (j) Verification of an applicant's income and rent. The PHA must verify that an applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent, asfllows: (1) The PHA must verify the family's income in accordance with the standards and procedures that it uses to verify income for purposes of determining applicant eligibility and Total Tenant Payment under this part. (2) The PHA must verify the amount due to the family's landlord (or cooperative) under the leaso or occupancy agreement: i By requiring the family to furish copies of its most recent rental (or cooperative charges) receipts (which may include canceled checks or money order receipts) or a copy of the family's current lease or occupancy agreement. or (ii) By contacting the landlord (or cooperative) or its agent directly. (3) The PHA must verify the amount paid to amortize the purchase price of a manufactured home: (i) By requiring the family to furnish copies of its most recent payment receipts (which may include canceled checks or money order receipts) or a copy of the family's current purchase agreement, or (ii) By contacting the lienholder di;rectl (4) %IO verify the actual amount that a family paid for utilities and otherhousing services, the PHA must require the family to provide copies of the appropriate bills or receipts, or must obtain the information directly from the utility or service supplier. (k) Notice and opportunity for a meeting where federal preference is denied. If the PHA determines that an applicant does not meet the criteria for receiving a federal preference, the PHA must promptly provide the applicant with written notice of the determination. The notice must contain a brief statement of the reasons for the determination, and state that the applicant has the right to meet with the PHA to review it. (See, for example, procedures specified in 24 CFR part 966.) The applicant also may exercise other rights, such as ights granted under Federal. State, or local civil rights laws, if the applicant believes that he or she has been discriminated against on prohibited bases such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age. handicap, or familial status. 37. A new \u00a7 960.213 would be added, to read as follows: \u00a7960.213 Local preferancea. (a) General. In addition to its system of administering the federal preferences, the PHA may have a system for selection of tenants on the basis of local preferences. fb) Adoption of local preferences. (1) General. The PHA system of selection on the basis of local preferences must be established to respond to local housing needs and priorities (e.g., as expressed in the local comprehensive housing affordability strategy, prepared in accordance with 24 CFR part 91). after the PHA conducts a public hearing on the subject. The preferences established after a public hearing and that are used for this purpose are those that are referred to throughout this subpart as\"local preferences,\" it must again conduct a public hearing on the subject. (2) Transition. After the expiration of three months after [the effective date of a final rule], if the PHA has not adopted local preferences following a public hearing, no local preferences will be in effect, and the federal preferences will be used exclusively (in accordance with \u00a7 960.212), until such time as local preferences are duly adopted. Similarly, if the PHA has not submitted its residency preference provisions for HUD approval by that time, the PKA will not be permitted to use residency preference for any purpose. (c) Examples of local preferences. Examples of local preferences a PHA might adopt are stated in section 6(c)(4{A){ii) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(c)(4)(A)(ii). Another example would be a local preference for admitting tenants with a broad range of incomes to each project. (d) Use of local preferences. (1) Admissions of an applicant based on qualification for a local preference (\"local preference admission\") is permitted until the admission would cause the PHA's local preference admissions for the year to exceed the percentage limitation for such admissions described in \u00a7 960.211(b)(2)(ii). (2) Selection of a higher income family that is lower on the waiting list is permitted where it is a selection from a waiting list in accordance with a duly- adopted system of local preferences. (But see 24 CFR 913.105 for other income-related restrictions on selection.) Dated: July 29, 1993. Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing revisions to its pesticide tolerance crop grouping regulations, which allow establishment of tolerances for multiple related crops based upon data from a representative set of crops. The revisions would create new crop subgroups, expand existing crop groups by adding new commodities, and revise the representative crops in some groups. The current crop grouping scheme has been underused since its establishment in 1983. EPA believes that these revisions will promote greater use of crop grouping for tolerance-setting purposes, and in particular will assist in retaining or making available pesticides for minor crop uses.

Background EPA is authorized to establish tolerances for pesticide residues in raw agricultural commodities under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a). To establish a tolerance, a petition is submitted to the Agency, requesting the tolerance and furnishing information on the chemical identity and composition of the pesticide, and its use pattern on the crop, toxicology data, and extensive residue data on the nature of the residue and the residue levels resulting from the proposed use pattern. One of the principal data requirements pertaining to establishment of a tolerance is the requirement for magnitude of residue data on the treated commodity. These data are used by EPA to determine the appropriate tolerance level for the treated commodity. The magnitude of residue must be determined in field trials using the pesticide in accordance with its proposed use pattern. Tolerances may be proposed for individual commodities such as oranges or lemons, or for a group of related commodities such as the citrus crop group. The crop grouping regulations currently in 40 CFR 18t).34(0 enable the establishment of tolerances for a group of crops based on residue data for certain crops that are representative of the group. The crop grouping concept leads to an estimate of the maximum level of residue that could occur on any crop within the group. The minimum data base required for a group tolerance consists of residue data on all of the representative commodities for a group. Data may be submitted, however, for a suitable substitute in place of data for a designated representative commodity. Once the crop group tolerance is established, the tolerance level applies to all raw agricultural commodities within the group, unless a crop is specifically excluded. The concept of utilizing crop grouping to estimate maximumpesticide residues on each commodity within a group of related commodities has been used since publication of crop grouping regulations in the Federal Register of December 6, 1962 (27 FR 12100). In the Federal Register of June 29, 1983 (48 FR 29855), EPA revised the crop group regulations to allow for more extensive use of group tolerances for related crops. The revised 40 CFR 180.34(o defined the crop groups involved and the procedures for establishing group tolerances. The 1983 rule replaced the existing crop groups in 40 CFR 180.34(0 with an expanded set of crop groupings. Included in the revised regulations was a list of representative crops for each group, these crops being those likely to have the highest residue and the most economically important crops in each group. Currently there are 19 crop groups, ranging in size from 4 commodities (Bulb vegetable group) to 34 commodities (Herbs and spices group). II. The Problem The current crop grouping scheme was developed, in part, to minimize the burden of developing data in support of commodity-specific tolerances for\"minor crops\" (i.e., crops for which data development in support of individual tolerances is not cost-efficient for the pesticide producer). A number of minor crops can be included in a group tolerance based upon residue data for the representative crops, for which a pesticide producer is more likely to ave an economic incentive to undertake the necessary residue data development. Despite this seemingly attractive means of securing clearances for minor crop residues in a cost-effective manner, only about 10 percent of the petitions submitted to EPA over the past 6 years proposed the establishment of crop group tolerances. The vast majority of petitions continue to propose commodity-specific tolerances. Although the concept of crop grouping is legally, scientifically, and economically sound, it appears that the current scheme suffers from practical impediments that have discouraged parties from seeking crop group tolerances. The success of the crop grouping scheme depends upon the incentives for, and willingness of, the pesticide industry to develop residue data for the representative crops of a group. The major difficulty of the current scheme is that pesticide companies frequently do not have sufficient economic incentive to generate data for all of the representative crops in a group. The cost Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 1 Proposed Rules of residue data is a significant factor in such decisions. A second cost obstacle to certain group tolerances is the cost of secondary residue data (livestock feeding studies and processing data) for certain .representative crops that greatly increase the cost of data development. Potatoes and sugar beets, two resntative crops for the Root and r vegetables group, and soybeans for the Legume vegetables group, require extensive processing residue data. Crop group tolerances for these groupings am not feasible unless the registrant has sufficient economic interest in these and the other representative commodities to develop the data required for a group tolerance. In other cases, corporate decisions about which crops warrant the costs of residue data development may be dictated by marketing or efficacy considerations. If the product has not been demonstrated tobe efficacious against the principal pests of the representative crops, such that it would warrant marketing to growers of those crops, the company is not likely to undertake residue data collection. A company's marketing strategy may lead it to market the pesticideonly in certain areas or for certain crops which do not constitute a set of representative crops. While evaluting the crop groupngs, EPA has d that cranberry. grape and strawberry, which are three of the five representative crops for the Small fruits and berries group, are basically unlike each other or the other berries in the group. Residue data are needed independently for each of these representative crops and for the other berries, which am similar among themselves and am represented adequately by the blueberry and blackberry or raspberry. The inclusion of three crops which ae dissimilar deters data development for the entire crop group. In the 10 years since the group was established, only a single crop group tolerance has been established. Finally, a -nneconomic factor that precludes the establishment of group tolerances is the variability in the residue profile and use patterns associated with crops in a group. If the use pattern or the actual residue levels among the representative crops are too variable (a difference of more than a factor of 5 between lowest and highest residues), a crop group tolerance cannot be scientifically supported. In summation, the current crop grouping scheme appears unwieldy for companies to use because a number of crop groups are too large or too variableto permit cost-effective applicatio.n of the crop group concept. The practical difficulties of realizing crop group tolerances have been highlighted by the apparent loss of minor crop uses (and associated tolerances) resulting from the 1988 amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Section 4 of FIFRA has imposed costs upon registrants for the registration and reregistration of pesticide products. While some of these costs ae direct, i.e., an annual fee for each registered product and a reregistration fee for each active ingredient, the indirect costs of data development to support tolerance reassessement are believed to be a more significant factor in the loss of pesticides for minor uses. This proposal should increase the usefulness of the crop grouping scheme, leading more companies and user groups to take advantage of it Ill. The Proposal A. Summary EPA ppos to amend the crop grouping schema in 40 CFR 180.34W in a number of ways, summarized here and discussed In detail in unit IV. of this preamble by crop group: 1. Format changes. EPA proposes to create a new section. S,180.40, devoted to the crop group scheme. Included is new language explaining the subgroup system, and a series of tables for ease of use and greater clarity and comprehensibility. EPA Is assigning each group a number for reference purposes. EPA is also adding an alphabetical listing of commodities with cross references to the assigned crop groups. Many of the crop group listings have been revised to some degree to reflect updated common and/or scientific names for various commodities. Finally, EPA proposes to locate its crop grouping scheme in new \u00a7\u00a7 180.40 and 180.41. Section 180.40 would contain the explanation of the crop grouping scheme, and J 180.41 would contain the tables of crop groups. 2. Creation of subgroupings. Subgmupings (smaller and more closely related groupings of commodities) are proposed for 8 of the 19 crop groupings. The commodities for each subgroup are a subset of the commodities of the associated -parent\" crop group. The number of representative commodities for each subgroup ranges from one to three commodities based on the size, diversity, and economic and dietary importance of the subgroup. The representative commodities for each subgroup were chosen from therepresentative commodities for the\"parent\" group. The eight crop groups for which subgroups are proposed incorporate approximately two-thirds of all food crops covered by the crop grouping scheme. The remaining 11 crop groups for which there are no proposals for subgroupings consist of animal feed commodities or smaller groupings of food commodities which have only two or three representative commodities. EPA requests comments on possible subgroups for other crop groups. 3. Revised representative commodities. Revisions to the representative commodities for the \"parent\" crop groups are proposed for six crop groups. EPA will continue to permit group tolerances, on a case-by- case basis, when data for acceptable substitutes for the representative commodities are available. 4. Additions. Additions to the crop groups (commodities not previously included in a crop group) are proposed for five crop groups and Included in the new subgroups. 5. Deletions. Deletion of cranberries, grapes, and strawberries from the Small fruits and berries group, and addition to the list of miscellaneous commodities not grouped in new S 180.41(b) is proposed. EPA does not propose to revise the \"factor of 5\" criterion. By allowing up to, but not more than, a factor of 5 between lowest and highest residues expected in the various commodity members of a crop group, there is a certain amount of flexibility in setting a crop group tolerance level without allowing too great a range of residues within the group. Although it is less likely that crops within a subgrotp will have residues that vary by as much as a factor of 5, the Agency will retain that approach to crop grouping. This will be important primarily for the parent crop groups, but will apply to subgroups if the need arises. 8., Technical corrections. Finally, EPA proposes to'revise 40 CFR 180.1Wg) to eliminate the inconsistency between that section and S 180.34(f) regarding the setting of crop group tolerances for systemic pesticides. The reference to \"negligible residues\" will be removed from \u00a7 180.1(g) since crop group tolerances set under \u00a7 180.34(f) have not been limited to negligible residue situations since 1983. Also, the limitation on grouping for systemic pesticides was eliminated in 1983 and will be removed.44991 44992 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules B. Specific Revisions This section discusses the current crop groups and explains the proposed revisions group by group. 1. Crop Group 1. Root and tuber vegetables group. EPA is proposing the creation of four subgroups: a. 1-A. Root vegetables. Vegetables that form a root which grows almost entirely underground, such as carrots, and vegetables that form an enlarged bulbous root which grows near or above the soil surface, such as the garden beet. b. 1-B. Root vegetables (except sugar beet). c. 1-C. Tuberous and corm vegetables. Vegetables in which the true tuber (enlarged fleshy underground stem), enlarged tuberous roots or rhizomes, or corms (thickened compressed underground stem) grow entirely underground and are consumed, such as sweet potato. d. 1-D. Tuberous and corm vegetables (except potato). Subgroups are proposed that include potatoes (Tuberous and corm vegetables) or exclude potatoes (Tuberous and corm vegetables (except potato)), and include sugar beets (Root vegetables) or exclude sugar beets (Root vegetables (except sugar beet)). Potatoes are the representative commodity for the Tuberous and corm vegetable subgroup, which includes potatoes, and sweet potatoes are the representative crop for the Tuberous and corm vegetable subgroup, which excludes potatoes. Similarly, carrots, radishes, and sugar beets are the representative crops for the Root vegetables subgroup, and carrots and radishes are the representative crops for the Root vegetables (except sugar beet) subgroup. The Agency initially considered having only two subgroups, Root vegetables (except sugar beet) and Tuberous and corm vegetables (except potato). Since data from both potato and sugar beet are needed to acquire a tolerance for the parent crop group, there seemed to be little need to have subgroups which would also require data from these commodities. However, EPA believes that a petitioner might have an interest in potato but not sugar beet or vice versa, or only in one of the subgroups containing potato or sugar beet. Since the intent of providing the new subgroups is to encourage additional group tolerances, the Agency is proposing four subgroups. These four subgroups will provide petitioners with a variety of options in the number of representative commodities for which they may generate residue data. Approximately half the total number of commoditiesincluded in the parent crop group are included in Subgroup 1-B. Root vegetables (except sugar beet) and can be covered by residue data from two representative commodities, carrot and radish. Sugar beet data are needed primarily to support a tolerance for sugar beet. Data from sweet potato may be used to support Subgroup 1-D. Tuberous andcorm vegetables (except potato) but is not an acceptable representative commodity for the parent crop group since processing data for potato are required for the parent crop group. The Agency considered creating a fifth subgroup which would have included the bulbous root vegetables, those vegetables that form an enlarged bulbous root which grows near or above the soil surface, such as table/garden beet, celeriac (celery root), rutabaga, and turnip, all of which are now proposed to be included in both of the Root vegetables subgroups; the representative commodity would have been the petitioner's choice of garden beet or turnip. However, neither garden beet nor turnip is currently a representative commodity for the parent crop group, and the Agency does not intend to revise the current representative crops for this group at this time. EPA believes it is inappropriate to have a representative commodity for a subgroup which is not also a representative commodity for the parent crop group. 2. Crop Group 2. Leaves of root and tuber vegetables group. EPA proposes to allow substitution of garden beet for sugar beet as a representative crop. Although sugar beet tops are used to a greater extent for animal feed compared to garden beet tops, the residue data to be derived from either of those commodities should serve equally well to determine the appropriate residue level for the other. A petitioner who is developing residue data for Subgroup 1- B. Root vegetables (except sugar beet) may be interested in pursuing a tolerance for Crop Group 2 if table/ garden beet data can be substituted for sugar beet data. 3. Crop Group 3. Bulb vegetables (Allium spp.) group. EPA proposes to revise the representative commodities for the crop group by designating onion (dry bulb and green) as the representative commodity. The representative commodities for the group are currently listed as onion (bulb and green) and one other commodity. The Bulb Vegetable group is a small group of closely related commodities that includes garlic, leek, onion, and shallot. Members of this group are marketed fresh (green) such as greenonion, leek, and green shallot, or they are dried such as dry bulb onion, garlic. and dry bulb shallot. Residue data for green and dry bulb onion are representative of the Bulb Vegetable group and are sufficient to support tolerances for the group. 4. Crop Group 4. Leafy vegetables (except Brassica vegetables) group. EPA proposes the creation of two subgroups: a. 4-A. Leafy greens. Leafy vegetable crops in which the leaves are the part primarily consumed, such as leaf and head lettuce and spinach; and b. 4-B. Leaf petioles. Leafy vegetable crops in which the petioles, stems, or stalks are the parts primarily consumed, such as celery. Most of the commodities included in the parent crop group will fall into the subgroup for leafy greens. A petitioner who is interested in leafy greens but not celery or other leaf petiole crops will be able to obtain the Leafy greens subgroup tolerance without celery data. Conversely, a petitioner with only celery data will be able to obtain a Leaf petiole subgroup tolerance. EPA proposes to add a new entry for radicchio (red chicory) to the parent group and to the Leafy greens subgroup 5. Crop Group 5. Brassica (cole) leafy vegetables group. EPA proposes the creation of two subgroups: a. 5-A. Head and stem Brassica. Brassica (cole) leafy vegetables in which the flower head and adjoining stems (or heads, formed of densely packed flowers, leaves, and stem material) or a bulbous stem are the parts primarily consumed, such as broccoli; and b. 5-B. Leafy Brassica greens. Brassica (cole) leafy vegetables in which heads are not formed, but the leaves are the parts primarily consumed, such as kale. Cauliflower will be added to the list of representative commodities for the parent group and the subgroup as an alternative to broccoli. EPA proposes to add a new entry for cavalo broccolo (a hybrid of cauliflower and broccoli) to the parent group and to the Head and stem Brassica subgroup. 6. Crop Group 6. Legume vegetables (succulent or dried) group. EPA proposes the creation of three subgroups: a. 6-A. Edible-podded legume vegetables. Legume vegetables in which both the pods and the enclosed seeds are the parts primarily consumed, such as snap beans; b. 6-B. Succulent shelled peas and beans. Legume vegetables in which the succulent seeds are removed from the pod and are the parts primarily consumed, such as garden peas; and c. 6-C. Dried shelled peas and beans (except soybeans). Legume vegetables in Federal Regiser / Vol. 58, No. 163 I Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules which the dried seeds are removed from the pod at maturity and are the parts primarily consumed, such as navy beans. Dried soybeans are excepted from the Dried shelled pea and bean subgroup in order to make the subgroup tolerances more attainable. Tolerances for dried soybeans can he obtained specific to the commodity or as a member of the Legume vegetables crop group. An additional commodity (soybean immature seed) has been added to both the parent group, and the subgroup and the entries have been clarified byincluding synonyms.7. Crop Group 7. Foliage of legume vegetables group. EPA proposes the creation of I subgroup: a. 7-A. Foliage of legume vegetables (except soybeans) subgroup. Plant parts of any legume vegetable included in the Legume vegetable group (except soybeans). Soybean foliage is excepted from the subgroup to make tolerances more attainable. A petitioner who is developing residue data for Subgroup 6c. Dried shelled peas and beans (except soybeans) may be interested in pursuing a tolerance for Subgroup 7-A if soybians are excluded. 8. Crop Group 8. Fruiting vegetables (except cucurbits) group. No changes. 9. Crop Group 9. Cucurbit vegetables group. EPA proposes to create two subgroups: a. 9-A. Melons. Fruits of varieties of muskmelons (Cucumis melo) or watermelons (Citruflus spp.) that have a firm to semi-firm outer rind and the interior pulp is edible, and a short storage life; and b. 9-B. Squash/cucumber. Fruits of the Gourd (Cucurbitaceae) family, including the cucumber. A third subgroup, for winter squash, was considered and rejected. Residue data from at least one representative commodity would be needed to support the winter squash subgroup tolerance. However, the current representative commodities for the parent crop group do net include any winter squash. Residue data for the representative commodity summer squash are considered sufficient to support winter squash as well. To add a winter squash to the representative commodities for the parent crop group would have been counterproductive. Instead, EPA proposes to include the summer squash and winter squash in the same subgroup, along with cucumber. The representative commodities for the subgroup will be cucumber and summer squash, both of which are representative commodities for the parent crop group. The parent and subgroups have been revised by adding new entries forMomordica spp., and expanding various entries to include synonyms. 10. Crop Group 10. Citrus fruits group. No changes. 11. Crop Group 11. Pome fruits group. No changes. 12. Crop Group 12. Stone fruits group. EPA proposes to revise the group by adding a new entry for plumcot (a hybrid of plums and apricots). 13. Crop Group 13. Berries group, EPA proposes to revise this crop group by removing cranberry, grape and strawberry and placing these commodities in S 180.41(b) as crops not grouped. These three commodities are sufficiently distinctive, with specific residue data requirements, that they are less representative of the group than of themselves. The remaining commodities in the group are all \"berries.\" The representative commodities for the new Berries group will be blueberry and one variety of blackberry or one variety of raspberry. It will be possible to obtain commodity-specific tolerances for cranberries, grapes and strawberries, but they will be excepted from the crop group and subgroups in order to make the group and subgroup tolerances more attainable. There is one established tolerance for the Small fruits and berries crop group and several tolerances for the pro-1983 crop group Small fruits. No revisions to the established tolerances are needed at this time to make this crop group revision consistent with existing tolerance rules. These tolerances will continue in effect until such time as the particular pesticides undergo the reregistration process. Further, EPA proposes to create two subgroups within the Berries group, a. 13-A. Caneberry (blackberry and raspberry); and b. 13-B. Bushberry. Includes Woody shrubs and bushes that produce fruit in clusters. In addition, the commodity entry for blackberries (Rubus spp.) will be clarified with the inclusion of additional Rubus 5pp. berries. 14. Crop Group 14. Tree nuts group. EPA proposes to delete English walnuts as a representative commodity for the group. A comparison of established pesticide tolerances for pecans and English walnuts shows that residues for the same pesticide are similar for both commodities. Pecans are preferred to English walnut as a representative commodity since they are more widely growl; more than 99 percent of the U.S. production of English walnuts are grown in California. Residue data for almonds and pecans, the remaining representative commodities, are considered adequate for establishingcrop group tolerances for the tree nuts group. 15. Crop Group 15. Cereal grains group. No changes. 16. Crop Group 16. Forage, fodder and straw of cereal grains group. No changes. 17. Crop Group 17. Gruss farage, fodder, and hay group. No changes. 18. Crop Group 18. Non-grass animal feeds Iforage, fodder, straw and hay) group. No changes. 19. Crop Group 19. Herbs and spices group. EPA proposes to create two subgroups: a. 19-A. Herbs. Herbs grown largely in temperate climatic areas, mostly for their leaves and stems and may be used fresh or dried, such as basil, and b. 19-B. Spices. Spices grown mostly in tropical climatic areas and consisting mostly of aromatic seeds, dried roots, flowers, fruit, and/or bark, such as allspice. EPA proposes to revise the representative commodities for the parent crop group to equitably reflect herbs and spices. The spices celery seed and dillseed, as alternates to each other, and black pepper will be representative commodities for the parent group and the new Spice subgroup. Chives and both fresh and dried forms of the herb basil will be representative commodities in both the parent crop group and the new Herb subgroup. Sage and marjoram or other Origanum spp. will be deleted as representative herb commodities for the group since the remaining representative commodities will provide sufficient residue data to support group tolerances. EPA also proposes to add new commodities to the parent group and subgroups. EPA requests comments and suggestions on additional groupings or subgroups. Any recommended changes to existing crop groupings or to those proposed in this document should be presented in a form which includes all necessary background and supporting information, such as a list of all commodities to be included. accompanied by scientific names if not already inciuded in the proposed regulation, naming all representative commodities and providing a rationale for selecting the particular commodities and representative commodities to be included. IV. International Considerations The current crop grouping scheme does not include all commodities produced or marketed in the U.S. Several commodities with regional production in the U.S., such as figs, hops, mushrooms, okra, peanuts, and44993 44994 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules watercress, were considered for grouping in 1983, but were determined to be inappropriate for grouping and were intentionally excluded. Other commodities such as bananas, mangoes, and papayas, which are primarily imported, were also determined to be inappropriate for grouping. Although the Agency does not propose to significantly expand the scope of the crop groupings at this time, EPA has initiated a project to develop options for harmonizing the U.S. crop groups with the International Codex Classification of Food and Feed Crops (CAC/PR 4-1989), which is a more extensive listing of commodities in trade. The CODEX classification of foods and animal feeds is intended to be as complete a listing of commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodities' similar potential for pesticide residues. The Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR), Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme, recommended at its 23rd Session in 1991 that national governments adopt the CODEX Classification of Food and Feeds. EPA recognizes the importance of establishing uniformity in commodity terms used to describe commodities in international trade and has initiated an evaluation of opportunities for harmonizing the CODEX and the U.S. commodity classification and crop grouping schemes. One aspect of this effort will be the large-scale evaluation of many crops classified by CODEX but not currently grouped by the U.S. to determine whether they can be incorporated into the U.S. crop grouping scheme. This evaluation will include commodities not previously considered for the U.S. groupings, as well as commodities that have previously been excluded from the crop groupings. EPA will also consider the addition of new crop groupings (such as a tropical fruit group) to more closely harmonize with the Codex system and to meet the needs of U.S. growers. The proposed revisions to the crop group regulations will not impede future efforts to harmonize the U.S. and CODEX commodity classifications. V.

Regulatory Requirements In order to satisfy requirements for analysis as specified by Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA has analyzed the costs and benefits of this proposal. This analysis (Economic Assessment: Proposed Revisions to the Crop Grouping Regulations) is available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, at the address given above. A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a rule is\"major\" and therefore subject to the requirement for a Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPA has determined that this proposal is not a \"major\" regulatory action, i.e., it will not result in: 1. An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; 2. A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions; or 3. Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. This rule revision is intended to promote greater utilization of crop grouping for tolerance-setting purposes by establishing subgroupings for certainexisting crop groups. The subgroupings will require supporting data from fewer representative crops, making subgroup tolerances easier to obtain. This proposed rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget as required by Executive Order 12291. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This regulatory action has been reviewed under the provision of section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and EPA has determined that it will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. As this regulatory action is intended to simplify established policy, it is anticipated that no adverse economic impact will occur on any small entity. Accordingly, EPA certifies that this regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. C Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Administrative practice and procedures, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests. Dated: August 13, 1993. Victor 1. Kimm, .Acting Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180--[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. In \u00a7 revising (g), to read as follows: 1180.1 Defintlone and Interpretation*. (g) For the purpose of computing fees as required by \u00a7 180.33, each group of related crops listed in \u00a7 180.34(e) and each crop group listed in \u00a7 180.41 is counted.as a single raw agricultural commodity in a petition or request for tolerances or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. 5 180.34 (Amended] 2. By amending \u00a7 180.34 Tests on the amount of residue remaining by removing paragraph (f).3. By adding new \u00a7 180.40, to read as follows: 5180.40 Tolerances for crop groups. (a) Group or subgroup tolerances may be established as a result of: (1) A petition from a person who has submitted an application for the registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. (2) On the initiative of the Administrator. (3) At the request of an interested person. (b) The tables in \u00a7 180.41 are to be used in conjunction with this section for the establishment of crop group tolerances. Each table in \u00a7 180.41 lists a group of raw agricultural commodities that are considered to be related for the purposes of this section. Refer also to \u00a7 180.1(h) for a listing of commodities for which established tolerances may be applied to certain other related and similar commodities. (c) When there is an established or proposed tolerance for all of the representative commodities for a specific group or subgroup of related commodities, a tolerance may be established for all commodities in the associated group or subgroup. Tolerances may be established for a crop group or, alternatively, tolerances may be established for one or more of the subgroups of a crop group. (d)The representative crops are given as an indication of the minimum residue chemistry data base acceptable to the Agency for the purposes of establishing a group tolerance. The Agency will take a flexible approach to allow for group tolerances when data on suitable substitutes for the representative crops are available (e.g., limes instead of lemons). (e) Since a group tolerance reflects maximum residues likely to occur on all individual crops within a group, the proposed or registered patterns of use for all crops in the group or subgroup must be similar before a group tolerance is established. The pattern of use consists of the amount of pesticide applied, the number of times applied, the timing of the first application, the interval between applications, and the interval between the last application and harvest. The pattern of use will also include the type of application; for example, soil or foliar application, or application by ground or aerial equipment. (f) When the crop grouping contains commoditiesor byproducts that are utilized for animal feed, a tolerance or exemption from a tolerance for the pesticide in meat, milk, poultry and/or44997 44998 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 163 I Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Proposed Rules eggs must be established before a tolerance will be granted for the group as a whole. This criterion, of course, applies only if the pesticide transfers to meat, milk, poultry and/or eggs. The representative crops include all crops in the group that could be processed such that residues may concentrate in processed food and/or feed. Processing data will be required prior to establishment of a group tolerance, and food additive tolerances will not be granted on a group basis. (g) If maximum residues (tolerances) for the representative crops vary by more than a factor of 5 from the maximum value observed for any crop in the group, a group tolerance will ordinarily not be established. In this case, individual crop tolerances, rather then group tolerances, will normally be established. (h) Alternatively, a commodity with a residue level significantly higher or lower than the other commodities in a group may be excluded from the group tolerance (e.g., cereal grains, except corn). In this case an individual tolerance at the appropriate level for the unique commodity would be established, if necessary. The alternative approach of excluding a commodity with a significantly higher or lower residue level will not be used toestablish a tolerance for a commodity subgroup. Most subgroups have only two representative commodities;, to exclude one such commodity and its related residue data would likely provide insufficient residue information to support the remainder of the subgroup. Residue data from crops additional to those representative crops in a grouping may be required for systemic pesticides. (i) The commodities included in the groups will be updated periodically either at the initiative of the Agency or at the request of an interested party. Persons interested in updating this section should contact the Registration Division of the Office of Pesticide Programs. (j) Establishment of a tolerance does not substitute for the additional need to register the pesticide under a companion law, the Federal Insecticide. Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The Registration Division of the Office of Pesticide Programs should be contacted concerning procedures for registration of new uses of a pesticide. 4. By adding new \u00a7 180.41, to read as follows:1180.41 Crop group tables. (a) The tables in this section are to be used in conjunction with \u00a7 180.40 to establish crop group tolerances. (b) Commodities not listed are not considered as included in the groups for the purposes of this paragraph, and individual tolerances must be established. Miscellaneous commodities intentionally not included in any group include asparagus, avocados, bananas, cranberries, figs, globe artichokes, grapes, hops, kiwifruit, mangoes, mushrooms, okra, papayas, pawpaws, peanuts, persimmons, pineapples, strawberries, water chestnuts, and watercress. (c) Each group is identified by a group name and consists of a list of representative commodities followed by a list of all commodity members for the group. If the group includes subgroups, each subgroup lists the subgroup name, the representative commodity or commodities, and the member commodities for the subgroup. (1) Crop Group 1: Root and Tuber Vegetables. (i) Representative commodities. Carrot, potato, radish, and sugar beet. (ii) Table.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are issuing today final regulations that implement the following actions with regard to the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404 regulatory program: (1) Modification of the definition of \"discharge of dredged material;\" (2) clarification of when the placement of pilings is a discharge of fill material; and (3) codification of the current policy that prior converted croplands are not waters of the United States. EPA is also issuing conforming changes to the definition of \"waters of the United States\" and \"navigable waters\" in other CWA program regulations. The first two changes implement the settlement agreement in North Carolina Wildlife Federation v. Tulloch, Civil No. C90- 713-CIV-5-BO (E.D.N.C. 1992). EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule becomes effective on [Insert 30 days from the publication in the Federal Register]. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Michael Davis, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works at (703) 695-1376 or Mr. Sam Collinson (Corps) at (202) 272-0199 or Mr. Gregory Peck (EPA) or Ms. Hazel Groman (EPA) at (202) 260-7799. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On February 28, 1992, the Federal government agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by the North Carolina Wildlife Federation and the National Wildlife Federation (North Carolina Wildlife Federation, et a]. v. Tulloch, Civil No. C90-713--CIV-5-BO (E.D.N.C. 1992)) involving CWA Section 404 as it pertains to certain activities in waters of the United States. In accordance with the settlement agreement, the Corps and EPA proposed changes to theirregulations on June 16, 1992 to clarify that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, and other excavation activities involve discharges of dredged material when performed in waters of the United States, and that these activities would be regulated under Section 404 of the CWA when they have or would have the effect of destroying or degrading waters of the United States, including wetlands. 57 FR 26894. In addition, the Corps and EPA agreed to propose to incorporate into the Section 404 regulations the substantive provisions of Corps Regulatory Guidance Letter (RGL) 90-8 to clarify the circumstances under which the placement of pilings have the effect of \"fill material\" and is subject to regulation under Section 404. The agencies stated that the proposal would not affect, in any manner, the existing statutory exemptions for normal farming, ranching, and silviculture activities in Section 404(f)(1). In addition to the changes proposed in accordance with the settlement agreement, the Corps and EPA proposed to incorporate into the Section 404 regulations the substantive provisions of Corps RGL 90-7 to clarify that prior converted croplands are not waters of the United States for purposes of the CWA. EPA also proposed conforming changes to the definitions of \"waters of the United States\" and \"navigable waters\" for all other CWA program regulations contained in 40 CFR parts 110, 112, 116, 117, 122, and 401 to provide consistent definitions in all CWA program regulations. Overall, these changes were proposed in order to promote national consistency, more clearly notify the public of regulatory requirements, ensure that the Section 404 regulatory program is more equitable to the regulated public, enhance the protection of waters of the United States, and clarify which areas in agricultural crop production would not be regulated as waters of the United States. The proposed changes were published in the Federal Register on June 16, 1992, for public comment. The comment period closed on August 17, 1992. We received over 6,300 comments. The significant issues raised by public comments and the changes that have been made from the proposed rule are discussed below. I. General Comments on the Proposed Rule Several commentors raised general issues with regard to the proposed rule. These comments are addressed first below. Comments relating to the specific components of the rule areaddressed in the following sections of this preamble. Several commentors expressed concern that the agencies had agreed to propose these revisions as part of a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the Tulloch lawsuit. These commentors felt that this procedural posture for the rulemaking impaired the agencies' ability to conduct the rulemaking impartially and based upon a good faith consideration of all public comments, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. The commitments the agencies entered in the settlement of the Tulloch case have not, in any way, bound the agencies to reach a predetermined outcome in this rulemaking. The agencies agreed in the settlement agreement to propose certain revisions to their regulations in exchange for the plaintiffs' agreement to stay that litigation. The settlement agreement in no way binds the agencies to an outcome in the final rule, but provides that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit will dismiss their action if the final rule is \"substantially similar\" in language and effect as the proposal. The agencies do not view the settlement agreement as narrowing our discretion in any manner to adopt a final rule that best reflects relevant legal and policy considerations under Section 404. Because this rulemaking is of great national significance to the Section 404 program, EPA and the Corps have pursued this rulemaking based upon careful consideration of all the policy issues raised in the proposal and addressed by public comments. The agencies would not adopt policies in this final rule that we do not believe are appropriate merely to avoid reinitiation of litigation in the Tulloch lawsuit. As reflected by the discussion in this preamble, the agencies have fully considered all the public comments received on the proposal, and we have therefore fully complied with the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. Several commentors recommended that no decision on the final rule be made until a wetland definition was agreed upon by Congress. Two commentors stated that the wetlands definition was too broad and that it was not applicable across the country. Similarly, two commentors stated that because the rulemaking regarding the wetlands delineation manual was not yet complete, it was inappropriate to propose changes that would expand activities in wetlands covered under the program, thereby increasing uncertainty about the Federal government's regulation of wetlands. Several commentors were concerned about how45008 Federal Register / Vol. 58,No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations No. 163 I Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations -45009 the functions and values of wetlands would be addressed or requested that a wetland classification systeal be developed. Some commentors requested that no decision be made until such a system was developed. We do not agree that these concerns should delay promulgation of this rule. With the exception of the prior converted (PC) cropland aspect of this rulemaking, this rule addresses the scope of activities regulated under Section 404. The question of what activities result in a discharge of dredged or fill material is distinct and separate from the issue of what areas constitute wetlands, or how wetlands functions and values are considered in the permitting process. Today's rule will enable the Corps and EPA to make appropriate determinations as to whether an activity occurring in waters of the U.S. is subject to regulation under Section 404, however wetlands are defined. Therefore, there is no reason to delay this rulemaking pending completion of the delineation manual rulemaking. With regard to the PC cropland portion of this rule, the agencies do not believe that completion of this rulemaking should await conclusion of the manual rulemaking. The proposed revisions to the delineation manual did not alter the policy finding in Corps RGL 90-7 that PC cropland is not wetlands under the Act. Since the applicability of Section 404 to PC cropland is not an issue in the delineation manual rulemaking, delaying completion of this rule is not warranted. In any case, EPA and the Corps are both currently making wetlands delineations using the 1987 Corps Manual. Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual (Technical Report 4-87-1, Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, MS). We believe that the guidance in that Manual is entirely consistent with our statutory and regulatory authorities under the CWA. Several commentors requested that the comment period be extended. We believe that a 60-day comment period was sufficient time to provide an opportunity for the public comment, as reflected by the fact that we have received over 6,300 comments on the proposal. At least one commentor requested that the agencies hold a public hearing on the proposal. The agencies have declined to do so. The comments on the proposal addressed many legal and factual issues that were presented in great detail in written submissions, and the agencies have fully considered the submitted documents'in developing the final rule.EPA and the Corps do not believe that the opportunity for meaningful public input or the agencies' understanding of public comments would have been materially advanced by the holding of a public hearing. Several commentors requested that the Corps districts work with local regulatory agencies to avoid duplication of effort. We agree and encourage districts to develop regional general permits to avoid duplication of effort for those activities with minimal impacts. III. Revisions to Definition of \"Discharge of Dredged Material 33 CFR 323.2(d) and 40 CFR 232.2(e) We have organized the numerous comments on the definition of discharge of dredged material into several issues. Our discussion of the comments is provided below. A. Summary of Major Issues and Changes From the Proposal The aspect of the rule which engendered the most public comment was the proposed revisions to the definition of \"discharge of dredged material.\" Many commentors supported the proposed revisions on the grounds that they would better achieve the goals of the Section 404 program, and help ensure more eqlial treatment of different types of activities that adversely impact wetlands. Opponents of the changes challenged the appropriateness of the proposed rule on both legal and factual grounds. In their legal arguments, many commentors contended that the proposal constituted a change in the Corps' longstanding approach to regulating landclearing and excavation activities, and that the agencies had failed to explain adequately the reasons for changing the existing approach, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Commentors also contended that EPA and the Corps lacked the authority under the CWA to regulate incidental discharges associated with mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation on the grounds that such incidental discharges do not constitute an \"addition\" of \"dredged material\" to waters of the U.S. within the meaning of the Act. These commentors also contended that the proposed rule would impermissibly regulate \"activities\" rather than \"discharges,\" something they argued was beyond the agencies' jurisdiction under the statute. Other commentors argued that the proposed rule's establishment of a presumption that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavationdestroy or degrade wetlands was contrary to the requirements of the CWA. Factual contentions raised by commentors centered on objections to the fin ing in the proposed rule that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation always result in a discharge of dredged material. Some commentors contended that the agencies had failed to compile an adequate factual record to support this finding, and a few commentors discussed activities which they believed did not result in a discharge. Some commentors also objected to the rebuttable presumption in the proposed rule that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation destroy or degrade wetlands or other waters of the United States. Commentors suggested specific activities that they believed should be excluded from the regulation on the grounds that they did not cause such effects. Concerns were also raised in public comments that the term \"degrade\" was not adequately defined by the agencies. Based upon public comments, the agencies have made certain changes to the language in the regulation defining \"discharge of dredged material.\" However, the basic thrust of the proposal had not changed. Under the final rule, any addition or redeposition of dredged material associated with any activity, including mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation, that destroys or degrades waters of the United States requires a Section 404 permit. The agencies have modified some of the language and structure of the final rule to improve clarity, since some public comments found the proposed rule language hard to follow. In response to public comments, we have decided to include definitions of the terms \"destroy\" and \"degrade\" in the final rule. These changes are discussed in section D.1, below. In response to public comments, the agencies have deleted the in'ebuttable presumption in the proposed rle that all mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation result in a discharge of dredged material. This change is discussed further in section C, below. The agencies have modified the structure of the final rule to provide that any addition, including redeposit, of dredged material associated with any activity, including mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation, constitutes a discharge of dredged material. The final rule states, however, that a Section 404Federal Register / Vol. 58, 45010 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations permit is not required for an activity that would not destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. because it would have only a de minimis effect on such waters. Under the final rule, mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation activities resulting in a redeposition of dredged material associated with a discharge of dredged material require a Section 404 permit unless the discharger demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, prior to the discharge, that the activity will not have such an effect. Under the final rule, the discharger bears the burden of demonstrating that its mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation activity will not destroy or degrade waters of the United States. B. Comments on Agencies' Legal Authority To Promulgate This Regulation Several commentors argued that EPA and the Corps lack legal authority under the Clean Water Act to issue the proposed regulation. Each of the bases for commentors' assertion is addressed below. 1. Definition of \"Dredged Material\" Several commentors argued that the term \"dredged material\" has a narrow and specific meaning as used by Congress in the Clean Water Act, and that Congress never intended incidental discharges associated with landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation to be regulated as dredged material under Section 404. These commentors cited a dictionary definition of the verb \"to dredge\" as moaning \"to gather and bring up with a dredge, as oysters; to clear out or deepen with a dredge, as a channel,\" and the definition of the noun \"dredge\" as \"a contrivance for gathering objects or material from the bed of a river, lake or harbor, by dragging along the bottom * * *. \"New Webster's Dictionary of the English Language 301 (1984). According to these commentors, therefore, the term \"dredged material\" in Section 404 is limited to material taken from the bottom of a harbor, river or channel and cannot be construed as extending to material redeposited in the course of activities taking place in other waters of the United States, such as wetlands. While these commentors argued that the meaning of the statutory language was so clear that recourse to the legislative history was not necessary, they contended that the legislative history of the 1972 Amendments of the Clean Water Act also supports their view,EPA and the Corps believe that these comments are unfounded, for several reasons. First, these comments are in fact not relevant to this rulemaking, for they do not address the revisions the agencies are making to the definition of the term \"discharge of dredged material.\" Rather, these comments challenge, in effect, the agencies' definition of the term \"dredged material\" which includes \"any material dredged or excavated from waters of the U.S.\" (see 40 CFR 232.2(g) and 33 CFR 323.2(c)). Presumably the commentors believe that this definition should have been revised so that it would be limited to material excavated from waterbodies such as harbors, rivers and channels. However, EPA and the Corps have not proposed to revise this longstanding definition in any respect in this rulemaking, and this comment is therefore not relevant to the proposal on which we solicited public comment. Even if these comments were relevant to this rulemaking, however, EPA and the Corps disagree with the commentors that the statutory term \"dredged material\" was expressly limited by Congress to mean material dredged from the bottom of waterways such as lakes, rivers or channels. While the \"narrow\" and \"specific\" definition of this term favoredby these commentors appears in the Webster's dictionary, it is not contained in any provision of the Clean Water Act. Congress therefore left to the agencies administering Section 404 the discretion to define this term. Since regulations were first promulgated implementing Section 404, the Corps has interpreted the term \"dredged material\" to mean any material excavated from waters subject to the full jurisdictional reach of the CWA (see 39 FR 12119, April 3, 1974), and the current language in the agencies' definition has been in existence since 1977 (see 42 FR 37145, July 19, 1977). This longstanding definition of the term \"dredged material\" is a straightforward and reasonable reading of the statutory language used by Congress. The commentors' approach to defining dredged material, in contrast, would draw arbitrary distinctions in how the CWA regulates identical types of material based upon whether the waterbody from which it was excavated met some vague standard of wetness and water depth (i.e., material excavated from the bottom of a \"lake\" would qualify as dredged material but material excavated from a \"drier\" water such as a saturated wetland would not). Such distinctions are without any support in the language or structure of the CWA. Because the commentors' approach does not reasonably reflect the structureof the Act, their suggested reading of the term \"dredged material\" would lead to anomalous results that we believe could not have bden intended by Congress. For example, under their scenario, material excavated from a saturated wetland presumably would not qualify as \"dredged material\" under Section 404. However, the disposal of that material into waters of the U.S. would nonetheless require a permit under the Act, since the material, even if not meeting the definition of \"dredged material,\" would in any case constitute a \"pollutant\" within the meaning of the Act (see section 502(6) of the Act, defining pollutant to include \"sand\" and \"rock\"). The disposal of such material, therefore, would require a permit under Section 402 of the Act, a regulatory provision ill-suited for authorizing such discharges. In our view, it is clearly more consistent with Congressional intent that all material dredged from and redeposited in waters of the U.S. be regulated under a single regulatory scheme-Section 404 of the CWA. Rather than draw the arbitrary distinctions suggested by these commentors, the agencies' definition of the term is a straightforward and logical interpretation of the statutory language in Section 404 that is consistent with the jurisdictional reach of Section 404 to all waters of the United States. While the legislative history of the 1972 Amendments to the Clean Water Act reflects Congressional concern regarding disposal of material dredged from waterways to maintain navigation, EPA and the Corps do not read that legislative history as demonstrating Congressional intent to limit narrowly the agencies' discretion to define dredged material so that it Includes any material excavated from waters of the U.S. The agencies' longstanding definition of this term is reasonable and fully consistent with the language and purposes of the Clean Water Act. 2. \"Addition\" of Pollutants to Waters of the U.S. Some commentors argued that the activities that would be subject to this regulation are beyond the scope of Section 404 because they do not result in the \"addition\" of pollutants to U.S. waters, as required by the definition of \"discharge\" contained in section 502(6) of the Clean Water Act. According to these commentors, no such \"addition\" occurs when the material to be excavated falls back into the very same water being dredged. An \"addition\" only takes place, these commentors believe, where material is excavated from one water of the U.S. and falls into\"another\" water, \"outside\" the area Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45011 being excavated. These commentors cited as support the decisions in National Wildlife Federation v. Consumers Power, 862 F.2d 580 (6th Cir. 1988); National Wildlife Federal v. Gorsuch, 693 F.2d 156, 174-75 (D.C. Cir. 1982); and U.S. v. Lambert, 18 Env't Cas (BNA) 1294 (M.D.Fl. 1981), affd 695 F.2d 536 (11th Cir. 1983). In Consumers Power and Gorsuch, environmental groups challenged EPA's longstanding interpretation of the CWA that impacts on water quality and fish caused by the operation of dams were not covered by the CWA because the dams did not cause an \"addition\" of pollutants. EPA's longheld view was that impacts resulting from the passage of water through the dam did not constitute an \"addition\" because pollutants did not enter the water \"from the outside world.\" See Gorsuch, 693 F.2d at 165. The Consumers Power and Gorsuch courts deferred to EPA's administrative interpretation of the CWA and upheld it as reasonable. Commentors argued that these holdings prevent EPA and the Corps from finding that redeposition of soil incidental to mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation constitutes an \"addition\" of pollutants. We do not believe that the analysis of the Gorsuch and Consumers Power decisions is controlling here. These cases did not address what constitutes an addition of dredged material to waters of the United States. In our view, it would not be reasonable to require that dredged material enter waters of the U.S. \"from the outside world\" since dredged material, by definition, is contained in the waters themselves. This was the conclusion of the Fifth Circuit in Avoyelles Sportsmen's League v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897 (5th Cir. 1983), which addressed the applicability of the Gorsuch case to mechanized landclearing activities. While the court did not rule on the question whether those activities resulted in a discharge of dredged material (finding that a discharge of fill material had occurred), the court rejected the notion that dredged material is only regulated if it enters waters from the \"outside world.\" Since dredged material comes from the water itself, the court concluded that such an interpretation \"would effectively remove the dredge-and-fill provision from the statute.\" 715 F.2d at 294, n.43. See also U.S. v. Sinclair Oil Co., 767 F.Supp. 200 (D.Mont. 1990) (distinguishing Gorsuch and Consumers Power cases partially on the grounds that they were decided under the\"separate regulatory framework\" of Section 402, and holding that redistribution of riverbed materialsconstituted a \"discharge\" of fill material). United States v. MCC of Florida, Inc., 772 F.2d 1501 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that redeposition of seabed materials by tug-boat propellers on adjacent sea grass beds was an\"addition\" of dredged spoil). Some commentors suggested that the appropriate test in this context should be whether dredged material is moved from \"one place to another\" or \"from one water to another.\" If the material is not moved in this manner, these commentors argued, it does not trigger Section 404. The agencies do not believe that such a vague test would be a meaningful or appropriate one to adopt in this rule. If dredged material must be\"moved\" from one \"location\" to another in order to trigger Section 404, the question arises as to how far the material must be moved. The agencies see a strong potential for drawing arbitrary distinctions among activities that may be identical in terms of the amount of soil redeposited and their effects on the aquatic ecosystem, but differ only in terms of the distance the soil is moved. EPA and the Corps certainly do not view such a distinction as legally compelled by the Clean Water Act. Commentors also cited as support for their position the decision of the district court in U.S. v. Lambert, Env't Rep. Cases (BNA) 1294 (M.D.Fla. 1981), (11th Cir.1983), which held that \"back-spill\" of dredged material into the area from which it was excavated could not be considered to be an \"addition\" of a pollutant. Notably, however, the Lambert case was decided before the Supreme Court decision in Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), which now establishes a deferential standard of review of agency actions where Congress has not specifically addressed an issue. EPA *and the Corps do not believe that Congress has specifically mandated in any provision of the CWA that redeposition of dredged material is only regulated if it is \"moved\" from one\"place\" to \"another.\" Rather than focus simply on the spatial relationship between where the excavation and redeposition occur as the deciding factor determining regulatory jurisdiction under Section 404, this rule will regulate an activity (involving a discharge to any part of waters of the U.S.) taking into account the effect of the activity on the aquatic environment. The agencies believe that this approach is entirely consistent with the language of the CWA, and better effectuates the environmental protection goals of the statute than the approach suggested by commentors. See CWA section 101(a).3. Regulation of \"Activities,\" Not \"Discharges\" Many commentors argued that the proposed rule was outside the agencies' authority under the CWA because the effects-based test for determining whether an activity requires a Section 404 permit impermissibly regulates\"activities,\" whereas the statute only authorizes regulation of \"discharges.\" These commentors also argued that if the agencies were to adopt the proposed rule, EPA and the Corps would be limited by Section 404 of the CWA to considering the environmental effects associated with the discharge itself, not the activity with which the discharge is associated. Commentors cited the decision of the district court in Reid v. Marsh, 20 Env't Rep. Cas. (BNA) 1337 (N.D.Ohio 1984) as supporting this argument. EPA and the Corps agree with the point made by these commentors that the presence of a \"discharge\" into waters of the U.S. is an absolute prerequisite to an assertion of regulatory jurisdiction under Section 404. Based on the clear language in section 301(a) of the CWA, this has been the agencies' longstanding position, and we are not altering that view in this rulemaking. For the reasons explained in this preamble, the agencies believe that addition or redeposition of dredged material in the course of activities such as mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation meets the discharge requirement of section 301(a). Because this rule will only regulate activities where the jurisdictional prerequisite of a \"discharge\" is present, EPA and the Corps disagree with commentors who argued that this rule is outside the scope of the agencies' authority under Section 404. Commentors are therefore flatly incorrect that this rule would trigger Section 404 jurisdiction over a discharge based upon the environmental effect of the associated activity. Under today's rule, the presence of certain environmental effects is not a prerequisite for Section 404 jurisdiction; rather, this rule looks to the environmental effects for purposes of creating an exception to the Section 404 permitting requirement that would otherwise apply to the discharge. Consideration of such effects is appropriate in order to ensure that the creation of a de minimis exception is consistent with the goals and objectives of Section 404. See discussion in section D, below. Sinc6 the agencies clearly have the authority under Section 404 to regulate all discharges of dredged 45012 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 I Rules and Regulations material into waters of the United States, without regard to effects on the aquatic environment, we fail to see how our decision in this rulemaking to regulate a subset of these activities could conceivably be overstepping our regulatory authority under Section 404. Because the only statutory condition for regulation under Section 404 is the presence of a \"discharge.\" commentors' arguments about the scope of environmental effects that can be considered under Section 404 are irrelevant to the findings that EPA and the Corps are making to support today's rule. To the extent commentors argued that EPA and the Corps can only consider the environmental effects of the discharge itself in adinlhistering Section 404 (i.e., in the Corps' parmitting process or EPA's Section 404(c) process), such comments are nGt relevant to this rulemaking, which addresses the circumstances when a discharge or dredged material will required a Section 404 permit, not how the discharge will be addressed in the permitting or 404(c) process. In any case, however, EPA and the Corps wish to clarify that consideration of the environmental effects of activities associated with discharges covered by this rule is well within the agencies' authority in carrying out their authorities under Section 404. Because the scope of the agencies' authority to consider environmental effects is not relevant to our authority to issue this rule, the following discussion is not provided as a legal justification of today's rule, but rather as an attempt to help the public understand how we administer the Section 404 program generally. Commentors' extremely narrow reading of the agencies' authority is first belied by the language of Section 404(f) of the Act, which was discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule. Section 404(f)(1) exempts certain activities from the requirement to obtain a Section 404 permit. Section 404(f)(2), however, requires that a permit nonetheless be obtained for \"any discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters incidental to any activity\" which has the purpose of changing the water's use and the effect of impairing the water's flow or circulation, or reducing its reach, Commentors criticized the citation of Section 404(f)(2) in the preamble to the proposed rule. They argued that this provision merely recaptures activities that are exempted under Section 404(f)(1). but that it does not expand the underlying scope of activities covered by the permit requirement of Section 404(a). Thesecommantore have misinterpreted the reason why the agencies cited Section 404(f)(2) in the preamble to the proposal. We agree with the commentors' point that Section 404(f)(2) does not expand the scope of activities subject to Section 404. However, the agencies do not rely on Section 404(f)(2) for such a proposition. Rather, we believe that Section 404(0(2) contradicts the argument that Congress Intended to preclude EPA and the Corps from considering under Section 404 the effects of activities associated with discharges of dredged or fill material, such as mechanized landclearing, ditching, channeization and other excavation. In Section 404(0(2), Congress expressly required EPA and the Corps to implement the statutory exemptions based upon consideration of not only the effects of the discharge itself, but also the effects of the activity \"incidental\" to the discharge. Because Congress expressly required the agencies to consider such effects under Section 404(0, we do not believe it would be reasonable to conclude that Congress nonetheless intended to prohibit EPA and the Corps from otherwise considering such effects under Section 404. Morever, EPA's longstanding interpretation of Section 404, as reflected in the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, demonstrates that EPA and the Corps are not limited to considering solely the environmental effects of the discharge itself. The Guidelines expressly require consideration of\"secondary effects,\" which are defined as effects on an aquatic ecosystem that are associated with a discharge of dredged or fill materials, but do not result from the actual placement of the dredged or fill material. 40 CFR 230.11(h). Where an activity such as mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation activities are performed in waters of the U.S. and result in a discharge of dredged material to those waters, we believe that such activities are clearly \"associated with\" the discharge, within the meaning of Section 230.11(h), and therefore considering the effects of those activities is properly within the scope of Section 404. Commentors nonetheless cite the decision in Reid v. Marsh, which addressed the Corps' authority to regulate dredging activities under Section 404. This case held that the Corps was limited under Section 404 to evaluating the effect of the discharge itself, and that the Corps could not look at the effects of the overall dredgingactivity. For the reasons noted above, however, Reid is simply not relevant to this rulemaking, since the sole trigger under this rule for asserting Section 404 jurisdiction is the presence of a \"discharge of dredged material,\" and the agencies therefore have clear authority to regulate the activities covered by today's rule. Reid did not address in any manner the scope of the agencies' authority to establish a de minimis exception under Section 404. In any case, we do not view the Reid decision as precluding EPA and the Corps from considering the effects of activities associated with a discharge of. dredged material in the Section 404 permitting or veto process. Notably, Reid was decided before the Supreme Court decision in Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC which, as discussed previously, now mandates that courts defer to any reasonable agency interpretation of a statute it administers unless Congress has specifically spoken to the question at issue. The Reid opinion failed to cite any provision of the Clean Water Act as precluding the Corps from looking yond the effects of the discharge itself; nor did Reid discuss at all the well-established administrative interpretation in the Guidelines that secondary effects must be considered in issuing permits under Section 404. Since the CWA does not reflect specific Congressional intent that EPA and the Corps be precluded from considering secondary effects under Section 404. the agencies retain broad discretion in deciding whether such an approach is appropriate. EPA and the Corps believe that considering the primary and secondary effects of a discharge is clearly consistent with the language and intent of Section 404 to ensure protection of the aquatic system from effects associated with the discharge of dredged and fill material. In addition, the Reid decision is at odds with the decision of the Tenth Circuit in Riverside Irrigation District v. Andrews, 758 F.2d 508 (10th Cir. 1985). In this case, the Corps denied nationwide permit coverage for the construction of a dam, the operation of which would have resulted in depleted stream flows that would adversely affect habitat of an endangered species. Even though the discharge of fill material itself to construct the dam would not have had an adverse impact, the court held that the CWA authorized the Corps to consider the total environmental Impact of the discharge, including in direct effects such as the impact of the operation of the dam on flows downstream and associated wildlife impacts.45012 Federal Reiser / Vol. 58,No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45013 Several commentors cited cases under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and Section 402 of the CWA as supporting their argument that EPA and the Corps are narrowly constrained to evaluating the effects of the discharge itself. For the reasons discussed previously, these cases are simply not on point because this rule properly triggers Section 404 jurisdiction based upon the presence of a \"discharge of dredged material,\" and arguments about the proper scope of environmental review under Section 404 are therefore not relevant to this rulemaking. In any case, for the reasons explained above, we disagree with commentors that EPA and the Corps are limited to considering only the direct effects of discharges themselves in implementing Section 404. 4. Authority Limited to Regulating Impacts on Water Quality A few commentors contended that EPA and the.Corps could only consider \"degradation\" of waters of the U.S. in terms of the impacts of an activity on chemical water quality. Some commentors cited for support for this argument the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Hoffman Homes v. EPA, 961 F.2d 1310 (7th Cir. 1991), reh. granted and opinion vacated, 35 ENV'T Rep. Cases (BNA) 1328 (7th Cir. Sept. 4, 1992). EPA and the Corps believe that this comment is erroneous. First, the decision in Hoffman Homes relied upon by some commentors has since been vacated by the Seventh Circuit. A new opinion issued by the Court in this case contains no support for the commentor's argument that the CWA is only intended to address impacts of an activity on chemical water quality (Hoffman Homes v. EPA, No. 90-8810 (uly 19, 1993)). We believe, moreover, that there is no support in the CWA as a whole or in Section 404 for the proposition that impacts to the aquatic ecosystem under Section 404 are limited to impacts on chemical water quality, as opposed to -impacts on other functions such as flood storage and wildlife habitat. First, the language in Section 404 itself repudiates the notion that EPA and the Corps may only evaluate impacts of a discharge on chemical water quality. For example, Section 404(c) authorizes EPA to deny or restrict specification of a disposal site for dredged or fill material if the disposal would have an unacceptable adverse effect on a range of aquatic system values, including \"shellfish bed and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas),\" \"wildlife,\" or\"recreational areas.\" There is no language in Section 404 indicating that the adverse impacts to these other aquatic functions are only remediable under Section 404 if the impacts result directly from impacts to chemical water quality. Similarly, Congress directed that the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines be based upon criteria comparable to the ocean discharge criteria contained in Section 403(c) of the Act. Section 403(c) states that guidelines for ocean discharges shall include consideration of impacts of a discharge on \"marine ecosystem diversity, productivity, and stability; and species and community population changes.\" Again, there is no language in Section 403(c) limiting the consideration of such impacts solely to those deriving directly from changes to chemical water quality itself. Therefore, the line that some commentors seek to draw around EPA's and the Corps' ability to protect the aquatic environment is simply not one that has been drawn by Congress. The agencies' interpretation of Section 404, as reflected in the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, reaffirms their responsibility to consider impacts of discharges on the broader aquatic ecosystem, and not just water quality itself. For example, 40 CFR 230.10(c) prohibits any discharge of dredged or fill material that would cause significantly adverse effects on ecosystem diversity, productivity and stability such as loss of fish and wildlife habitat. See also 40 CFR 230.32 (describing wildlife values that must be considered in the permitting process); 40 CFR 230.41 (describing how discharges of dredged or fill material may damage or destroy habitat and adversely affect the biological productivity of wetlands). 5. Reversal of Agency Position Commenters argued that the proposed rule was arbitrary because it represented an abandonment and reversal of an allegedly longstanding agency interpretation of the CWA, and because the agencies allegedly had failed to provide an adequate explanation of the change in policy. In certain respects this final rule represents a change in Corps regulations and policy, but some commenters seemed to overstate and exaggerate both the extent and the \"abruptness\" of that change. The Corps and EPA expect that the net effect of this rule will be that most projects involving mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, mining, or other excavation activity in waters of the U.S. will require authorization under CWA Section 404.Although this new rule will regulate a number of projects that previously might have escaped Section 404 regulation, it is important to realize that the Corps has been regulating many projects involving mechanized andclearing, ditching, channelization, mining, or other excavation in waters of the U.S. for years because those projects frequently involved substantial discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. For example, many drainage ditches in wetlands traditionally have been dug by sidecasting the excavated material into the wetlands; those activities have always been regulated under Section 404. Similarly, many channelization, mining, and other excavation activities in U.S. waters have been regulated under Section 404 over the years, because they involved substantial discharges through disposal or stockpiling of the excavated material in waters of the U.S., or \"sloppy\" excavation practices, or other substantial discharges. As we shall explain below, the Corps has gradually changed its policy and practice to increase our regulation of mechanized landclearing activities over a period of years. Thus, this final rule is not an abrupt change in policy, interpretation, or practice, that would suddenly begin to regulate all landclearing, ditching, channelization, and other excavation activities in U.S. waters for the first time. Nevertheless, this final rule does represent both a clarification of agency guidance and a change of agency practice regarding a sub-class of excavation-type activities in waters of the U.S.: i.e., those that would take. place with relatively small-volume, \"incidental\" discharges of dredged material that unavoidably accompany such excavation operations. Until the Corps and EPA undertook this present rulemaking, neither agency had ever promulgated written guidance explicitly and specifically addressing the question whether CWA Section 404 could or should regulate ditching, channelization, mining, or comparable excavation activities in waters of the U.S. based solely on their incidental discharges of dredged material. However, most Corps districts normally followed the practice of not regulating such activities so long as their discharges of dredged material were limited to small-volume, \"incidental\" discharges. This practice by most Corps districts was generally consistent with the informal policy of the Department of the Army during much of the 1980s, which narrowly construed the scope of Section 4501 Feea Ist IVl 8 o 6 ensaAgs 25,199IIIule andRegaton 404 jurisdiction over these activities. The practice of not regulating small, incidental discharges was also viewed by many Corps districts as consistent with the thrust of guidance dating from the late 1970s regarding de minimis discharges associated with normal dredging activities. This practice led to the adoption by the Corps in 1986 of the current language in the definition of \"discharge of dredged material,\" which excludes from regulation \"de minimis, incidental soil movement occurring during normal dredging operations.\" 33 CFR 323.2 (1986) (emphasis added). This language was explained in several paragraphs in the preamble to the Corps' 1986 rule, which some commenters who oppose today's rule quoted to support their position. It states: Section 404 clearly directs the Corps to regulate the discharge of dredged material, not the dredging itself. Dredging operations cannot be performed without some falIback. However, if we were to define this fallback as a \"discharge of dredged material,\" we would, in effect, be adding the regulation of dredging to Section 404 which we do not believe was the intent of Congress. 51 FR 41210 (Nov. 13, 1986) (emphasis added). While some in the Corps (along with some commentors opposed to this rule) have interpreted this language as indicating that the Corps did not intend to regulate fallback associated with any activity, the Corps has never in fact adopted written guidance clarifying the scope of this exclusion, or defining the term, \"normal dredging activities.\" Moreover, there is no explicit indication that the language of the rule, or the explanation statement in the preamble, applies generally to mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, or other excavation activities in the waters of the U.S. As discussed further below, an informal survey of Corps districts shows that, in fact, the districts have varied in their approach to regulating activities involving only incidental discharges, indicating that the language of the 1986 rule and preamble was not as definitive as some commentors have suggested. Today's rule therefore represents the first time that the Corps and EPA have clarified the meaning of the term\"normal dredging operations,\" which we have defined as: Dredging for navigation In navigable waten of the United States, as that term is defined in Part 329 of this chapter, with proper authorization from Congress and/or the Corps pursuant to Part 322 of this Chapter; however, this exception is not applicable to dredging activities in wetlands, as that term is defined at Section 328.3 of this Chapter. (Emphasis added).By providing this definition, the Corps and EPA hope to substantially reduce the inconsistency among Corps District offices as to scope of the de minimis exclusion for discharges of dredged material. Much of the inconsistency among the Corps district offices on this issue resulted from the decentralized nature of the Corps. Recognizing that conditions and situations differ tremendously across the country, the Corps confers a large amount of discretion upon each of its district engineers to operate the regulatory program in a reasonable manner. Each district engineer must therefore consider local and regional factors in applying national standards. This approach enables the program to remain flexible enough to interpret one standard set of regulations so that it applies to widely varying regional needs and circumstances. In carrying out their responsibilities, districts have therefore had to interpret terms used (but not defined) in the 1986 regulation, such as \"de minimis,\" \"incidental,\" and\"normal dredging operations\" in response to specific projects, situations, and regional needs and these interpretations have differed somewhat across the country. Corps headquarters did not intercede to halt the adoption of these varying interpretations so long as they did not conflict with the plain words of the regulations. The Corps has always provided its districts with the flexibility to interpret the Corps' regulations so that they may be reasonably applied to varying circumstances. So long as the districts abided by the regulatory language In Section 323.1(d), that Indicates that the term \"discharge of dredged material * * does not include de minimis, incidental soil movement occurring during normal dredging operations,\" districts were not prohibited from developing their own operating interpretations of \"de minimis,\" \"incidental,\" and \"normal dredging operations.\" Today's rule aims to rectify the ambiguity inherent in the 1986 rule's statements on \"de minimis soil movement\" and \"normal dredging operations,\" first, by making it clear that the exclusion from Section 404 of \"incidental movement\" of dredged material only applies to such movement occurring in the course of \"normal dredging operations\"; all other incidental discharges of dredged material under this rule can be considered a discharge of dredged material regulated under Section 404. Second, today's rule for the first timedefines \"noral dredging operations,\" as quoted above. As noted above, over the years Corps district offices have developed somewhat differing approaches to how they regulate the various activities that produce incidental discharges of dredged material. To sample this diversity, the Corps conducted an informal survey of eleven Corps district offices. The Corps selected the districts surveyed in order to obtain a cross- section of likely practices among district offices. The Corps did not intend, however, for this to be a \"scientific\" survey statistically representative of practices across the country; the Corps simply wanted to obtain anecdotal information regarding the range of interpretations and practices among the districts. In the survey the Corps found that many districts currently regulate some of the activities covered by this rule. Although the Corps Is not aware of any district that regulates all the activities subject to the rulemaking in the same manner that today's rule dictates, there are several districts that regulate one or more of these activities in the same manner as provided for under this rule. Since the issuance of the 1990 RGL on landclearing (RGL 90-5), the districts have been much more consistent in how they regulate landclearing. In the absence of comparable guidance on ditching, channelization, and mining, the Corps districts have shown a greater diversity in their regulation of these activities. By examining the informal survey results on an activity-by-activity basis, this diversity becomes readily apparent. Virtually all of the districts surveyed regulate ditching activities that involve sidecasting. At least one of the districts surveyed regulates ditching activities that produce only incidental discharges. These incidental discharges were typically in the form of drippings or fallback from ditching machinery. Another district regulates ditching based on these same incidental discharges, but only if the water of the U.S. being ditched is covered by some type of vegetation that the district could use to classify the activity as landclearing, and thus, apply the guidance in RGL 90-5. Several Corps districts surveyed regulate channelization activities based on incidental discharges. These districts tend to focus on those channelization operations that employ drag lines. At least one of these districts will only regulate these channelization activities if the activity is conducted in water. At least three of the eleven districts surveyed regulate mining activities in45014 Federal Register / Vol. 58,No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations No. 163 1 Wednesday, August 25, 1093 / Rules and Regulations 45015 the waters of the U.S. Two of these districts are currently regulating these activities in virtually the same manner as they will be regulated under today's rule. Other districts only regulate mining activities if the material removed is in water. Yet another district regulates the discing of peat bogs, which is required in the mining of peat. As explained above, mechanized landclearing is being regulated in a fairly consistent manner by all Corps districts due in large part to the series of regulatory guidance letters that have been issued by the Corps over the past decade. There is. however, some inconsistency in how the most recent RGL (RGL 90-5) is currently being applied by some districts. At least one district, as explained above, uses the RGL 90-5 to regulate discharges incidental to ditching, as long as the area has some type of vegetation on it. Some degree of inconsistency among the Corps districts' in regulating ditching, channelization, mining, and even landclearing is therefore evident in the results of our survey. The Corps will readily concede that practically every district will have to change some number of their regulatory practices to conform to today's rule. However, the allegation that today's rule represents a sudden and radical departure from a longstanding, official interpretation of our Section 404 regulatory jurisdiction substantially overstates the case. Commentors specifically cited several RGLs on landclearing, the only written, national guidance the Corps has issued concerning any of these activities, as evidence that the Corps, by promulgating this rule, allegedly is drastically departing from past agency positions. The commentors focused mainly on the RGLs that were issued by the Corps in 1982 and 1985 that more narrowly construed the extent to which mechanized landclearing activities would be subject to Section 404. RGL 82-5 stated that Section 404 did not cover \"[minimal (\"de minimis\") movement of dirt, in and of itself, incidental to removal of planting of vegetation.\" Under this RGL, such activity would be covered if\"accompanied by a land leveling operation which alters the topographic features of a 'water of the U.S.' through significant movement of soil.\" After the decision was issued by the 5th Circuit in Avoyelles, the Corps issued RGL 85- 4, which provided that mechanized landclearing activities required a Section 404 permit if \"the activity would involve burying logs or burying burn residue, or totally or partially filling in sloughs or low areas, or leveling the land.\" This RGL also statedthat piling of trees, brush and stumps with de minimis amounts of soil attached or gathered in the piling operation did not necessarily constitute a Section 404 discharge unless it would totally or partially fill in sloughs or level the land. The RGL also stated that the filling of stump holes is normally a de minimis discharge because of the de minimis nature of the incidental soil movement. EPA and the Corps acknowledge that the interpretation of the applicability of Section 404 to mechanized landclearing activities contained in these two earlier RGLs was more narrow than that reflected in today's regulation. Rather than view today's rule as a sharp departure of our past position, however, we believe that there has been an evolution in the agencies' treatment of mechanized landclearing under Section 404, which has gradually brought more and more mechanized landclearing activities under regulation by the Section 404 program. The 1982 RGL most narrowly construed the applicability of Section 404 to these activities, while the 1985 RGL recognized additional circumstances when mechanized landclearing would trigger Section 404 jurisdiction. Finally, almost three years ago, the Corps issued RGL 90-5, which took the position that mechanized landclearing activities generally are regulated under Section 404 because they result in the redeposition of dredged material. Today's rule is therefore entirely consistent with the guidance issued by the Corps in 1990. Thus, while our position has changed over the course of the last decade regarding the applicability of Section 404 to mechanized landclearing activities, we do not agree with the commentors who argued that today's rule is an \"abrupt\" reversal of our longstanding position. The interpretation of Section 404 contained in the landclearing portion of today's rule is the position that has been taken by the Corps since 1990. This position reflects, moreover, the gradual increase in our appreciation of the severe adverse environmental effects associated with mechanized landclearing that has led us to conclude that regulation of these activities under Section 404 is warranted. Even if one were to consider today's rule an \"abrupt reversal\" of a longstanding agency position, however, the Corps and EPA believe that such a change is warranted in light of our increased understanding of the severe environmental effects often associated with the activities covered.by the rule, and the increasing sophistication ofdevelopers who seek to convert waters of the U.S. to uplands without being subject to the Section 404 regulatory program as previously administered by the agencies. As the Supreme Court recently provided in Rust v. Sullivan, an\"agency, to engage in informed rulemaking, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.\" 111 S. Ct. 1759, 1769 (1991), quoting Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 863-64, 104 S. Ct. 2792. The Court further explained that agencies must be rovided the flexibility to\"'adapt Ieir] rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.\"' Id. Such changes, whether dramatic or. slight, must be consistent with the authorizing statute and be based on a\"'reasoned analysis.\"' Id. quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of the United States v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 2866 (1983). The Corps and EPA both strongly believe that the regulatory mandates expressed in today's rule are within the authorities provided to our agencies pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Furthermore, we feel that, to whatever extent today's rule constitutes a change of previous practice, such a change is warranted, for the reasons we have explained in the preamble. The Corps regulatory program over the years has proved to be remarkably adaptable to changes that has occurred in our appreciation of wetland functions and values and in our increased understanding of the effects of certain activities on wetlands. Ever since the Corps was first given authority to regulate discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., the Corps and EPA have been shaping and defining the regulatory program with the broad discretion granted to the agencies by the CWA. Today's rule embodies many changes that we have gradually adopted through less formal guidance over the past two decades, and incorporates some refinements and clarifications to our policy that are long overdue. In certain respects, and for every Corps district, today's rule will bring about changes in our previous practice; however, we believe that such changes are warranted in order to ensure that the Section 404 program can effectively protect our aquatic resources from the degradation that can result from unregulated mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, and other excavation activities. As discussed further below, we have learned increasingly over the last decade howFederal Register / Vol. 58, 45016 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations * these activities can severely impact our nation's aquatic resources, and we therefore view today's rule as an important means of achieving the objectives of the CWA to \"restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity\" of those resources..The specific facts of the case that led to the initiation of litigation in the Tulloch lawsuit provides a graphic example of how mechanized landclearing and ditching activities adversely affect the aquatic environment, and of the inequities that have resulted under the previous policies for regulating these activities. The facts in Tulloch help demonstrate the necessity of this rule by revealing how one developer with the technical expertise and financial resources was able, under past agency policies, to avoid the requirement to obtain a Section 404 permit for environmentally destructive activities in waters of the United States. The Tulloch case involved an 1800 acre development project in Now Hanover County, North Carolina, called the Pembroke Jones Park. In 1987, the Corps determined that about 700 acres of the site were wetlands. The developer performed numerous activities in the wetlands that \"destroyed or degraded\" them, yet the Wilmington District repeatedly determined, based on their understanding of the policies of the Corps, that the developer's activities should not be regulated under Section 404. The developer originally applied for a permit for discharges associated with its development, but withdrew the application in light of concerns among the Corps and resource agencies about the significant adverse effects likely to be caused by the development. The developer subsequently met-repeatedly with the Wilmington District of the Corps, presenting a strategy for constructing the same project without the need to obtain a Section 404 permit. First, the developer land cleared much of the wetland acreage. This was accomplished by pushing the vegetatfon from the cleared area. Wilmington Iistrict determined that since the developer removed all fhe vegetation arid did not recontour the land, this activity did not require a Section 404 Permit. If these same activities were employed after the promulgation of today's rule, those activities would tri3ger Section 404 regulation. Under the rule, for example, the dirt falling from the roots of the trees as they were removed from the ground, in and of itself, would constitute a discharge of dredged material that would subject themechanized landclearing operation to regulation. Pursuant to today's rule, these landclearing activities pursued by the developer would certainly destroy or degrade the wetlands and therefore require Section 404 authorization. Second, the developer performed two types of excavation activities in the wetlands. He excavated some areas to create new ponds and excavated drainage ditches. The excavation was performed using draglines (in the ponds) and backhoes, which had sealed buckets. The soil excavated was either placed directly on uplands or placed in sealed containers resting on the beds of 4-wheel drive and 6-wheel drive trucks or pans. The excavation, for the most part, was performed in such a manner that only drippings from the buckets of the excavation machinery were allowed to fall back into the wetland. Using computer modeling, the developer's consultant determined that by excavating ditches four feet deep every two hundred feet, the wetlands in the first conversion area could be drained, eliminating the presence of wetland hydrology and wetland vegetation, and thereby removing the area from Section 404 jurisdiction. After these ditches were completed and the water table had dropped sufficiently, the Wilmington District released the tract from jurisdiction. The developer used this technique in several other tracts which were also later released from jurisdiction. The developer also excavated many acres of the wetlands in order to create approximately eighty-five acres of open water ponds. He also inundated portions of the wetlands acreage to create additional open water ponds. The work was accomplished by constructing wooden piers that the Wilmington District did not find to be an activity that was regulated under Section 404. During the course of ihe excavation operations, thA Wilmington District determin ad that these activities were not subject to regulation. By using sOFUed buckets and container trucks, the deva!pbr was able to substantially ieduce 4ha aumiuit of dredged material beaig redepusfted in the wetland. Althou,:gh the Wilmington District later adopted a more strict position regarding excavation activities in wetlands, the District initially determined that it would not require the developer to secure a permit based on the \"drippings\" along. As a result of this operation, hundreds of ecres of environmentally valuable pocosin wetlands have been converted into a residential development and a go!f course without being regulated, eliminating opportunities to avoid andmitigate adverse environmental effects. Pocosins are an unusual and relatively rare type of wetland found only in the Southeast. Owing their existence to poor drainage and abundant rainfall, pocosins typically serve important water quality and groundwater recharge functions, and often provide habitat for rare plants and animals. Because of the sophisticated methods employed, this developer was able to evade regulation under the Section 404 program while destroying these ecologically valuable wetlands. It is clear that the methods used by the developer were expressly chosen because they would avoid triggering the need to obtain a Section 404 permit. The developer's representatives met repeatedly with the staff at the Wilmington District to determine what the District believed was the exact extent of its regulatory jurisdiction over wetland excavation. It was only after the developer was confident that it could successfully evade Corps regulation that it would proceed with the next destructive portion of its operation. It is precisely because of operations like this development that the Corps and EPA have decided to promulgate this rule. At one time it appeared to be sufficient to base the regulation of\" ditching on sidecast material. This, as well as other similar projects, have demonstrated that this is no longer the case. It the Corps and EPA are to perform their assigned mission under the CWA, \"to protect and restore the chemical, biological, and physical integrity of the waters of the U.S.,\" we believe that modification of earlier practices and policies is necessary and appropriate. C. Presumption That Mechanized Landclearing, Ditching, Channelization and Other Excavation Result in Discharges The proposed rule contained language that would have established an irrebuttable presumption that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation activities in waters of the United States result in the discharge of dredged material (proposed 33 CFR 323.2(d)(2) and 40 CFR 232.2(e)(2)). 1. Public Comments and Changes to Proposed Rule Commentors expressed several concerns with this approach. First, commentors argued that the terms\"mechanized landclearing,\" \"ditching,\"\"channelization\" and \"excavation\" are vague, and therefore do not provide clear guidance to the regulated public as to whether their activities would require No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45017 a permit under the rule. Commentors argued, moreover, that the agencies had not presented factual information in justify the conclusion that these activities invariably result in discharges. They contended that it is possible in some cases to conduct some of these activities without causing any fallback or redeposition of dredged material. In response to these comments, and in order to ensure that the final rule is clear and understandable, the Corps and EPA have made certain changes in the final rule. The agencies have deleted the proposed rule language that would have established the irrebuttable presumption that the listed activities Will result in discharges of dredged material. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule and explained further below, we believe that it is virtually impossible to conduct mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or excavation in waters of the United States without causing incidental redeposition of dredged material (however small or temporary) in the process. However, the agencies cannot rule out the possibility that, in a highly unusual case, or with novel technology, one or more of these activities might be accomplished without such a discharge. Moreover, since the agencies' jurisdiction over a particular activity can only be triggered by the presence of a discharge in the specific case, the agencies declined to make a categorical finding in this regulation that the listed activities always result in discharges. That determination, by its nature, depends on the facts of a particular case. However, the agencies strongly admonish any party considering conducting any one of these activities without obtaining a permit that they may be proceeding at the risk of violating Section 404 since, under today's rule, a permit is required in any case where any incidental redeposition of dredged material (however small or temporary) is cause in connection with an activity that would destroy or degrade waters of the United States, unless otherwise exempted under Section 404[f). Because this rule does not make a finding that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation will always result in discharges, commentor's concerns about the factual support for such a finding are no longer relevant. Section C, below, however, provides a detailed description of how mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation activities can result in the redeposition of dredged materials.Several commentors stated that the term \"mechanized landclearing\" should not be defined to include operations such as the moving or cutting of vegetation where the activity occurs at or above the soil/sediment line. Some commentors wanted the Corps and EPA to clarify which landclearing activities will be regulated under this rule. We agree that not all mechanized operations involving the removal of vegetation In wetlands and other waters of the United States should be regulated because not all these operations result in a discharge of dredged or fill material. In response to these comments, the definition of discharge of dredged material in the final rule expressly excludes \"activities that involve only the cutting or removing of vegetation above the ground (e.g., mowing, rotary cutting, or chainsawing) where the activity neither substantially disturbs the root system nor involves mechanized pushing, dragging, or other similar activities that redeposit excavated soil material.\" Under this language, a discharge only occurs when mechanized landclearing activities occurring in waters of the U.S. cause soils and other excavated dredged materials to be added or redeposited in such waters. So long as all work occurs above ground level, and root systems are not substantially disturbed, the cutting of vegetation, whether using hand-held equipment or equipment mounted on heavy machinery, would not cause either the addition or the redeposition of dredged material. For example, maintenance clearing of existing powerlines and chipping cut vegetation in place or shearing vegetation above the soil line where the vegetation is not subsequently windrowed or otherwise pushed would not usually cause a discharge regulated under Section 404. Several commentors, however, appeared to argue that maintenance of utility line corridors would never result in a discharge of dredged or fill material. These commentors cited the decision of the Fifth Circuit in Save Our Wetlands, supra, which held that cutting of trees with a chainsaw and windrowing of the vegetation did not result in a discharge subject to Section 404. As noted above, today's rule expressly excludes from the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" the cutting of vegetation above the ground. Under today's rule, if vegetation is cut above the surface and then lifted into windrows without causing redeposition of excavated material, then no Section 404 permit is required. If, however, windrowing is accomplished in a manner that would redeposit dredged material (for example, by pushing thefallen vegetation with a bulldozer or similar equipment), then a permit would be required. Unlike certain commentors, however, we do not read Save Our Wetlands as holding that EPA and the Corps are precluded under the CWA from regulating landclearing unless it would result in a conversion of waters of the U.S. to uplands. That decision did not construe the scope of the agencies' statutory authority under Section 404, but rather turned on EPA's and the Corps' regulatory definition of discharge of dredged material. The court held that the activities in that case did not constitute a discharge of dredged material under the agencies' regulatory definition because the activity would not convert wetlands to uplands. An activity involving a discharge of dredged material subject to today's rule, however, would require a permit if it would destroy or degrade a water of the United States. We do not read Save Our Wetlands as addressing, in any respect, the agencies' statutory authority to adopt the regulatory approach we are taking here. Indeed, the court expressly noted in its opinion that Congress left to EPA and the Corps how to define the term \"dredged or fill material.\" Id. at 647. 2. Description of Mechanized Landclearing, Ditching, Channelization and Other Excavation Activities The agencies provide below a detailed description of the actual processes involved in mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation. This discussion is intended to be illustrative of the major types of landclearing and excavation techniques currently used, and is not intended to be exhaustive or limit in any manner the scope or applicability of the final rule. We are providing this description in order to illustrate the manner in which these types of activities cause incidental soil movement, which results in additions or redepositions of dredged material. a. Mechanized Iandclearing. In the mechanized landclearing process, the addition or redeposit of dredged material can occur several ways. For example, implements used in the mechanized landclearing process are scraped along the surface of the ground or pushed into the ground and then moved through the soil, usually by bulldozers or loaders. Brushrakes, rootrakes, chunkrakes, disc harrows, root plows, rippers, bulldozer plows, and many types of shearing blades are characteristic of the type of equipment which operate in this way. Brushrakes, for example, have tines which scrapeFederal Register / Vol. 58, 45018 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations below the ground level to gather and stockpile slash and loose rock; chunkrakes have bowl shaped blades frequently up to two feet or more in diameter, which cut into the ground and fluff the soil; disc harrows knock down, chop and partially bury weeds, brush, and small saplings by using concave disc, two feet or more in diameter, with sharp scalloped edges; root rakes remove roots and stumps by use of a fork-like blade pushed through the soil; shearing blades are tractor-mounted shears wh;ch can weigh up to several thousand pounds and can move large amounts of debris, soil and roots if they are moved along the surface of the ground. Rippers and deep plows are pulled along below the soil surface to brosak up hard pans or other stiff subsoil. The arm which attaches them to the bulldoze- or leader drags through the soil surface, moving soil aside and thereby causing a discharge. When the implements used in medchanized landclearing move along the Fround or trough the soil, they scrape, pick up, move or otherwise displace debris end soil (including leaf litter and humus) and usually have a leveling effect on the ground by moving debris from high areas to low areas. When soils are picked up, moved, or otherwise displaced, they are added or redeposited to waters of the United States at various distances from the excavation point as the implements used in the mechanized landclearing process move through waters of the United States. During the discing, tining, or raking process, for example, soil will ride in front of the disc, tine, or rake if the disc, tine, or rake scrapes or penetrates the ground, resulting in a displacement and redepositing of soils and sediments. The addition or redeposit of dredged material also occurs when equipment is used to knock down trees and rip up root systems even if the equipment used does not, in itself, scrape across or penetree the ground. When stumps are ripped out of the waters of the United State;3, soils and sediments are added or redeposited back into the waters of the United States. Also, hoies and depies3ons are created in tLe ground which are typmally filled by using the ve!\"'7'- which removed the trees and their f(. ts 3- subsequently by other vehic!es cr equipment. This filling or redeFosition would constitute a dischzrge in addition to that which occurs by the removal of the stumps themselves. Tree pushers and tree splitters are examples of equipment which normally operate in this way. A tree pusher uses a bar mounted to the front of a bulldozer or loader while atree splitter uses a V-shaped blade, which is usually about 18 to 20 feet in length. As the tree pusher or tree splitter knocks the tree down, the roots are usually ripped up out of the ground. Any roots remaining are then typically removed from the ground by the bulldozer's blade. Not all equipment used to remove trees disturbs root systems, or pushes, drags, or otherwise engages in an activity which results in a discharge of dredged material. Some tree shears or tree pinchers, for example, may be operated in such a manner so that they do not cause a discharge of dredged material, provided the vegetation is cut above the ground while leaving the soils and roots intact. b. Ditching, channelization and other excavation. During excavation, material in either a solid or semi-solid form is removed from the waters of the United States. As material is excavated from the waters of the United States, the addition or redeposit of dredged material occurs through soil or sediment spills, drippings, and moving or displacing of soils and sediments as the dredging equipment moves through the soil or sediments. Ditching and channelization are two types of excavation activities which often occur in wetlands and in other waters of the Untied States. As we use the terms here, ditching is the act of creating ditches (i.e., trenches or troughs) by excavating the earth. Channelization is the modification made to, within, or adjacent to an existing stream channel, as well as the rerouting of a steam channel. Both ditching and channelization are used to convey water, often for irrigation or drainage purposes and can be accomplished by using the same equipment. Most ditching and channelization activities are accomplished using excavation equipment of some type, which is usually characterized by the use of some form of bucket or scoop to excavate soil and sediment. Mechanial dredging equipment typically consists of a backhoe, a bulldozer, a dipper, or a bucket. A backhoe is a hoe-type or pull-type shovel usually attached to the back of a front loader. A backhoe, which shovels and then lifts soil or sediments from waters of the United States, is often used during the construction of ditches or for stream channelization projects. A dipper and bucket operate at the end of a boom, which is attached to a crane or other vehicle. Buckets are suspended from a cable and dippers are fixed directly to the boom, Typically, a crane drops the bucket into the soil or through the water column to the bottom. Thebucket is filled with soil or sediments and lifted from the water or off the ground and dropped or sidecast on adjacent grounds or into vehicles where it is moved to another disposal site. Bucket dredging for ditching and channelization projects is commonly done with a dragline. Draglines, or other equipment of this kind, operate by dropping the bucket into the soil or sediment and then dragging it through the soil or sediment until it is filled. With a dipper, as with a backhoe, a bulldozer or loader pushes the scoop or hoe through the soil or sediment in order to fill up the dipper. The dipper is then moved off the bottom and the collected sediments disposed of as they are with buckets. Many stream channelization projects are accomplished by using a bulldozer to push sediments, including cobble, gravel and sand, from a particular point in the stream to another location. To complete such work, the bulldozer blade is lowered into the bottom of the stream and then moved in a forward direction which results in the pushing of sediments to another location in the steam or to an upland area. Because of the physical processes of soil movement inherent in the act of dredging, the use of bulldozers, draglines, dippers, and backhoes, or other equipment of this kind will, except in limited situations, result in some addition or redeposition of dredged material. The addition or redeposit of dredged material occurs as soils and sediments are picked up and moved during the excavation process. For example, when a dragline or backhoe is dragged through soils or sediments, such soils and sediments are displaced and redeposited to various distances from the initial excavation point as the implement used in the excavation process gathers the dredged material. This same type of displacement and redeposition occurs as a bulldozer pushes sediments during a stream channelization project. Also, when the dragline or backhoe stops moving along the bottom and the bucket is raised, additional additions or redeposits of soils or sediments occur as such material falls from the bucket. The cutterhead dredge is the most commonly used hydraulic dredger. It operates by using a rotating cutter to cut into the sediments. The rotating cutter is attached to a suction line which sucks in the material as it is being cut. Typically, a cutterhead is used to break up the sediment and mix it into a slurry and then pump it through a pipe to a disposal area. As the cutterhead moves through the bottom, it pushes the sediment around. The addition or Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45019 redeposit or dredged material occurs as the whirling of the cutter slings some of the dredged material away from the suction of the pump either as discrete clumps or in suspension and adds or redeposits it at various points from where the cutterhead moved through the bottom. D. Effects of Mechanized Landclearing, Ditching, Channelization and Other Excavation The agencies received substantial public comment regarding whether the activities that would be covered by this rule in fact destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. Many commentors cited activities that they believed did not cause such an effect. There was also confusion regarding the meaning of \"degrade\" in the proposed rule. Some commentors also objected to the presumption in the proposed rule that these activities destroy or degrade wetlands, and questioned the factual basis for such a presumption. These comments are addressed below. 1. Definition of \"Destroy\" and\"Degrade\" The proposed rule did not contain definitions of the terms, \"destroy\" and \"degrade.\" In the preamble to the proposal, however, the agencies solicited public comment on defining destruction as altering an area \"in such a way that it would no longer be a water of the U.S,\" and defining degradation as occurring when a discharge \"results in an identifiable decrease in the functional values of the water of the U.S.\" 57 Fed. Reg., 26896. Several commentors supported the definition of \"destroy,\" stating it was clear and concrete. A few commentors recommended that the definition of \"destroy\" be modified to clarify that it is only necessary to determine whether there is destruction in areas currently being delineated as waters of the United States. Two commentors felt the destruction threshold was inadequate and that destruction would also occur when a wetland or other special aquatic site is converted to open waterbody, such as conversion of a wetland to a retention pond. Another commentor disagreed and argued that this type of activity did not destroy, and possible did not even degrade, waters of the United States. We believe that the term \"destroy\" is sufficiently clear that no change in the proposed approach is appropriate. We agree with commentors that the jurisdictional status of an area before and after an activity takes place should be based on current agency guidance for making such determinations. While weagree that conversion of a wetland or other water of the U.S. to another type of water of the U.S. (e.g., conversion of a wetland to open water such as a lake) does not necessarily \"destroy\" a water of the U.S., such a change could in fact \"degrade\" an area by adversely affecting at least one of the aquatic functions, of the site. As discussed further below, while there may be some environmental benefits associated with such a project, any adverse effect on any aquatic function would mean that an activity required a Section 404 permit. While such an activity may well receive a permit based on consideration of the Corps' public interest review and the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, we do not believe that It would be appropriate to exclude such activities from the coverage of Section 404 entirely. For clarity, we have added the definition of destroy to the final rule (see 33 CFR 323.2(d)(4); 40 CFR 232.2(e)(4)). By far, most commentors addressing these terms were concerned with the definition of \"degrade\" contained in the preamble to the proposal as \"an identifiable decrease in the functional values of waters of the United States.\" The commentors stated-that \"identifiable decrease\" and \"functional values\" were vague terms, which were not susceptible to measurement, and that adoption of these terms would only contribute to increased confusion over the Section 404 regulatory process, as a result of subjective determinations made by Corps or EPA personnel. Two commentors felt that the term \"functional values\" was inappropriate and should be replaced with \"functions and values,\" to be judged separately since functions are measurable and values are subjective. A few commentors recommended that regulated waters be generally classified, according to potential functions and values, for their respective geographic areas, while two others felt functions should be directly related to the science of water quality. Several commentors stated that there is no established methodology to evaluate functional values for impact assessment. Therefore, they recommended that the Corps and EPA develop a methodology and/or identify a preferred method to provide a clear and precise standard to measure degradation. Further, two of these commentors also felt that the selected methodology should be implemented only after promulgation through notice- and-comment rulemaking. Several commentors disagreed with the example presented in the proposed rule, i.e., that if the hydrologic regime of a wetland is altered enough to change the vegetative composition of the area,it will be degraded. These commentors did not believe a mere change in vegetative composition automatically results in degradation. As a means of better clarifying the term \"degradation,\" several commentors suggested that the definition refer to an \"identifiable adverse effect that the proposed activity is likely to have on waters of the United States.\" Two commentors suggested replacing the word \"identifiable\" with\"significant\" commentor recommended changing \"identifiable decrease\" with \"appreciable decrease.\" Because there was confusion among the public about the term \"degrade\" we have chosen to include d definition of degradation in the final rule that incorporates suggestions made by some commentors. Under the final rule, an activity results in degradation when it would have more than a de minimis effect on the area by causing an identifiable individual or cumulative adverse effect on any aquatic function. As discussed further below, this standard is a threshold for determining whether an activity requires a Section 404 permit at all, so we believe that any adverse effect to any aquatic function of the site would constitute \"degradation\" under the final rule. Evaluation of the project and its overall impacts under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines and the Corps' public interest review would occur during the permit process. This definition changes how the term \"de minimis\" is used in the rule from the way it has been used previously in the definition of \"discharge of dredged material.\" In the previous rule, the term \"de minimis\" referred to the amount of soil moved during normal dredging activities, and the proposed rule similarly used this term to refer to the amount of soil moved in the process of mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation. The definition of degradation in the final rule uses the term \"de minimis\" to refer to the degree of environmental effects associated with these activities. This change makes sense for several reasons. First, using the term \"de minimis\" to refer to environmental effects is consistent with the intent of this rulemaking, which is to ensure that incidental discharges associated with mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation trigger Section 404 where those activities would have certain effects on waters of the U.S. Establishing a de minimis effects test also comports with the structure and goals of Section 404, which focus on providing protection of waters of the United States from adverse effects associated with discharges of dredged or fill material. 45020 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 /,Rules and Regulations EPA and the Corps believe that the deminimi$ exception contained in today's regulation is within the agencies' authority under Section 404. The underlying focus of Section 404 is on evaluating and, where possible, reducing and avoiding adverse effects to the aquatic-environment due to discharges of dredged or fill material. Section 404's focus on environmental effects is evident in numerous aspects of this statutory provision, For example, Section 404(c) authorizes EPA to prohibit, deny or restrict the specification of any site for the discharge of dredged or fill material if it would have \"unacceptable adverse effects\" on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife or recreational areas. A similar focus on environmental effects is evident in Section 404(f)(2), which \"recaptures\" activities otherwise exempt under Section 404(f)(1) where the activities have the purpose of changing the use of an area of waters of the United States, and have the effect of impairing the flow or circulation, or reducing the reach, of waters of the United States. Thus, the very purpose of Section 404 is to conduct an environmental review of discharges of dredged or fill material in order to determine the gravity of the environmental harm associated with the discharge, and evaluate ways in which that harm can be reduced or avoided. The focus of Section 404 on effects of discharges is reflected throughout the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines which, for example, prohibit discharges where a practicable alternative would have less\"adverse impact\" on the aquatic ecosystem, where a discharge would cause or contribute to significant degradation of the aquatic environment or where appropriate and practicable steps have not been taken to minimize\"adverse effects of the discharge on the aquatic ecosystem.\" See 40 CFR 230.10 (a), (c), and (d), See also 40 CFR 230.11 (listing types of effects that must be considered in the permitting process). Therefore, subjecting de rmnimis activitics to review under section 404 wonld be a needless paper exercise that would dive'rt limited agency resources frmn focusing on discharges associated with environmental effects of concern under Section 404. Given the clear focus of Section 404 on regulating activities based on their environmental effects, we view an exception for discharges of dredged material having de minimis effects as a tool for advancing the goals and objectives of Section 404. See Alaboma Power Co. v, Costle, 636 F.2d 323 (DC Cir, 1979), We note that the exception addressed by this rulemaking was already presentin the agencies' regulatory definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" This rule is clarifying, and narrowing the effect of, this pro-existing exception. Moreover, as discussed further below, EPA and the Corps have included provisions in the rule to help ensure that only truly de minimis activities are exempted from the Section 404 program by requiring that dischargers engaging in mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation obtain a finding by the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, prior to their discharge, that their activities do not require a permit. We wish to emphasize that the threshold of adverse effects for the de minimis exception is a very low one, Under the final rule. an identifiable adverse individual or cumulative effect on any aquatic function is sufficient to subject an activity to Section 404 jurisdiction. Some activities may cause certain adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem while having other beneficial effects. For example, an activity altering the hydrology of a wetland may result in restoring pre-existing hydrology, or may improve habitat value or water quality in the long-term. If the activity would result in some loss or identifiable reduction of any aquatic function to achieve this result, however, the activity would \"degrade\" waters of the U.S. and a permit would be required under today's rule, For example, if a discharge activity would have any adverse impact on the suitability of the area as habitat for any species utilizing the area, a permit would be required. It is not our intent, therefore, that the positive and negative effects of the activity be balanced and to require a permit only in those cases where the net effect is adverse, Rather, an adverse effect on any one aquatic function, even if it is temporary, would be sufficient undr the final rule to trigger the Section 404 permit requirement. In the case of endangered or threatened species, any effect of an activity on such species would trigger an inquiry by the Corps as to the nature of that effect, and whether the activity would destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. within the moaning of today's rule. If there is an effect on endangered or threatened species from an activity, the Corps in consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service (depending on the agency having jurisdiction over the species) under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, will determine whether the activity is likely to adversely effect the species. If the Corps finds that the activity is not likely to adversely affect the species, and theService concurs in writing in this finding, then the activity would not \"degrade\" the water within the meaning of today's rule, and no permit would be required. If, however, either the Corps or the Service believes that the effect is likely to be adverse, then a Section 404 permit will be required for the activity. Other examples of adverse effects on any aquatic function would be an adverse alteration of the area's hydrologic regime, or of the type, distribution of diversity of vegetation, fish and wildlife that depend on such waters. Again the threshold of effect under the final rule is a low one. It would not be necessary for a discharge activity to remove or significantly impair wetland hydrology to trigger the permit requirement. An activity that would, for example, likely reduce the duration of inundation or saturation of a portion of wetland would \"degrade\" the wetland within the meaning of this rule. Indeed, In some cases, increasing the duration of inundation or saturation may have an adverse effect on an aquatic function. Similarly, alteration of the vegetative composition of a water of the U.S. does not require that all vegetation be removed, or that the vegetative composition be so significantly altered that the area would no longer meet the hydrophytic vegetation criteria for delineating wetlands. A lesser change to the vegetation of an area can, for example, have an impact on the function of a wetland as a food source or as habitat for a species utilizing the area. Activities such as walking, bicycling or driving a vehicle through a wetland would have de minimis effects except in extraordinary situations, and the agencies do not intend to devote scarce resources to regulating such typically innocuous activities. In response to commentors who thought that the agencies should establish a higher effects threshold in this rule (eg., activities would be regulated only when they have a\"significant\" effect on the environment), we wish to emphasize that the de minimis exception is necessarily a narrow one, limited to \"trifling\" or \"inconsequential\" effects (see Alabama Power Co, v. Castle, 636 F2d. at 360 (DC 1979). Moreover, the evaluation of effects under this rule is for the purpose of determining whether an activity is subject to regulation under the CWA at all. When an activity poses more than de minimis effects on the aquatic environment, the severity of those effects will be evaluated to determine whether, for example, a class of activities would have minimal effects and therefore could be authorized by a Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45021 general permit. See CWA Section 404(e). The severity of effects is also evaluated during the individual permitting process to determine whether a permit should be issued and, if so, with what conditions. Where the question, however, is whether an activity requires authorization at all, we believe that the threshold should be a low one, consistent with the nature of the legal de minimis exception. The term \"significant impacts\" by contrast, generally suggests a severe adverse environmental effect. As used in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), an action \"significantly\" affecting the environment triggers the most rigorous of environmental reviews, an environmental impact statement. Similarly, under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, any discharge that would\"significantly\" degrade waters of the U.S. is prohibited. Such a high threshold is not appropriate where, as here, the question is whether an activity should be subject to regulatory scrutiny under Section 404 at all. Because commentors expressed confusion regarding the application of the phrase \"decrease in functional values\" that was included in the proposed rule, this phrase is not included in the final rule. Nevertheless, an evaluation of the functions of a water of the U.S. is obviously relevant to determining whether an activity may cause an adverse effect on waters of the U.S. For example, an area whose functions include vegetation serving as a food source or habitat for migratory waterfowl would suffer a decrease in that function by the alteration or removal of vegetation. However, it is not our intent to place on the Corps or EPA a heavy burden of conducting a detailed evaluation of the water's functions and values and documenting how they would be impacted by an activity. Such an inquiry is more relevant to the evaluation conducted by the Corps under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines and Corps regulations in the permitting process itself. Again, we emphasize that this is merely the threshold inquiry of whether an activity should be subject to regulation under Section 404 at all. We believe it is sufficient for this purpose that the Corps or EPA, as appropriate, evaluate the available information to make a reasonable judgment of whether an activity will adversely affect waters of the U.S. For similar reasons, we also disagree with commenters who suggested that the agencies should establish a scheme for classifying the values of wetland areas for purposes of this rule. The\"value\" of a water of the U.S. is again something that should be considered inthe permitting process when the Corps determines whether a discharge complies with the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, and what type and level of mitigation is necessary to compensate for the impacts of a project. We do not view a detailed consideration of values of an area to be necessary for the Corps or EPA to determine whether an activity would simply have an \"adverse effect\" on a water of the U.S. One commenter argued that the rule should list the specific activities that require a Section 404 permit based on the type, location, and known impact of the activities and also should identify \"de minimis\" activities that will not require a Section 404 permit. While such a list might be ideal from the regulated community's standpoint, the types of activities that involve a discharge and would destroy or degrade waters of the United States are too numerous and varied to list definitively. They generally must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, today's rule does provide examples of several activities that require a permit unless the discharger demonstrates they would not destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. (i.e., mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation in waters of the United States). Several commentors argued that the agencies had failed to give the public adequate notice of the meaning of the terms \"destroy\" and \"degrade\" as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. We disagree. Definitions of the terms \"destroy\" and \"degrade\" were discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule, along with a request for public comment. The definitions of \"destroy\" and \"degrade\" in the final rule reflect the proposal and the public comments received. We believe that the agencies have fully complied with the Administrative Procedure Act's rulemaking requirements. One commentor felt that the definitions of \"destroy\" and \"degrade\" contradicted Section 101(g) of the CWA. It is entirely unclear to us how this rule conceivably would be inconsistent with Section 101(g), which provides that State water rights will not be superseded, abrogated, or impaired by the CWA. This aspect of the rule simply addresses what activities result in discharges of dredged material requiring a permit under Section 404 of the Act. Merely subjecting activities to the Section 404 permitting requirement cannot, in and of itself, result in any impact on allocation of water rights. The substantive criteria for processing Section 404 permits are not altered in any way by this rule.Two commenters believed that the determination of degradation should be the responsibility of the State agency to ensure compliance with State waterquality standards. We disagree, since the Corps and EPA are charged with administering the regulatory responsibilities of CWA Section 404. Moreover, degradation of waters of the U.S. will not necessarily be limited to consideration of State water quality standards. 2. Presumption That Activities Destroy or Degrade The proposed rule also would have established a rebuttable presumption that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation would result in the destruction or degradation of waters of the United States. See 33 CFR 323.2(c)(2); 40 CFR 232.2(e)(2). Some commenters supported the proposed rebuttable presumption because they felt these activities virtually always cause adverse impacts to the aquatic ecosystem. Other commentors opposed the presumption in the proposal on the grounds that the government should bear the burden for demonstrating that it has jurisdiction over an activity. These commentors cited the discussion in the preamble to the proposed revisions to the wetlands delineation manual, in which the government stated that it bore the burden of demonstrating that it has geographic jurisdiction over a specific area under the statue. These commentors argued that such a burden should also fall on the government here. Some commentors contended that the presumption would impose unreasonable costs on project proponents seeking to rebut the presumption. Commentors also argued that the presumption was based upon a factual finding that these activities virtually always destroy or degrade wetlands, yet the agencies have not provided record support for such a conclusion beyond the reference to the\"experience\" of the agencies in administering the Section 404 program. We believe that these commentors have misconstrued the nature of and basis of the approach in this rulemaking. In the proposed rule, the agencies stated that, in our experience, mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation virtually always destroy or degrade waters of the United States. While this statement accurately describes our experience, we are not relying on such a factual finding to support the approach in the final rule. Rather, we view the final rule as legally appropriate in light of the language and structure of No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Section 404, which prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material except in compliance with a permit under Section 404. In our view, the addition or redeposit of any dredged material into waters of the U.S. associated with mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelizaton and other excavation constitutes a \"discharge,\" and is therefore prohibited if no permit is obtained under Section 404, unless otherwise exempted under Section 404(f). The approach taken by the agencies in this rule is to carve out a narrow exception to the Section 404 permitting requirement for certain discharges that are associated with activities thathave only de minimis environmental effects. We do not view this exception as compelled by the Act. There is no express de minimis exception in Section 404, and it would therefore be perfectly consistent with: the statutory scheme to require that any person discharging dredged mateial in the course of mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, other excavation or any other activity to obtain a Section 404 permit, without regard to the effects of the associated activity on waters of the U.S. Nonetheless, the agencies believe that the better approach in this case is to maintain a narrow exception for those activities that have only a de minimis effect on waters of the U.S. This exception, as explained above, is consistent with Section 404 and will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the program by focusing limited agency resources on activities having more than inconsequential environmental effects. The language and structure of the final rule have been modified to reflect the basis for the agencies' approach. First, the rule states that any addition or redaposit of dredged materials into waters of the U.S. incidental to any activity, including mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation constitutes a material.\" 33 CFR 323.2(d)(1)(iii); 40 CFR 232.2(e)[1)(iii), The rule therefore provides that a Section 404 permit is required for the incid3ntal discharge unless the dische:ger demonstrates to the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, prior to the discharge, that the activity associated with the discharge does net have or would not have the effect of destroying or degrading any area of waters of the Unii,:d States: Under the final rule, a d'szrirger bears the burden of demonstrating that such activities will not destroy or degrade the waters of the U.S., including wetlands. 33 CFR 323.2(d)(3)(i); 40 CFR 232.2(e)(3)(i).Given the language and structure of the Act, we believe that the approach adopted in the final rule is appropriate. Under the CWA, a party wishing to discharge dredged material into waters of the U.S. can only do so if it obtains a Section 404 permit, unless otherwise exempted. Therefore, if such a discharger conducting mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation desires to proceed without Section 404 authorization, we believe that it behooves the discharger to obtain an affirmative finding from the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, prior to the discharge, that the discharge is subject to the de minimis exception. Requiring dischargers to bear the burden of demonstrating that its activities do not require a Section 404 permit does not, as some commentors have asserted, place an unreasonable burden on the discharger. Rather, since the discharger would otherwise be required to obtain a permit for its activities, we believe that it behooves the discharger to demonstrate affirmatively that mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation activities should be exempted from the permitting requirement. Moreover, EPA and the Corps would not feel comfortable establishing a de minimis exception for mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation activities without the procedural protection of requiring an affirmative finding prior to the discharge by EPA or the Corps that the exception is appropriate in a particular case. This will ensure consistency in the application of the exception and guarantee that the exception is interpreted in a manner consistent with the purposes of the CWA. Under the final rule, dischargers conducting activities other than merhanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation which would not destroy or degrade waters of the United States (e.g., walking and vehicular traffic) do not require a prior finding by the relevant agency that the activity can proceed without obtaining a Section 404 permit. The agencies do not believe that it would be practical, or an efficient use of limited agency resources, to require a prior deterr,1iation in such cases. However, should any activity- inclu.Iing activities other than mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation- undertaken by a discha-Eer in fact have more than a de minimis effect on waters of the United States, that discharger is subject to enforcement action or citizen suit for discharging without a Section 404 permit.Some commentors objected to the proposal of regulating only activities that are associated with incidental discharges where those activities produce certain environmental effects. These commentors feli that the agencies should regulate any addition or redeposit associated with mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation, regardless of its impact on the aquatic environment. We do not believe, however, that it would be an effective use of limited agency resources to eliminate completely the de minimis language in the current definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" so that all incidental discharges would be regulated, wiilout regard to their environmental effect. The underlying purpose of Section 404 is to avoid, where possible, the degradation of our nation's aquatic resources due to discharges of dredged or fill material, and it is in keeping with that goal to focus limited agency resources on activities that have more than a de minimis effect on those waters. See Alabama Power Co. v. Castle, 636 F.2d 323, 357-360 (DC Cir. 1979). We also do not agree with one commentor that there should be an opportunity for an appeal to an independent panel of a decision to require a Section 404 permit. The CWA grants the Corps or EPA, as appropriate, the authority to determine that a certain activity is subject to the Section 404 permitting requirement. Allowing an\"appeal\" at such a preliminary stage in the permitting process would not be in accordance with the agencies' roles under the statute, and would be wasteful of limited agency resources. Many commentors recommended that the Corps specify the mechanism by which project proponents may demonstrate that their activity does not require a Section 404 permit. The Corps district engineer and EPA Region, as appropriate, will require the minimum information necessary to conduct an adequate evaluation of an activity's impacts. The submittal to the Corps district engineer will include, as necessary, the following information: A written description of the project; the specific landclearing, ditching, channelization, or excavation techniques to be used; the equipment to be used; the acreage and type of wetland or other waters of the U.S. to be affected; the extent and type of impacts projected; the change or loss of wetland functions and values that could be anticipated from the activity; a project location-vicinity map; the name, address and phone number of the applicant; and other site-specific information requested by the district45022 Federal Register / Vol. 58, Feea eitrIVl 8 o 8 ensa, uut2,19 ue n euain 52 engineer. Based on this information, the Corps district engineer or EPA Region,- as appropriate, will.determine, within a reasonable length of time, whether a Section 404 permit is required. One commentor recommended that the language of the proposed rebuttable presumption be modified to have the nature and extent of the impact assessed during the individual permit review process. We agree with the intent of this suggestion; however, no change is necessary. If an individual Section 404 ermit application is submitted, the rps willevaluate the nature and extent of the impacts of the activity and, if appropriate, return the application if no permit is required. Finally, we do not believe that a determination by the Corps or EPA that a-discharger must obtain a permit under today's rule would be subject to judicial review, since pre-enforcement review is not available under the CWA. See e.g., Avella v. Corps, 20 ELR 20920 (S.D. Fla. 1990), aff'd 916 F.2d 721 (11th Cir. 1990) (holding that Corps finding that a discharger could not proceed under a general permit and had to obtain an individual permit was not subject to judicial review). 3. Whether Specific Activities Will Destroy or Degrade Waters of the U.S. In the preamble to the proposal, we solicited public comment on whether there were certain categories of activities which, as a general rule, did not destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. and which therefore would not come within the scope of this regulation. We address below comments that were submitted on this issue. Many commentors felt that the modification of the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" was too expansive and would result in the regulation of such activities as walking, grazing, vehicular traffic, and boating in waters of the United States. Several other commentors indicated that they believe vehicular traffic should be regulated. As indicated above, under today's rule, we are not regulating every discharge associated with activities in waters of the U.S., but only those associated with activities which have or would have the effect of destroying or degrading any area of a water of the United States. We believe that activities such as walking, grazing, vehicular traffic and boating (excluding prop- dredging) in waters of the United States would not generally be regulated under this rule because, even if they do result in discharges, they generally do not destroy or degrade waters of the United States. As discussed previously, activities such as these do not require afinding prior to the discharge that the activity would not destroy or degrade waters of the United States. If the effect of the activity is de minimis, then a Section 404 permit is not required. One commentor stated that the following activities should be categorically excluded from regulation under Section 404: landclearing activities for the creation and maintenance of utility line corridors; mechanized landclearing in wetlands that are seasonally dry or frozen, provided that cutting of brush and timber occurs above the soil surface; and use of corduroy roads in constructing utility lines. Another commentor said that activities associated with the construction and maintenance of powerlines and distribution corridors should be exempted from regulation under Section 404 because they do not destroy or degrade wetlands. One commentor suggested that routine maintenance of pipeline rights-of-way should not require an individual permit since there is no long-term impact on vegetation. Another commentor stated that pipeline construction on Alaska's North Slope should be specifically identified as an activity that should be excluded from regulation under Section 404 because the pipelines are elevated and supported by pilings that result in only temporary de minimis discharges. If a landclearing operation does not disturb the soil, no discharge occurs; thus, such activities would not be regulated (see 33 CFR 323.2(d)(1); 40 CFR 232.2(e)(2)(ii)). We do not believe that it would be appropriate, as this commentor has suggested, to categorically exclude from regulation mechanized landclearing to create utility line or transmission line corridors. As we have explained above, where a discharge occurs, we believe that it is appropriate for the discharger to bear the burden of demonstrating that a particular activity will not destroy or degrade waters of the United States. Pipelines that are normally built on pilings and where no landclearing or fill pad construction is required are generally not regulated under Section 404. Similarly, we do not believe it is appropriate to categorically exclude from regulation mechanized landclearing in frozen or seasonally dry wetlands. While we agree with the commentor that cutting of brush and timber in wetlands above the soil's surface does not normally result in a redeposition of soil (see 33 CFR 323.2(d)(1)(ii); 40 CFR 232.2(e)(2)(ii)), as described in today's preamble at section 111(c), mechanized landclearing usually results in a discharge of dredgedmaterial, and the commentor has provided no basis for concluding that mechanized landclearing in seasonally dry or frozen wetlands will never result in such a discharge. We therefore do not believe there is a basis to exclude categorically such areas from the scope of this rule. Where a regulated discharge occurs, it is subject to this rule, regardless of the type of water of the U.S. in which it occurs. In response to the cornmentor's request that corduroy roads, (i.e., roads which are created by placing cut timber and brush along the centerline of a utility line corridor through a wetland without the addition of dirt or rock fill), should be exclud9d Lom Section 404 regulation, we agree that this activity generally does not constitute a discharge of dredged material. However, this activity may constitute a discharge of fill material, and require Section 404 authorization. The agencies cannot, as suggested by this commentor, administratively expand the statutory exemptions for farm, forestry and mining roads to include corduroy roads used for utility line construction unrelated to farming, forestry, or mining operations. Other activities that commentors contended should be excluded from regulation are: Maintenance of flood control structures according to design specifications; public health and safety projects; activities associated with the maintenance of natural or mitigated wetlands; construction or repair of water diversion structures to divert water under state water rights, where there is only a minor amount of excavation with temporary, minimal impacts; maintenance dredging of cooling water intake channels; dredging operations in wetlands; the creation of stormwater retention/detention basins for residential construction which involve only de minimis soil movement that should not destroy or degrade wetlands; certain wetland wildlife management activities, including wetland wildlife enhancement work and gravel placement in river channels to serve as salmon spawning habitat; and excavation in a dry streambed or similar areas, which will not cause destruction or degradation of a water of the United States. We do not agree with these commentors that these activities would, as a general rule, not result in discharges of dredged material that would destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. For example, a category of activities such as \"public health and safety projects\" relates to the purpose of the activity, not to whether it causes additions or redeposits of dredgedFederal Register / Vol. 58,No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45023 45024 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 1 Rules and Regulations material or whether it will destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. Activities associated with the maintenance of natural or mitigated wetlands might have an overall purpose of benefiting the environment, but may nonetheless cause certain adverse effects warranting review under Section 404. Such activities may be addressed through general permits if they would have minimal environmental impacts. Similarly, we do not believe that there is a basis for concluding that the other activities listed by this commentor will not destroy or degrade waters of the United States. However, some of these activities are authorized by existing nationwide and regional general permits. In addition, to the extent construction or repair of water diversion structures involve the construction or maintenance of irrigation ditches or the maintenance of drainage ditches, such activities may be exempt under Section 404(f) of the Act. Furthermore, we do not believe that today's rule will greatly burden the regulated public because, to the extent they involve minimal environmental impacts, the Corps will consider issuing general permits to regulate those activities. Two commentors requested that the nationwide permits not be subject to the presumption and demonstration requirements of Section 323.2(d)(2). They recommended adding to \u00a7 323.2(d)(2), as follows: \"(2) the purposes of paragraph (d)(1), mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, or other excavation activities in waters of the United States result in a discharge of dredged material. Further, where such activities occur in waters of the United States-and are not authorized under the Nationwide Permit Program at part 330, the activity is presumed to result in destruction * * *,\" We do not agree with the thrust of this comment. The tests in this rule go to the question whether an activity rasults in a discharge of dredged material requiring a permit under Section 404. By definition, activities already covered by a Section 404 permit (including nationwide permits) are subject to regulation. The scope, applicability and potential use of nationwido permits is not affected by today's rule. Those excavation activities that destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. but only have minimal adverse environental effects may qualify for coverage under a nationwide permit, Corps districts are encouraged to develop general permits for those classes of mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, and other excavation that aredetermined to have only minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects. Several commentors addressed discussion in the preamble to the proposed rule regarding \"snageing,\" which we stated included \"the removal of trees, parts of trees, or the like, from a water body to prevent their interfering with navigation.\" We concluded that such activities generally would not result in a disclarge and therefore would notbe subject to Section 404. unless ins particular case, the snagging operation would result in a discharge through redeposition of soil and would destroy or degrade a water of the United States. Some commentors agreed that snagging operations, such as the removal of trees and tree parts from streams, should be regulated. Two commentors stated that all snagging operations should be regulated, Another commentor asserted that snagging, especially in waters only subject to Section 404 jurisdiction and where Section 10 permits are not required, should be regulated because it involves a discharge and will result in significant adverse impacts to wetlands and water quality, One commentor suggested that the exclusion for snagging should be more narrowly defined to allow removal of tree and treeparts only where there is interference with navigation or where they are likely to obstruct normal stream flow. Several commentors expressed concern that the new proposed rules would negatively affoct flood control activities, such as snagging and dredging, by requiring Section 404 permits. Two commentors stated that an exemption to Section 404 is needed for the maintenance of flood control projects that involve the removal of vegetation. We have carefully consideed, these comments and believe that qualifying the term \"snagging\" in the proposal to include only the removal of trees and tree parts where that removal is to prevent their interfering with navigation is not appropriate. Therefore, for purposes of today's preamble, we are eliminating that qualification (i.e., prevention of interference with navigation, The determination of whether an activity involves a discharge of dredged ma' 4ria! is not based on the intent of the actioity; instead, that determination turns on whether there is any addition or redeposit of dredged material into waters of the United States. Where only vegetation is Rmoved during a snagging operation and no discharge of dredged or fill material occurs, a permit is obviously not required. Consequently, snagging operations will only be regulated whenthey would result in incidental discharges through redeposition of soil and the activity would destroy or degrade waters of the United States. For this reason, we do not agree with the commentor who suggested inclusion ofan additional qualifier (i.e., snagging only includes removal of trees or treeparts where they are likely to obstruct normal steam flow). While today's rule may affect those flood control projects that involve snagging operations that result in discharges of dredged material by requiring authorization under Section 404, some such activities may already be exempted under sections 404(f)(1) (B) and (C), and others may be covered by current general pemits. Also, in some cases, general permits may be developed where the adverse environmental effects of certain snagging operations that involve a discharge of dredged material into waters of the United States are determined to be minimal. Several commentors expressed concerns that the regulation of excavation would affect normal drainage practices around small isolated wetlands that allegedly have little or no value. It is unclear what this commentor means by normal drainage practices. Section 404(f) provides an exemption for maintenance of existing drainage ditches, and such practices would therefore not he affected by today's rule. To the extent they are not exempt, such activities in small isolated wetlands may also be authorized by nationwide permit number 26 or other general permits. In general, however, we believe that the approach suggested by the commentor is overboard. Smanll isolated wetlands can be of great cumulative importance to the aquatic ecosystem. Categorically exempting drainage activities in these areas from Section 404 of the Act would therefore not be warranted or appropriate, Two commentors stated that it was unclear how commercial sand and gravel dredging operations would be regulated and wanted exemptions for such operations. Several commentors wanted mining exemptions for the removal of overburden and sand and gravel mining operations in intermittent streams. While we appreciate these concerns, we believe that an exemption would be inappropriate for this type of activity since sand and gravel operations do involve excavation activities in waters of the U.S. and there is no basis to conclude categorically that these activities will not destroy or degrade waters of the U.S. Indeed, most mining activities result in significant alteration of the aquatic environment since their very purpose is to remove No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45025 overburden and substrate materials, and such activities generally would therefore have an identifiable adverse impact on the aquatic environment. We have, however, decided to include a grandfather provision for mining activities that have not been regulated prior to the adoption of this rule to allow time for operators to obtain the necessary permits and for the Corps to consider development and issuance of general permits for mining activities that have minimal individual and cumulative impacts. One commentor expressed concern that the rule would regulate \"normal reservoir operations.\" Such activities below the ordinary high water mark of a reservoir will often require Section 404 authorization; however, districts may develop regional general permits to authorize certain activities with minimal impacts, as appropriate. One commentor expressed concern that the new regulations would discourage developers from creating stormwater management ponds through the excavation of existing wetlands. The agencies note that today's rule is not meant to \"discourage\" activities that comply with the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, including the construction of appropriate stormwater management ponds. Under today's rule, the creation of stormwater management ponds will be regulated under Section 404 to the extent.that such creation involves a discharge of dredged material incidental to excavation activities which destroy or degrade wetlands or other waters of the United States. However, this does not mean these activities are prohibited, only that they require Section 404 authorization. As part of the permit evaluation process, the agencies will evaluate whether the proposal to excavate an existing wetland to create a stormwater management pond is the lea't environmentally damaging practicable alternative, a.d whether all appropr-ite actions have been taken to minimize impacts to the aquatic ecc3ystfm, and whether other Section 4C4 permitting criteria are met. Moreover, to the extent croat'on of stormwater management ponds require the construction of dikes or berms, such activitias would be regulated as a discharge of fill material, regardless of today's rule. Several commentors indicated we should regulate the pumping of water because pumping water from a wetland has the sane effect as draining, and, according to this commentor, \"the impact of draining would be considered an identifiable decrease\" in functions and values of waters of the U.S. We believe that pumping water from awetland or other waters of the United States would not, in and of itself, necessarily result in a discharge of dredged material. See Save Our Communityv. EPA, 971 F.2d 1155 (5th Cir. 1992). However, if excavation would be necessary to accomplish the pumping and the activity would destroy or degrade a water of the United States, then the discharge activity would be regulated under Section 404. Further, if the pumping resulted in a discharge of other pollutants to a water of the United States, such a discharge would be regulated under Section 402 of the CWA. Section 404 covers only discharges of dredged or fill material. We do not believe that simply placing a pipe into a water of the United States, per so, would necessarily involve a regulated discharge. One commentor indicated that the deepening and widening of existing ditches should be regulated. Maintenance of existing drainage ditches are exempted from the permit requirement under Section 404(f)1 )(C), provided the original dimensions of the drainage ditches are not increased. Those excavation activities in drainage ditches that deepen or widen an existing drainage ditch beyond the original dimension do not qualify for an exemption and, if they would expand the carrying capacity of the ditch, would likely ater the hydrological regime of adjacent areas, and therefore result in degradation. Some commentors indicated that they believe that many excavation activities are beneficial to the environment and result in increased aquatic functions and values, including excavation for purposes of stormwater management and maintenance of ditches, and were concerned that many such activities will be regulated under Section 404. However, even though these activities may have some beneficial effects, they can still have adverse effects by, for example, altering the hydrology of an area of the water of the U.S. Therefore, they may be covcred under this rule. However, the Corps will consider the use of general permits where such environmentally beneficial activities otheiwisa result in minimal impacts. In addition, particular cases where the applicant can dam'irctrate that the activity would not destroy or degrade a water cf the United States would not be regulated under Section 404. One commentor indicated that the preamble should clarify that the excavation of wetlands to place drainage tiles should be regulated under Section 404 since this involves a discharge and destroys wetlands. The excavation of wetlands to place drainage tiles iscurrently regulated under Section 404 unless such activities qualify for a Section 404(o exemption. Activities that involve replacing existing field drainage tiles where the replacement does not. increase the extent of drainage beyond that provided by the original tiling would generally qualify for such an exemption. E. Normal Dredging Operations Many commentors suggested that all discharges of dredged material should be regulated, stating that it does not seem reasonable or consistent to exclude discharges incidental to\"normal dredging operations\" for navigation, while regulating excavation for non-navigation purposes. One commentor stated that the proposal was extremely confusing because, while the preamble discussed eliminating the de minimis exemption, the proposed rule mentioned exemptions for certain de minimis activities. The commentor stated that the proposed rule has created a disparity with respect to excavation in waters of the United States versus normal dredging operations in navigable waters of the United States. Several commentors stated that, contrary to the explanation that normal dredging operations \"generally do not alter the reach or flow or circulation of the waters, nor do they convert waters of the United States into dry land or degrade wetlands,\" these operations do in fact have negative impacts. These commentors further cited specific examples, including increased sedimentation, changes in salinity, loss of habitat, alteration of flows, changes in circulation and lowered dissolved oxygen concentrations. Two commentors stated that the exemption for normal dredging operations to maintain navigation is acceptable so long as the term \"navigation channel\" is clearly defined as that type of channel capable of carrying commercial traffic. However, those commentors .,tzted that the extension or deepening of navigation channels should be regulated under Section 404. Today's rule clarifies that \"normal dredging operations\" will continue to be excluded from the definition of \"discharge of dredged material.\" \"Normal dredging operations\" are defined as \"dredging for navigation in navigable waters of the United States, as that term is defined in part 329 of this Chapter, with proper authorization from the Congress and/or the Corps pursuant to part 322 of this Chapter; however, this exception is not applicable to dredging activities in wetlands, as that terms is defined at \u00a7 328.3 of this Chapter\" (33 CFR 323.2(d)(3)(ii))..Federal Register / Vol. 58, 45026 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations There are several reasons for continuing to exclude incidental soil movement occurring during \"normal dredging operations\" from the regulatory definition of \"discharge of dredged material.\" The overriding goal is to ensure that discharges of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States are regulated in a satisfactory manner. In light of this goal, the Corps, as well as all other Federal or private dredging entities, fully comply with the regulatory reouirements of the Section 404 process for any and all disposal of the dredged material removed from the navigation channel during dredging and discharged in the waters of the United States, v,hether that dredged material has been generated by Corps or other dredging operations. Furthermore, the Corps applies for state Section 401 water quality certifications and any required state permits for these disposal activities. 'The Corps has established a two-part r,_gilatory framework for the actual dredging portion of its own normal dredging operations. Prior to conducting any normal dredging operations for Corps dredging projects, the Corps must comply fully with its Operations and Maintenance dredging regulations. (33 CFR 209, 335, 336, 337, and 338.) These regulations were developed by the Corps in 1986 specifically to address environmental and other aspects of normal dredging operations on the waters of the United States. Pursuant to these regulations the Corps must fully comply with NEPA, the Clean Water Act, including Section 401, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act, and all other applicable environmental laws. Furthermore, each time a federally authorized navigation channel is designated or modified, Congress, in effect, conducts a public interest review through the authorization process. This provides another safeguard that the subsequent normal dredging operations to maintain these channels are in the best interests of the Nation. The procedure is different for those normal dredging operations conducted by other Federal agencies or non- Federal entities. The Corps requires that these dredgers apply for a Section 10 Rivers and Harbors Act permit. The Section 10 permit process includes an extensive public interest review pursuant to which any adverse impacts of the proposed dredging are fully discussed and analyzed. The Corps must ensure that NEPA, CWA Section 401, the Coastal Zone Management Act,the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act, and all other applicable Federal environmental laws are complied with prior to granting a Section 10 permit. Considering these various types and levels of review, the Corps and EPA have concluded that it would not be in the public interest to require that the Corps, other Federal agencies, and private entities also be required to secure a Section 404 permit for each normal dredging operation. This process would be resource intensive and duplicative, and would only serve to divert limited Corps and EPA resources away from permit applications that deserve our careful scrutiny. Additionally, the Corps and EPA believe that this is an appropriate approach bpcaiise, as a general rule, normal dredgng operations which have been subdoctod to the above regulatory process and associated environmental safeguards do not have a substantially adverse effect on the aquatic environment. It may be true, as some commentors have stated, that normal dredging operations can, in some cases, cause changes in sedimentation, salinity, habitat, flows and circulation patterns, and dissolved oxygen concentration. However, the Corps and EPA believe that these impacts are adequately addressed as part of the regulatory and congressional review processes described above and do not warrant the additional scrutiny of the Section 404 regulatory process. As stated above, two commentors agreed that normal dredging operations conducted in Federal (Corps of Engineers) navigation channels should not be regulated under Section 404; however, these commentors argued that any deepening or extension of these channels should be regulated under Section 404. We disagree, and see no reason to distinguish between normal dredging operations, on the one hand, and channel deepening or extensions, on the other hand. For one thing, Congress must authorize any major extensions of, and any deepening of, any Corps Federal navigation channel. Through this authorization process, Congress is responsible for determining whether it is in the public interest to conduct these activities. Moreover, Federal agencies and non-Federal entities must apply for a Section 10 permit for any project to extend or deepen a Federal navigation channel. The Corps' and EPA s position that incidental soil movement associated with normal dredging operations does not constitute a discharge under Section404 is specifically addressed in the Corps' regulations at 33 CFR 323.2. Since 1977, the Corps has consistently held that Section 404 does not apply to incidental soil movement during normal dredging operations. We continue to believe that \"normal dredging operations\" to maintain or deepen navigation channels in the navigable waters of the United States, with proper authorization from the Congress and / or the Corps under Section 10, will not result in significant environmental impacts affecting the reach or flow or circulation of the waters, nor do they convert waters of the United States into dry land. The definition of \"normal dredging operations\" excludes dredging that takes place in wetlands. We made this exclusion to reflect the fundamental purpose of the normal dredging operations exception, which is to allow for the maintenance of navigation channels. We believe it would be a rare and exceptional circumstance for a party to propose dredging wetlands for purposes of navigation. If such an exceptional case were to arise, however, we believe that the activity should be evaluated under Section 404 in light of the special functions and values of wetlands that Section 404 is specifically designed to address. As we stated in the proposed rule, it is our desire to avoid duplicative regulation of dredging itself in waters within the jurisdictional scope of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Normal dredging operations in the navigable waters will continue to be regulated and evaluated under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. F. Section 404(f(1)(A) Exemptions Several commentors expressed concern that the language of the proposed rule might be construed as weakening the exemptions provided for normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities under Section 404(f(1)(A). A few commentors urged the continued exemption for normal farming and forestry practices as provided in Section 404(0. Many commentors requested clarification that the 404(f)(1) exemptions would not be affected by the new regulations and some requested that the following language be added to the rule: \"The term 'discharge or dredged material' does not include activities defined in 33 CFR 323,4(a).\" One commentor requested assurance by suggesting changing \u00a7 323.2(d)(2) to state that the existing exemptions of Section 404(f) are not presumed to have the effect of destroying or degrading waters of the United States. A few commentors stated that \u00a7 323.2(d)(1) be amended to read45026 Federal Register / Vol. 58,No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45027 \"the term does not include the activities defined in \u00a7 323.4(a)(1)-(6).\" We disagree that any further clarification is necessary. As indicated in the Preamble of the proposed rule, this rule does not change, in any way, the manner in which the Corps and EPA determine whether an activity is exempt under Section 404(f) of the CWA. Therefore, this regulation will not, in any way, affect the exemptions for normal agriculture, silviculture 'or ranching activities now provided by Section 404(f)(1)(A) of the CWA, or any of the other exemptions found in Section 404(f)(1). As part of today's rule, the agencies have also made an additional minor revision to the Corps' definition of \"discharge or dredged material\" which would make EPA's and Corps' definition consistent with each other and conform the definitions to the language and intent of Section 404(0. The EPA' pre-existing definition expressly excludes \"plowing, cultivating, seeding and harvesting for the protection of food, fiber and forest products.\" 33 CFR 323.2(d). EPA's current definition, by contrast, does not contain this exclusion, see 40 CFR 232.2(e), although the proposal would have added the Corps' language in EPA's definition. The final rule deletes this exclusion entirely from the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" because it has created confusion with regard to the effect of today's rule on the Section 404(0 exemptions. This exclusion in the Corps' regulation predates the adoption of Section 404(0 in the 1977 Amendments to the CWA. Clean Water Act of 1977, Public Law No. 95-217, 91 Stat. 1566 (amending 33 U.S.C. 1251-1376). Section 404(f)(1)(A) expressly lists these activities as examples of normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities exempt from Section 404, unless the activities would be recaptured under Section 404(f)(2). The exclusion of these activities from the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" is broader than the exemption in Section 404(f) because, under the Corps' regulatory definition, these activities would never require a Section 404 permit, even if they would have effects \"recapturing\" the activities under Section 404(f0(2). Since Congress expressly stated in Section 404(0 that discharges associated with these activities require a permit if they would be recaptured under Section 404(f0(2), we believe that the exclusion in the current rule should be deleted in order to be consistent with Congressional intent in this area. The Corps and EPAreiterate that today's rule, including deletion of this sentence, has no effect with regard to the scope and applicability of the Section 404(f) exemptions. This is further emphasized in the rule at \u00a7\u00a7 323.3(d)(3)(iv) and 232.2(e)(3)(iv). Under Section 404(f)(1), discharges of dredged or fill material associated with certain activities, including normal farming, ranching, and silviculture activities, are exempt from the Act's permit requirement, provided that they are not \"recaptured\" under Section 404(0(2). G. Grandfather Provision Numerous commentors requested that the Corps and EPA include a grandfather provision as part of the revised definition of \"discharge of dredged material.\" In light of these comments and consistent with past Corps practice, the Corps and EPA have included such a provision in this part of the final rule. By including a grandfather provision here, the Corps and EPA are intending to avoid application of the revised definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" in a manner that would frustrate the reasonable expectations of persons who, as explained below, justifiably relied on the previous definition of that phrase as interpreted by the regulatory agencies. At the same time, however, we are also mindful of the goals of today's rule and the overall goals of the Clean Water Act. Therefore, we have developed procedures to \"grandfather\" certain \"discharges of dredged material\" that, in some Corps districts, were riot considered to be subject to regulation under the previous definition of that term. Under these procedures, Section 404 authorization will not be required for discharges of dredged material associated with ditching, channelization and other excavation activities in waters of the United States where such discharges were not previously regulated and where such activities had commenced or were under contract prior to the date of publication of this final rule in the Federal Register, and where such activities are completed within one year from the date of publication of the final rule. This provision does not apply to discharges associated with mechanized landclearing because the Corps current policy (reflected in RGL 90-5) has generally subjected this activity to Section 404 regulation. To further ensure that implementation of the revised definition proceeds in a fair and equitable manner, the Corps will be able to extend the one-year grandfather provision on a case-by-case basis-subjectto the following three conditions: (1) The excavation activity is of a type that occurs on an ongoing basis, either continuously or periodically (e.g., seasonally); (2) the discharger submits a completed individual permit application to the Corps within one year from the date of publication of this final rule; and (3) the total time period within which the excavation activity proceeds subject to this grandfather provision does not exceed three years from the date of publication of today's rule. The agencies recognize that the revised definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" is likely to apply to some persons who have been engaging in ongoing excavation activities, such as some mining or sand and gravel operations, which given their ongoing nature on either a continual or periodic basis, will not be able to be completed within one year from the date of publication of today's rule. Therefore, in situations where persons engaged in excavation activities occurring on an ongoing basis have acted in good faith by submitting a complete individual permit application seeking Section 404 authorization for such activities no later than one year from the date of, publication of this rule, the agencies elieve it is appropriate to retain sufficient flexibility to ensure that such persons are not prevented from proceeding with these excavation activities pending the evaluation of a Section 404 permit application for the discharges associate dwith the activity. The agencies have further determined that a grandfather period not to extend beyond three years from publication of today's rule is sufficiently long to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the regulated community in a manner consistent with the environmental goals of this rulemaking and the Clean Water Act. Moreover, discharges associated with activities that were regulated by a particular Corps district prior to the promulgation of this rule will not be subject to the grandfather provision in the regulation. If a discharger is uncertain whether its activity was regulated by the Corps district in which the discharge would take place, the discharger should contact the Corps district. Finally, the grandfather provision does not apply to landclearing activities, since the Corps has interpreted current regulatory provisions as covering mechanized landclearing under the Section 404 program since 1990. See RGL 90-5. H. General Permit Comments .We invited public comment to identify mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, or otherFederal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday. August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations excavation activities that would generally have minimal environmental impacts and therefore be potential candidates for authorization under general permits. Several commentors suggested activities that are either exempt from regulation or already covered under the nationwide general permit program. Several commentors suggested that activities having minimal environmental impacts should be authorized by general permits, but they did not give specific candidate activities. Another commentor indicated that all activities should be regulated on a case-by-case basis. Several activities were suggested for authorization by general permits. These include all mechanized landclearing; mechanized landclearing in seasonally dry or frozen wetlnds where brush and timber c,itting occurs above the soil surface; landclearing for creation and maintenance of utility line or overhead transmission line corridors; water diversion structures constructed to exercise water rights; activities when states already have effective regulatory controls; discharges incidental to dredging or excavation to improve fish and/or wildlife habitat or to restore previously filled wetlands; excavation in dry streambeds; use of a hydroax to clear vegetation; creation of stormwater retention/detention basins for residential construction; and sand and gravel mining activities having minor impacts. The general permit program is an extremely important regulatory tool used by the Corps to regulate effectively activities with minimal impacts on the aquatic environment. The Corps does not have the resources to regulate all activities on a case-by-case individual permit basis. Therefore, we must focus our resources on those activities with more than minimal impacts. Moreover, general permits are very effective in protecting the aquatic environment, because they are issued with stringent conditions that limit authorized activities to those with minimal adverse effects. This regulation may increase the number of discharges regulated by the Corps nationwide. In order to administer reasonably the regulatory program and protect effectively the environment, the Corps will identify those activities with minimal impacts and pursue development of general permits. We appreciate the suggestions made and will consider them for possible issuance as nationwide or regional general permits in the near future. Any proposed nationwide permits will be published in the Federal Register and any proposed regionalgeneral permits will be proposed by p ublic notice to obtain public comment fore a decision is made whether to issue such nationwide or regional general permits. IV. Revision to Definition at \"Discharge of Fill Material;\" 33 CFR 323.3(c) and 40 CFR 232.2(r) We have organized the numerous comments on the regulation of pilings as fill material into several issues. Our discussion of the comments is provided below. A. Summary of Major Issues and Changes From the Proposal Many commentors supported the proposed revisions on the grounds that the regulation of the placement of pilings as a discharge of fill material was necessary under Section 404 to ensure that adverse impacts to wetlands and other aq,i:-c resources are minimized. Miury of these commentors, as explained in more detail below,. also argued that the placement of pilings should be regulated as a discharge of fill material in all circumstances, and that the proposed revisions contained unnecessary and unjustified limitations and exceptions. Other commentors contended that EPA and the Corps lacked the authority under the CWA to regulate the placement of pilings as fill material. Concerns were also raised by commentors that the terms used in the proposed revisions were not adequately defined by the agencies. Based upon public comments, the agencies have made certain changes to the language in the regulations to clarify when the placement of pilings constitutes a discharge of fill material subject to regulation under Section 404. Under the final rule, the placement of pilings in waters of the United States shall require a Section 404 permit when such placement has or would have the physical effect of a discharge of fill material. The agencies have made two major changes to the rule in response to public comments. First, we have deleted the \"functional use and effect\" test in the proposed rule. In addition, the final rule does not contain an exception for structures \"traditionally constructed\" on pilings. For the reasons explained further below, we agree with commentors who argued that the physical effect of the placement of pilings (as opposed to its functional use, or whether the structure was traditionally placed on pilings) should be the focus for determining when placement of pilings constitutes a discharge of fill material. We recognize, however, that some projects generallyuse pilings in a manner that does not result in the same physical effect as the placement of fill material. Consequently, the final rule notes that placement of pilings for these projects (i.e., linear projects, piers, wharves, and individual houses on stilts) generally do not have the effect of a discharge of fill material and therefore a Section 404 permit will generally not be required for these projects. The Corps and EPA, nevertheless, reserve the right on a case- by-case basis to determine that the proposed placement of pilings to support a particular linear project or a articular pier, wharf, or individual home on stilts does hav/e or would have the effect of fill material and therefore requires Section 404 authorization. B. Need for Regulating Pilings Having the Effect of Fill The Corps adopted RGL 90- in order to address projects placed on pilings in waters of the U.S. that would have the kinds of adverse environmental consequences generally associated with discharges of fill material, but which were not subject to any environmental review under Section 404 to avoid or mitigate those adverse effects. For example, in one case, a developer proposed a large, multi-use high rise waterfront complex which would have covered over 16 acres of the East River in New York. The developer proposed an unconventional construction method, using pilings instead of solid fill to support the 16 acres of structures. The developer apparently pursued this course of action in order to try to avoid the necessity of obtaining a Section 404 permit. To provide the necessary structural support, the pilings would have been so large and so closely spaced that they would have physically displaced over 20% of the bottom surface area and the water column. In addition to the physical displacement of aquatic habitat due to the extraordinarily dense spacing, the project would have substantially altered current and sedimentation patterns such that at least some of the covered area would have silted in and eventually lost its character as a water of the U.S. In another case, a 13-acre hotel/office development project was proposed to be constructed in palustrine forested wetland in New Jersey. This wetland was identified as habitat for more than 80 species of birds, including numerous migratory birds that had witnessed decreasing population numbers due to fragmentation and loss of habitat. The developer originally proposed that the project be built on fill material, which would have required a Section 404 permit, but subsequently proposed to45028 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45029 build virtually the identical project on 12-16 inch diameter pilings. While the pilings did not need to be spaced densely to support the structure, as in the East River situation, the platform supporting the 13 acre development would have rested from 3 inches to approximately one foot above the wetland. The project would therefore have prevented sunlight from reaching almost all of the 13 acres of wetlands underneath the structures, thereby making wetland vegetation growth impossible and causing the area to lose virtually all of its wildlife habitat value. The project also would have contributed to soil erosion by killing vegetation that provide soil stability, resulting in interference with the site's natural flood protection function, and impairment to downstream water quality. Ultimately, the developer decided not to pursue this project. - In both of these cases, the environmental effects of the projects would have been severe, comparable in many respects to the effects that would have resulted had the projects been built on fill material. Adoption of RGL 90-8 reflected the Corps' belief that allowing such projects to proceed without any environmental review under Section 404 would not be consistent with the goals and objectives of the CWA or Section 404. Regulating pilings when the project would have the effect of fill will therefore help insure that potentially damaging activities constructed on pilings in waters of the United States are reviewed under Section 404. C. Comments on Agencies' Legal Authority To Promulgate This Aspect of the Regulation Several commentors argued that EPA and the Corps lack legal authority under the Clean Water Act to issue the proposed regulation. These commentors, however, did not cite any provision of the statute or discussion in the legislative history to support this contention; they simply asserted that placement of pilings having the effect of fill was not the same thing as a discharge of fill material itself. We believe, however, that today's rule is a reasonable exercise of our authority under the statute. The CWA does not define the term, \"fill material.\" Nor does the CWA specifically address, in any manner whatsoever, whether the placement of pilings in waters of the U.S. is a discharge of fill material subject to Section 404 of the Act. Therefore, it is up to EPA and the Corps to determine a reasonable regulatory approach to this activity, consistent with the languageand purposes of the CWA. We have made what we believe to be a very straightforward determination here that placement of pilings is a discharge of fill material when it would have the effect of fill material on waters of the U.S. The agencies believe that this approach is entirely consistent with the language of the Act, and helps effectuate the underlying goal of the statute of protecting our nation's aquatic resources. Several commentors requested that we not pursue this rulemaking but instead wait to see how Congress addresses pilings in the upcoming reauthorization of the CWA. Because this rule is entirely consistent with existing statute, we see no reason to delay promulgating this rule. One commentor argued that there is no justification for regulating certain pilings under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, but not regulating them as \"fill\" under the Clean Water Act, when the pilings are placed in waters subject to jurisdiction of both Acts. This commentor also suggested that Section 10 jurisdiction does not substitute for Section 404 jurisdiction. Today's decision to define fill material under Section 404 to include the placement of certain pilings is not in any manner related to the regulation of pilings under Section 10. Section 10 establishes an independent regulatory program that regulates any work, among other things, in navigable waters that affects the navigable capacity of those waters. Regulatory jurisdiction under Section 10 does not depend to any degree on whether the work involves a \"discharge of fill material.\" Therefore, we do not believe, as this commentor does, that the scope of activities regulated under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of CWA must be the same. D. Establishment of \"Effects\" Tests and Exceptions to the Regulation of the Placement of Pilings as Fill Material The proposed rule contained language that would have regulated the placement of pilings where the pilings were essentially equivalent to a discharge of fill material in physical effect or in functional use and effect. In addition, the rule would have provided exceptions to the regulation of the placement of pilings as fill material in circumstances involving linear-projects or projects which have traditionally been constructed on pilings. , Commentors expressed several concerns with this approach. First, several commentors contended that all pilings, without exception, should be regulated. One commentor also arguedthat pilings are by definition \"fill material\" and therefore must be regulated in all cases. Numerous commentors were concerned that the proposed rule was arbitrary since it would regulate the placement of pilings based on what type of structure is built on the pilings. Asserting that the functional use of the pilings is irrelevant, several commentors suggested that the agencies rely solely on the physical effect test to determine when the placement of pilings wculd constitute fill material. Other commentors disagreed, supporting the inclusion of a functional use and effect test. We agree with commentors who argued that it is not appropriate to determine whether Section 404 applies to the placement of pilings solely on the basis of the functional use of the pilings or whether the structures on the pilings have traditionally been built in this fashion. As discussed earlier, the agencies have deleted the \"functional use and effect\" test set forth in the proposed rule. We agree with certain commentors that this test was vague, and that focusing on the use of the pilings structure is not appropriate where our paramount concern is the effect of the placement of pilings on the aquatic environment. Our primary motivation in adopting the pilings RGL in December 1990 and in proposing this rule, has been to address the growing practice among some project proponents of building large development projects on pilings, even though they would normally have been placed on top of fill material. In these cases, the projects had a clear adverse impact on the aquatic environment, yet no permit was being required for the activity. While the type of structures built on top of pilings can be indicative of how the pilings will affect the aquatic environment, ultimately it is the effect of the pilings that is of concern to us. Focusing solely on those effects will therefore simplify imp lamentation of this regulation. For the same reasons, the final rule provides that the placement of pilings will not be excluded from regulation under Section 404 based on whether the structures they support are traditionally constructed on pilings. The final rule will require a Section 404 permit when the placement of pilings has or would have the effect of a discharge of fill material; this test will be applied in all circumstances. The final rule also provides examples of activities that generally have the effect of a discharge of fill material, including the following: projects where the pilings are so closely spaced that sedimentation rates would be increased; projects in which theFederal Register / Vol. 58, 45030 Federal Register I VoL 58, No. 163 I Wednesday, August 25, 1993 I Rules and Regulations pilings themselves effectively would replace the bottom of a waterbody; projects involving the placement of pilings that would reduce the reach or impair the flow or circulation of waters of the United States; and projects involving the placement of pilings which would result in the adverse alteration or elimination of aquatic functions. We disagree, however, with the commentor who argued that the placement of a piling is by definition a discharge of fill material in all cases and that all pilings must therefore be regulated under Section 404. As discussed above, the CWA does not define fill material. We believe that it is reasonable to define the placement of pilings as a discharge of fill material when such placement would have the effect of fill material. This commentor apparently believes that EPA and the Corps are compelled to regulate the placement of a piling in waters of the United States as a discharge of fill material, even where the placement would not have effects associated with discharges of fill material. We see no provision of the Clean Water Act that would compel tbe adoption of such an approach. We have taken what we believe to be a straghtforward and common-sense approach to defining when the placement of pilings Is a discharge of fill material, an approach that we believe is entirely consistent with the Clean Water Act. Several commentors raised concern over the exception for the placement of pilings in linear projects. Some commentors suggested deleting the exception based on their concerns that adverse impacts to the aquatic ecosystem wouid occur as a result of the construction of linear projects. One commentor suggested that linear projects not be except.3d If the project would \"significantly alter the flow of water or incre.se sedimentation so that the quantity rnd quality of habitat is reduced.\" One comzntentor also suggested that the exception for projects that have traditionally been constructed on pilings b- eliminated, while another commentor was conc6med that determining what constitutes a pier or marina is subject to \"elastic interpretations\" and therefore should not be exempted. Other commentors supported the exception for linear projects, and one commentor requested that \"hot-oil\" pipelines constructed In Alaska's North Slope be included in the list of linear projects where the placement of pilings would not require a Section 404 permit. Some commentors argued that the proposed exceptions wbre too narrow, and suggestedadditional examples of activities involving the placement of pilings that should not be considered a discharge of fill material. In particular, several commentors suggested that the examples of structures that would not require a Section 404 permit due to their having been traditionally constructed on pilings should be expanded to include \"commercial and industrial structures interrelated to wharves, piers, and marinas.\" Finally, one commentor suggested that all non-water dependent activities in waters of the United States be regulated under Section 404. We believe that linear project construction on pilings will generally not have the physical effect of fill material. We recognize, however, the possibility that such projects could, in certain cases, have the effect of fill material and therefore should be subject to Section 404. Therefore, the regulation does not establish a definitive rule that linear projects will never have the effect of fill material. Nonetheless, we believe that it will be a rare case when pilings used for linear projects have the effect of fill material and require authorization under Section. 404. The most significant factors in determining whether placement of pilings has the effect of fill material are how densely the piles are placed, the size of the pilings, and the ground clearance of the structures built on pilings, and the overall areal coverage of the structures built on pilings. Closely spaced pilings of any size, for example, can have the effect of substantially replacing an aquatic area. Very large pilings, regardless of their spacing, may also substantially replace an aquatic area. Large or closely spaced pilings can also affect current patterns and sedimentation rates. The above- ground clearance, and the overall areal coverage of the structures built on pilings, affect the suitability of the area underneath for vegetation and wildlife. The losses of aquatic and wetland functions and values under these circumstances can be the same as would occur from the discharge of fill material itself. Most linear projects (piers, wharves, bridges, elevated roads and pipelines, etc.) do not require either closely spaced pilings or overly large pilings since they generally do not support massive structures requiring great support. Also, although some linear projects (e.g., bridges and elevated roads and pipelines) may be quite long, they generally are not very wide, and therefore would generally not result in the overall areal coverage that can result in substantial adverse effects onvegetation and suitability of the area.as wildlife habitat. Although an individual home on pilings is generally not \"linear\" in design, it generally shares many of the same attributes as linear projects so that we believe that It generally will not have the effect of fill material. Most pile supported individual houses require neither closely spaced nor large pilings, An individual home also generally does not cover large areas. Some commentors objected to the term \"single-family\" houses contained in the proposed rule. We agree that this term was somewhat vague and confusing. We have substituted the word \"individual\" for\"single-family\" in the final rule in order to more effectively exclude larger structures (e.g., a development of multiple single-family houses) that may indeed have the effect of a discharge of fill material, as outlined above. We do not take the position that pile supported linear projects and an individual house on pilings can never have any adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem. Obviously, aquatic life located where a single piling is placed will be crushed by the placement of the piling. Similarly, even less-than-massivestructures on widely spaced pilings have some effects on the aquatic environment. We, however, are concerned with the cases where the pilings and structures they support cause impacts on the aquatic environment comparable to those which occur with the discharge of fill material (i.e., by displacing many or all of the aquatic functions of an area). Today's rule will ensure that such effects do not occur without undergoing environmental review under Section 404 of the CWA. We do not agree with commentors who argued that we should expand the proposed exceptions to include\"commercial and industrial structures interrelated to wharves, piers and marinas.\" Such a broad category of structures could certainly include those with large area coverage or those built on large or closely spaced pilings; therefore we cannot find as a general matter that these types of structures generally would not have the effect of fill material.Several commentors expressed concern over the manner in which the effects tests were defined. Some of these commentors suggested that the rule should be consistent with the test proposed for determining whether a discharge of dredged material occurs, i.e.. the rule should clarify that the placement of pilings should be regulated as a discharge of fill material only when the activity would destroy orNo. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations .45030 Federal Register / Vol. 58, Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45031 degrade any area of waters of the United States. One commentor suggested that the proposal to regulate the placement of pilings as fill material when a project\"significantly alters or eliminates aquatic functions and values\" was too vague. Another commentor was concerned that the proposed test of whether the \"pilings are so closely spaced that sedimentation rates are increased\" would be difficult to implement given technical difficulties in predicting sedimentation rates. Commentors also requested that we develop specific thresholds, such as flow/temperature, or volume change, to determine if pilings have the same physical or functional effect as fill material. For example, one commentor recommended setting a standard volume of piles to be used in one project below which a project would not be regulated because there would be \"minimal environmental impact.\" One commentor suggested that use of the phrase\"essentially the same effects as fill\" was vague, and left open questions of how similar the effect would have to be in order to be \"essentially the same.\" The agencies disagree with the comments that suggested the inclusion of the same \"destroy or degrade\" test proposed for the definition of \"discharge of dredged material.\" We note that the definition of \"discharge of dredged material,\" unlike that of the \"discharge of fill material,\" historically has contained an exclusion for de minimis discharges associated with\"normal dredging operations.\" As part of today's rule, the agencies are narrowing that exclusion in a manner that we believe carries out the purposes and objectives of the CWA. There is no comparable language in the agencies' definition of \"discharge of fill material\" and we see no justification for adding such language. In response to the comment that\"significantly alters or eliminates aquatic functions and values\" was too vague, we have deleted the term\"significantly.\" We agree that this qualifier would add confusion to the determination of whether the placement of pilings should be regulated as fill material, and Is unnecessary. We agree with the comment that precise przedictions would be difficult. We believe, however, that Corps and EPA staff are able to make general predictions regarding sedimentation rates that may result from the placement of pilings. Moreover, we believe that such generalized findings would be sufficient to determine whether a placement of pilings would have the effect of a discharge of fill material. Ccnsequently, we have retained thispart of the proposed rule without modification. We agree with the concern expressed over the use of the term \"large\" when referring to structures, and have deleted it from the final rule. We have not set specific standards or thresholds to measure the physical effect of pilings as suggested by comments, as we believe the circumstances related to each situation are so diverse that setting specific standards would be inappropriate. Instead, we believe the determination of the effect of the placement of pilings should be determined on a case-by-case basis considering the facts of each individual case. We agree with the commentor that\"essentially\" the same is unclear, and we have deleted use of the term\"essentially\" in the final rule. E. Additional Comments A few commentors expressed the need to note specifically that existing nationwide permits are not affected by this rule and that activities determined not to be subject to Section 404 regulation may still need a Section 10 permit when undertaken in traditionally navigable waters of the United States. With regard to the first point, today's rule does not modify, in any manner, current authorizations provided by existing nationwide permits. However, the Corps will examine the need for additional general permits under Section 404 for those projects involving the placement of pilings that have less than minimal adverse effects on the environment. In addition, as specifically provided for in today's rule, the placement of pilings in traditionally navigable waters of the United States remains subject to authorization under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Another commentor expressed concern that the regulation will prohibit construction of any structures in wetlands (either on fill material or on pilings). This is clearly not our intent. The Corps authorizes thousands of projects involving fill material every year, and the Corps expects to authorize activities on pilings where appropriate. One commentor proposed that a set of quantifiable standards be developed for how and where structures such as decks may be built. We believe that national standards for pile supported structures are inappropriate; instead, these determinations are more properly addressed on a case-by-case basis in the permitting process. One commentor suggested that pilings should be defined to include pile caps, columns, piers and abutments which are part of linearprojects, such as bridges. We agree with this comment. V. Revision to the Definition of Waters of the United States to Exclude Prior Converted Cropland A. Background and Rationale for the Final Rule. The agencies proposed to add language in the definition of waters of the U.S. providing that the term does not include prior converted (\"PC\") cropland, as defined by the National Food Security Act Manual (NFSAM) published by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). PC cropland is defined by SCS as areas that, prior to December 23, 1985, were drained or otherwise manipulated for the purpose, or having the effect, of making production of a commodity crop possible. PC cropland is inundated for no more than 14 consecutive days during the growing season and excludes pothold or playa wetlands. EPA and the Corps stated in the preamble to the proposal that we were proposing to codify existing policy, as reflected in RGL 90-7, that PC cropland is not waters of the United States to help achieve consistency among various federal programs affecting wetlands. Some commentors supported the proposed change. They felt that it was important for EPA, the Corps and the Department of Agriculture to follow consistent procedures and policies, because to do otherwise undermines the credibility and effectiveness of federal wetlands protection programs. Other commentors opposedthe change in its entirety or took issue with specific aspects of the PC cropland definition that they believed were inappropriate. We have decided to retain the approach contained in the proposed rule. The reasons for this approach and responses to comments opposing the proposal are discussed below. As stated in the preamble to the proposal, we are excluding PC cropland from the definition of waters of the U.S. in order to achieve consistency in the manner that various federal programs address wetlands. One commentor argued that such consistency is not a\"goal of the CWA,\" and that it was therefore not appropriate to base wetlands policy on this consideration. We believe, however, that effective implementation of the wetlands provisions of the Act without unduly confusing the public and regulated community is vital to achieving the environmental protection goals of the Clean Water Act. The CWA is not administered in a vacuum. Statutes other than the CWA and agencies other 45032 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations than EPA and the Corps have become an integral part of the federal wetlands protection effort. We believe that this effort will be most effective if the agencies involved have, to the extent possible, consistent and compatible approaches to insuring wetlands protection. We believe that this rule achieves this policy goal in a manner consistent with the language and objectives of the CWA. Moreover, we believe that excluding PC cropland from the definition of waters of the U.S. is consistent with EPA's and the Corps' paramount objective of protecting the nation's aquatic resources. By definition, PC cropland has been significantly modified so that it no longer exhibits its natural hydrology or vegetation. Due to this manipulation, PC cropland no longer performs the functions or has values that the area did in its natural condition. PC cropland has therefore been significantly degraded through human activity and, for this reason, such areas are not treated as wetlands under the Food Security Act. Similarly, in light of the degraded nature of these areas, we do not believe that they should be treated as wetlands for the purposes of the CWA. The altered nature of PC cropland was discussed in RGL 90-7, in which the Corps concluded that cropped conditions constitute the \"normal circumstances\" of such areas. The Corps contrasted PC cropland with \"farmed wetlands,\" defined by SCS as potholes and playas with 7 or more consecutive days of inundation or 14 days of saturation during the growing season, and other areas with 15 or more consecutive days (or 10 percent of the growing season, whichever is less) of inundation during the growing season. Because the hydrology of farmed wetlands has been less drastically altered than it has for PC cropland, the Corps stated in RGL 90-7 that farmed wetlands continued to retain their basic soil and hydrological characteristics, and that such areas should therefore be considered to be wetlands. B. Technical Validity of Excluding PC Cropland From Regulation Under Section 404 Several commentors argued that it was not technically valid to treat all PC cropland as non-wetlands. These commentors pointed out that the SCS definition of PC cropland excludes areas that are inundated for more than 14 consecutive days a year, and they argued that this requirement was inconsistent with EPA's and the Corps' regulatory definition of wetlands, which includes areas that have wetlandhydrology due to inundated or saturated soil conditions. We believe that these commentors have oversimplified the relationship between the SCS definition of PC cropland and the wetlands definition under Section 404. In fact, except for a brief period of time after the adoption of the 1989 Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (1989 Manual), the Section 404 program has generally not considered such farmed areas as meeting the regulatory definition of wetlands under the CWA. In 1986, the Corps issued RGL 86-9, which interpreted the phrase \"normal circumstances\" in our regulatory definition of wetlands as-referring to an area's characteristics and use in the present and recent past. Under this interpretation, cropped areas did not constitute wetlands where hydrophytic vegetation has been removed by the agricultural activity. In the 1989 Manual, EPA and the Corps modified this approach and evaluated whether a cropped area retained wetland hydrology to the extent that wetland vegetation would return if the cropping ceased. Under the 1989 Manual, therefore, the phrase \"normal circumstances,\" as applied to agricultural areas, meant the circumstances that would be present absent agricultural activity. The Corps ceased using the 1989 Manual in August, 1991 at the direction of Congress (Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1992, Pub) L. 102-580) and began using its earlier 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (1987 Manual) for wetlands delineations. EPA is currently also using the Corps' 1987 Manual in implementing Section 404 (See 58 FR 4995, January 19, 1993). While the 1987 Manual does not address application of the \"normal circumstances\" phrase as it relates to areas in agricultural production, both agencies continue to follow the guidance provided by RGL 90-7, which interprets our regulatory definition of wetlands to exclude PC cropland.' The evolution over the last several years in the EPA and Corps policy for delineating wetlands in agricultural areas attests to the difficult technical, legal and policy considerations that bear on this issue. We therefore disagree with commentors who seemed to believe that ascertaining the jurisdictional status of PC cropland is a cut-and-dried technical question readily resolved by reference to generally accepted delineation methodologies. In utilizing the SCS definition of PC cropland for purposes of Section 404 of the CWA, we are attempting, in an area where there is nota clear technical answer, to make the difficult distinction between those agricultural areas that retain their wetland character sufficiently that they should be regulated under Section 404, and those areas that been so modified that they should fall outside the scope of the CWA. As is inevitable where the government engages in such line- drawing, we recognize that the particular line we have chosen to draw is not perfect. Two areas that are inundated for 14 days and 15 days a season respectively may not, in fact, differ materially in terms of their function and values. This criticism, however, could be made no matter where we chose to draw the line between wetlands and non-wetlands. We believe that the distinctions under the Food Security Act between PC cropland and farmed wetlands provides a reasonable basis for distinguishing between wetlands and non-wetlands under the CWA. In addition to the fact that we believe this distinction is an appropriate one based on the ecological goals and objectives of the CWA, adopting the SCS approach in this area will also help achieve the very important policy goal of achieving consistency among federal programs affecting wetlands. C. Role of SCS PC Cropland Determinations In the preamble to the proposal, we stated that jurisdictional determinations under the CWA can only be made by EPA and the Corps. While we stated we would accept and concur in SCS determinations to the extent possible, this rule does not alter the final authority of EPA regarding CWA jurisdiction. This discussion in the preamble was criticized by commentors from several angles. Some commentors were concerned that the proposed rule effectively \"delegated\" EP4's and the Corps' authority regarding CWA jurisdiction to SCS. Some of these commentors urged that SCS be required to obtain Corps (or EPA) concurrence for the purposes of making PC cropland determinations. From the other side, commentors argued that EPA and the Corps should not be allowed to make an independent judgment at a site, and should be required to defer absolutely to SCS determinations. In response to these comments, we note that today's rule does not \"delegate\" EPA's ultimate authority for determining the scope of geographic jurisdiction under the CWA. At the same time, we believe it is critical that duplication between the SCS's wetlands program and the CWA Section 404 No. 163 I Wednesday. August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45033 program be reduced. In that regard, we believe that farmers should generally be able to rely on SCS wetlands determinations for purposes of complying with both the Swampbuster program and the Section 404 program. In order to make this reliance possible, we are working with SCS to develop appropriate procedures, including monitoring, for coordinating wetland determinations by the agencies. We are also working with SCS to develop field guidance for implementing the 1987 Corps Manual to clarify procedures for identifying wetlands in areas managed for agriculture, and are expediting current efforts to revise the SCS's NFSAM to provide greater consistency between our wetlands delineation procedures. Moreover, we are also developing an interagency training program with SCS and other agencies to ensure that agency field staff are properly trained, and that standard, agreed-upon methods are utilized in maklng wetland determinations. However. in order to clarify the relationship between determinations made by SCS and the Corps or EPA, we have added language to the rule itself stating that the final authority regarding CWA jurisdiction remains with EPA. We also disagree with commenters who stated that SCS should be required to obtain EPA or Corps concurrence in their PC cropland determinations. First, since SCS is the administering agency under the Food Security Act, we do not believe it would be appropriate to require that SCS obtain the concurrence of other federal agencies before making determinations under that statute. Moreover, requiring EPA/Corps concurrence on every PC designation made by the SCS would be an inefficient use of our limited resources, since a site being evaluated by SCS may not be one where a regulated activity will occur (i.e., a discharge of dredged or fill material not exempt under Section 404(f)). In those cases, a Section 404 delineation will not be necessary at all, and expanding our resources on delineations in such cases would be a waste of taxpayer money. In light of EPA's ultimate statutory responsibility for determining the scope of CWA jurisdiction, we cannot satisfy commentors who argued that we should be required to defer absolutely to SCS determinations. However, recognizing SCS's expertise in making these PC cropland determinations, we will continue to rely generally on determinations made by SCS. Many commentors expressed concerns about the alleged lack of consistency and reliability in SCS prior converted cropland determinations.These commenters stated that most SCS PC cropland determinations are made based on aerial photos, and they argued that site visits were necessary to accurately delineate wetlands under Section 404. As discussed earlier, the SCS, in consultation with the Corps and EPA, is working to improve the consistency of its prior converted cropland determinations. D. Expand Exclusion to All Agricultural Areas Some commentors argued that the exclusion of agricultural areas should not be limited to land that meets the SCS definition of PC cropland but that the exclusion should apply to any agricultural area that is not inundated for more than 14 consecutive days during the growing season, While these commentors believed there would be advantegaes to trating all agricultural areas s~rni!r ly in this manner, we believe that such considerations ae outweighed by the importance of achieving the goal of consistency with the PC definition under the Food Security Act. E. Incorporation of NFSAM Into EPAI Corps Regulations Several commentors made the procedural argument that adoption of the NFSAM by reference into EPA's and the Corps' regulations violated the Administrative Procedure Act. These commentors pointed out that the NFSAM had not yet gone through rulemaking when it was adopted by SCS and they argued that reference to the NFSAM in the proposed rule was not legally adequate. Other commenters questioned the appropriateness of incorporating the NFSAM into EPA's and the Corps' regulatory provisions when the agency that developed'the manual (SCS) uses it as a guidance document. Some commentors also felt that EPA and the Corps should retain the flexibility to follow future revisions to the NFSAM made by SCS. As explained above, one of the primary reasons that EPA and the Corps are amending the definition of waters of the United States to exclude prior converted croplands is to ensure consistency in the way various federal agencies are regulating wetlands. We believe that consistency with SCS policy will best be achieved by our utilizing the NFSAM in the same manner as SCS, i.e., as a guidance document used in conjunction with other appropriate technical guidance and field testing techniques to determine whether an area is prior converted cropland. We also agree with the commentors' arguments about the* need to be able to maintain consistency with SCS in the future when revisions are made to the NFSAM; incorporating one version of the manual into EPA's and the Corps' regulations would impair our ability to follow future revisions to the NFSAM in administering Section 404. The final rule. therefore, continues to exclude prior converted cropland from the definition of waters of the United States, but does not specifically incorporate by reference the provisions of the NFSAM. EPA and the Corps will, however, implement this exclusion in a manner following the guidance contained in the NFSAM and appropriate field delineation techniques, and will continue to rely. io the extend appropriate, on determinations made by SCS. The Corps and EPA will continue to work with SCS on procedures for implementing the prior converted cropland port[ion of the NFSAM. We will also is_:uc policy guidance directing our field stsif to utilize the guidance in the NFSAM when determining the presence of wetlands on agricultural lands. By codifying our existing policy that prior converted croplands are not waters of the U.S., the final rule strengthens the regulatory basis for not regulating these areas under Section 404. The fact that we have not incorporated by reference the actual provisions of the NFSAM into our rules does not undercut our ability to maintain this consistency. Rather. as explained above, we believe that utilizing the NFSAM as a guidance manual, as it is used by SCS, will enhance consistency in the administration of the Food Security and Clean Water Act programs. F. Section 404(f) Exemptions Some commentors expressed concern that codifying Regulatory Guidance Letter 90-7 would eliminate all exemptions for agricultural activities under Section 404(f)(1)(A) of the Act, Other commentors felt that the rule was not needed and that prior converted croplands should be considered exempt under the Section 404(f) normal farming activities exemption. As previously stated in this preamble, today's rule will not eliminate or in any way effect the exemptions for normal farming, ranching, or silviculture activities in Section 404(f)(1). Moreover, the exemptions apply only to discharges and not to the issue of whether an area Is within the geographic scope of Section 404. G. Criteria for Abandonment Some commentors expressed concerns that the abandonment rule was not clear. A few commentors opposedFederal Register / Vol. 58, 45034 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 I Wednesday, August 25, 1993 I Rules and Regulations the use of prior converted croplands for non-agricultural uses. One commentor objected to the fact that there is no mechanism providing for \"recapture\" into Section 404 jurisdiction of those prior converted croplands that revert back to wetlands. One commentor objected to the requirement that a prior converted cropland is considered abandoned unless it is used for the production of an agricultural commodity at a regular interval, stating that it should include use for any agricultural production, including hay and pastureland. The Corps and EPA will use the SCS provisions on \"abandonment,\" thereby ensuring that PC cropland that is abandoned within the meaning of those provisions and which exhibit wetlands characteristics will be considered wetlands subject to Section 404regulation. While we agree that SCS's abandonment provisions may be complex, SCS has been applying these provisions for several years in implementing the Swampbuster program, and farmers have become familiar with the standards used to determine whether a property has been \"abandoned.\" If EPA and the Corps were to use different abandonment provisions in implementing today's rule, we believe the resulting inconsistency between the two regulatory programs would serve only to create confusion as to which standards are applicable to the same parcel of property. In response to commentors who opposed the use of PC croplands for non-agricultural uses, the agencies note that today's rule centers only on whether an area is subject to the geographic scope of CW4 jurisdiction. This determination of CWA jurisdiction is made regardless of the types or impacts of the activities that may occur in those areas. The agencies also note that today's rule will provide a mechanism for \"recapturing\" into Section 404 jurisdiction those PC croplands that revert back to wetlands where the PC cropland has been abandoned. Finally, in response to the request that a PC cropland not be considered abandoned if the area is used for any agricultural production, regardless of whether the crop is an agricultural commodity, we note that SCS's abandonment provisions do recognize that an area may be used for other agricultural activities and not be considered abandoned. In particular, PC .,,ropland which now meets wetland criteria is considered to be abandoned unless: For once in every five years the area has been used for the production of an agricultural commodity, or the areahas been used and will continue to be used for the production of an agricultural commodity in a commonly used rotation with aquaculture, grasses, legumes or pasture production. H. Grandfather Clause One commentor said that RGL 90-7 results in the retroactive grandfathering of illegal drainage activities between 1977 and 1985. It has been and continues to be the position of the Corps and EPA that unauthorized discharge activity cannot eliminate Section 404 jurisdiction. Therefore, wetlands that were converted to prior converted cropland between 1972 and 1985 as a result of unauthorized discharges of dredged or fill material do not constitute\"prior converted cropland\" within the meaning of today's rule and remain\"waters of the United States\" subject to Section 404 regulation. VI. Environmental Documentation Some commentors wanted the Corps to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), arguing that this rulemaking constitutes a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Some commenters felt that since these rules protected wetlands, an EIS would be needed to determine such environmental effects as mosquito infestation, odors, and gases. Others wanted an EIS prepared because they felt that these rules would result in a loss of wetlands. One commentor requested that the Corps prepare an EIS for farming, forestry and ranching disturbances and other questionable wetland Impacts before proceeding with further rulemaking. Section 511(c) ol the CWA provides that, except for certain actions not relevant here, no action by EPA constitutes a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment with the meaning of NEPA. In this joint rulemaking by EPA and the Corps, these two agencies are making substantively identical revisions to their regulations in order to better carry out the purposes of Section 404 of the CWA. EPA is exempt from NEPA under Section 511(c), and we believe that, under the circumstances of this joint rulemaking, the Corps is exempt as well. Nonetheless, the Corps has prepared an environmental assessment and determined that there will not be a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. This assessment is contained in the record for this rulemaking. Consequently, an EIS has not been prepared by the Corps. Furthermore, appropriate environmentaldocumentation, including an EIS when required, is prepared by the Corps for all permit decisions. VII. Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act Numerous commentors indicated that a regulatory Impact analysis under Executive Order 12291 should be done because the rule would allegedly cause an increase in the Corps' workload and in costs to permit applicants and because the rule will allegedly result in additional encumbrances or burdens on the public in the form of tax increases, project delays, project scrutiny and increased project costs. One commentor felt that agency resources would be diverted from larger, more significant projects by this rule. EPA and the Corps do not believe that this regulation meets the definition of a major rule under Executive Order 12291, and we therefore have not prepared a regulatory impact analysis for the rule. Some commentors also argued that the agencies were required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for this regulation under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. EPA and the Department of the Army certify, pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, that this regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of entities. Therefore we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis for this rule. EPA and the Corps do not believe that this regulation will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities first because most of the components of this rule merely codify current agency policies and these aspects of the rule will therefore not result in any increased regulatory burden on the public, including small businesses. Since 1990, the Corps has followed the policy under RGL 90-5 of regulating mechanized landclearing activities under Section 404. Similarly, RGL 90-8 established, in December 1990, the Corps policy of regulating the placement of pilings when the activity would have the effect of discharge of fill material. The amendment of the definition of waters of the United States in today's rule also codifies the agencies' current policy of not regulating prior converted cropland under Section 404, as reflected by Corps RGL 90-7. RGL 90-7, moreover, eased the regulatory burden of the Section 404 program by excluding prior converted cropland from coverage under this provision. EPA and the Corps believe, moreover, that coverage of discharges associated with ditching, channelization and otherNo. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations 45034 Federal Register / Vol. 58, Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulaions 45035 excavation activities that would destroy or degrade waters of the United States should not result in a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Prior to today's rule, the Corps has uniformly regulated these activities where they were accomplished by excavating dredged material and sidecasting the material in adjacent waters of the United States. Conducting these activities without sidecasting dredged material is technically difficult nd costly, and operators unable or unwilling to pay the costs to perform their activities in this manner have therefore already been subject to the Section 404 program. In addition, the practices of Cors districts have varied in this area, with some districts already regulating ditching, channelization and other excavation activities where dredged material was not sidecast. Therefore, we do not believe that the incremental regulatory burden associated with this aspect of the regulation should be significant. Moreover, EPA and the Corps have included a provision in this regulation that would minimize any increased regulatory burden that may result from subjecting some activities to Section 404 jurisdiction for the first time. The rule does not regulate discharges of dredged material associated with activities that would not destroy or degrade waters of the United States. Establishing this threshold for requiring a Section 404 permit should be relevant for small entities in most instances, since they may be more likely than large operations to engage in minor activities having only a de minimis impact on the aquatic ecosystem. Some commentors believed that there would be regulatory impacts on the public due to regulating activities such as mowing, certain snagging activities, pumping, and vehicular traffic. While such activities may occur in waters of the United States, they generally do not involve a discharge of dredged material or would not have the effect of destroying or degrading a water of the United States and therefore would not trigger the requirement of a Section 404 permit. I addition, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble, the Corps intends to issue general permits (regional or nationwide) for newly regulated activities that would have a minimal individual or cumulative impact on the aquatic environment. Issuance of general permits should further reduce any regulatory burden associated with complying with today's rule. Finally, one primary purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act is to encourage agencies to explore regulatory alternatives that would minimizeimpacts of the regulatory scheme on small entities. See 5 U.S.C. 604(a)(2) (requiring that final regulatory flexibility analysis include \"a description of each of the significant alternatives to the rule * * * designed to minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities\"). The only issue addressed in this rulemaking, however, is whether a discharge of dredged or fill material will require a Section 404 permit. Under Section 404, there are therefore only two regulatory \"alternatives\" available to the agencies: either a Section 404 permit is required or it is not. Section 404 does not authorize any other \"intermediate\" regulatory control mechanisms for regulated discharges that the agencies could consider establishing for small entities. Because, under Section 404, the requirement to obtain a permit is the sole tool for regulating activities covered by this provision, we do not believe that there are less burdensome alternatives available to achieve the objectives of this rulemaking. Rather, we believe that the appropriate forum for exploring means of reducing impacts on small businesses is through the permitting process itself (e.g., through issuance of general permits where appropriate, and by tailoring permit requirements to the severity of the environmental harm, which in turn may correlate with the size of the entity undertaking the project). As explained previously, the agencies have considered in this rulemaking alternatives that may, indirectly, have resulted in less of a regulatory burden on small entities (e.g., by excluding from regulation activities associated with a discharge of dredged material that would not have a\"significant\" effect on the environment). For the reasons explained in this preamble, however, we rejected these alternatives as not being consistent with the language, goals and/or objectives of Section 404. Therefore, we believe that the final rule reflects a regulatory approach that appropriately meets the requirements of Section 404. Note 1.-The term \"he\" and its derivatives used in these regulations are generic and should be considered as applying to both male and female.

Section 323.2(0 is amended by adding a sentence at the end that reads as set forth below. \u00a7323.2 Definitions. (d)(1) Except as provided below in paragraph (d)(2), the term discharge of dredged material means any addition of dredged material into, including any redeposit of dredged material within, the waters of the United States. The term includes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) the addition of dredged material to a specified discharge site located in waters of the United States; (ii) the runoff or overflow from a contained land or water disposal area; and (iii) any addition, including any redeposit, of dredged material, including excavated material, into waters of the United States which is incidental to any activity, including mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, or other excavation. (2) The term discharge of dredged material does not include the following: (i) discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States resulting from the, onshore subsequent processing of dredged material that is extracted for any commercial use (other than fill). These discharges are subject to section 402 of the Clean Water Act even though the extraction and deposit of such 45036 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations material may require a permit from the Corps or applicable state Section 404 program. 0i) activities that involve only the cutting or removing of vegetation above the ground (e.g., mowing, rotary cutting, and chainsawing) where the activity neither substantially disturbs the root system nor Involves mechanized pushing, dragging, or other similar activities that redeposit excavated soil material. (3) Section 404 authorization is not required for the following: (i) any incidental addition, including redeposit, of dredged material associated with any activity that does not have or would not have the effect of destroying or degrading an area of waters of the United States as defined in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section; however, this exception does not apply to any person preparing to undertake mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation activity in a water of the United States, which would result in a redeposit of dredged material, unless the person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, prior to commencing the activity involving the discharge, that the activity would not have the effect of destroying or degrading any area of waters of the United States, as defined in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section. The person proposing to undertake mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation activity bears the burden of demonstrating that such activity would not destroy or degrade any area of waters of the United States. (ii) incidental movement of dredged material occurring during normal dredging operations, defined as dredging for navigation in navigable waters of the United States, as that term is defined in part 329 of this chapter, with proper authorization from the Congress and/or the Corps pursuant to part 322 of this Chapter; however, this exception is not applicable to dredging activities in wetlands, as that term is defined at section 328.3 of this Chapter. (iii) those discharges of dredged material associated with ditching, channelization or other excavation activities in waters of the United States, including wetlands, for which Section 404 authorization was not previously required, as determined by the Corps district in which the activity occurs or would occur, provided that prior to August 25, 1993, the excavation activity commenced or was under contract to commence work and that the activity will be completed no later than August 25, 1994. This provision does not applyto discharges associated with mechanized landclearing. For those excavation activities that occur on an ongoing basis (either continuously or periodically), e.g., mining operations, the Corps retains the authority to grant, on a case-by-case basis, an extension of this 12-month grandfather provision provided that the discharger has submitted to the Corps within the 12- month period an individual permit application seeking Section 404 authorization for such excavation activity. In no event can the grandfather period under this paragraph extend beyond August 25, 1993. (iv) certain discharges, such as those associated with normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities, are not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under Section 404. See 33 CFR 323.4 for discharges that do not reM uired permits. 4) For purposes of this section, an activity associated with a discharge of dredged material destroys an area of waters of the United States if it alters the area in such a way that it would no longer be a water of the United States. [Note: Unauthorized discharges Into waters of the United States do not eliminate Clean Water Act jurisdiction, even where such unauthorized discharges have the effect of destroying waters of the United States.] (5) For purposes of this section, an activity associated with a discharge of dredged material degrades an area of waters of the United States if it has more than a de minimis (i.e., inconsequential) effect on the area by causing an identifiable individual or cumulative adverse effect on any aquatic function.

Section 323.3(c) Is added to read as follows: 1323.3 Discharges requiring permits. * * * * (c) Pilings. (1) Placement of pilings in waters of the United States constitutes a discharge of fill material and requires a Section 404 permit when such placement has or would have the effect of a discharge of fill material. Examples of such activities that have the effect of a discharge of fill material include, but are not limited to, the following: Projects where the pilings are so closely spaced that sedimentation rates would be increased; projects in which the pilings themselves effectively would replace the bottom of a waterbody;projects involving the placement of pilings that would reduce the reach or Impair the flow or circulation of waters of the United States; and projects involving the placement of pilings which would result in the adverse alteration or elimination of aquatic functions. (2) Placement of pilings in waters of the United States that does not have or would not have the effect of a discharge of fill material shall not require a Section 404 permit. Placement of pilings for linear projects, such as bridges, elevated walkways, and powerline structures, generally does not have the effect of a discharge of fill material. Furthermore, placement of pilings in waters of the United States for piers, wharves, and an individual house on stilts generally does not have the effect of a discharge of fill material. All pilings, however, placed in the navigable waters of the United States, as that term is defined in part 329 of this chapter, require authorization under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (see part 322 of this chapter).

(1) Except as provided below in paragraph (2), the term discharge of dredged material means any addition of dredged material into, including any redeposit of dredged material within, the waters of the United States. The term includes, but is not limited to, the following: i} The addition of dredged material to a specified discharge site located in waters of the Untied States; (ii) The runoff or overflow, associated with a dredging operation, from a contained land or water disposal area; and (iii) Any addition, including any redeposit, of dredged material, including excavated material, into waters of the United States which is incidental to any activity, including mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, or other excavation. (2) The term discharge of dredged material does not include the following: (i) Discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States resulting from the onshore subsequent processing of dredged material that is extracted for any commerjal use (other than fill). These discharges are subject to section 402 of the Cksn Water Act even though the extraction and deposit of such material may require a permit from the Corps or applicable state. (ii) Act';vities that involve only the cutting or iemoving of vegetation above the ground (e.g., mowing, rotary cutting, and chainsawing) where the activity neither substantially disturbs the root system nor involves mechanized pushing, dragging, or other similar activities that redeposit excavated soil material. (3) Section 404 authorization is not required for the following: (i) Any incidental addition, including redeposit, of dredged materialFederal Register / Vol. 58, No. 163 / Wednesday, August 25, 1993 / Rules and Regulations associated with any activity that does not have or would not have the effect of destroying or degrading an area of waters of the U.S. as defined in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this definition; however, this exception does not apply to any person preparing to undertake mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation activity in a water of the United States, which would result in a redeposit of dredged material, unless the person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, prior to commencing the activity involving the discharge, that the activity would not have the effect of destroying or degrading any area of waters of the United States, as defined in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this definition. The person proposing to undertake mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation activity bears the burden of demonstrating that such activity would not destroy or degrade any area of waters of the United States. (ii) Incidental movement of dredged material occurring during normal dredging operations, defined as dredging for navigation in navigable waters of the United States, as that term is defined in 33 CFR part 329, with proper authorization from the Congress or the Corps pursuant to 33 CFR part 322; however, this exception Is not applicable to dredging activities in wetlands, as that term is defined at S 232.2(r) of this Chapter. (iii) Those discharges of dredged material associated with ditching, channelization or other excavation activities in waters of the United States, including wetlands, for which Section 404 authorization was not previously required, as determined by the Corps district in which the activity occurs or would occur, provided that prior to August 25, 1993, the excavation activity commenced or was under contract to commence work and that the activity will be completed no later that August 25, 1994. This provision does not apply to discharges associated with mechanized landclearing. For those excavation activities that occur on an ongoing basis (either continuously or periodically), e.g., mining operations, the Corps retains the authority to grant, on a case-by-case basis, an extension of this 12-month grandfather provision provided that the discharger has submitted to the Corps within the 12- month period an individual permit application seeking Section 404 authorization for such excavation activity. In no event can the grandfatherperiod under this paragraph extend beyond August 25, 1996. (iv) Certain discharges, such as those associated with normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities, are not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under Section 404. See 40 CFR 232.3 for discharges that do not require permits. (4) For purposes of this section, an activity associated with a discharge of dredged material destroys an area of waters of the United States if it alters the area in such a way that it would no longer be a water of the United States. Note: Unauthorized discharges into waters of the United States do not eliminate Clean Water Act jurisdiction, even where such unauthorized discharges have the effect of destroying waters of the United States. (5) For purposes of this section, an activity associated with a discharge of dredged material degrades an area of waters of the United States if it has more than a de minimis (i.e., inconsequential) effect on the area by causing an identifiable individual or cumulative adverse effect on any aquatic function. Discharge of fill material. (1) The term discharge of fill material means the addition of fill material into waters of the United States. The term generally includes, without limitation, the following activities: Placement of fill that is necessary for the construction of any structure in a water of the United States; the building of any structure or impoundment requiring rock, sand, dirt, or other material for its construction; site-development fills for recreational, industrial, commercial, residential, and other uses; causeways or road fills; dams and dikes; artificial islands; property protection and/or reclamation devices such groins, seawalls, breakwaters, and revetments; beach nourishment; levees; fill for structures such as sewage treatment facilities, intake and outfall pipes associated with power plants and subaqueous utility lines; and artificial reefs. (2) In addition, placement of pilings in waters of the United States constitutes a discharge of fill material and requires a Section 404 permit when such placement has or would have the effect of a discharge of fill material. Examples of such activities that have the effect of a discharge of fill material include, but are not limited to, the following: Projects where the pilings are so closely spaced that sedimentation rates would be increased; projects in which the pilings themselves effectively would replace the bottom of a waterbody; projects involving the placement of pilings that would reducethe reach or impair the flow or circulation of waters of the United States; and projects involving the placement of pilings which would result in the adverse alteration or elimination of aquatic functions. (i) Placement of pilings in waters of the United States that does not have or would not have the effect of a discharge of fill material shall not require a Section 404 permit. Placement of pilings for linear projects, such as bridges, elevated walkways, and powerline structures, generally does not have the effect of a discharge of fill material. Furthermore, placement of pilings in waters of the United States for piers, wharves, and an individual house on stilts generally does not have the effect of a discharge of fill material. All pilingq, however, placed in the navigable waters of the United States, as that term is defined in 33 CFR part 329. require authorization under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (see 33 CFR part 322).
