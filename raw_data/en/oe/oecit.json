Pollard said working out whether or not the vaccine worked would likely come this year, after which the data would have to be carefully reviewed by regulators and then a political decision made on who should get the vaccine. \"Our bit \u2014 we are getting closer to but we are not there yet,\" Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said. Asked if he expected the vaccine would start to be deployed before Christmas, he said: \"There is a small chance of that being possible but I just don't know.\" The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to be submitted for regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate. \"If I put on my rose-tinted specs, I would hope that we will see positive interim data from both Oxford and from Pfizer/BioNTech in early December and if we get that then I think we have got the possibility of deploying by the year end,\" Kate Bingham, the chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, told lawmakers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was the prospect of a vaccine in the first quarter of 2021. Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees. The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again. If Oxford's vaccine works, it would eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic. Asked what success looked like, he said: \"I think good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy \u2014 so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is \u2014 is an enormous achievement. \"It means from a health system point of view, there are fewer people with Covid going into hospital, that people who develop cancer can have their operations of chemotherapy - its a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points.\" But Pollard, one of the world's top experts on immunology, said the world might not return to normal immediately. \"It takes time to roll out vaccines. Not everyone will take them,\" he said. Thirsty drinkers in England will be enjoying their final freshly poured pints in a pub for a month on Wednesday while shoppers will get one last dose of retail therapy as the country prepares to join large swathes of Europe in lockdown as part of intensified efforts to contain the resurgent coronavirus. Pubs, along with restaurants, hairdressers and other retailing outlets deemed to be selling non-essential items, such as books and sneakers, will have to close their doors Thursday until at least December 2 following a sudden change of course last weekend by the British government. Johnson had for weeks argued in favour of more regional strategies to contain the virus, but said he had to be \"humble in the "}
