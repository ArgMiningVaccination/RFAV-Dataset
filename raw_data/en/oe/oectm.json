To treat a patient, the acupuncturist uses hair-thin needle to stimulate special points on the body, which are carefully chosen based on the appropriate Traditional Oriental Medicine diagnosis. When the needle activates the energy in the meridians, the patient may feel tingling, heaviness, or warmth around the point being needled. When energy flows free through the meridians, the body obtains all the essential nutrients and energy for itself. And when it reaches to the optimal energy stage level, your body is pain and disease free.
