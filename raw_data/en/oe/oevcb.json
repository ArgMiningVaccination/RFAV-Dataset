Stay home. Stay safe. What this means for homeopaths and their patients Regulated health professionals provide essential care to their patients and are among those businesses permitted to open during all stages of lockdown and reopening. Homeopaths should continue to operate with a preference for remote practice whenever possible. Please refer to your local Public Health Unit to identify initiatives in place in your community. All primary care providers are encouraged to implement a system for virtual and/or telephone consultations. When possible, primary care providers should conduct a consultation over the phone, video or secure messaging to determine if a virtual/telephone consultation will suffice or if an in-person appointment is necessary. The purpose of this is to support physical distancing and minimize contact of persons within health-care settings who may have COVID-19. In cases where in-person visits are necessary, appropriate measures, including PPE and infection control, should be implemented.
