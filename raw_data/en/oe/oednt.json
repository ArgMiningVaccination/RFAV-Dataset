Why can't I recover from Lyme disease?\" Lyme Disease: From Victim to Vitality When Jennifer walked in my door last spring, she was shockingly frail, underweight, paralyzed on her right side, losing her vision, depressed, anxious, and barely able to keep even a few morsels of food down. She was ravaged by insomnia, and having been through a recent divorce as well, she was hanging by a thread. She came to me after witnessing her dear friend fully recover from stage 3 ovarian cancer, with the help of my techniques and methods of natural medicine. Today, approximately a year later, Jennifer is a healthy, vibrant, and sparkling soul, ever willing to help another in need, to lend an ear and even a few dollars to help ease the pain of a fellow \"Lymewayfarer.\" She has completely recovered from the anatomical, physiological, and biochemical damage that her Lyme disease created within her, is currently working full time, and training to be fit again with yoga and meditation. The elegance of medicine lies in knowing when to wean ourselves off of harsh chemicals, and turn to the wisdom of plants, nature, and biological medicine to help us truly repair damage and heal from within. Integrative Medicine is the Key No one can kill their way to health. The body is a sacred vessel of the soul. We are all beings of light, and every cell carries the healing light of our maker within us. Every strand of our DNA is programmed to seek homeostasis and balance. Yes, we do need to bring out-of-control microbes back in check, with fast-acting allopathic medication during acute phases of any disease - but the elegance of medicine lies in knowing when to wean ourselves off of harsh chemicals, and turn to the wisdom of plants, nature, and biological medicine to help us truly repair damage and heal from within. Almost every patient I see benefits both spiritually and emotionally from a physiological detox. The process is difficult, but then again, true change is never easy. It takes great willpower, faith in oneself, and a positive attitude that this universe will bend over backwards to help heal and accommodate a spiritually awakened child of hers. The therapeutic ideal we strive for is a complete healing of all systems - body, mind, and spirit. These are not separate - in reality, we need all three to work together to remain fit, healthy, and happy. In integrated medicine, we look at health as beyond freedom from physical disease. Health is a deeper strength, balance, and a mind-body wellness that must be achieved along with absence of disease. I truly believe that the future of healthcare lies in the fusion of allopathy with alternative therapies, giving rise to a system that will treat each patient holistically and according to their own unique needs.
