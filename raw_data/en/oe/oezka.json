A must-read for every parent. Emphasis on autism, manufacturing, safety and efficacy of vaccines. A review of the literature, this book will save the reader months of research. Complete revision of the 8th edition. 190 pages. 325 references. I actually read the Twelvth Edition, which I assume is much more up-to-date since he cites so much recent data. I found his book to be very imformative and comprehensive, yet quick and to-the-point making it a very easy read. His references are impressive and he encourages the reader to check his sources for validity because he isn't afraid he'll be proven wrong. His overarching views that our blood is sacred and that all we need to do is \"follow the money\" both made sense to me. I definitely recommend this book to all parents facing vaccinations for their children. Many parents of permanently developmentally ill children state they wish knew this information before they chose to vaccinate. Better to be informed. While shrill, mis-informative, conspiracy-laden, very poorly written and possibly dangerous, in this book o'Shea reminds us how much we still don't understand about health and wellness. If doctors better understood what causes childhood cancer, SIDS, SBS, and autism, books like this would not proliferate. Germ theory of disease has given way to genetic biome theories and nutrition science continues to confuse parents. What is clear is that the average American has far more vaccinations today than 60 years ago but it is not clear that we are healthier, and this many to consider the cause-effect relationship of vaccines on our health. WOW. eye opening inforation. I can only wonder how things would be different if more people REALLY put vaccination information in their own hands. Do you know how little testing goes into each vaccine? Do you know what they put IN it? Do you know it's effectiveness (or lack of it)? Do you know who is making a ton of money off of this and how? Vaccination Is Not Immunization by Tim O'Shea is an excellent and well documented expose' on the history of vaccines, what's included in them, the harm they can cause and most importantly, the MONEY behind them. Perhaps you'll discover that you and your children can live and be safe without vaccines. Eye opening book. I am grateful there is still information available to one who wants to read up more on vaccines. It was very helpful information at the time when my children were having various reactions to their timely vaccinations. Every parent should read it. O'Shea, a chiropractor keeps cranking out antivax moldy oldies in this book, now in its fifth edition of misinforming readers. O'Shea claims he's not antivaccine - but he apparently opposes every single vaccine recommended for children and adults on the grounds that they're not 100% safe and effective (the Nirvana fallacy says that something that isn't perfect is worthless). He also argues that there's no \"independent third-party research\" supporting vaccination, something easily contradicted by checking references on PubMed, the free scientific literature database or consulting pro-immunization websites. Deception is a key part of this book. For instance, O'Shea alleges that children receive \"69 vaccines\". The actual number of recommended vaccines is 15 from infancy through age 18, which protect children from serious and sometimes fatal diseases. The trick employed by O'Shea and other antivaxers is to count total doses, not vaccines (although they can't even count those properly). This tactic, meant to scare parents, is akin to describing prescription of a twice-daily antibiotic for two weeks as \"28 antibiotics\". O'Shea fearmongers about imaginary \"toxins\" in vaccines, ignoring the real toxins produced in large quantities by pathogens during disease outbreaks. To get a further idea of how bizarre O'Shea's beliefs are, visit his website, which offers you a chance to buy \"hydrolyzed bovine collagen\" to mix into your drinks and other pricey supplements. He also claims that \"healthy people don't get sick\", which must be a revelation to the families of many otherwise healthy people who've died during the Covid-19 pandemic and from other infectious diseases including influenza. Just get your spines adjusted regularly, avoid evidence-based medicine, mix cow by-products into your food and you'll be disease-proof, suggests Tim. Earlier editions of Tim O'Shea's antivax diatribe were subtitled \"The Sanctity of Human Blood\", but that was dropped, possibly because it sounded too crazy for even those susceptible to his message. Then again, maybe that message is finding a new audience, since modern-day opponents of Covid-19 vaccines have taken to calling themselves \"purebloods\" and fantasizing that their \"untainted\" blood and sperm will command high prices. I'm not sure what to think about this book. If everything the authors says is right then a lot of the medical system in the US is very messed up and I'm not totally convinced of that. Still I do think vaccinations are questionable and even dangerous. There is no question that childhood illnesses, allergies, and autism have dramatically inceased over the last generation. It's certainly possible vaccinations are part of the problem. We are such complicated creatures that it is very hard to ponpoint one culprit. I applaud O'Shea for his indepth research in such a difficult and controversial topic. I read this book shortly before my first daughter was born while I was attending chiropractic school. It really helped me become pro vaccines. The overwhelming majority of this books argument is not scientifically based. I get it, sticking stuff in your arm is not natural and needles are scary. The most diseases were gone before vaccines came out still baffles me. Literally the only hold out for polio in the world is a war tore area of the Middle East that has trouble distributing vaccines. The only argument that was scientifically based with merit was the cleanliness argument and improved medication argument. Vaccines are not the only thing saving lives, but you're going to have a really hard time convincing me that small pox disappeared from washing hands. There are STILL in 2021 so many areas in the world without access to clean water and it's nearly been a full generation since the last wild small pox case reared its ugly head. Anyway, good book if you want to get a well rounded view of anti vaccine folks. I read this book because I don't like making decisions about something so polarizing as vaccinations without understanding the point of both sides of the fence! He made a lot of great points and had credible citations of actual studies and data, which I liked. But the author's language was a little too inflammatory for me. I understand his passion in writing this, but when I read literature that's meant to educate me and provides scientific resources, I would have appreciated it more if it were more professionally worded and less emotional! Ugh...this book goes against everything I know and believe as a scientist. It challenged some of my thinking and was clearly biased propaganda against vaccination. I'm not sure it swayed my opinions, but, I will say, it opened my eyes to new ways of considering immunization techniques and the true necessity of mandated vaccination. 2017 edition re-read after my initial read of 2013 edition in 2016. Good updates and great concise summary of relevant research on vaccines. Countless hours of research and references all in one place and opportunity to explore further with the 300+ citations listed. Editing is a bit rough with occasional typos and formatting issues, but it doesn't affect the content and is still very readable. This book is full of numbers, percentages on what the vaccinations are up to and what's really happening behind the curtain of the media versus the implications involved for people who resist taking the jab. It's not perfect and a little dry but we'll worth the investment in being unplugged and fully aware. "}
