Keep up-to-date to stay fully protected. Initial vaccination series For most people, their initial vaccination series is 2 doses. These are offered approximately 56 days apart. If you are [immunocompromised](#immunocompromised), you may need a third or fourth dose to complete your initial series. You will get an invitation for your third dose approximately 4 weeks after your second dose.

Under the [Infants Act](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/infants-act-mature-minor-consent-and-immunization), youth can give consent as a mature minor to receive health care, like getting a vaccine. Children 5 to 11 The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines for children use a smaller dosage of the same vaccine used for youth and adults. Children need a smaller dose of the vaccine to get the same protection from COVID-19.

COVID-19 vaccines are an important part of your young child's routine vaccine schedule. [Book your child's vaccine appointment now.](/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/children) People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems will generally have lower antibody responses from two COVID-19 vaccine doses. Studies show that giving a third dose to complete the initial vaccine series can help these individuals create antibodies to protect them from COVID-19. People who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and meet the criteria need a third dose of vaccine to complete their initial series.
