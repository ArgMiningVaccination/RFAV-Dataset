Triggers include: When we are stressed the brain sends a signal to the adrenal glands to release stress hormones, first adrenaline and then if the stress continues, cortisol. No matter what the stress is, our bodies go through the same response. This response, often called \"fight or flight,\" was essential to our survival during primitive times. However, in modern times the constant activation of the stress pathway can create a major disruption in the signals from the brain and an imbalance is created with the stress hormones. Chronic stress damages the brain and its neuronal connections. This leads to anxiety disorder and a whole host of problems throughout the body, contributing to cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and gastrointestinal problems. Anxiety is a normal part of the stress response, part of our alert system when situations threaten our security. But when the system malfunctions and the anxiety occurs inappropriately in response to normal, everyday things, it can result in a debilitating condition called anxiety disorder. People with anxiety disorder have a malfunctioning stress response and are constantly primed in anticipation of a threat to their well-being.
