I'm your host, Jackie Moranty. In the last 50 years we've lost more than 4,000 species that are vital to their habitats. These animals played an important role in the support of their ecosystems. Some were predators and some were prey, but they all had one natural enemy: Man. As humans grew in numbers, these animals were overhunted, exposed to pesticides, and driven into smaller and smaller habitats. The land was needed for the King of the Beasts. It's 90 seconds to midnight, and our wildlife suffers under the heavy burden of human encroachment. From logging to drilling for oil, overdevelopment of wild lands to water diversion, animals are disappearing, never to be seen again.

I'm your host, Jackie Moranty. I changed my mind mid-script. I decided that I needed to finish this season with a 100 Seconds to Midnight Episode on extinction. I thought that would be more appropriate, so this week, I'm going to talk about the last disease in this season. We're going to look at Whirling Disease in Fish. Let's begin with etiology and pathology. This will be a new pathogen for us. Myxobolus cerebralis is a myxozoan parasite. Whirling disease is caused by the actinosporean spores of the parasite Myxobolus cerebralis. This parasite has a complex two-host lifecycle. The parasite alternates between the sludge worm, Tubifex tubifex and the salmonid host. I've hit 15,000 downloads! That's a big deal. I never thought this podcast would attract as many listeners as it does and I want to thank everyone for coming back and passing the word.

Before we get started, I want to welcome my latest Patron to the family. Welcome Elizabeth! I'm so happy to have you here! I thought that since we talked about White Nose Disease in bats last time, we could just hop on over to Frog Fungal Disease this time. There is nothing like going to the river in spring. The frogs are sending their mating calls back and forth. The males are trying to sing their best songs to attract females, and they're measuring up the other males to see if they really want to battle for the female they've chosen. Frogs are both a keystone species and an indicator species in their environments. Keystone species are vital to their environments. If we lose a keystone species, the entire ecosystem will fail. Frogs provide food for several species including birds, fish, monkeys and snakes. As tadpoles, they eat algae which helps regulate blooms and reduce the risk of algal contamination. As they metamorphose from tadpoles into frogs, they become more carnivorous, and this means that they eat a lot of bugs. They can eat up to 100 insects in a day. O.K., so not quite as impressive as the bat, but still, that's a lot of bugs. The larger the frog, the larger the prey. Some species can eat animals as big as snakes and birds. So, maybe you didn't want to hear that part, but it does show that frogs are an important part of the food chain as predator and prey. Frogs are also an indicator species. If you listen to the Greed and Avarice episode on chemical spills and the environment, I talked a bit about researchers walking the stream where the train derailment occurred in Ohio. They were looking for dead fish and frogs. You can reach me on the website at http://www.causeofdeath100secs.net or you can email me at mailto:Jackie@causeofdeath100secs.net.

I'm your host, Jackie Moranty. In the last episode, I briefly mentioned White Nose Syndrome. It's a terrible disease that has killed off about 90% of some species of bats in North America. If you haven't listened to the last episode, I suggest that you go back and give that one a listen before we start this one. It gives a pretty good overview of the importance of bats to several ecosystems and to people. If you have listened to that episode, then you already know how invaluable this order is. Without them, we wouldn't have several species of plants, nor would we have many vaccines, we may not have echolocation technology. Bats have given us so much. Now, we need to think about what we can do for them. Let's begin with the etiology and pathology of White Nose Syndrome. White Nose Syndrome is caused by a pathogenic fungus called Pseudogymnoascus destructans that was formerly known as Geomyces destructans. After close study, the fungus was reclassified because it more closely resembles other fungi from the Pseudeurotiaceae family. P. destructans is a psychrophilic, or cold-loving, fungus that forms asymmetrically curved conidia.

I often use mg powers of anxiety to dream up ways I could die, but Jackie has me beat! This show is so great if you're an over-thinker because it breaks down possible ways people can die from zombie apocalypse to the measles, but also how to protect yourself. The best part, Jackie is actually a scientist, so its well researched and accurate! 10/10 recommended Jackie does an amazing job at being educational but at the same time is remains entertaining. I honestly learn so much while listening to this podcast that I share with everyone after listening. One of the best podcast out there right now!
