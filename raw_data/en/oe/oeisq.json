ABOUT THE COVID-19 TESTS: PCR and Antigen tests both detect the virus in different ways. PCR tests are more accurate because they can detect small amounts of the virus. They require a lab's analysis and results are usually returned to campus after about 24 hours. The Antigen tests provide results in about 15 minutes, but they are not as accurate as PCR tests. Antigen tests are especially useful for people who are COVID-19 positive and need to determine if they are no longer contagious.

[Path to Recovery - May 18, 2022: Budget Changes in May Revision and Vaccination Mandate Lifted Beginning Summer Intersession](#d14e905) Budget Changes in May Revision Each May, the [California Governor's proposed budget](https://www.ebudget.ca.gov)is updated based on the latest economic forecasts. With state revenues remarkably higher than projected, the May Revision provides about $2 billion more to the California Community Colleges compared to the January proposal. It adds nearly $500 million in new ongoing funding and $1.8 billion for additional one-time programs and initiatives. The proposed budget for 2022-2023 supports California Community College system priorities, such as increased per-student funding, part-time faculty health, technology modernization, and an investment in strategies to increase student retention and enrollment rates. President Scroggins will be providing a full analysis of the May Revision Impact on Mt. SAC in his Cabinet Notes. Vaccination Mandate Lifted Beginning Summer Intersession Due to declining COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations in the region, the state of California and county of Los Angeles have eased COVID-19 prevention strategies. After considering the latest data and balancing risks and responsibilities at its April meeting, the Mt. San Antonio College Board of Trustees has decided not to renew the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for students taking classes on campus.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the county has reached a key benchmark, moving from high community transmission risk to low community transmission risk, triggering the change. While the masking mandate has been lifted at the county level, masking is still strongly recommended. In determining Mt. SAC's masking requirements, the college will continue to follow public health guidance, Cal/OSHA workplace safety guidelines as well as agreements with employee bargaining units. Beginning Friday, March 4, 2022, the Mt. SAC masking requirement will be as follows: While on campus, regardless of vaccination status, Face Coverings are: - Required indoors for Faculty and Students (following a Faculty Association side letter in place through Spring Semester unless another agreement is reached) - Recommended indoors for all other groups Questions related to masking requirements should be sent to [hraccommodations@mtsac.edu](mailto:hraccommodations@mtsac.edu?subject=).

In Los Angeles County, public health officials reported that residents who were fully vaccinated and had a booster were about 31 times less likely to need care in an ICU than those who were not vaccinated. Fully vaccinated individuals who did not have a booster dose were about 8 times less likely to be admitted to an ICU than unvaccinated individuals. THE TRUTH ABOUT VACCINES Each clinic will provide COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer, Moderna and/or Janssen (a Johnson & Johnson company). Pfizer's vaccine has FDA approval for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 and older. The other two companies received FDA emergency-use authorization for their adult COVID-19 vaccines, alongside Pfizer's vaccines for youths 5-11 and 12-15 years of age. The vaccines are safe and effective in protecting against COVID-19 in trials. Vaccinated individuals are less likely to become sick with COVID-19 and less likely to require hospitalization. The community is encouraged to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccines by - Visiting the CDC to [bust common myths about vaccines and understand the facts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html). - Reviewing this [video about vaccine safety by Student Health Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIADyZuOlho) - Visiting the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration COVID-19 vaccines website](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) AGE AND DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS Individuals should confirm which vaccine they want to receive and confirm if they require a second dose: - Pfizer is for people 5 and older. It requires a second dose 3 weeks later. A booster dose can be taken 5 months after the second dose. - Moderna is for people 18 and older. It requires a second dose 4 weeks later. A booster dose can be taken 5 months after the second dose. - Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) is for people 18 and older. It requires one dose. A booster dose can be taken 2 months after this shot. NO COST REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS All people living in the United States are able to get the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge, regardless of their immigration status and health insurance status. Recipients of the vaccine just need to show proof of their age with any official document that includes their name and date of birth. Examples include California ID cards, school records, medical documents (including immunization records), and passports (foreign country and expired are OK). Details are available through Los Angeles County Public Health's [How to Get Vaccinated website](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/hcwsignup/).

[A Message from the President - Return to Campus for Winter 2022 - January 3, 2022](#d14e1719) Return to Campus for Winter 2022 Dear Mounties, Welcome to 2022 and the Winter Intersession at Mt. San Antonio College. This New Year, we face many of the same challenges, but with a renewed hope that we can learn to live, study, work and thrive despite the pandemic. Given the rise in COVID-19 cases in our county and across the nation, we are grateful the College spent much of the Fall implementing vaccination and testing procedures. These measures help us defend our community against COVID-19. While the number of cases are increasing, the data does not show any appreciable increase in serious illness due to Omicron. Mt. SAC will reopen as scheduled on Monday, January 3, 2022. Our classes and services play a critical role in our community, particularly in serving minoritized populations. We provide the necessary education and training (both online and in-person) for students to become first responders, essential workers, breadwinners and future leaders, particularly important in this period of economic recovery. We provide the support for students to succeed in their education, overcome physical and mental health challenges, address food insecurity, and so much more. While it is tempting to retreat in the face of the continuing COVID-19 challenge, it is imperative that we allow science data and health officials to guide our response. We can and should continue to move onward, together. We will continue to follow state and county orders while monitoring the impact on our campus closely. As we are getting to know the Omicron variant, we are learning new ways to safeguard against it. I urge you to read these safety guidelines carefully and follow the procedures. We all share a responsibility to remain vigilant and do our part to minimize the impact of the virus. We appreciate your cooperation in order to provide a safe environment for students and employees, as well as to keep classes and services open through the pandemic. Students with additional questions can contact us at [vaxortest@mtsac.edu](mailto:vaxortest@mtsac.edu)or (909) 274-5122. I realize that we all feel the stress and frustration with the pandemic now entering its third year. I would urge all of us to reflect on our own needs and challenges as we continue to meet the mission of the College. An important part of that reflection is addressing anxiety and tension that may reach critical points in our lives. To assist with your needs for help that we all recognize, the College now has available mental health services for both students and employees. Students should reach out to Student Health Services at (909) 274-4400 for support. Employees should reach out to the Employee Counseling Center at (909) 274-6211 or [employeecounselingcenter@mtsac.edu](mailto:employeecounselingcenter@mtsac.edu)for support.

Pfizer's vaccine has FDA approval for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 and older. The other two companies received FDA emergency-use authorization for their COVID-19 vaccines, alongside Pfizer's vaccine for youth 12-15 years of age. The vaccines are safe and effective in protecting against COVID-19 in trials. In the rare case a vaccinated individual becomes sick with COVID-19, they are less likely to require hospitalization. The community is encouraged to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccines by - Visiting the CDC to [bust common myths about vaccines and understand the facts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html). - Reviewing this [video about vaccine safety by Student Health Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIADyZuOlho) - Visiting the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration COVID-19 vaccines website](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) AGE AND DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS Individuals should confirm which vaccine they want to receive and confirm if they require a second dose: \u00b7 Pfizer is for people 12 and older. It requires a second dose 3 weeks later. \u00b7 Moderna is for people 18 and older. It requires a second dose 4 weeks later. \u00b7 Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) is for people 18 and older. It requires one dose. NO COST REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS All people living in the United States are able to get the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge, regardless of their immigration status and health insurance status. Recipients of the vaccine just need to show proof of their age with any official document that includes their name and date of birth. Examples include California ID cards, school records, medical documents (including immunization records), and passports (foreign country and expired are OK). Details are available through Los Angeles County Public Health's [How to Get Vaccinated website](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/hcwsignup/).

As noted last week, we are providing more details about the college's plans to keep our community safer as we expand classes and services on campus. In short, the college will require that all students and employees ON CAMPUS be fully vaccinated OR test negative for COVID-19 each week. The college is working as quickly as it can to release details about the roll out of the program. Information on the process for students is attached. Below is the process for: - Fully Vaccinated Employees with Confirmed Verification - All Other Employees Employee Vaccination/Testing Plan Fully Vaccinated Employees with Confirmed Verification Employees who have been fully vaccinated may submit evidence of their COVID-19 vaccination through the Employee Vaccine Verification Form on the COVID-19 health website at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](http://www.mtsac.edu/covid19). Individuals who have already submitted their vaccination evidence, do not need to do it again.

San Antonio College [President's Letter - August 16, 2021: New Mt. SAC Vaccine and Testing Requirements for Fall 2021](#d14e4300) Dear Mt. SAC Community, The COVID-19 pandemic is swiftly evolving. We are seeing COVID-19 transmission increase across the country, particularly in populations with lower vaccination rates. After hearing from many people and groups across campus, it is clear that we must strengthen our approach to the virus to keep our community safer. The reasons are plentiful and significant, particularly the widespread surge of the highly contagious delta variant and the significant percentage of those still unvaccinated. With that in mind, the Mt. San Antonio College Board of Trustees unanimously approved a resolution Friday night, authorizing the college to develop and implement a COVID-19 vaccine and testing program for the Fall 2021 semester. In summary, Mt. SAC will require all students and employees on campus to be vaccinated OR test negative for COVID-19 each week. I wanted to alert you as soon as possible that we are quickly and aggressively implementing a number of key measures to protect our campus community that will directly impact you: - STUDENT VACCINATION/TESTING REQUIREMENT SAC is developing a new requirement for students studying on the physical campus to either (1) show proof of vaccination or (2) test negative for COVID-19 weekly. The college is working through the details of this requirement. We will announce the dates that vaccination submission and weekly testing will begin and provide details as soon as possible. At this time, students should decide whether they will continue their enrollment in person or drop those classes and enroll in online classes by the end of their class add/drop period. Students can visit the Mt. SAC Portal, under the Student Tab (#11 Print your Schedule/Receipt), to view deadlines to drop. For most 16-week semester classes, the deadline is Friday, September 3, 2021. Fully online students will not be required to show proof of vaccination nor take weekly COVID-19 tests. However, without proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test, on-campus assistance for online students will be limited to select services with a quick transaction, such as to pick up a laptop or briefly visit the bookstore and food pantry. - EMPLOYEE VACCINATION/TESTING REQUIREMENT SAC will require employees who work on campus to either (1) show proof of vaccination or (2) test negative for COVID-19 weekly. Employees can submit proof of vaccination through the HR Verification Form accessible from the Mt. SAC COVID-19 Health website at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](http://www.mtsac.edu/covid19). Details on weekly tests will be provided as soon as possible. Employees who are only working remotely, do not have to show proof of vaccination nor take weekly COVID-19 tests. However, without proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test, they are limited to quickly visiting their offices or conducting brief transactions on campus. - CAMPUS MASKING REQUIREMENT SAC is committed to requiring masks indoors through December 31, 2021. Public health orders may strengthen requirements. Even if the masking order is removed by the county, the college will continue to require masking indoors. This requirement applies to all indoor spaces with limited exceptions. Accommodations must be formally vetted through the ACCESS Center for students and Human Resources for employees. These new steps are consistent with the advice of public health experts. The positive test rate for unvaccinated individuals is 243 per 100,000 people, while the rate for fully vaccinated individuals is 66 per 100,000 people. Being fully vaccinated also means that you will be less likely to get severely ill or die. Vaccinated people are about 14 times less likely to be hospitalized, with a hospitalization rate of less than 1 per 100,000 people. More than 168 million people in the United States have already been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. These vaccines are safe and effective. Their benefits far outweigh the devastating risks of COVID-19. You can get a vaccine free of charge at doctor's offices, pharmacies and clinics, regardless of health insurance and immigration status. The college has already hosted regular vaccination clinics and developed a testing program. An expansion of those services will be announced soon. Hundreds of colleges, universities, and businesses have announced similar vaccination and testing requirements. Implementing these steps here will help our college reduce risk as we expand in-person classes and services through the pandemic. We understand these are significant changes and you likely have more questions. Our Board of Trustees did not make these decisions lightly, staying fully focused on the safety of our community in order to provide the education and training that is critical for our students. We are working as quickly as possible to formulate these plans and announce them to the campus. You can expect a timeline for these requirements by Monday, August 23, 2021, via email as well as our COVID-19 Health website at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](http://www.mtsac.edu/covid19). We are excited to welcome you to Mt. SAC for the Fall 2021 semester, whether you are participating in-person, online, or both! Sincerely, Dr. William T. Scroggins President/CEO Mt. San Antonio College - STUDENT VACCINATION/TESTING REQUIREMENT - April to End of Summer Term - [Path to Recovery - August 5, 2021: Custodial Team Prepares for Fall Classes, Delta Variant Necessitates Indoor Masking, Precautions, and Weekly Vaccine Clinics](#d14e4431) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. CUSTODIAL TEAM PREPARES FOR FALL CLASSES Mt. SAC reopened on July 1 in preparation for expanded in-person classes this Fall. Among the departments readying the campus is the Custodial Team, which has been in high demand due to the pandemic. The team has shifted to prioritize day time shifts, cleaning high use areas more frequently. Previously, only 3 custodial team members worked during the day shift. This has increased 5-fold to 15 daytime custodians. They have compiled lists of high traffic areas and are developing strategies to increase the cleaning of these areas, keeping in mind classroom schedules. The team has been tasked with increased cleaning on campus as well as deep cleaning buildings before they are occupied. The cleaning was prioritized by the Return to Campus Task Force, which worked with divisions across campus to compile lists of buildings and their occupation dates to prepare for the Fall. More than half of the buildings have already been deep cleaned and prepared for occupation. The rest of the occupied buildings are scheduled to be completed by August 20.. DELTA VARIANT NECESSITATES INDOOR MASKING, PRECAUTIONS Called COVID-19 on steroids, the Delta variant has fueled significant COVID-19 transmission rates, according to Los Angeles County Public Health officials. On June 30, the county's daily report shared there were 422 new confirmed cases with a daily test positivity rate of 1.2%. By July 31, there were 3,318 new confirmed cases with a daily test positivity rate of 6.1%. Hospitalizations also increased. On June 30, 255 people with COVID-19 were hospitalized with 25% in the Intensive Care Unit. By July 31, 1,008 people with COVID-19 were hospitalized with 23% in the Intensive Care Unit. Unvaccinated individuals are bearing the brunt of the spread and almost all of the hospitalizations. County officials highlighted the value of vaccinations, which prevents or greatly reduces the severity of the illness. In June, 80% of all new cases were among those not vaccinated. Between May 1 and July 17 of this year, Los Angeles County had 3,167 hospitalized COVID-19 cases. Of those, 92% (2,914) were among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, and 8% (253), were among those fully vaccinated. Officials noted that vaccinated individuals are seeing a rise in COVID-19 positive tests, however, symptoms are notably less severe for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report with Massachusetts Public Health ( [Brown, et al, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w#contribAff)), which investigated an outbreak in Barnstable County after multiple large events. In that case study, 346 individuals (74%) who tested positive with COVID-19 were fully vaccinated. The study cites that testing was done with the PCR Cycle Threshold test. This nasal swab test is sensitive to very small amounts of nasal COVID-19 virus which accounts for the large number of vaccinated individuals who tested positive even though they had slight exposure. [As reported by COVID-19 Real-Time Learning Network](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/diagnostics/RT-pcr-testing/), supported by CDC and IDSA, the PCR test \"does not differentiate between viable and nonviable virus. Thus, a positive test does not necessarily indicate that a person is infectious and requires isolation.\" Four days after this report was published, the CDC changed course on guidance for wearing masks, calling for increased use in areas with high infection rates, including by vaccinated individuals. A Singapore study ( [Chia, et al, 2021](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295v1)) funded by the Singapore National Medical Research Council that posted on medRxiv before peer review, also using the sensitive PCR test, suggests that the viral loads are similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with the Delta variant. However, the vaccinated group experienced a faster decrease in viral load. This finding supports the most frequent result that vaccine-generated antibodies reduce the severity of symptoms in exposed vaccinated cases. Due to the increased transmission of the Delta variant, masking indoors, when an effective mask is worn properly by a contagious person, is a helpful way to reduce the transmission of the virus and protect the broader community. For that reason, masking indoors is mandated by the county, with few exceptions, such as when wearing a mask is dangerous for work, medical exceptions, and if an individual is working alone in a private cubicle or office. This mandate applies to all on campus at Mt. SAC, students, faculty, staff, and the public. WEEKLY VACCINE CLINICS Mt. San Antonio College is partnering with East Valley Community Health Center to provide a series of on-campus COVID-19 vaccination clinics through the Summer intersession. The free clinics will be available for anyone 12 years or older, including Mt. SAC employees, students, and community members. Vaccines will be provided by appointment through the [My Turn website](https://myturn.ca.gov), though limited walk-ins will be accommodated.

No Cost Regardless of Immigration Status All people living in the United States are able to get the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge, regardless of their immigration status and health insurance status. Recipients of the vaccine just need to show proof of their age with any official document that includes their name and date of birth. Examples include California ID cards, school records, medical documents (including immunization records), and passports (foreign country and expired are OK). Details are available through Los Angeles County Public Health's [How to Get Vaccinated website](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/hcwsignup/). How to Sign Up If you are interested in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine on campus, you must: - Be 12 years or older to receive a Pfizer vaccine, or be 18 or older to receive a Moderna vaccine - Be available to receive the vaccine at Mt.

[Path to Recovery - July 19, 2021: Mask Mandate, Summer Grading Options, Course Repeatability, and Fall Class Search](#d14e4549) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. MASK MANDATE INDOORS RE-INTRODUCED The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health issued a new Health Officer Order on Friday, July 16, 2021, with an effective date of July 17, 2021. This order mainly aligns with the State Public Health Officer Order of June 2021 and continues to place certain safety requirements on individuals consistent with County and State guidelines. In addition, this order now requires that all persons wear face masks while in indoor public settings and businesses, with limited exceptions, as a precautionary measure with the current level of community COVID-19 transmission. As a result, this Health Officer Order shall supersede the [Return to Work Guide (updated)](/covid19/pdf/MtSACreturntowork.pdf)related to face covering requirements until further notice. For additional information on the Health Officer Order, please see the [Health Officer Order](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/docs/HOO/HOO_SaferReturnWorkCommunity.pdf). Following the health order, Mt. SAC will again require masks for anyone indoors, regardless of vaccination status. This includes any classes, labs, and meetings held inside. There are few exceptions, such as a situation where a mask can impede workplace safety. One of the best ways to curb COVID-19 is to wear masks and get vaccinated. Public health officials reiterated vaccines are now widely available at most local pharmacies. They are safe, effective and free. EXCUSED WITHDRAWAL (EW) CONTINUES IN SUMMER This term, Summer 2021, Mt. SAC will continue to allow students to drop with an \"EW\"\u2014Excused Withdrawal. An \"EW\" does not count against the student's GPA, academic standing or ability to repeat the course. For students receiving Financial Aid in the summer, the Financial Aid Office encourages students to provide a written email ( [financialaid@mtsac.edu](mailto:financialaid@mtsac.edu?subject=)) explaining why the withdrawal was the result of the COVID-19 emergency to receive more flexible support. Examples of COVID-19 related reasons that students might need an EW include, but are not limited to: illness of the student or family member; need to become a caregiver or first responder; loss of childcare; economic hardship; inability to access Wi-Fi due to closed facilities; or an increase in work hours as a result of the COVID-19 emergency. Students can withdraw with an EW up until the day before the last day of class instruction. PASS/NO PASS GRADING OPTIONS EXTENDED The date to choose Pass/No Pass (P/NP) as a grading option for eligible classes has been extended to 5 p.m., Thursday, August 5 for regular 6-week classes. For other summer classes, students should check their portal for deadlines and additional information. Students can choose their grading option by signing into the Mt. SAC Portal, clicking on the Student tab, and then choosing \"Change Class Grading Option.\" Only eligible classes will allow students to change from \"Letter Grade\" to \"Pass/No Pass.\" In all eligible classes, including letter grade only, students who receive an F will have their grade automatically changed to NP, which will not affect their GPA. Choosing Pass/No Pass may have implications for students. Students transferring to the University of California should take caution in using this option and meet with a [counselor](/counseling/)or a [transfer specialist](/transfer/)in the Transfer Center. Students receiving Financial Aid should be aware the NP option affects their completion rate for Satisfactory Academic Progress, but doesn't impact their GPA. For Veterans, a NP may be a better option than the EW, because it shows that the student completed the course. All GI Bill\u00ae students should speak with a [Veterans Resource Center](/veterans/)counselor for advisement. Students may speak with a [counselor](/counseling/)to review their options. COURSE REPEATABILITY REMAINS FLEXIBLE Due to COVID-19, students who receive a D, F or NP will have their grades marked as DV, FV and NPV. The \"V\" stands for virus to note the unique conditions created during the pandemic. Students who receive those grades this summer, will be able to repeat the course without the unsuccessful attempt counting against the total number of maximum allowable repeats for the particular course. FALL CLASSES AVAILABLE FOR SEARCH Mt. SAC posted more than 3,600 classes for the Fall Semester. About three-fourths of classes will be held in person, with one-fourth also provided online. Registration began July 7. At this time, enrollment appears to have increased, with Full Time Equivalent students increasing about 10%. The college will follow public health guidelines to ensure all on-campus classes follow public health recommendations. Learn more at [www.mtsac.edu/schedule](http://www.mtsac.edu/schedule). [Path to Recovery - July 1, 2021: Mt. SAC Reopening and New Safety Guidelines](#d14e4628) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. MT. SAC REOPENING AND NEW SAFETY GUIDELINES Following the reopening of the state, Mt. SAC will also reopen its physical campus on July 1. The college has also adjusted its COVID-19 safety guidelines after careful review of the guidelines released by the [state of California](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx#June15guidance)as well as the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health ( [Cal/OSHA](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/)). Fall semester guidelines are still under development, and will be released before class registration begins. This Summer, the safety practices are: Face Coverings STUDENTS: Students and guests are required to wear masks inside buildings and during classroom activities that are held outside during the Summer term. Face coverings are available and have been stocked in classrooms and offices. Classrooms or offices that need more stock can request them through their Division Office. UNVACCINATED EMPLOYEES: Employees who are not vaccinated must also wear masks in buildings and vehicles during the Summer term. Exceptions for face coverings include when an unvaccinated person is alone in a room or a vehicle, eating, drinking, requiring an accommodation, or when the job duties make a face covering infeasible or unsafe. Unvaccinated employees may request N95 respirators from the Risk Management Office or use face coverings already provided to classrooms and offices. VACCINATED EMPLOYEES: Employees who are vaccinated are not required to wear masks during the Summer term. Vaccinated employees are encouraged to consider wearing a mask as needed, such as to set an example for students in a classroom. Health Check Previously, the campus community was asked to fill out an online health check before coming to campus. At this time, students and employees are asked to self-check for symptoms before coming to campus. If they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, they are asked to fill out the Health Check form. The forms are available at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](/_archived-sites/health/index.html). Vaccinations The vaccination against COVID-19 is no longer required for employees. However, Mt. SAC joins public health experts across the world in strongly encouraging them. Documentation is still required for a fully vaccinated employee to work without a face covering indoors. It is done through the Employee Return to Work Form available on the COVID-19 website at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](/_archived-sites/health/index.html). Anyone interested in getting a COVID-19 vaccine can learn more at the state's My Turn site at [https://myturn.ca.gov/](https://myturn.ca.gov/) [.](https://myturn.ca.gov/.) Social Distancing Social distancing is no longer required. Unvaccinated individuals are advised to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet when they remove their masks for eating and drinking. Contact Tracing and Outbreaks In the event you have been on campus and are now experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, please contact the college, which is tracking cases for the safety of the community. Students report to the Student Health Center at (909) 274-4400. Employees report to Human Resources at (909) 274-4414. Mt. SAC may implement additional protective measures than are required, including the use of physical distancing and barriers, especially in the case of an outbreak. [Path to Recovery - June 14, 2021: Campus Holds In-Person Commencement and New COVID-19 Guidelines Coming Soon](#d14e4707) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. CAMPUS HOLDS IN-PERSON COMMENCEMENT Mt. SAC celebrated the Class of 2021 with an in-person commencement ceremony on Friday evening. This class was the first to graduate in the newly built Hilmer Lodge Stadium and has the added distinction of being the college's 75th graduating class. Despite the pandemic, a record number of students\u20145,258\u2014petitioned to graduate, the largest number in the college's history. There were 2,065 petitions to transfer, which guarantees admission to the CSU system. This is 1,000 more than filed last year. About 1,000 graduates plan to participate in the ceremony. The youngest graduate was 17 and the oldest was 72. Due to Los Angeles County Department of Public Health protocols, students and guests were screened for COVID-19 symptoms at the Lot F tunnel before entering the stadium. All participants and guests were required to wear a face covering and maintain physical distancing of 6 feet in the parking lots and stadium. Graduates were able to remove their masks before walking the stage. The celebration was live-streamed for family and friends to watch from home on YouTube [www.youtube.com/mtsac](http://www.youtube.com/mtsac). View [photos of Commencement Highlights, in the online album](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPl80uYWY83NwdzuccPXMaGcEHZ8GEbgt5-rU5-7J8s1mv7_dqWRmF3Ua2QPSIWQQ?key=bU93Y2dRYWcwRndhcEFqNU9rT2FiOE5BekFKUnh3). NEW COVID-19 GUIDELINES COMING SOON The California governor has announced that the state plans to fully reopen its economy beginning on June 15. With vaccines readily available and COVID-19 rates dropping, the state will soon phase out the color-coded tier system. The state will then align its masking and social distancing guidelines with that of the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The [new guidance taking effect June 15](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx#June15guidance)can be viewed on the California Public Health web site. While this loosens masking requirements for vaccinated individuals at many places, Mt. SAC also needs to follow the workplace safety standards set by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA). Its regulations are currently being revised. Details have not been released, but they have suggested the rules will also relax masking, especially for those who are vaccinated. The proposed standards will be presented at a meeting June 17 and could go into effect by June 28. Once the new guidelines are released, Mt. SAC's Return to Campus Task Force will also adjust the college's guidelines and procedures for students and employees. Until then, the masking requirement will continue on campus. [Path to Recovery - May 20, 2021: Masking Continues in LA County, How to Get Fully Vaccinated, and On-Campus Vaccination Clinic](#d14e4758) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. MASKING CONTINUES FOR L.A. COUNTY While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased its masking guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals in most indoor settings, masking mandates have not changed for California and Los Angeles County. State and local agencies can have stricter guidelines than those established at the federal level. California Public Health and Los Angeles County Public Health clarified that the state and county will continue to require masks indoors. The state and county public health officials anticipate adopting the CDC guidance on June 15, when the state plans to reopen and drop its color-coded tier system. This is contingent on COVID-19 health indicators continuing to head in the right direction. At this time, [Los Angeles County](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/FullyVaccinatedMasks.pdf)is following [state guidance on mask wearing](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx). People must wear masks when in public settings and when interacting with people who are not in the same household. Fully vaccinated people can forego masks indoors if they are in a private place and they are with other fully vaccinated people. At the Mt. SAC campus, masks continue to be required in public areas and if individuals might be within 6 feet of others while on campus. HOW TO GET FULLY VACCINATED Fully vaccinated individuals have more protection against COVID-19 and have fewer requirements when it comes to masking. Individuals are fully vaccinated: - Two weeks after one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and - Two weeks after the second dose of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines require a second booster dose to strengthen the body's immunity to the virus. Vaccines are safe and effective. About half of all California residents (15.8 million) have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The FDA authorized these vaccines, which have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in the country's history. In trials, the vaccines have prevented people from getting COVID-19 up to 95 percent of the time. In the rare case that a vaccinated individual does get COVID-19, the vaccines keep them from becoming seriously ill. Learn more through the [state's vaccines website](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/). Vaccines are free. COVID-19 vaccines are available through local doctor's offices and pharmacies, as well as the [state's My website](https://myturn.ca.gov), [Kaiser Permanente pharmacies](https://www.walgreens.com). ON CAMPUS COVID-19 VACCINATIONS ON MAY 27 Mt. San Antonio College is partnering with East Valley Community Health Center to provide on-campus COVID-19 vaccination clinics. The next clinic will provide Moderna vaccines and will be open to anyone 18 and older. The clinic will be on Thursday, May 27, in the courtyard between Buildings 67A and 67B. Participants are encouraged to make an appointment online, but can also walk in between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. to get a free vaccine. Each clinic will provide 600 doses of the Moderna vaccine, which require two doses four weeks apart. Participants coming May 27 should come back June 24 for a second booster shot. The Moderna vaccine is 94% effective in protecting against COVID-19 in trials. In the rare case a vaccinated individual becomes sick with COVID-19, they are less likely to require hospitalization. More information is available through the [video about vaccine safety by Student Health Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIADyZuOlho)or the [California Public Health COVID-19 Vaccines website](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/). If you are interested in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine on campus, you must: - Be 18 years or older - Be available to receive the first dose at Mt. SAC on Thursday, May 27 and the second dose on Thursday, June 24 - Sign up for an appointment at [https://myturn.ca.gov](https://myturn.ca.gov)or walk in between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. [Path to Recovery - May 10, 2021: Town Hall Video and Supporting Mental Health](#d14e4855) The Mt.

[Path to Recovery - April 27, 2021: Preparing the Campus for a Return: Air Circulation, Plastic Shields and More](#d14e4926) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. PREPARING THE CAMPUS FOR A RETURN The proliferation of COVID-19 vaccines and the corresponding drop in COVID-19 cases has been welcome news across the world. Thanks to these improvements, Governor Newsom announced a plan to end the current tier system and reopen the state on June 15. With this in mind, Mt. SAC is planning for the transition back to the campus and the expansion of in-person classes and services this Fall. Managers and classified employees will return to campus by July 1. Faculty will return in time for Fall classes, 80 percent of which are anticipated to be in person. Details are available in the union contract agreements posted in the Human Resources website as well as last week's message on vaccinations. While Mt. SAC is working under projections for Fall that are less limited than the current situation, the college is committed to strictly following Los Angeles County Public Health orders. Should the pandemic take a turn, the college will pivot and adjust to meet public health orders. Current planning includes safety preparations of buildings, equipment and supplies such as: - Increased outside air intake and filtration - Preparing computers and technology - Preparation of safety features for student and customer service areas - Increased cleaning of buildings - Safety supplies and PPE INCREASED AIR CIRCULATION AND FILTERING Facilities Planning & Management team members are adjusting building ventilation systems across campus before departments return to campus. They have ensured each HVAC unit has a filter that provides the maximum level of filtration the unit supports. Additionally, in all occupied buildings, air flow is adjusted to maximize fresh outside air while still allowing the unit to perform its function. As an added measure the college is in the process of adding supplemental purification units in buildings where they would provide a reasonable enhancement. PREPARING COMPUTERS AND TECHNOLOGY The Information Technology team has already started evaluating and updating computers across campus in preparation for a broad return to campus. With some computers sitting dormant for more than a year, the team is sweeping through classrooms, labs and offices to ensure the computers are updated and ready to run. The team anticipates checking on nearly 7,000 computers before the campus reopens. PREPARING STUDENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AREAS A subgroup of the Return to Campus Task Force has gathered a list of campus programs, their projected return dates, and their need for plastic shield dividers at customer services areas. With this information, Facilities Planning & Management staff are preparing plastic shield dividers for these areas before their occupancy. INCREASED CLEANING Custodial staff have received special training on effective cleaning during the pandemic. Aside from increased cleaning, they are also planning to ensure buildings are checked and cleaned before they are occupied by returning staff. SAFETY SUPPLIES AND PPE The college has gathered safety supplies, such as masks, gloves, sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer. The Office of Risk Management is distributing those supplies across campus. Departments that need to replenish those supplies can reach out to their Division Offices.

SAC to Receive New Federal Stimulus Funding, and Vaccines Eligibility Expanded on April 1](#d14e5128) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. STUDENTS RECEIVING EMERGENCY GRANTS The Financial Aid Department is disbursing about $9.2 million in emergency grants to Mt. SAC students on Friday, April 9. Eligible students will be notified by Financial Aid when their grants are disbursed. Grants will be between $50 and $1200, depending on the student's financial need and unit load. An emergency grant process will also be developed for students with special needs. To receive their money as quickly as possible, students are encouraged to check that they have made a refund selection. This is something students do at least once during their time at the college. Students can learn how to make a refund selection on the [Cashier's Office Refunds web page](/cashier/refunds.html). The emergency grant funding is from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF), and was authorized through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) to help students continue learning through the pandemic. Previously, Mt. SAC also distributed emergency grants to students with funding from HEERF through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. MT. SAC TO RECEIVE NEW FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDING Mt. San Antonio College is set to receive about $60 million of federal stimulus funding through the American Rescue Plan Act, which has resulted in $39.6 billion to support higher education institutions and their students. Half of the stimulus funds will directly help Mt. SAC's students with emergency financial aid grants. The California Community Colleges continues to work with federal authorities to interpret the funding requirements. The other half of the stimulus funds will help the college offset expenses incurred as a result of responding to the pandemic. Similar to the CRRSAA (previous HEERF II funding), this funding can support the cost of lost enrollment, COVID-19 safety equipment, technology to support online learning, and more. It has two new requirements: Institutions must (1) use a portion of the allocation to implement evidence-based practices to monitor and suppress coronavirus in accordance with public health guidelines and (2) conduct direct outreach to financial aid applicants about the opportunity to receive financial aid adjustments due to the recent unemployment of a family member or the independent student, or other circumstances. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for students, employees and community,\" said Dr. Bill Scroggins, president and CEO of the college. \"These funds will be critical as we support our community through emergency aid to students, online learning opportunities, and the careful preparation for the return to safe, in-person classes. The ability for Mt. SAC to continue providing degrees and certificates will be essential as we emerge from the pandemic and this economic downturn.\" VACCINES ELIGIBILITY EXPANDED ON APRIL 1 Mt. SAC employees who are interested in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine are encouraged to make an appointment soon, before vaccine eligibility is expanded to other groups. Public health officials are expecting an influx of COVID-19 vaccine supply, and expanded eligibility to these vaccines for people 50 and over on April 1. Eligibility will also be extended to people 16 and older by April 15. Mt. SAC employees can register as education section employees through appointment scheduling websites. Appointments can be made through the My Turn website at [https://myturn.ca.gov](https://myturn.ca.gov).

LOS ANGELES COUNTY REACHES RED TIER For the first time, Los Angeles County has reached the less-restrictive red tier in the [system set by the state](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)for loosening and tightening restrictions based on the level of COVID-19 spread. The county joins San Bernardino and Orange counties. Ventura and Riverside counties remain in the strictest purple tier. A county can move from the state's most-restrictive purple tier to the less-restrictive red tier if the new daily case rate is under 10 per 100,000 population (instead of the previous 7 per 100,000) for at least two weeks. Under the [red tier in Los Angeles County](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3014), indoor restaurant dining, gyms, movie theaters, museums, and personal care services can reopen with limited capacity and safety procedures in place. K-12 schools also have the option to reopen if they can meet all the state and county directives. At this tier, Mt. SAC continues to provide limited in-person instruction for essential services programs and athletics conditioning. [President's Message - March 16, 2021: Reflecting on the One-Year COVID-19 Anniversary](#d14e5283) MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT Dear Mt. SAC family, This week marks one year since Mt. SAC closed its physical campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The College's last full day on campus was March 19, 2020, when the governor called a stay-at-home order for the state. One year later, vaccinations are occurring across the world, with President Biden expecting vaccines to be available to all adults by May 1. In this single year, we experienced unimaginable tests to our strength, patience, and mindset. We have felt the raw pain of loss, the uncertainty of navigating a new normal, and the cautious optimism of finding new knowledge, new processes, and new ways to teach and learn. And somehow, we have found a way to thrive. Our classes and services are fully online. Our students continue to graduate with degrees and certificates. And our indomitable Mt. SAC spirit continues to lift the College through challenges we never imagined a year ago. Thank you for everything you've done for this College and everything you have done to continue on despite the challenges. Mt. SAC will recognize this anniversary through an online COVID-19 reflection site and a moment of silence. We invite you to submit your reflection on the past year at [www.mtsac.edu/united](http://www.mtsac.edu/united). The reflections will be posted online at 8 a.m., Friday, March 19. Then, at noon, the campus is invited to take part in a moment of silence. If your schedule permits, we encourage you to visit the reflection site and think about this historic year, which has significantly impacted us personally and globally. Our collective resolve in responding to COVID-19 reflects the very best of Mt. SAC. I want to thank our faculty, staff, and administrators for their resolve, creativity, and unwavering commitment to our academic mission. And I want to thank our students for their persistence and flexibility as they continued to find a way to learn and grow despite the difficult conditions created by the pandemic. With vaccinations becoming more prevalent, we can see the end in sight. We are planning for a return to campus this Fall Semester, with broad classes available in-person as well as online. As we work hard to bring back life as we knew it, it's important to take a moment and reflect on how far we have come. I look forward to reflecting as a community on Friday. Even though we will not be gathered on campus in person, we will continue to be together in spirit. Bill Scroggins President and CEO, Mt. San Antonio College [Path to Recovery - March 10, 2021: More In-Person Classes, Fewer Students This Spring and New Guidelines for Vaccinated Individuals](#d14e5324) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. MORE IN-PERSON CLASSES, FEWER STUDENTS THIS SPRING This Spring Semester, Mt. SAC has seen a significant decrease in students. At this time, headcount has decreased by about 7% compared to last year. Students are taking fewer classes, with Full Time Equivalent students at 20% less than the previous year. While the great majority of classes are being held online, the college has increased the number of first responder and essential worker programs that are holding limited classes on campus. There are now more than 220 classes held on campus. New additions include programs for culinary arts, medical assistant, personal care aide, and certified nursing assistant. In addition, athletics teams are conditioning on campus, following new protocol established by public health. These in-person classes and labs were permitted by public health officials, prioritized by the Instruction Office, approved by the President's Cabinet and vetted by the Return to Campus Task Force. NEW GUIDELINES FOR VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released highly anticipated [guidance for fully vaccinated individuals](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html). This interim guidance is a first step as researchers learn more about the effects of the COVID-19 vaccines on individuals, including their ability to get and spread the virus. Officials shared that more activities would be approved for vaccinated individuals once caseloads and deaths decline. Authorities also noted individuals are fully vaccinated two weeks after their last dose of a vaccine. Fully vaccinated people can: - Visit other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing a mask and without physical distancing - Visit unvaccinated individuals from one other household if they are low-risk without wearing a mask and without physical distancing - Refrain from quarantine and testing after a COVID-19 exposure if they do not have symptoms of COVID-19 Fully vaccinated people should still: - Wear a mask and physically distance in public - Take precautions when visiting unvaccinated people who have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 - Avoid medium and large sized gatherings [Path to Recovery - March 3, 2021: Education Employees Now Eligible for Vaccines, Make a Vaccination Appointment Online, and Learn About the COVID-19 Vaccines](#d14e5382) The Mt.

EDUCATION EMPLOYEES NOW ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINES Mt. SAC employees are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, after education and childcare sectors were added to eligibility lists of local public health agencies (Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, Ventura County, City of Pasadena, City of Long Beach). While all staff in the education and childcare sector are now eligible for vaccines, the availability of vaccines may limit what is actually offered on the appointment scheduling website. Employees are encouraged to be patient and persistent when making appointments. Public Health officials say everyone in California will eventually have an opportunity to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Widespread availability of the vaccines are expected by the end of Spring 2021. A small number of Mt. SAC employees also qualify under [different sectors](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineAllocationGuidelines.aspx)(such as health care, food and agriculture, and emergency services), which may provide them more options to sign up for vaccines. MAKE A VACCINATION APPOINTMENT ONLINE Centralized My Turn Website The state has launched a centralized website called [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov)( [myturn.ca.gov](https://myturn.ca.gov)) that checks for an individual's eligibility and allows eligible individuals to make an appointment, if slots are available. Appointments are made available at varying times, so eligible individuals are encouraged to check the My Turn website at different times each day, including the morning, afternoon and evening. These vaccination locations include public health, Kaiser and FEMA locations, such as Cal Poly Pomona, Pomona Fairplex, Cal State Los Angeles, and Disneyland. - Visit [My Turn website](https://myturn.ca.gov)( [myturn.ca.gov](https://myturn.ca.gov)) - Answer the questions - When choosing business/industry, all Mt.

SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. STUDENT WITHDRAWAL FROM CLASSES Similar to the previous semesters, Mt. SAC is extending the deadline for students to withdraw from classes. The deadlines for spring 2021 are as follows: - 16-week classes: The deadline for students to choose an EW is Sunday, June 6, at 11:59 p.m. - 8-week or other short-term spring classes: The deadline for students to choose an EW is one day before the last day of that specific CRN's (Course Record Number) part of term end date. The part of term end date is the date the short-term class ends. Going forward, students who drop will receive an Excused Withdrawal (EW) mark rather than a Withdrawal (W). Students who drop their classes before the deadline will automatically receive refunds, unless they received a fee waiver. An EW mark will not count toward the limits on how many times students can repeat a class. In addition, it will not impact progress status. However, an EW may have implications for students receiving federal benefits (including veteran's benefits) and students planning to transfer to a university. Therefore, students are encouraged to [speak with a counselor online](/counseling/)about their options before withdrawing from classes. PASS/NO PASS GRADING OPTIONS EXTENDED The date to choose Pass/No Pass (P/NP) as a grading option for eligible classes has been extended to 5 p.m., Thursday, June 17 for regular 16-week classes. For other short-term spring classes, students should check their portal for deadlines and [additional information](/instruction/winter_2021_tutorials/Pass_and_No_Pass_2021.pdf). Students can choose their grading option by signing into the Mt. SAC Portal, clicking on the Student tab, and then choosing \"Change Class Grading Option.\" Only eligible classes will allow students to change from \"Letter Grade\" to \"Pass/No Pass.\" In all eligible classes, including letter grade only, students who receive an F will have their grade automatically changed to NP, which will not affect their GPA. Choosing Pass/No Pass may have implications for students. Students transferring to the University of California should take caution in using this option and meet with a counselor or a transfer specialist in the [Transfer Center](/transfer/). Students receiving Financial Aid should be aware the NP option affects their completion rate for Satisfactory Academic Progress, but doesn't impact their GPA. For Veterans, a NP may be a better option than the EW, because it shows that the student completed the course. All GI Bill\u00ae students should speak with a [Veterans Resource Center](/veterans/)counselor for advisement. Students may [speak with a counselor online](/counseling/)to review their options. COURSE REPEATABILITY Due to COVID-19, students who receive a D, F or NP will have their grades marked as DV, FV and NPV. The \"V\" stands for virus to note the unique conditions created during the pandemic. Students who receive those grades this fall, will be able to repeat the course without the unsuccessful attempt counting against the total number of maximum allowable repeats for the particular course. [Path to Recovery - February 12, 2021: Mt. SAC Vaccination Plans Change, State Vaccine Clearinghouse Simplifies Search for Vaccines, and Learn About the COVID-19 Vaccines](#d14e5603) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. MT. SAC VACCINATION PLANS CHANGES DUE TO STATE STRATEGY SHIFT Due to the uneven rollout of California's COVID-19 vaccination efforts, the state has partnered with Blue Shield of California to oversee the COVID-19 vaccine distribution to counties, pharmacies, private health care providers. Mt. San Antonio College was planning for campus vaccine distributions. Due to the state's shifting vaccine distribution strategy, the college's original plans for campus clinics must change. The college is now exploring the feasibility of becoming a Medical Point of Distribution, which could host vaccination clinics that would serve Mt. SAC employees as well as local K-12 partners. The situation is evolving and additional details are unknown. Mt. SAC employees are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated through the state or local programs outlined below. STATE VACCINE CLEARINGHOUSE SIMPLIFIES SEARCH FOR VACCINES Previously, the Path to Recovery email highlighted each county's varying processes and requirements related to getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Since then, the state has launched a centralized website called [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov)( [myturn.ca.gov](https://myturn.ca.gov)) that checks for an individual's eligibility and allows eligible individuals to make an appointment, if slots are available. Individuals who are not yet eligible, can register to receive updates. Public Health officials say everyone in California will eventually have an opportunity to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Because the vaccine supply cannot keep pace with demand at this time, higher risk individuals have been prioritized to receive the vaccine, including health care workers and people 65 years and older. Providing the second doses of the vaccine has also been prioritized over providing more first doses. While the [state vaccination plan](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/)now says all staff in the education and childcare sector are eligible for vaccines, the availability of vaccines may limit what is actually offered on the appointment scheduling website. Appointments are made available at varying times, so eligible individuals are encouraged to check the [My Turn website](https://myturn.ca.gov)at different times each day, including the morning, afternoon and evening. Nearby vaccination locations include Cal Poly Pomona, Pomona Fairplex, Cal State Los Angeles, and Disneyland. LEARN ABOUT THE COVID-19 VACCINES Employees are encouraged to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccines by visiting the [California Public Health COVID-19 Vaccines website](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/). The vaccines require two doses and are 94-95% effective in keeping a person from becoming ill with COVID-19 and spreading it to others. After receiving the vaccine, some people may have a sore arm, aches, fatigue or fever, but public health officials emphasize these are not harmful. Vaccinated individuals can still spread COVID-19, so please note, vaccinated individuals still need to wear masks, social distance, and practice healthy habits.

COUNTY RETURNS TO PURPLE TIER After the California Governor lifted the November stay-at-home order, local counties have adjusted to allow the opening of more venues. Each county provides different guidance. The three counties around Mt. SAC remain in the purple tier (Tier 1) of the state's color-coded, four-tier reopening plan. This means the virus is widespread in the county and continued vigilance is essential to stop the spread. Los Angeles County For Los Angeles County, outdoor dining resumed Jan. 29. In addition, indoor shopping malls and personal care services can reopen with capacity limited at 25% indoors. Private gatherings are again allowed outdoors, limited to 3 households with a maximum of 15 people. Details are available through [L.A.

CALIFORNIANS 65 AND OLDER ARE ELIGIBLE TO GET VACCINATED. NOW WHAT? While the COVID-19 vaccine supply is still extremely limited, Californians who are 65 and older are eligible to get vaccinated. While state guidelines make them eligible, each public health agency handles vaccinations differently. Most public health agencies recommended individuals see if their workplace and health care provider could provide the vaccine before signing up for a vaccination appointment. As noted in last week's message, Mt. SAC has a task force working to gain approval from the county to provide vaccination clinics. Below is a summary of how local public health agencies are providing vaccines at this time. Please note that demand is greater than supplies in all cases.

VACCINES GIVE HOPE FOR FALL 2021 RETURN TO CAMPUS Due to the increase of COVID-19 vaccines as well as advancements in understanding of the virus, Mt. San Antonio College officials are planning for a return to the physical campus in time for the Fall 2021 semester. Since March, Mt. SAC has been primarily providing classes and services online due to the pandemic. Spring classes will continue to be held primarily online, giving time for the vaccines to become more widely available and the Return to Campus Task Force to plan for a safe return in consultation with public health guidance. A small number of programs are already holding limited labs on campus for first responder and essential worker programs that strictly follow public health guidelines. These in-person classes were allowed by public health officials, prioritized by the Instruction Office, approved by the President's Cabinet and vetted by the Return to Campus Task Force. \"The vaccines are a critical key to a safe return to the physical campus,\" said Dr. Bill Scroggins, president and CEO of Mt. SAC. \"While a complete return to campus life as we knew it before will take some time, these advances give us much needed hope for a more normal collegiate experience for our students this Fall.\" While details for a Fall 2021 return to campus will not be available until later, Mt. SAC officials said they wanted students, future students, and employees to be able to plan accordingly. TASK FORCE DEVELOPING CAMPUS VACCINATION CLINICS Through close collaboration with public health officials, Mt. SAC is evaluating the possibility of providing vaccinations to college. A Mt. SAC Return to Campus subgroup is planning for future vaccination clinics on campus. The team will follow [Los Angeles County Public Health COVID-19 vaccination guidelines](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/allocation/). Details will be provided as soon as possible. Vaccines are rolling out in tiers in Los Angeles County, with the first batch of vaccines being available to long-term care facility residents and medical workers, including Mt. SAC's medical workers. Education employees, which includes employees at Mt. SAC, are a part of Phase 1B Tier One. While some California counties are already vaccinating education employees, Los Angeles County public health officials anticipate the timeline to be closer to early February. Officials are estimating the general population will have vaccines available sometime this Spring. Employees are encouraged to learn more about the vaccines by visiting the [California Public Health COVID-19 Vaccines web site](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/). The vaccines require two doses and are 94-95% effective in keeping a person from becoming ill with COVID-19 and spreading it to others. After receiving the vaccine, some people may have a sore arm, aches, fatigue or fever, but public health officials emphasize these are not harmful. That being said, vaccinated individuals can still spread COVID-19, so they are still expected to wear masks, social distance, and practice healthy habits.

MORE STUDENTS START THIS WINTER, MOSTLY ONLINE Mt. SAC began Winter Intersession on Monday with a 3.3% increase in Full Time Equivalent students (75) over the previous year. The great majority of classes are being held online.

Public health officials are imploring the community to rethink holiday plans and avoid gatherings with people outside of their household. COVID-19 cases are at record levels after the Thanksgiving holiday caused a [surge in cases](http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/)that has overwhelmed hospitals. In Southern California, the availability of intensive care unit beds dropped to 0% on Thursday. \"The devastation we are experiencing now is in part because many people ignored warnings and made the decision to travel or visit with people from outside of their home over the Thanksgiving holidays. We are now learning a very painful lesson that, despite how much we want things to go back to normal, this virus is relentless and will continue to spread, make people very ill, and tragically lead to people passing away. We can't afford another holiday season surge that will further overwhelm our already strained hospitals and healthcare staff. We must all work together to prevent as much death as possible,\" said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, Los Angeles County Director of Public Health. While COVID-19 vaccines are a reason for optimism, public health officials say the region is months away from having enough vaccine widely available in the area. At this time, the most important action for everyone to take to stop the surge is to stay home as much as possible and avoid mingling with people outside our household. When individuals must leave home, they are urged to always wear a face covering and socially distance.

GOVERNOR PULLS EMERGENCY BRAKE ON REOPENING California is experiencing [record COVID-19 infections](https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/). On Thursday, California Governor Newsom introduced a regional stay at home order that would take effect when available hospital beds in intensive care units drop below 15%. While no California regions have reached this grim threshold, Newsom warned that public health officials anticipate most of the state will reach it \"as early as the next day or two, as late as the next week or so.\" With positive infection rates on the rise, hospitalization rates are expected to follow soon after. \"The bottom line is, if we don't act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed. If we don't act now, we'll continue to see a death rate climb, more lives lost,\" said Gov. Newsom. \"And that's why today we are ... pulling that emergency brake.\" If brought into effect, the [regional stay at home order](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/12/03/california-health-officials-announce-a-regional-stay-at-home-order-triggered-by-icu-capacity/)would close all hair salons and barbershops; bars, breweries and distilleries; casinos; and indoor and outdoor playgrounds. LOS ANGELES COUNTY ADDS LIMITATIONS Due to record numbers of COVID-19 cases causing alarm for public health officials, Los Angeles County has already implemented a stricter stay at home order. While colleges like Mt. SAC can continue to provide in-person classes for limited first responder and essential worker training programs, the county order does the following: - Limits gatherings to include only members of your own household, whether the event is indoors or outdoors. - Essential retailers, like grocery stores, may remain open. However, their capacity has been reduced from 50% to 30%. - Nonessential stores, like hair salons, may remain open, but limit capacity to 20%. The campus community is urged to increase vigilance, stay home as much as possible, avoid crowds and gatherings, wear a mask in public and practice social distancing to avoid further restrictions.

SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. STAYING HOME IS VITAL AS COVID-19 CASES RISE DANGEROUSLY COVID-19 cases have reached new records across the state. To slow the spread, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a [limited stay-at-home order](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order.aspx)for counties in the most restricted purple tier, like Los Angeles. Beginning Saturday, most nonessential activity outside the home is prohibited from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. The current order is effective through Dec. 21. However, officials warned that restrictions could be extended or increased. Los Angeles County reached a grim new milestone with a record breaking 5,031 new cases on Nov. 19. In one week, the county went from a 7.6 average case rate per 100,000 people to 13.7 average case rate per 100,000. The rest of the state isn't faring much better. Cases have more than doubled across California over the last 10 days. Forty counties have been placed back to the purple tier, bringing all of Southern California into the most restricted category. If the coronavirus spread continues, health officials warn the county can return to the early restrictive stay at home orders from the beginning of the pandemic. Public health officials are urging the public to stay at home as much as possible and avoid gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus. When away from home, individuals should wear a mask and practice social distancing. [Path to Recovery - November 16, 2020: COVID Best Practices](#d14e6107) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. FEELING WORN OUT? STOMACH PROBLEMS? STAY HOME! Some of the symptoms of exhaustion, flu and COVID-19 are surprisingly similar. While most people think COVID-19 is present when there is fever, sore throat and cough, people may experience more than a dozen different symptoms or have no symptoms at all. It's important for the campus community to familiarize themselves with the broad range of symptoms and take extra precautions when they're feeling under the weather. With COVID-19 cases on the rise in Los Angeles County, officials are urgently reminding students, faculty and staff to be extremely cautious if they are feeling unwell in any way. Even if symptoms are mild, there are cases of people unknowingly exposing others to COVID-19, which later obliges their close contacts to self-quarantine for 14 days. For example, individuals who feel tired could be experiencing fatigue, a less discussed symptom of COVID-19. While sneezing is not a COVID-19 symptom, the act of sneezing can disperse air droplets and spread germs. As a reminder, below are symptoms of COVID-19 according to the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization. Some of these symptoms can be surprising. - Fever or chills - Cough - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Fatigue - Muscle or body aches - Headache - New loss of taste or smell - Sore throat - Congestion - Runny nose - Nausea - Vomiting - Diarrhea - Red eyes - Skin Rash If community members are experiencing any of these symptoms, they are asked to please stay home. Even if they only experience one symptom, like a headache, they should stay home. If they are taking medication to reduce these symptoms, they should continue to stay home. Employees with symptoms can contact their general healthcare provider with questions about their symptoms. Students can also contact their general healthcare provider or the Student Health Center at (909) 274-4400. These precautions are critical as we seek to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and protect our community, family and friends. REPORTING COVID-19 CASES AND CONCERNS Mt. SAC is ready to support students and employees who have COVID-19. STUDENTS REPORT TO STUDENT HEALTH CENTER \u2014 Students who are sick with COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19, are asked to contact the Student Health Center at (909) 274-4400 as soon as possible. EMPLOYEES REPORT TO HUMAN RESOURCES \u2014 Employees who are sick with COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19, are asked to contact Human Resources by emailing [hraccommodations@mtsac.edu](mailto:hraccommodations@mtsac.edu?subject=)or calling (909) 274-4414 immediately. TIPS TO STAY HEALTHY Each individual should do what is best for them and their unique needs. High risk individuals (older adults and those with health conditions) require additional vigilance. In general, public health agencies say that the best preventative measures are staying home as much as possible, social distancing and simple good hygiene practices: - Practice social distancing. Stay home except for essential needs. If you must go out, keep a 6 foot distance from others and avoid crowds. - If you are sick, stay home. Anyone with even mild symptoms should stay away from campus. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, headache, new loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, congestion, sneezing, nausea, diarrhea, and so on. - Wear face coverings in public and if there is a chance you will be within 6 feet of others. [Wash your hands often](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html), especially before you eat, after using the restroom or blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If you cannot wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth in case your hands are not clean. - Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Use your sleeve if you don't have a tissue handy and wash your hands. If you have these symptoms, stay away from campus. - Avoid sharing objects like tools, office equipment, cups, food and drinks. - Minimize contact, and avoid shaking hands and high-fives. - Practice healthy habits. Get plenty of sleep, stay active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious foods. [Path to Recovery - November 9, 2020: System-wide Online Technology Resources Continue and Mt. SAC to Support Economic Recovery](#d14e6219) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. SYSTEM-WIDE ONLINE TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES CONTINUE The California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office announced that tools for online education will continue to be available through the end of the academic year. During the pandemic, a number of resources have been provided to community colleges to equitably offer online classes. Some resources, like the online student services platform Cranium Caf\u00e9, are still under negotiation. [Resources available](https://cvc.edu/expanded-student-support-ecosystem-services/)through June 30, 2021 include: - Labster, a virtual science lab platform - NetTutor, online tutoring platform - Zoom, online meeting platform. MT. SAC TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC RECOVERY Due to the pandemic, the national gross domestic product is estimated to be 4.2% lower in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the same time last year. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis also anticipates a complete rebound will not be possible until 2022. The economic downturn has disproportionately hurt people of color, who have higher unemployment and COVID-19 infection rates. Mt. SAC is set to play a large role in the region's economic recovery. An economic impact report found the college added $1.3 billion in income to the district in the 2018-19 year. This is equivalent to 2.3% of the gross regional product. Students who study at Mt. SAC also benefit. For every $1 they invest in their education at Mt. SAC, they gain $6 in lifetime earnings. Similarly, for every $1 taxpayers invest in the college, they gain $2.10 in added tax revenue and public sector savings. [Path to Recovery - November 1, 2020: Mt. SAC Hiring Critical Positions, Dual Enrollment Sees Growth, and College Level Math and English Success](#d14e6260) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. MT. SAC HIRING CRITICAL POSITIONS Mt. SAC is currently actively recruiting for 47 positions that have been deemed critical to the college. The online nature of the hiring has created unique challenges, including new protocols for online interviews. Due to a hiring frost in place due to the pandemic, another 42 positions are on hold. DUAL ENROLLMENT SEES GROWTH The Dual Enrollment program noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the K-12 school districts, which have also transitioned online. Dual enrollment allows high school students to take college classes. These classes count for both high school and college credit. Despite the current challenges, dual enrollment courses have continued to expand. This academic year boasts over 30% more courses over the previous year. COLLEGE LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH SUCCESS After changes to the way students are assessed and placed in classes, Mt. SAC has seen impressive improvements in student throughput rates. This measures the proportion of students who complete a transfer level math or English course. In math, the one year throughput rate increased from 22.5% in Fall 2015 to 39.3% in Fall 2019. In English, the one year throughput rate in completing transfer level English increased from 33.5% in Fall 2015 to 68.7% in Fall 2019. [Path to Recovery - October 26, 2020: Legal Opinion on Student Camera Requirements and Real Time Captioning and Spring Enrollment Withdrawals Analyzed](#d14e6292) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. LEGAL OPINIONS PROVIDED ON STUDENT CAMERA REQUIREMENTS AND REAL TIME CAPTIONING The California Community Colleges Office of the General Counsel has provided legal opinions on two topics that have been of brought to the forefront due to the pandemic. The first legal opinion addresses whether it is permissible for faculty to [require students to keep their cameras on](/covid19/pdf/CCCCO_2020-12_Legal_Opinion_re_Cameras-On_Requirements.pdf)for live synchronous online classes. In short, there is no prohibition against a requirement. However, requiring students to keep cameras on may create a risk of violating student privacy rights. A separate legal opinion answered [whether real-time captioning is required in live synchronous online classes](/covid19/pdf/CCCCO_2020-11_Legal_Opinion_re_Real-Time_Captioning.pdf). The American Disabilities Act requires auxiliary aids or services to be provided to deaf and hearing impaired students to ensure they can participate in their educational program. In many cases, this can be satisfied through real-time captioning. Colleges are reminded to give primary consideration to the student's choice of aid or service and weighing those requests against the burden it would create for the college. SPRING ENROLLMENT WITHDRAWALS ANALYZED Mt. SAC analyzed Spring 2020 enrollment to better understand the students who withdrew. The percentage of students who ended the Spring 2020 term without earning a single unit was 14% higher than the last two spring semesters due to the pandemic. In Spring 2020, 21% of students ended the term without earning units. In the previous two springs, only 7% of students did so. A greater percentage of older students withdrew from all of their classes than the younger students, especially those 26 years and older. Foster youths, students with disabilities, AB540 students, and those receiving need based aid also withdrew at higher rates than average. [The research](/covid19/pdf/Spring_2020_Enrollment-Who_Withdrew.pdf)was made possible by Research and Institutional Effectiveness, Information Technology, and Student Services. [Path to Recovery - October 16, 2020: State Guidance Update, Cares Act Report Available, and Los Angeles County COVID-19 Status](#d14e6330) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. STATE GUIDANCE UPDATED The California Department of Public Health updated its statewide guidance for institutions of higher education. The guidance is intended to help institutions prepare to resume in-person instruction when appropriate based on local conditions. The change that most impacts Mt. SAC is updated guidance for college athletics to resume, including clear procedures, safety measures, testing, and other considerations for individuals, teams and facilities. Before Mt. SAC Athletics resumes on campus, the college must follow guidance from the state, county and athletics groups. The interim guidance provides is available in the [COVID-19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Institutions of Higher Education](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-higher-education--en.pdf)(PDF). CARES ACT REPORT AVAILABLE Mt. SAC has updated its CARES Act Report describing the college's Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. As of September 30, 2020, at total of 12,882 students have received the CARES Act grants for a total $8,770,900. LOS ANGELES COUNTY COVID-19 STATUS According to the state's [Blueprint for a Safer California](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/), Los Angeles County remains in the widespread (purple) category with the highest level of restrictions. The county has 7.6 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people. To get to the next tier, there needs to be 7 or fewer cases per 100,000 people. The county has met or exceeded other metrics, including the daily positive test rate and health equity. Public health officials warn the public should maintain vigilance against the virus. [Path to Recovery - October 9, 2020: Faculty Hiring Continues and Budget Picture Becomes Clearer](#d14e6373) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. FACULTY HIRING CONTINUES AND BUDGET PICTURE BECOMES CLEARER Due to the pandemic, the California Community Colleges can temporarily suspend regulations related to the faculty obligation number. This number specifies how many full-time faculty must be employed by a district in order to avoid reduction in apportionment for non-compliance. With more flexibility on faculty hiring, Mt. SAC can better manage expected budget shortfalls. While Mt. SAC will maintain a hiring frost, key faculty positions have already been approved by the President's Cabinet to move forward and the college plans to fill faculty vacancies critical to program viability. The regular process for hiring faculty to start in Fall 2021 will begin this month. BUDGET PICTURE BECOMES CLEARER At next week's Board of Trustees meeting, a budget presentation will detail the college's 2019-2020 actuals and anticipated budget for 2020-2021. For the 2019-2020 year, the college's reserves are $ 62.0 million. This year, expenditures are expected to increase by $7.1 million, bringing expenditures to $214.3 million. With the increase in the 2019-20 SCFF, reductions in discretionary funds, and other cost saving measures, the ongoing deficit is reduced to about $4 million. This year, Mt. SAC will also be managing more than $45 million in apportionment deferrals. Budget deferrals are like IOUs. Colleges will be able to use the promised budget, but the deferred funds will not be available until the subsequent fiscal year, creating a significant cash flow challenge. While the deferral is significant, the college will use its reserves and aggressive budget reduction measures to protect permanent positions and quality education. [Path to Recovery - September 24, 2020: Foothill Transit to Require IDs and FTES Calculation Change Positively Impacts](#d14e6399) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. FOOTHILL TRANSIT TO REQUIRE IDs ON OCT. 18 Mt. SAC students, both credit and noncredit, will be able to continue riding Foothill Transit buses for free during the fall 2020 semester. Beginning Oct. 18, Mt. SAC students will likely need to show their Mt. SAC student ID card and enter the bus from the front entrance. Students who do not yet have a student ID card may pick one up from Mt. SAC's bookstore, the Sac Book Rac, on Oct. 7 and 8, from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. Previously, students were able to enter from the back of Foothill Transit buses without showing any form of ID or payment. The installation of new plexiglass protective barriers on Foothill Transit buses allows customers to pay a fare or show a pass with added protection. Most buses will have these installed and allow for front boarding and ID checks. Buses without these partitions will continue to allow rear boarding with no ID checks. Signage will instruct passengers on which way to enter the bus. Bus routes are following a regular schedule despite lower ridership to support social distancing. Riders are asked to: - Wash hands before and after riding the bus - Beginning Sunday, Oct. 18, pay attention to signs on the buses to determine entry through the front or back doors - Support social distancing and keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible - Wear a face covering - Follow safety procedures on the bus More information is available at [foothilltransit.org/classpass](http://www.foothilltransit.org/classpass). FTES CALCULATION CHANGE POSITIVELY IMPACTS ENROLLMENT - Following new guidance from the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, Mt. SAC has updated the calculation of Full Time Equivalent Students (FTES). Previously, the FTES calculation translated to a drop of more than 25% FTES this fall semester. The new calculation takes into account students are studying in online formats due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The change brings FTES to 9,674 or a 7.8% drop compared to last year. This is more in line with the drops in headcount, which is currently at 8.8% less than last year. - The funding Mt. SAC receives from the state's general fund is based on FTES. While Mt. SAC still shows a drop in FTES, state funding will be based on last year's data, providing the college a cushion as we navigate the pandemic and serve students as best we can. [Path to Recovery - September 18, 2020: Get a Flu Shot, Withdrawal from Classes, Pass/No Pass Options Extended, and Course Repeatability](#d14e6460) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. PREVENT A 'TWINDEMIC', GET A FLU SHOT Mt. SAC is strongly urging the campus community to get a flu shot to help support the health and well-being of the community. In addition to protecting individuals from the flu, this would also help prevent a surge of flu cases at local health care facilities already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/index.html)recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot with rare exceptions. The CDC recommends getting a flu shot in September or October. The flu season normally runs from October through May, with peaks from December through February. For employees, most health insurance options provide the flu shot at no cost. For students, the Student Health Center has coordinated for students to get free flu shots through Kaiser Permanente locations in Baldwin Park, Diamond Bar, Montebello, San Dimas, and West Covina. WITHDRAWAL FROM CLASSES Similar to the Spring Semester, Mt. SAC is extending the deadline for students to withdraw from classes to Sunday, Dec. 6, for regular 16-week classes. For short-term courses, students can drop through the day prior to the last day the class is scheduled. Going forward, students who drop will receive an Excused Withdrawal (EW) mark rather than a Withdrawal (W). Students who drop their classes before the deadline will automatically receive refunds, unless they received a fee waiver. An EW mark will not count toward the limits on how many times students can repeat a class. In addition, it will not impact progress status. However, an EW may have implications for students receiving federal benefits (including veteran's benefits) and students planning to transfer to a university. Therefore, students are encouraged to [speak with a counselor online](/counseling/online-counseling/)about their options before withdrawing from classes. PASS/NO PASS GRADING OPTIONS EXTENDED The date to choose Pass/No Pass (P/NP) as a grading option for eligible classes has been extended to 5 p.m., Thursday, Dec. 17 for regular 16-week classes. For short term classes, the deadline would be the Thursday after the term ends. Students can check the portal for the exact date. Students can choose their grading option by signing into the Mt. SAC Portal, clicking on the Student tab, and then choosing \"Change Class Grading Option.\" Only eligible classes will allow students to change from \"Letter Grade\" to \"Pass/No Pass.\" In all eligible classes, including letter grade only, students who receive an F will have their grade automatically changed to NP, which will not affect their GPA. Choosing Pass/No Pass may have implications for students. Students transferring to the University of California should take caution in using this option and meet with a counselor or a transfer specialist in the [Transfer Center](/transfer/). Students transferring to the California State University, should note the P/NP grading option is acceptable for the Fall 2020 term. Students receiving Financial Aid should be aware the NP option affects their completion rate for Satisfactory Academic Progress, but doesn't impact their GPA. For Veterans, a NP may be a better option than the EW, because it shows that the student completed the course. All GI Bill students should speak with a [Veterans Resource Center](/veterans/)counselor for advisement. Students may [speak with a counselor online](/counseling/online-counseling/)to review their options. COURSE REPEATABILITY Due to COVID-19, students who receive a D, F or NP will have their grades marked as DV, FV and NPV. The \"V\" stands for virus to note the unique conditions created during the pandemic. Students who receive those grades this fall, will be able to repeat the course without the unsuccessful attempt counting against the total number of maximum allowable repeats for the particular course. [2020 Fall Semester update: EW, P/NP, & Repeatability](#d14e6520) EW \u2014 Excused Withdrawal The California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office permits colleges to allow students to withdraw from classes with an \"excused withdrawal\" or EW through the end of December, 2020. At Mt. SAC, students can withdraw with an EW up until the day before the last day of class instruction this fall. It is agreed that students will have the ability to utilize the EW option in the same manner as Spring 2020: - Students can opt to withdraw from a class through the day before the last day of instruction of a short-term class and the final class meeting date of a full-term class. An \"EW\" will be assigned for all of these withdrawals. - Faculty should still drop students who \"no show\" - these drops should be processed immediately. If completed immediately after ascertaining the student is a no show, the student will not receive a \"W\". - Students who drop classes during the term by the deadline to drop with EW will receive refunds if they paid for their classes (didn't receive a fee waiver). - Holds will be removed to allow students to do this. - All drops on/after CENSUS will get full refund and an \"EW\" grade. Drops before census (DB,DF and DG) will get full refund and NO GRADE. - Students who do not attend a course and are not dropped or do not withdraw on their own, will be billed and will have a financial obligation (hold) on their records. Additionally, students who do not attend, are not dropped and do not withdraw will receive an \"F\" or \"NP\". - The EW mark will not be detrimental to the student in computing their Mt. SAC progress status, however, there may be implications for students receiving federal benefits, including Veterans benefits. PASS/NO PASS \u2014 EXTENDING THE DEADLINE TO CHANGE GRADING OPTION The 'normal process' requires students to select a grading option of either a standard letter grade or a pass/no pass by a specific date - if the course is eligible to be taken in a pass/no pass grade option (exceptions shown below). Similar to the Spring 2020 semester, it is agreed that we will extend the deadline to allow students to change their grading option for courses that are approved to be taken P/NP. Additionally, all students (except those in the classes listed below* which require a letter grade) who receive an \"F\" will have the \"F\" grade changed to \"NP\". *Classes that are not able to be taken P/NP: Technology and Health Courses Requiring a Letter Grade Nursing: 1A 1B 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Respiratory Therapy: 53 59 60 61 Mental Health: 40 56 58D 70 72 73T Business Division Courses Requiring a Letter Grade Paralegal Courses (PLGL) Business Law Courses (BUSL) Child Development (CHLD) BUSA 58 For CRNs that allow for a pass/no pass option this has been expanded for the following: - For full-term classes: students will have a 2-day time frame after the grade submission deadline to change their grading option. - Students will have the option to change the grading option from a standard grade to a pass/no pass option or change back from a pass/no pass to a standard grade option. For full-term Fall 2020 classes, the term ends on a Sunday, December 13, 2020. Thus the deadline for faculty to enter the final grades would be 11:59PM on Tuesday, December 15, 2020. Students can change their grade mode from 12:00AM Wednesday, December 16, 2020 through 5PM Thursday, December 17, 2020. - For short-term classes: the deadline for faculty to enter grades is 2 days after the end date for the course. Students will then have 2 days to change their grade option. Advisory Information - Students seeking to withdraw or take the class as a P/NP should meet with a counselor. - For students transferring to the University of California, students should meet with a counselor or a transfer specialist in the Transfer Center. Caution should be taken regarding whether to take required courses in the P/NP option for Fall 2020 and beyond. - For students transferring to the California State University, the P/NP grading option is still acceptable at least for the Fall 2020 term. - All students are advised to contact Counseling to review their options. - For students transferring to the University of California, caution should be taken regarding whether to take required courses in the P/NP option for Fall 2020 and beyond. - For students transferring to the California State University, P/NP grading option is still acceptable at least for the Fall 2020 term. - For students receiving federal and state Financial Aid, the NP option affects the student's completion rate for Satisfactory Academic Progress, but doesn't impact the student's GPA. - For some students receiving Veterans Benefits, the NP may be a better option than the EW as it shows that the student completed the course (the EW appears as a withdrawal from the start of a course and most likely results in a debt for the student). Given multiple VA benefit types, ALL GI Bill students should be speak with a VRC Counselor for advisement. COURSE REPEATABILITY The same process used in Spring 2020 related to substandard grades and repeatability will be followed for Fall 2020: Students who attempted a course unsuccessfully will earn a substandard mark that will be coded as DV, FV, or NPV on their academic records. These were new grading symbols used in lieu of D, F, and NP that were created to reflect the conditions operating during the Spring 2020 semester due to the \"V\" virus. Students who receive a substandard grade or NP in Fall 2020, will be able to repeat the course without the unsuccessful attempt counting against the total number of maximum allowable repeats for the particular course. It is important to note that academic transcript grade notations have been amended only for these specific terms. This does not pertain to courses successfully completed with an A, B, C, or P. [Path to Recovery - September 13, 2020: Grant Funding for COVID-19 Response and LA County COVID-19 Status](#d14e6639) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. GRANT FUNDING SUPPORTS COVID-19 RESPONSE Mt. SAC is working to strategically use state and federal programs designed to support communities grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. As one of 116 California Community Colleges, Mt. SAC is eligible to apply for the COVID-19 Response Block Grant. This block grant can be used to support activities that directly impact student learning, continuity of education, and mitigate learning loss related to COVID-19. State legislators expect programs that support underrepresented students to be prioritized. At the federal level, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided Mt. SAC $17.5-million in coronavirus aid. Half of the aid was made available to students in the form of emergency cash grants to help students pay for housing, food, and other basic essentials. The other half is to help the college offset financial losses from the outbreak, such as faculty training to teach online, personal protective equipment, and covering parking permit fee reimbursements. LOS ANGELES COUNTY COVID-19 STATUS Recently, the state unveiled the [Blueprint for a Safer California](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/), a system that places California's counties into four tiers based on the number of new daily cases and the percentage of positive tests. Los Angeles County remains in the widespread (purple) category with the highest level of restrictions. While neighboring Orange County has moved to a lower tier in the substantial (red) category, public health officials anticipate Los Angeles County will remain in the purple tier for at least another 5 weeks. Early data shows Los Angeles County residents were more careful over the Labor Day weekend and have avoided a major spike in cases like the one that occurred after Fourth of July. [Path to Recovery - September 3, 2020: New Employee Process Before Working on Campus and Governor's New COVID-19 Reopening Plan](#d14e6669) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. NEW EMPLOYEE PROCESS BEFORE WORKING ON CAMPUS The Return to Campus Committee has revamped the process for employees to follow before coming to the physical campus. This process helps the college follow the Los Angeles County Public Health Department's safety guidelines. Employees must receive authorization from their manager to come to the physical campus. If coming to campus at a regular schedule, this request can be done once. Before coming to campus, employees should perform a health check to verify they are not experiencing symptoms of sickness. The process has been simplified through an online [Employee Health Check Form](/employeescreen/), which can also be accessed from the Public Health website at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](/covid19/). Responses to the form will be automatically forwarded to the employee's manager as well as Police & Campus Safety and the Office of Risk Management. The health check must be completed each day an employee comes to campus. In addition, employees who work on campus must do the following: - Review the [Return to Work Guide](/covid19/pdf/MtSAC-Return-to-Work-Guide-for-Employees-8-26-20.pdf), edited on August 26 with updated flow charts - Complete online coronavirus safety training through [POD Connect](/pod/news/2019-pod-connect.html). This training was assigned to employees by their managers and can also be found in POD Connect by searching for \"coronavirus.\" Mandatory training topics are: - Coronavirus Awareness - Coronavirus: Reopening Your Organization - Coronavirus: Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Workplace - Coronavirus: CDC Guidelines for Making & Using Cloth Face Coverings. GOVERNOR'S NEW COVID-19 REOPENING PLAN California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently unveiled a new process for loosening and tightening COVID-19 restrictions by county. The new system, called [Blueprint for a Safer California](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/), places California's counties into four tiers based on the number of new daily cases and the percentage of positive tests. Tiers are categorized as: - Widespread (purple) - Many non-essential indoor business operations are closed. Counties in this tier have more than 7 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people per day and a coronavirus test positivity rate of more than 8%. Los Angeles County is currently in this category with 13.1 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people per day and a test positivity rate of 5%. - Substantial (red) - Some non-essential indoor business operations are closed. Counties in this tier have between 4-7 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people per day and a coronavirus test positivity rate of between 5%-8%. - Moderate (orange) - Some indoor business operations are open with modifications. Counties in this tier have 1-3.9 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people per day and a coronavirus positivity rate of 2-4.9%. - Minimal (yellow) - Most indoor business operations are open with modifications. Counties in this tier have less than one new COVID-19 case per 100,000 people per day and a coronavirus positivity rate of less than 2%. The blueprint takes a more cautious approach than previously. Counties now need to show consistent success over two weeks in order to ease restrictions. Counties can also add more stringent guidelines. For Los Angeles County (and most of California), these changes won't have many immediate effects because the county continues to be in the highest risk level with widespread transmission. Guidance for reopening higher education institutions remains the same and continues to be in line with the processes put in place by the college's Return to Campus Task Force.

FALL CLASSES START SAFELY ONLINE AND IN-PERSON Thanks to the hard work of faculty, staff and managers, Mt. SAC launched its Fall 2020 semester with more than 3,800 classes. At this time, the college is serving nearly 28,000 students, a nearly 7% drop from last year. The pandemic is certainly impacting our students as they are taking fewer classes, with our Full Time Equivalent count at close to 25% below last year. While this is a significant drop, our state funding will be based on last year's data, providing us a cushion as we navigate the pandemic and serve students as best we can.

SAC's president and CEO, welcoming faculty and staff to the Fall Semester. IN-PERSON CLASSES BEGIN THIS FALL A Return to Campus Task Force helped coordinate the safe return of in-person classes. Watch a news video about the in-person classes on YouTube. These classes first met the criteria of training for the state's 16 critical infrastructure areas, then they were prioritized by the Instruction Division, and were approved by the President's Cabinet. Beginning in July, four classes piloted the process to provide in-person classes. For the Fall semester, more than 200 classes will have an in-person component, whether fully in person or in a hybrid format. These classes required a number of safety measures, including: - Rooms vetted for optimal air flow and HVAC was inspected and cleaned - Individualized class safety plans - Face covering requirements - Building adjustments to ensure physical distancing, such as 6-foot separation between seats, one-way walking systems, and the closure of gathering spaces - A health check process for employees and students, including temperature scans - A process for students and employees to report COVID-19 sickness or related absence - Increased, specialized deep cleaning by custodial staff - Safety equipment, such as masks, hand sanitizers, cleaners, and thermometers - Training for employees, including specialized cleaning for coronavirus and general coronavirus safety - Clear building signage to support safety measures - Classroom safety kits, including masks, hand sanitizers and gloves Learn more about Fall 2020 COVID-19 planning as well as Safety Guidelines on the Public Health website at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](http://www.mtsac.edu/covid19). PLANNING FOR WINTER AND SPRING ONLINE Following the guidance of public health officials, Mt. SAC will continue to operate with the vast majority of classes and services held online. With planning for Winter Intersession and Spring Semester already underway, the President's Cabinet has determined classes and services should continue online as much as possible. The college will continue to offer in-person training and instruction for essential workforce for required activities that cannot be accomplished through virtual learning. Los Angeles County has met several important COVID-19 benchmarks, including testing per day, changes in the three-day average of hospitalized patients, ICU bed availability and ventilator availability. However, case rates are still about three times more than officials expect for schools to reopen safely. [Path to Recovery - August 14, 2020: Mandated Coronavirus Training and Chancellor's Office Fiscal and Policy Update](#d14e6909) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. MANDATED CORONAVIRUS TRAINING TO BE ASSIGNED Due to the serious threats related to COVID-19, Mt. SAC is requiring all employees that work on campus to take training related to the coronavirus. This training has been mandated by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Managers have been asked to assign four training videos to all employees: Coronavirus Awareness; Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Workplace; Reopening Your Organization; and CDC Guidelines for Making and Using Cloth Face Coverings. These training videos only take 37 minutes to view. Employees can also find these training videos through [POD Connect](/pod). CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PROVIDES FISCAL AND POLICY UPDATE The California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office provided a fiscal and policy update. As noted previously, Mt. SAC will face a deferral of $46.6 million, creating a significant cash flow challenge. Mt. SAC's deferral will be taken from a combination of funds from the Student Centered Funding Formula and Student Equity and Achievement Program. This an accounting device, and does NOT mean SEAP funding is reduced or that the program has to delay their spending. It is strictly a large amount of dollars the state could readily defer. While the deferrals are significant, Mt. SAC reserves and continued reductions in spending will help protect permanent positions and the college. [Path to Recovery - August 6, 2020: Budget Apportionment, Spring 2020 Parking Reimbursed, and Bookstore Limited Hours for Photo IDs](#d14e6941) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OUTLINES BUDGET APPORTIONMENT A clearer picture of Mt. SAC's budget has been developing thanks to the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, which released its 2020-21 Advance Principal Apportionment memorandum. Ultimately, the memo clarified that Mt. SAC will be planning for $46.6 million in deferrals if there is no federal intervention. These numbers are expected to change in future Chancellor's Office communication. Budget deferrals are like IOUs. Colleges will be able to use the promised budget, but the deferred funds will not be available until the subsequent fiscal year, creating a significant cash flow challenge. While the deferral is significant, budget officials anticipate a strong rainy day fund and the College's aggressive budget reduction measures will allow the college to protect permanent positions and quality education. SPRING 2020 PARKING WILL BE REIMBURSED Students who purchased Spring 2020 parking will be automatically reimbursed for the cost of the parking permit. Previously, Mt. SAC allowed students to request a Spring 2020 parking refund through the semester. In addition, students who planned to continue studies at Mt. SAC were permitted to use the Spring 2020 parking permit through Summer and Fall. However, with most classes being held online this Fall, campus administrators will provide automatic refunds to students who purchased Spring 2020 parking permits and had not yet requested a refund. The Cashier's Office is currently in the process of identifying the students that will be owed a refund and developing a reimbursement process is still being developed. The goal is to automatically issue reimbursements no later than should be completed by the end of August. Students with questions about refunds can contact the Cashier's Office via email at cashiersoffice@mtsac.edu. BOOKSTORE LIMITED HOURS FOR PHOTO IDS The Sac Book Rac, Mt. SAC's bookstore, will be opening for photo IDs next week. IDs will be available Monday through Thursday, August 10-13, from 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m., and Friday, August 14, from 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. To minimize crowds, students are asked to get their photo ID cards on the day assigned by the first letter of their last name: - Monday: REQUIREMENTS: Students must bring a print out of their class registration that shows they have paid all fees for the Fall 2020 Semester.

LIMITED IN-PERSON CLASSES BEGIN ON CAMPUS This week, Mt. SAC opened a highly limited number of in-person classes for four programs that provide training for the state's critical sectors, which are deemed essential, such as health care and public safety. The four programs train certified nursing assistants, emergency medical technicians, histotechnicians, and respiratory therapists. The college has received clarity and guidance from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on providing essential workforce training while ensuring social distancing protocols are strictly followed. MT. SAC RECEIVES PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT DELIVERY The college is receiving a shipment of Personal Protective Equipment (also known as PPE) to help protect its students and employees as classes resume on campus. The Chancellor's Office and California Office of Emergency Services helped secure an initial 60-day supply of cloth masks, surgical masks, hand sanitizer, and thermometers. The safety equipment will be made available in kits for each classroom. Replenished supplies can be requested through the Office of Risk Management. FOOTHILL TRANSIT BUS RIDES ARE FREE Mt. SAC has long partnered with Foothill Transit to provide bus rides for students through the Class Pass program. The mass transit organization has adjusted its procedures in response to the coronavirus. The Mt. SAC community is free to use Foothill Transit buses without the requirement of a payment or Class Pass from now through the Fall semester. Bus routes are following a regular schedule despite lower ridership to support social distancing. Riders are asked to: - Wash hands before and after riding the bus - Enter through the rear entrance only - Support social distancing and keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible - Wear a mask - Follow safety procedures on the bus [Path to Recovery - July 15, 2020: ICE Policy Rescinded, Uptick in County Cases of COVID-19, and Budget Update](#d14e7090) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. ICE POLICY ON INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS RESCINDED The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have agreed to rescind the policy issued on July 6, 2020 that would have prevented international students from remaining in the country while participating in fully-online educational programs. Mt. SAC had joined 180 other colleges in the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, which filed an amicus brief in federal district court in support of rescinding the policy. Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology had filed a lawsuit requesting a temporary restraining order to pause the enforcement of the policy. During a hearing, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs announced that a settlement was reached. The federal government will rescind any implementation of the policy and revert back to guidance provided in March, which allows students taking online courses to reside in the United States on F-1 visas. AS COUNTY CASES INCREASE, MORE CAUTION REQUIRED On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced that the county has reached new highs, reporting the highest number of new COVID-19 cases in one day at 4,244, as well as the highest number of COVID-19 related hospitalizations with 2,103 people currently hospitalized. As a reminder, the college's physical campus is closed except for essential business for the safety of our community. Critical onsite employees must follow the safety protocol in the college's [Social Distancing Plan](/covid19/pdf/social-distancing-plan-v5.pdf). Before coming to campus, critical onsite employees must work with managers to confirm that they (1) have not traveled outside the United States in the past 14 days, (2) have not had close contact with someone who is known to have COVID-19, and (3) do not have any signs of a sickness, such as a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Even mild symptoms that appear to be allergies should stop an employee from coming to campus. Managers would then relay this information to Police and Campus Safety. AVOIDING LAYOFFS AND DEFERRALS THROUGH BUDGET REDUCTIONS Mt. SAC executive leaders are calling on all employees to find ways to reduce spending and help the college navigate significant budget challenges in the coming years. In its commitment to protect permanent positions and quality education, Mt. SAC has implemented a number of strategies, including strictly limiting the use of overtime and short-term hourly positions, implementing a hiring frost, returning unspent new resource allocation funding, as well as reducing budget line items that have a history of unspent funds. Last week, Vice President Morris Rodrigue emailed all employees an analysis of the 2020-2021 State Budget by the Chancellor's Office. As expected, the state budget avoids major cuts to community colleges, but removes a cost of living adjustment and uses significant budget deferrals. Deferrals are similar to providing an IOU. Colleges will be able to use the promised budget, but the deferred funds will not be available until the subsequent fiscal year, creating a significant cash flow challenge. Anticipated deferrals of $40-million will comprising about 20 percent of the college's unrestricted general fund. Budget analysts caution that the state budget takes an optimistic view of tax revenue estimates. A more well-informed budget picture will be available in late summer after state taxes are received. While Mt. SAC is well positioned with our own rainy day fund, careful spending will be a necessity to mitigate budget challenges. [Health Alert - July 13, 2020 - New Case in Building 4](#d14e7130) Mt. SAC Employee in Building 4 Tests Positive for COVID-19 July 13, 2020 -- This weekend, a Mt. San Antonio College employee learned they tested positive for COVID-19. The employee is a critical onsite worker who had been in Building 4, the administration building. The employee was last on campus Monday, July 6, and developed symptoms on July 7. The employee is recovering at home while in self-isolation, in accordance with public health protocols. Due to higher traffic in Building 4, a general notice is being provided. In addition, the college is actively tracing the individual's steps and contacting employees who came in contact with the individual. In addition, the contract tracing includes the collection of further information from those in contact with the individual, their wellness and their subsequent contacts. The college has reached out to those known to have been in close contact with the employee, provided them with testing instructions, and asked them to stay at home and self-quarantine for 14 days, as recommended by public health officials. The impacted departments and general areas have been vacated and thoroughly cleaned, with additional departments in the building scheduled for deep cleaning. \"Please join me in wishing our affected employee a quick recovery. Our hearts are also with all those in our community who are fighting the disease or have been impacted by the disease,\" said Dr. Bill Scroggins, president and CEO of Mt. SAC. \"These are challenging times, and we must unite to support one another.\" The college's physical campus has been closed since the Governor's stay at home order on March 19, with classes and services moved online. WORKING ON CAMPUS As a reminder, employees working on campus must follow the protocol in the college [Social Distancing Plan](/covid19/pdf/social-distancing-plan-v5.pdf). Critical employees who are coming to campus should communicate with their managers before coming to campus, and confirm they (1) have not traveled outside the United States in the past 14 days, (2) have not had close contact with someone who is known to have COVID-19, and (3) does not have any signs of a sickness, including a fever, experiencing a cough, or having shortness of breath. Managers should forward this health check confirmation to Michael Williams ( [mike.williams@mtsac.edu](mailto:mike.williams@mtsac.edu?subject=)), Paul Miller ( [pmiller12@mtsac.edu](mailto:pmiller12@mtsac.edu?subject=)), and Suzanne Vasquez ( [svasquez@mtsac.edu](mailto:svasquez@mtsac.edu?subject=)) before the employee comes to campus. SAFETY PRACTICES With coronavirus cases and hospitalizations on the rise, it's important to follow these steps to protect yourself and others: - Practice social distancing. Social distancing is deliberately increasing the space between people to avoid spreading illness. Staying at least six feet away from other people lessens your chances of catching COVID-19. - Wear a face covering when in public spaces and there is a chance of being within 6 feet of others. - Wash your hands often, especially before you eat, after using the restroom or blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If you cannot wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. - If you show any sign of sickness, stay home. Anyone with even mild symptoms should stay home. COVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth in case your hands are not clean. - Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Use your sleeve if you don't have a tissue handy. If you have these symptoms, stay away from campus. - Avoid sharing objects like cups, food and drinks. - Minimize contact, and avoid shaking hands and high-fives. - Practice healthy habits. Get plenty of sleep, stay active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious foods. HOME QUARANTINE The [L.A. County Department of Public Health home quarantine guidelines](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/COVHomeQuarantine.pdf)recommend that those who have been in close contact with someone who is positive or presumed positive must quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the ill person. The best source of public health information is available from the [Los Angeles County Department of Public Health](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/). We will also continue to update our Public Health website at www.mtsac.edu/covid19 and urge everyone to continue to follow the \"Safer at Home\" orders from the Governor and our public health officials.

[President's Message - July 1, 2020 - Staying Vigilant, Adapting our Communication Process](#d14e7225) MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT Dear Mounties, As COVID-19 testing becomes more prevalent and businesses reopen, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the region and within our campus community is increasing. Mt. SAC recently learned two more employees have tested positive for COVID-19. They are recuperating at home in self-isolation. Thankfully, the employees previously noted as having tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered or continue to recover safely at home. With Los Angeles County Public Health sharing grim news about the increase in confirmed cases and hospitalizations, I am writing to highlight two key points: (1) the need for all of us to continue to be vigilant to stop the spread of the virus, and (2) share our approach to informing our community about future cases. STAYING VIGILANT When it comes to mitigating the potential spread of the disease, Mt. SAC as an institution has taken a number of actions. We changed business practices to be online as much as possible with classes, meetings, and administrative processes reimagined. The College has limited those approved to be on campus, expanded cleaning and sanitization processes, required face coverings on campus, and developed physical distancing protocols. We have also begun work to prepare the campus for an eventual return, ordering hand sanitizing stations, creating class safety plans, and so much more. While we see more businesses open, I want to remind our community that we are still in a pandemic. Please continue to limit your time on campus to fulfill only essential business. Your supervisors should approve campus visits, and public safety should be notified before your arrival. Remember, face coverings are required on campus in public areas and if you expect to be within 6 feet of others. Keep your hands clean, washing them often for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. If you feel sick in any way, even with mild symptoms, please stay home. Mt. SAC is a large and strong community. We can manage a missed assignment. If anything, the coronavirus has taught us the critical importance of our health. KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY INFORMED If a Mt. SAC community member tests positive for COVID-19 or has been identified as a direct close contact in a non-college case, we ask that they contact Human Resources as soon as possible. We support Los Angeles County Public Health by compiling information for contact tracing and alerting direct close contacts to the possibility of transmission. Direct close contact to an infectious individual is defined by Los Angeles County Public Health as being within 6 feet of the individual for 15 minutes or longer OR to have direct contact with a patient's bodily fluids, such as being sneezed on or sharing utensils. A person with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 is considered to be infectious from 48 hours before their symptoms started until their isolation period ends. If Mt. SAC learns about an exposure on campus, we follow public health guidance and protocols to provide notifications to any affected groups. A broad campus message - such as a Health Alert - will be provided should there be risk to unidentified parties or there is potential impact to a general campus population. All COVID-19 decisions are made following the guidance of public health officials and our campus medical experts. In addition, Mt. SAC must follow federal and state confidentiality laws, which protects the privacy of our students and employees. Cabinet members and I will continue to provide weekly updates through the Path to Recovery email, which updates the campus on COVID-19 and its related economic impact. In closing, I want to thank you all for your collective efforts these last three months. You've kept classes and the college running. You've faced untold challenges. And you've made sacrifices to continue our efforts going forward. This is a long road and more challenges are on the horizon. Whatever may come, I am confident our Mt. SAC community will find the strength to persevere together. Bill Scroggins President and CEO, Mt. San Antonio College [Path to Recovery/Student Update: June 25, 2020: Summer \"EW\" Drop, Fall Classes, CARES Act and More](#d14e7271) Mt.

Full Time Equivalent students have increased by 18 percent. Classes are currently all online. Public health officials have approved a small number of exemptions to train essential personnel in areas such as public safety and health-related professions. 'EW' CONTINUES IN THE SUMMER This term, Mt. SAC will continue to allow students to drop with an \"EW\"\u2014Excused Withdrawal.

BOARD REVIEWS BUDGET MEASURES At the Board of Trustees meeting, Mt. SAC presented details on the Revised 2019-2020 Budget and Tentative 2020-2021 Budget. The Board of Trustees approved a proposal related to the college's Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Trust, which is a fund to pay for retirees' health benefits. To preserve cash flow to address deferrals, the college will delay contributions to the OPEB Trust this year and next year. In addition, because of stock market volatility, the college will pay approximately $2.9 million for retiree health benefits from the 2019-2020 unrestricted general fund rather than pulling money out of the trust during a decline. This week, the Governor and state legislators are due to approve a budget for the new fiscal year that avoids major cuts to community colleges, but removes a cost of living adjustment, increases the use of budget deferrals, and assumes additional aid from Congress. Budget analysts caution that a more accurate budget picture will be available in late summer after state taxes are received. The state is anticipating the use of deferrals for both the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 fiscal years. Similar to providing an IOU, colleges will be able to use the promised budget, but the deferred funds will not be available until the subsequent year. Anticipated deferrals of $38-million will impact about 20 percent of the college's unrestricted dollars. In anticipation of budget reductions over the next two to three years, the Mt. SAC leadership team is developing strategies to safeguard the college, ensure quality education continues, and protect permanent positions. Initial planning includes a hiring frost, review of overtime and short-term hourly positions, the return of unspent new resource allocation reviews, as well as analysis of unspent budgets over the past four years.

TENTATIVE BUDGET TO BE PRESENTED TO BOARD At the Board of Trustees meeting next week, Mt. SAC will present details on the Revised 2019-2020 Budget and Tentative 2020-2021 Budget. The college assumes a $16.6 million budget deficit next year, based on the Governor's May Revision. On June 15, the state legislature approved a more optimistic spending plan that counts on Congress to send states additional aid by Oct. 1. Budget negotiations are continuing and a finalized budget is expected before the start of the new fiscal year. However, with the state tax deadline delayed until two weeks after the start of the fiscal year, a clearer budget picture will not be available until late summer. BUDGET STRATEGIES ADD UP In preparation for budget cuts, Mt. SAC has implemented a number of strategies to carry over funding from the 2019-2020 budget and reduce spending in 2020-2021. The College estimates savings from vacant positions of nearly $8 million in 2019-2020. Additionally, the college expects to reduce expenditures from frosted positions to save $4 million in 2020-21. The return of unspent New Resource Allocations have also saved more than $700,000. Budget managers have analyzed four years of expenses to identify account balances that have historically ended with positive balances. From there, budget reductions for the 2020-2021 budget have been sent forward to executive leadership. The Board of Trustees will also consider a proposal related to the college's Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Trust, which is a fund to pay for retirees' health benefits. The college plans to delay contributions to the OPEB Trust this year and next year. In addition, because of stock market volatility, the college recommends paying approximately $2.9 million for retiree health benefits from the 2019-2020 unrestricted general fund rather than pulling money out of the trust during a decline. [Path to Recovery - June 10, 2020: Return to Campus Task Force and Identifying Unused Funds](#d14e7489) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. TASK FORCE PLANNING FOR RETURN TO CAMPUS A cross-campus task force has been developing strategies to safely bring a limited number of classes and services back to campus this Fall. Subgroups have been formed to tackle the challenges from numerous angles, including choosing the right buildings and classrooms with appropriate air flow, planning cleaning protocol and custodial team staffing, developing course-level safety plans, checking those returning to campus for COVID-19 symptoms, developing building signage, training and public communication. IDENTIFYING UNUSED FUNDS College executive leadership, with input from managers whose programs are affected, are reviewing unused funds from New Resource Allocations over the last several years. Most of the unused funds will be returned to the college general fund to address a budget reduction next year. Funds for essential activities will be retained by the program. The college estimates a $16 million reduction to the Student Centered Funding Formula, as well as budgetary deferrals. While Mt. SAC is well positioned with a rainy day fund, careful spending and reduced expenditures will be critical to guide the college through the recession. [Path to Recovery - June 4, 2020: Virtual Commencement, Essential Workforce Training and more](#d14e7515) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. STAND AGAINST RACISM Leaders across the college came together to recognize the plight of African Americans and condemn racism in an open letter shared Wednesday evening. The letter is only a beginning. It is a commitment to self-reflection and continual improvement as individuals and as an institution. Because we are educators and facilitators, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to lead our community to a brighter future. We must build a world where African Americans are not in danger because of the color of their skin. We cannot lose our resolve when the patina of political correctness returns. And we cannot lose hope when our nation catches a glimpse of the ugliness that still festers beneath the veneer. There will come a day that diversity will be respected and welcomed. But it must start within ourselves. We each play a role in making Mt. SAC the incredible college it has become today. And now, more than ever, we need each of you to build an atmosphere of understanding, safety and support. This is not a passive activity. We need you to use your compassion, knowledge and courage to identify and challenge racism. It can be found everywhere. In ourselves, our classrooms, our communities and our practices. We need you to build programs and provide services that enhance equity and support diversity. We need you to be actively anti-racist. This is not easy, nor is it fast. But it is imperative for us to live in a truly free and just society. VIRTUAL COMMENCEMENT AND DRIVE-THRU CELEBRATION Our resilient Class of 2020 will be celebrated with a live-streamed [Virtual Ceremony and Drive-Thru Celebration](/records/graduation/commencement-day.html)scheduled for Thursday, June 18. A virtual ceremony will be streamed at 2:30 p.m. on the college YouTube channel. The drive-thru celebration begins at 3 p.m. on campus and will be live-streamed for family and friends to watch from home. ESSENTIAL WORKFORCE TRAINING Mt. SAC provides training for the state's critical sectors, which are deemed essential, such as health care and public safety. The college has received clarity and guidance from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on essential workforce training that may occur as early as this summer on campus, if social distancing protocols are strictly followed. This provides flexibility for first responder programs, such as paramedic and fire safety, to begin cohorts this summer. BUDGET ANALYSIS AND REDUCTION In light of projected budget reductions, budget managers have been tasked with reducing ongoing discretionary funds. Their analysis and reports are due June 12. This is one of several budget strategies in effect to address an estimated $16 million reduction to the Student Centered Funding Formula, as well as planned deferrals and increased health benefit costs. While the college is well positioned with a rainy day fund, frugality and careful spending will be critical to guide the college through the anticipated recession. - April - May - [Path to Recovery - May 27, 2020: Virtual Town Hall, Return to Campus Task Force, Summer and Fall Online.](#d14e7587) The Mt. SAC Path to Recovery update provides a summary of large scale efforts from the college to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, including its related economic impact. COMMITMENT TO COMMUNICATION Mt. SAC's president and vice presidents have committed to providing weekly communication to employees on Mt. SAC's Path to Recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and its related economic impact. The college's diverse efforts to continue in its educational mission while navigating the public health challenge are detailed in President Scroggins' Cabinet Notes. These updates provide short summaries. VIRTUAL TOWN HALL Mt. SAC held a Virtual Town Hall to update the campus community on COVID-19 related issues as well as the economic impact of the crisis. Speakers included the college president, governance and union leaders, as well as the college vice presidents. To watch the full event visit the [Virtual Town Hall website](/townhall/). College leadership expressed gratitude and appreciation for the spirit of collaboration and creativity that has helped the college move forward throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Key topics brought forward in the town hall are highlighted below! RETURN TO CAMPUS TASK FORCE Colleges and universities are expected to reopen (with appropriate safety protocols in place) once Los Angeles County reaches Stage 3 of its [Five-Stage Reopening Process](https://covid19.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/RoadmapToRecovery-powerpoint-1.pdf). In preparation, a cross-campus task force has been brought together, led by Vice President of Administrative Services Morris Rodrigue. The task force is outlining key tasks, provisions and procedures required to bring employees and students safely back to campus. SUMMER AND FALL CLASSES ONLINE Due to direction from the Los Angeles County Department of Health and the state of COVID-19 in the county, summer classes will be scheduled entirely online. In the fall, all courses that can be taught online will be taught online. Department chairs and deans are still finalizing schedule options for both fully online delivery and partial on-campus instruction in curricular areas that cannot be taught remotely. The college is strongly advocating for exemptions, particularly to train essential personnel in public safety and health-related professions. EMERGENCY FUND FOR STUDENTS Thanks to federal funding from the CARES Act, Mt. SAC has developed an emergency grant for current students who show an urgent need due to COVID-19. Students can apply for the grant on the [Financial Aid website](/financialaid/). The college previously disbursed nearly $7 million directly to 10,400 eligible students. BUDGET CHANGES IN MAY REVISION Each May, the [California Governor's proposed budget](https://www.ebudget.ca.gov)is updated based on the latest economic forecasts. With coronavirus and the related economic crisis, the budget picture changed drastically from the initial January proposal. Dr. Scroggins will be providing a full analysis of the May Revision Impact on Mt. SAC in his Cabinet Notes. Three major impacts include: - Budget Baseline Better than Anticipated. The current 2019-2020 budget is based on the P1 Rebenching Allocation. Ultimately, this means Mt. SAC is better positioned with a base revenue at $197 million instead of $190 million. - Reduction in the Student Centered Funding Formula. Colleges are currently expecting a 10% cut in funding from the Student Centered Funding Formula in 2020-2021. The cut will be less severe thanks to a cost of living adjustment of +2.31%. This effectively becomes a SCFF budget reduction of about 8%. - Deferrals Expected - Mt. SAC is Prepared. The state is anticipating the use of deferrals for both the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 fiscal years. Similar to providing an IOU, colleges will be able to use the promised budget, but the deferred funds will not be available until the subsequent year. In the past, many districts have had to borrow money to cover the gap in funding. Thanks to a strong rainy day fund, Mt. SAC is well positioned to cover the cost of deferrals and weather budget reductions. MT. SAC BUDGET STRATEGIES In anticipation of budget reductions over the next two to three years, the Mt. SAC leadership team has begun planning strategies to safeguard the college, ensure quality education continues, and protect permanent positions. Initial conversations include the following: - Hiring Frost. The college will limit hiring to essential positions. Criteria have been developed and position reviews are underway. - Spending Analysis. Each department manager will analyze their 3-year budget and expenditures and then work with their respective vice presidents to identify regularly unused allocations. - Review of Overtime. Managers and their respective vice presidents will analyze overtime and find ways to limit overtime expenditures. - Investment Considerations. Mt. SAC's trusts for paying retirement health benefits as well as for weathering budget challenges are both in good positions. The college is exploring strategies, such as delaying contributions to the funds.

Due to the length of time between the employee's last time on campus and the onset of symptoms, we believe there is no increased risk to the college community. The employee was last on campus Thursday, March 19, 2020, and did not develop symptoms until Thursday, March 26. The employee learned of the diagnosis this evening.

SAC Has Fully Transitioned Online](/_archived-sites/health/images/Presidents-Letter-2020-03-30-Update1-v1.pdf) MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT March 30, 2020 Mt. SAC Fully Transitions Online Today, Mt. San Antonio College celebrated a milestone. More than 3,000 classes and almost all of our service departments have transitioned online. It's a record, and it wasn't easy. Through your hard work and perseverance, we were able to bring our college to the community. Faculty redesigned their classes for distance learning. Staff helped distribute laptops and internet access to our most vulnerable students. And our entire community shifted far beyond what would have been considered feasible just 3 weeks ago. I am immensely proud of your ability to quickly adapt and provide our critical service. While most of the state has been forced to shut down its services, Mt. SAC is still teaching, still learning, and still serving the community. That is a significant achievement, and it's worth celebrating! As we have seen the last few weeks, the COVID-19 crisis is constantly evolving. At this time, we're looking at finishing the Spring Semester with this model and eying Summer Intersession with cautious optimism. As we adapt to doing our important work remotely, we've developed a new home for our online initiatives called Mt. SAC Online ( [www.mtsac.edu/online](http://www.mtsac.edu/online)). There, you'll find resources for students, faculty and staff related to learning and working remotely. Health Alerts and information about our response to COVID-19 will continue to be housed on the Health Alert website at [www.mtsac.edu/covid19](http://www.mtsac.edu/covid19). Many of you continue to ask about our Mountie who was diagnosed with COVID-19. Please join me in keeping the affected employee in our thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery. This was a stark reminder of the COVID-19 threat. Our move to online teaching with remote staff and management support reflects Mt. SAC's commitment to the health and safety of our students, employees, and the communities in which we live and work. As we are home with our families, be proud of our college, be proud of your contributions, and say a prayer for our nation. Bill William T. Scroggins President & CEO Mt.

San Antonio College employee of having tested positive for COVID-19 and having been hospitalized on Friday, March 27, 2020. The employee was last on campus in Building 9B (Student Services) on Tuesday, March 17 and had first reported symptoms on Thursday, March 19. We are doing all we can to support the employee and the employee's family during this critical time. We wanted to share this information as quickly as possible for your protection and to help reduce rumors or false information. We realize that this news may cause a great deal of anxiety and we want to assure you that we have your best interests and safety at heart. We have already reached out to those known to have been in close contact with the employee and are continuing to call others who may have been in contact with the employee. Although the employee was not symptomatic while on campus, the L.A. County Department of Public Health recommends that those who have been in close contact with someone who is positive or presumed positive must quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the ill person. The college's physical campus has been closed since the Governor's stay at home order on March 19, with classes and services moved online. Out of an abundance of caution and to allow for cleaning and sanitization, the College's central campus (north of Temple Avenue and west of Bonita Avenue) will be through Wednesday, April 1, 2020. Critical onsite staff scheduled to be in that area will stay off campus and receive alternate instructions. All faculty and staff already telecommuting should continue to do so. The best source of public health information is available from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health We will also continue to update our Public Health website at www.mtsac.edu/covid19 and urge everyone to continue to follow the \"Safer at Home\" orders from the Governor and our public health officials. If you are sick or believe you have been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19, please contact your primary health care provider as soon as possible. If you do test positive, you need to call Human Resources at (909) 274-4225 immediately. For health-related questions and concerns, call Student Health at (909) 274-4400 and a staff nurse will respond. Please join me in sending our best wishes to the affected employee for a speedy recovery. And for all of you, stay safe and healthy. Bill William T. Scroggins President & CEO Mt.

Keep Teaching. Keep Climbing. Updates on Withdrawals, Refunds, Pay and More As the nation grapples with the effects of COVID-19, we have had to ask a lot of our community. Students were asked to transition online and quickly adapt to a new learning landscape. Faculty have had to re-evaluate their curriculum and pivot to remote learning. Staff have been holding operations together, working both on campus and at home. This doesn't even take into account the challenges in our personal lives with schools closed and loved ones to consider. Despite all this, the Mt. San Antonio College community has been nothing short of incredible. You've shown teamwork and perseverance and grit to push us beyond this challenging time. I want you to know Mt. SAC is doing everything it can to support you as well. In this update, we have answers to questions that many of you have asked and share resources that may be helpful to the community. We will continue to bring you the resources that you need to keep learning, keep teaching and keep climbing. After March 28,online classes will relaunch at Mt. San Antonio College with as many classes and student services as we can to help our students stay on track and reach their goals. This is not business as usual, and I am immensely proud of the way this community has come together to build a new way of learning and thriving during an unprecedented time. I sincerely thank you for your flexibility, hard work and patience. Bill William T. Scroggins, Ph.D President and CEO Mt. San Antonio [Student Topics](#student) >>> Jump to: [Employee Topics](#employee) Student Topics Mt. SAC is Online Only - For Now Due to the Governor's stay at home order, Mt. SAC's physical campus is temporarily closed except for critical onsite work to keep the college running. Only online classes are relaunching after March 28.

If students are not continuing, they may petition for parking reimbursement beginning April 3 by contacting [Parking Services](/safety/)via Police and Campus Safety. Withdrawals Our faculty has been working diligently to prepare their classes for you in a new, online format. We understand some students are hesitant to change from face-to-face instruction. To take the risk out of trying online learning, we are extending the deadline to withdraw to Sunday, June 7, for regular 16-week classes. For short-term courses, the deadline is the day prior to the final class meeting. Going forward, students who drop will receive an Excused Withdrawal (EW) mark rather than a Withdrawal (W). An \"EW\" mark will not count toward the limits on how many times you can repeat a class. In addition, it will not impact progress probation. You can [speak with a counselor online](/counseling/online-counseling/)about your options. Enrollment Fee Reimbursements Enrollment fees will be reimbursed to students if they withdraw from the class or the College cancels the class. Refunds will automatically be processed regardless of the selection of withdrawal codes. Learn more about refunds from the [Cashier's Office website](http://www.mtsac.edu/cashier/refunds.html). Bank Mobile ATMs Refunds are offered in a number of formats, including through a Bank Mobile Vibe account. Students can access the account through over 55,000 [fee-free Allpoint\u00ae ATMs](http://www.allpointnetwork.com/locator.aspx), so they are not limited to on-campus ATMs. Federal Work Study Student Employees Federal Work Study students will continue to be paid through the end of their award, without being required to work. These students should work with their supervisors to confirm their assignment end date. Federal Work Study Students may not participate in the Telecommuting Plan. Managers will need to submit a timesheet to the Payroll Office on the student's behalf using the student's regular hours. Student Assistants Student Assistants will continue to be paid through the end of the amount budgeted by their department, no later than the end of the Spring Semester, without requirement to work. Student Assistants may not participate in the Telecommuting Plan. Managers will need to submit a timesheet to the Payroll Office on the student's behalf using the student's regular hours. Short-Term Hourly Employees Short-term hourly employees (even those who may be students) will be paid their regular hours through the end of March, without requirement of work. From April 1 through April 20, any ongoing work performed by these employees should be transitioned to classified employees in the unit. A manager may have these employees continue the work if there is a critical need identified. Short-term hourly employees may participate in the Telecommuting Plan. Employee Topics Contact Information Help your colleagues and students understand how to best contact you by [updating your voicemail greeting](/it/resources/telecomm.html)and [email out-of-office assistant](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/send-automatic-out-of-office-replies-from-outlook-9742f476-5348-4f9f-997f-5e208513bd67), if necessary. You can check your email from any web browser by logging into the Mt. SAC Portal and choosing Office 365 at the top header. Make sure you also establish a way to reach your managers, colleagues, employees and vendors. Canceling Classes While the college has earnestly and creatively converted thousands of classes online, some classes will not be able to transition online and will need to be canceled. The college is working through the best process for the college to cancel classes, while simultaneously ensuring the student is not penalized and the college receives apportionment. Please be patient with us as we work through these important details before we provide you the process. Critical Onsite Workers Reporting While most campus employees are no longer on the physical campus, some employees are required to be on campus to ensure its successful operation. Managers must ensure these critical onsite workers are listed in the departmental Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) and receive approval from their vice president's office. Contact Human Resources at (909) 274-4225 or [hraccommodations@mtsac.edu](mailto:hraccommodations@mtsac.edu)for assistance. Pay for Work Onsite Short term hourly and professional experts are paid their regular pay for work on site. Permanent classified employees assigned to work on campus are paid at the overtime rate of 1.5 times the regular rate. For example, an employee called to work on campus 8 hours will be paid the equivalent of 12 hours of pay. Pay for critical onsite workers for CSEA 262, CSEA 651, and Confidential Employees will be as referenced in the CSEA Collective Bargaining Agreements, which is 1.5 the number of hours worked onsite or 4 hours, whichever is greater. Telecommuting Employees Assignments All permanent campus employees are telecommute employees, which include Management, CSEA 262, CSEA 651, and Confidential Employees. Employees are expected to be available during standard business hours of Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. for possible assignment of telecommute work. Employees and supervisors should be connecting on how to best communicate during the Governor's stay-at-home declaration. Managers may assign work within the job description of the employee to complete while on the telecommute assignment. Pay Employees who are working remotely on the Telecommuting Plan are paid at regular rate. Technology Employees who have technology needs in order to telecommute should submit those needs through [www.mtsac.edu/itrequest](http://www.mtsac.edu/itrequest). There is a limited amount of equipment available, so requests will be prioritized based on direction from Cabinet. The IT team requests that employees be mindful about the type of equipment and level of access they are requesting, and only request what they absolutely must have. Temporary Employees Federal Work-Study Student Employees Federal Work-Study students will continue to be paid through the end of their award, without requirement of work. These students should work with their supervisors to confirm the end date of their assignment. Federal Work-Study students may not participate in the Telecommuting Plan. Managers will need to submit a timesheet to the Payroll Office on the student's behalf using the student's regular hours. Student Assistants Student Assistants will continue to be paid through the end of their assignment (no later than the end of Spring Semester) or the amount budgeted by their department, without requirement to work. Student Assistants may not participate in the Telecommuting Plan. Managers will need to submit a timesheet to the Payroll Office on the student's behalf using the student's regular hours. Short-Term Hourly Employees Short-term hourly employees (even those who may be students) will be paid their regular hours through the end of March, without requirement of work. From April 1 through April 20, any ongoing work performed by these employees should be transitioned to classified employees in the unit. A manager may have these employees continue the work past April 20 if there is a critical need identified in the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). Short-term hourly employees may be assigned any combination of onsite or telecommuting. Both assignments shall be paid at straight time rate. Professional Experts Professional experts who are assigned to a specific project may continue through the project end date. Professional Experts may be assigned any combination of onsite or telecommuting. Both assignments shall be paid at straight time rate. Substitute and Out-of-Class Employees These groups of employees will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for continuance of work, subject to approval by the department's vice president. State and Federal Reimbursements In case of state or federal reimbursements due to the national emergency, Fiscal Services will be coding some purchases in case reimbursements become available. This will mostly be done by Fiscal Services without interruption to departments. In anticipation of FEMA reimbursements, Payroll is also working on new pay codes that will be used to track employees during the campus closure. Details will be provided soon. Online Paperwork Mt. SAC is moving paperwork online as much as possible to minimize the need to bring people on campus. A task force is coming together with representatives from each division to find a universal method to bring routine paperwork online. [President's Message March 22, 2020: Revised Telecommunication Agreement](#d14e8442) [President's Message March 20, 2020: Mt. SAC Closure and Online Transition](#d14e8458) [Message from the President on Mt. SAC Closure and Online Transition (PDF)](/covid19/pdf/Presidents-Letter-2020-03-20-v2-FINAL.pdf) March 20, 2020 Mt. San Antonio College executive leadership held an emergency meeting this morning to determine next steps for the College during the Governor's stay-at-home order. The [executive order](https://covid19.ca.gov/)directs that every Californian stay home except for essential needs, like going to the grocery store, pharmacy, bank or gas station. As one of the 16 federal critical infrastructure sectors highlighted by the Governor's order, Mt. SAC must continue to educate and train our next generation of employees, including health workers, public safety officers, and infrastructure professionals. CLOSURES In compliance with the Governor's stay-at-home order, only online classes will resume on Sunday, March 29, 2020. No in-person classes, labs or services will be available. Please work with your supervisor if you need to return to campus for any reason. CRITICAL ONGOING WORK At the emergency meeting, Mt. SAC executive management gave direction to identify and contact those who will be designated as onsite critical workers. All other employees will continue to be on paid status and will be authorized to work remotely. These assignments will be made in conformance with existing labor agreements. I have directed that Mt. SAC will continue to focus on the following critical steps through the Spring semester, at a minimum: - Maintain the College's critical infrastructure, including financial services, information technology, technology support, emergency services, public health, communication, and projects currently in construction - Move classes online and support online learning - Deliver remote student support TEMPORARY TELECOMMUTING The executive team finalized a process to identify and support those who will have a specific work at home assignment. Those assigned work from home assignments will read the [Telecommuting Agreement](/_archived-sites/health/images/Telecommute_Agreement_FINAL_Rev_032220.pdf)form and email their acknowledgment and agreement to their supervisor. Supervisors will be determining the remote work assignments and will work with individual employees. The telecommuting plan begins March 23, 2020, or thereafter at the discretion of the college. Through the duration of the stay at home order, those without specific remote work assignments will remain available for communication during standard College operating hours, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Employees will check College-related email, telephone, or other designated communication methods on a consistent basis as if the employee were working at a College work site. Thank you for your flexibility and patience as we navigate these ever-changing state and local directives. The resulting balance between online education and remote work, coupled with the essential onsite needs being met, provides Mt. SAC and our community with a higher level of safety in this expanding COVID-19 crisis. All of us have been concerned about the extent to which the College can operate to meet these imperatives. We all feel that the climate of our working environment is now more responsive to the growing risk of this pandemic. Yes, it is a challenge for such a huge transition to meet the needs of our students, but this effort will be accomplished through the energy, innovation and dedication that Mt. SAC faculty and staff have shown to be the hallmark of our excellence. Your passion and resilience allows us to meet whatever challenges come our way. Bill William T. Scroggins President and CEO Mt.
