Festive celebrations in Singapore are undeniably joyous and vibrant affairs - and Hari Raya Aidilfitri (also known as Hari Raya Puasa) is no exception. After practising abstinence and dawn-to-dusk fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims come together during Hari Raya (25 June) to revel in the spirit of forgiveness, fellowship and of course, familial togetherness. The lead-up to Hari Raya typically begins weeks prior and one of its main attractions is the annual Ramadan Bazaar at Geylang Serai. From 24 May to 24 June, the bustling street market will be packed with over1,500 stalls selling an eclectic mix of local food, handicrafts, home decorations, and traditional Malay garb. Also, experience Geylang Serai at its prettiest during the Hari Raya Light Up where the streets will be adorned with bright lights and colourful street decorations. Hari Raya season is also a great time to learn about the history, traditions, and practices of Muslims in Singapore. Every year, the Malay Heritage Centre opens its doors to the public during its Hari Raya Open House : a one-day event where guests can enjoy cultural performances and participate in fun craft activities like ketupat (diamond-shaped rice cake wrapped in woven coconut leaves)- making. Also, be sure to mark your calendars for Pesta Raya - Malay Festival of Arts (20 - 23 July, Esplanade), which celebrates the richness of the Nusantara (Malay Archipelago) community with a line-up of theatre, dance, and musical performances.Are you ready to rock, ruck and rumble? Singapore is hosting a major sports event that will get your adrenaline pumping. The HSBC World Rugby Singapore Sevens (15 to 16 April) is set to tear the roof off the Singapore National Stadium, with 16 of the globe's top teams - from Argentina and Kenya, to Australia and New Zealand - competing for fame and glory. The tournament will witness 45 gruelling matches over the two days, with countries represented by seven-player teams instead of the traditional 15-player ones, resulting in faster-paced, more heart-stopping games. Each game comprises two seven-minute halves in the pool stages of the tournament, and 10-minute halves once it hits the final stages. If all this is starting to sound too technical for you, there's plenty of off-field action to keep you entertained. \"Show Y our Colours\" is the theme this year, so come in your best costume or face paint! A fringe zone perfect for both rugby afiicionados and amateurs, the Fun Zone will feature a Rugby Challenge Zone where you can throw, pass, catch, and kick like a pro. Also, be treated to other exciting activities like the Inflatable Rugby Bungee and a Swing Bag Obstacle Course. Win or lose, there's no better way to celebrate the rugby season than with the official after party, Clarke Quay After 7s Music Festival. A stone's throw away from the National Stadium, this party features live performances, drink specials and themed parties. This mega event isn't just about sports; it's a lifestyle!

Her works have been published in books such as Soul Pancake and the UrbanOutfitters Printshop. Also, she has worked with big brands like Levi's and Marc Jacobs. Here, she shares her inspiration behind her cover piece, her favourite local food, and how she plays guide to tourist friends. This issue's cover is... inspired by Singapore's tropical flora and fauna. Singapore is a biophilic city with diverse, and sometimes rare, species hiding in plain sight. I am captivated by our beautiful wild surroundings, so it was only natural for a walk through the fantastical botanic city to be the main focus of the cover art. The local art scene is... dominated by numerous young talents who possess the aptitude to produce a plethora of impressive works, and who are able to create art that speaks volumes of their unique personal style. In addition to the opening of new museums and galleries, we are treated today to a slew of art shows, pop-up art markets and festivals - indicating a positive progress of art initiativesin Singapore. Inspiration behind my art comes from... tropical surroundings, comics or even funny stories. My illustrations often have an interesting back-story or a music reference. Also, I'm obsessed with being able to capture invisible forces of energy and its flow through patterns, so that shows up in my art. My go-to spots include... Craftsmen Specialty Coffee in Siglap, where you'll find me wolfing down its delectable bacon and egg waffles; and Spacemob (a new co-working space in Orchard) where I spend a lot of time hanging with the good folks there. I'll most likely pop by anywhere with art shows or local bands playing. My top three local dishes... are a good bowl of laksa (rice noodles served with coconut milk-infused broth) from 328 Katong laksa (53 East Coast Road), mouthwatering salted egg yolk custard bun at Swee Choon Tim Sum Restaurant (183-191 Jalan Besar), and anywhere that can offer me a delicious plate of maggi goreng ikan billis (fried instant noodles Kristal Melson Expos\u00e9 HOW CELEBRATESHARI RAYA AIDILFITRIDon't miss HSBC WORLD RUGBY SINGAPORE SEVENS HAD A GOOD TIME?

From tucking into a plate of chicken rice to enjoying succulent chilli crab dish, get your tastebuds ready for a gastronomical adventure! My favourite local dishes include... the Hainanese chicken rice from Nam Kee Chicken Rice & Restaurant (201 Upper Thomson Road); bak chor mee (vinegar- drenched noodles with boiled minced pork, liver, mushrooms and, occasionally, fishballs and beansprouts) from Ming Fa Fish Balls (246B Upper Thomson Road); and Hokkien mee at Chomp Chomp Food Centre (20 Kensington Park Road). For a local culinary experience that is lesser-known... you can visit Lau Pa Sat for mouthwatering Asian Cajun burnt BBQ prawns from stall number 8 in the outdoor area; or check out this stall called Western Food at a tiny kopitiam in Toa Payoh (Blk 8, Lorong 7) for its delicious mixed grilled meat platter that comprises chicken steaks, pork steaks, a beef t-bone steak, bacon, fries, a sausage, a fried egg and grilled kailan (Chinese broccoli) with a heavy black pepper sauce, all served on a hot plate. CHILLI CRAB A true blue Singaporean speciality, the chilli crab is a favourite staple served at zi char (Chinese home- style cooking) restaurants here. The invention of this dish can be attributed to pushcart hawker Madam Cher Yam Tian. The original recipe was then reinvented by the owner of Dragon Phoenix restaurant, who added the popular mix of eggs, sambal (chilli paste), and tomato paste. WHERE TO EAT: Roland Restaurant (#06-750, 89 Marine Parade Central) by Madam Cher's son, and Dragon Phoenix restaurant (#06-00 Novotel Clarke Quay, 177A River Valley Road). NASI LEMAK The allure of nasi lemak lies in its aromatic rice, cooked with coconut milk and pandan leaves. This traditional Malay dish is served with deep-fried ikan kuning (yellowtail scad), ikan (water spinach) and sambal (chilli paste), all wrapped in banana leaves. Now, ingredients like peanuts, cucumber slices and fried sunny side-up eggs are popular modern day additions to this indulgent meal. WHERE TO EAT: Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak (#01-106, Blk 221B Boon Lay Place) KAYA TOAST Visit any coffeeshop in Singapore for breakfast and chances are, you'll find locals ordering crispy slices of bread slathered with thin slabs of butter and kaya, an aromatic spread made of coconut, pandan (a tropical plant) and eggs. WHERE TO EAT: Ya Kun Kaya Toast (islandwide)INDIAN ROJAK A salad made up of fried dough fritters, boiled potatoes, cuttlefish, hard-boiled eggs, and more, Indian Rojak is a must-try local delicacy that offers a medley of flavours - think savoury, sweet and spicy! WHERE TO EAT: Temasek Indian Rojak(#01-254, Tekka Centre, 665 Buffalo Road) CHICKEN RICE A much-beloved national dish , the Hainanese chicken rice is made of three signature ingredients: fragrant pandan rice, roasted or poached chicken chunks, and the unmissable chilli and ginger condiments. WHERE TO EAT: Boon Tong Kee (#01-93, 34 Whampoa West)SATAY Served skewered on a stick, these BBQ meat snacks - often beef, chicken, and mutton - are perfect for sharing amongst ravenous groups, usually for dinner or supper. Served with chopped onions, ketupat (dense rice cakes), and a thick peanut dipping sauce that's both sweet and nutty, satay is indeed soul food that you can get at most hawker centres. WHERE TO EAT: Satay by the Bay (#01-19, 18 Marina Gardens Drive) ROTI PRATA Introduced to Singapore by Indian immigrants, roti prata literally means flat bread (roti). Making this dish is a theatrical process that involves deftly twirling the stretched dough until it is paper thin. The dough is then cooked on an oiled griddle. Try the plain or egg version with sugar and curry, or explore unorthodox creations ranging from the crepe-like roti tissue to an ice cream prata. WHERE TO EAT: The Roti Prata House (246M Upper Thomson Rd) HOKKIEN PRAWN NOODLES Stir-fried with a stock made of prawn heads and pork bones, the gloriously messy Hokkien prawn noodles is replete with yellow noodles, vermicelli, prawns, squid, pork belly, egg and fried pork lard. While its origin remains vague, it is said to be first sold by Hokkien sailors at Rochor Road in post-war Singapore.
