Discover the first addition to the family: an organic blend of green tea, mat\u00e9, and lemon. There are now countless fans of mat\u00e9! To give it its full name, yerba mat\u00e9 - the word mat\u00e9 usually describes the gourde, or calebasse, it is consumed in - this plant is part of the holly family and only grows in South America. People in Argentina, for example, drink mat\u00e9 all day long according to a strict ritual. They put some yerba mat\u00e9 in a calebasse, add sugar, honey, and spices, create a small well into which they insert a bombilla - a little cylinder used as both a straw and a filter - pour in some hot water, leave to infuse, and enjoy! And, as always, this beverage is best when shared... Lemon (natural flavor) Lemongrass Green and mate tea "}
