Such progress istruly a mark of our success as an academic medical institution. Each and every day, the many achievements of our faculty, staff andstudents strengthen our position among the nation's leading medical schools. Growing Our Success is a critical undertaking that is only achievable through the collective efforts and careful cultivation ofthe entire medical school community. As student applications to NJMS increase, we are expanding our educational offerings to provide medical students and residents withmeaningful experiences that reflect the latest in medical education. An examination of our curriculum \u2014 and the challenges facing tomorrow'sphysicians \u2014 will yield a new curriculum in August 2004. An increasedfocus on clinical experiences and humanistic medicine ensures that ourstudents are prepared to meet the changing needs of patients in New Jersey \u2014 and beyond. Our research efforts are growing exponentially. As our total number of research awards increase to include groundbreaking discoveries in biomedical, clinical, behavioral and health services areas,funding is also rising rapidly. During fiscal year 2003, funding reached an unprecedented $88.9 million, representing a 27 percent increase over the previous year. Research funding has increasedmore than twofold since 1996, surpassing UMDNJ's goal of doubling research dollars by 2005. On the clinical front, our physicians continue to treat patients with a variety of innovative tools and techniques \u2014 innovations that also offer our students and residents unique learningexperiences. Major construction of new cancer and ambulatory care centers has also begun inearnest. Both of these facilities will offer patients unparalleled care in convenient, welcoming andstate-of-the-art environments. All of these steps forward are achieved within the context of our local community. We value our community and its role in helping us achieve success. We remain committed to recognizingand responding to the needs of our neighbors and strive to make a difference in their lives. This report represents just a small sampling of our achievements during 2003. I am pleased to share these stories with you, and recognize the efforts of all those who are helping NJMS inGrowing Our Success . Russell T. Joffe, MD Dean, New Jersey Medical SchoolI NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT01 02 Sylvia Christakos, PhD Professor, Biochemistry and Molecular MedicineFrom first-year orientation to commencement, NJMS provides an educational setting that transforms students into first-rate physicians. ()>0.1 \u00b5 NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT03 continued on page 4progressive medical school cannot rest on its laurels. That is why New Jersey Medical School constantly assesses and refines its academic programs and extracurricular offerings. This year, admissions applications increased 30 percent, reversing a six-year decline felt at NJMS and nationwide. The Class of 2007 comes from a diverse pool of more than 2,900 applicants; more than half (51 percent) of the class is female for the first time. This class, like others before it, is encouraged to not only learn basic science and clinical concepts, but to embrace the human, compassionate aspects of medicine. Although more than a year away, New Jersey Medical School is preparing for a visit in 2005 from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The 17-member committee of medical educators and administrators, physicians, medical students and public representatives is the accreditation authority for MD programs throughout the United States and Canada. In January 2003, NJMS hosted a mock visit led by Harry Jonas, MD, former LCME secretary. Later that month, 130 faculty and students attended a retreat that reviewed the exercise and introduced them to a major initiative: development of a new curriculum. This project is progressing rapidly. A New Curriculum Steering Committee, comprised of depart ment chairs, faculty and students, was formed in May; feedback from the entire student body and faculty is ongoing. In January 2004, the group presented its findings and recommendations to the NJMS community, paving the way for department meetings and ratificationAEXPANDINGEDUCATIONNEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTcontinued from page 3 EXPAND ING E Kenneth Friedman, MD Associate Professor, Pharmacology and Physiologyin early 2004. The new program will be introduced to students in August 2004. The revamped curriculum reflects the latest in medical education. \"Today, lectureclasses are less common, and courses thatencourage active learning are on the rise,\"says Alex Stagnaro-Green, MD, associatedean for curriculum and faculty development. \"More clinical classes in thefirst two years of medical school and coursesthat integrate multiple disciplines are common.\" In considering these newapproaches, NJMS tapped into the expertiseof curricular deans from other medicalschools, including Weill Medical College ofCornell University; University of Rochester,School of Medicine and Dentistry; andIndiana University School of Medicine. Practice for Future Practitioners For students, the Clinical Skills Center is a familiar place. This state-of-the-art facilityutilizes a controlled environment for teaching,observing and assess ing a variety of healthcare-related skills. The center features 12 \"simulated\" patient examination rooms, complete withvideo equipment that monitors mockpatient encounters. Here, medical studentshave the opportunity to develop their history, physical exam, and, most important, their communication skillsthrough interactions with standardizedpatients (people who are trained to portraya variety of patient scenarios). The center's sophisticated computer programs enable faculty to evaluate student performance,serving as the basis for preparing futurephysicians for the clinical experience. Clearly,the Clinical Skills Center and its faculty'sexpertise go a long way in preparing studentsfor the new United States Medical LicensingExam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skills 04NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTDUCA TION requirement. Beginning in mid-2004, the USMLE will be updated to includea clinical skills examination that testsmedical students' ability to gatherinformation from patients, performphysical examinations and communicate their findings to patientsand colleagues. Students Chosen for Prestigious NIH Research Program Students have many research opportunities on campus, but everyyear, some pursue external programs. In July, Arun Singh 04 and ShaktiRamkissoon 05 began prestigious one-year appointments to the HowardHughes Medical Institute-NationalInstitutes of Health Research ScholarProgram. Each year, this elite programselects 42 medical or dental studentsnationally to work with senior NIHinvestigators. Singh's preceptor is Health's CancerTherapeutics Branch; the lab is tryingto develop ways to control metastaticprostate cancer. The project combinesSingh's interests in oncology andresearch. At NJMS, he worked withRobert Ledeen, PhD, professor of neurosciences, to develop a model formultiple sclerosis. Jane Fant, MS, assistant dean for research, and Pranela Rameshwar,PhD, associate professor of medicine,encouraged Ramkissoon, who workedin Dr. Ramkissoon withElaine Sloand, and Neal Young,MD, the hematology branch of theNational Heart, Lung, and BloodInstitute. His research is onmyelodysplastic syndromes, whichare disorders associated with bonemarrow failure. IEngaging Students Before they attended their first class, each of the 170 members of the Class of 2007received the most visual symbolof their future profession: a white coat. Ten years ago, NJMS was the second medical school tohold a White Coat Ceremony;now, it is a common rite of passage nationwide. Quite fittingly, Arnold P. Gold, MD,and Norman Seiden, both of theArnold P. Gold Foundation, theorganization that instituted theNJMS event, spoke at this year'sceremony. Dickson Despommier, PhD, a well-known professor ofpublic health and microbiologyat Columbia University, deliveredthe keynote address. During the moving ceremony, students recited theHippocratic Oath \u2014 a pledgethat traditionally was not madeuntil commencement. This year,students also received soundadvice from Dean Russell T.Joffe, MD. \"Understand andpractice the art of medicine andthe importance of humanism inmedicine,\" he said. \"The mostsought-after doctors are thehighly competent and compassionate.\" In October, Dean Joffe initiated a forum for studentsand faculty addressing pressingissues in medicine. HarveyFineberg, MD, MPA, PhD, president of the Institute ofMedicine and past provost ofHarvard University, was theinaugural speaker. An expert onhealth policy and medical decision-making, Dr. Finebergoutlined the forces that impacthealthcare quality. He also hosted a dialogue on how tochange health professions education to improve patient care.05''NJMS researchers continue to make groundbreaking discoveries critical to shapingthe future of medicine. esearch at New Jersey Medical School is growing on every front. For the past five years, funding from the National Institutes of Health has more than tripled, and about 60 research faculty were placed on the tenure track or received tenure. Research facilities expanded with the opening of the International Center for Public Health (ICPH) in 2002. In the future, a new regional biocontainment laboratory and the New Jersey Medical School-University Hospital Cancer Center will provide additional research space. Under the leadership of Harvey L. Ozer, MD, senior associate dean for research, NJMS's research programs continue to advance. Strategies for continued growth include encour- aging interdisciplinary research, recruiting more biomedical research scientists and partnering with research institutions in Newark \u2014 and beyond. The Best Defense Since September 11, 2001, scientists have entered an era of collaboration. A prime example: NJMS is one of a 32-institution consortium awarded a $65 million federal grant to develop a regional center of excellence for biodefense and emerging infections. The creation of the Northeast Biodefense Center and nine other regional research centers throughout the country was announced in September 2003 by the Department of Health and Human Services. Some of the other members include the Public Health Research Institute, RPIONEERINGRESEARCH NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT06 continued on page 807continued from page 6 NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTPIONE ERING Rutgers University, Columbia University, Mount Sinai School of Medicine and YaleUniversity School of Medicine. With the increased possibility of bioterrorism and the reality of infectious diseases such as SARS, these researchers are charged with developing new and sophisticated diagnostic tests, vaccines andstrategies to combat threats.\"There's no more room for white tower research,\" says Nancy Connell, PhD, director of the Center for BioDefense, vicechair for research in the department ofmedicine and executive committee memberof the Northeast Biodefense Center. \"Real deliverables, such as therapeutics and vaccines, are critical to ensuring the safetyof Americans.\" NJMS will also receive nearly $21 million from the NIH to construct a regional biocontainment laboratory for infectious disease and biodefense research adjacent tothe ICPH. The facility, which will add 13,000square feet of Biosafety Level 3 and animalsupport space, provides NortheastBiodefense Center researchers with a centralized place to work. Five principal investigators studying selected agents form the nucleus of a teamthat will grow to include several new biodefense experts. The center will also beshared with visiting scientists and outsideresearchers. The lab furthers NJMS's reputation in the infectious disease realm; the school isalready well known for the NationalTuberculosis Center, the Ruy V . Louren\u00e7oCenter for the Study of Emerging and Re-emerging Pathogens and the Center forBioDefense. Overall, NJMS boasts nine labsthat conduct pathogen research. Nancy Connell, PhD Director, Center for BioDefense0808RESEARCHUnderstanding Low-Dose Radiation Millions of people are exposed to low doses of radiation every year \u2014patients undergoing diagnostic radiology; workers cleaning up nuclearsites; and those who live in regionswhere there are high levels of radongas. But the effects of exposure are notfully known. Edouard Azzam, PhD, assistant professor of radiology, has demonstratedthat stressful effects on human cells,including genetic damage, occur in bothirradiated cells, and non-irradiated,adjoining cells. His goal is to define theeffects of exposure on normal\"bystander\" cells. With the help of athree-year, $790,000 grant from theNational Institutes of Health, Dr. Azzamis exploring the basic biochemical andmolecular processes that cause thisbystander effect. He is joined byNJMS faculty Roger W . Howell, PhD,and Andrew Har ris, PhD, as well as researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and Iowa University. In another three-year study funded by an $890,000 Department of Energy grant, Dr. Azzam and NJMS colleagues Venkatachalam Perumal, PhD,and Sonia M. de Toledo, PhD, are analyzing cellular response to energyradiation. They are investigatingwhether this exposure induces processes that lead to cancer.Making the Connection Although there is no cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),much is known about this rare cancer ofthe bone marrow. Following a chronicphase that produces no symptoms forseveral years, CML progresses to anacute \"blast crisis\" in which overproduction of white blood cellsoccurs. \"About 95 percent of CMLpatients have an abnormal chromosome,\"explains Ian Whitehead, PhD, assistantprofessor of microbiology and moleculargenetics. \"CML patients also produce two abnormal proteins associated withcancer: Bcr-abl and c-Myc, the latterlinked to tumor development.\" Researchers knew that patients had high c-Myc levels, but not why.The answer was learned in Dr.Whitehead's lab. \"In leukemic cells,Bcr-abl directly to c-Myc, actingas c-Myc,\"says Gwendolyn Mahon, MSc, whoserved as first author for the publishedresearch, which appeared in Current Biology . The research suggests that c-Myc protein can be targeted to treatthis disease. This finding offers hope for some patients. A new drug, imatinib mesylate, slows production of theseleukemic cells. I09Rewarding Research Under the leadership of Andrew Thomas, PhD, theDepartment ofPharmacology andPhysiology received specialrecognition this year duringUniversity Day. This annualevent celebrates the accomplishments of theentire University and honorsdepartments that encourageand develop faculty scholarship. Pharmacologyand Physiology was presented with aDepartmental Award forAcademic Excellence inrecognition of its growingresearch efforts. Since Dr. Thomas' arrival as chair in 1997,extramural funding hasgrown from $1,025,515 active spotlightwith another NJMS department: FamilyMedicine, which was honored for its innovative curriculum. NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT10 Baburao Koneru, MD, Associate Professor, Surgery Chief, Transplant ProgramAt NJMS, faculty are dedicated to combining sound medical practices with the latest innovations in patient care. nnovative patient care comes down to identifying patients' needs and finding new and better ways to meet them. Sometimes that involves using highly sophisticated equipment; in other cases, it is providing vital information at the correct reading level or applying the caring principles of hospice to dying patients and their families. At New Jersey Medical School and its teaching affiliates, a team effort ensures that students and residents are introduced to innovative approaches to competent patient care. Transplant Training For those in need of a new liver, having an experienced transplant team on-call is critical. The Liver Transplant Program team at University Hospital (UH) has performed more than 700 transplants since 1989. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, New Jersey's first liver transplant program is also the nation's 12th largest for adults. In addition to saving many lives, the center provides unique learning and training opportunities for NJMS students and residents, says Baburao Koneru, MD, associate professor of surgery at NJMS and chief of the liver transplant program. When a I NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT11INNOVATIVECARE continued on page 12NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT The Liver Transplant T eamINNOV ATIVE continued from page 1112 transplant occurs, students in the six-week clerkship in the Department of Surgery play arole in the organ procurement process. \"Formost students, it's their first experience withorgan donation. They gain a greater under-standing of organ procurement and the importance of organ donation,\" Koneru says.Fourth-year medical students can also take anelective focused on liver transplant surgery. When the liver transplant program began 14 years ago, one second-year resident rotated through the program eachyear. Today, there are four residents, representing each year of residency. \"Wetrain residents at various levels and providethem with many opportunities, including managing patients with difficult liver diseases; complicated surgeries of the liverand bile ducts; and recognizing the complications and side effects of immuno-suppressant drugs after transplant,\" hesays. Clearly, their teaching efforts are paying off; faculty members on the livertransplant team have been selected by students for the school's prestigious GoldenApple Teaching Award. A Quiet Revolution in End-of-Life Care Hospice programs are known for providing palliative services \u2014 such as painrelief and emotional support \u2014 for the terminally ill. However, it is much lesscommon to find comparable care forpatients who die from trauma. At University Hospital, a specially trained palliative care team has been in placefor patients admitted to the Surgical IntensiveCare Unit and their families for three years.However, two team members had a broadervision to increase staff training and enhanceservices, developing a program for urban trauma centers to emulate. Anne Mosenthal, MD, associate professor of surgery and director of surgical intensive13 NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT CARE continued on page 14 Ellise Delphin, MD, MPH, joined NJMS as professor and chair of anesthesiology in February2003. At New York UniversitySchool of Medicine, Dr.Delphin was director of medical education and alsoserved as co-chief of cardiacand thoracic anesthesia services at both TischHospital - New YorkUniversity Medical Centerand Bellevue Hospital Center. Since her arrival, Dr. Delphin has enhancedthe NJMS anesthesiology residency program byadding case conferences, a grand rounds visiting professor program and sixnew faculty members. A cardiac anesthesiologist withresearch interests in neurologic and myocardiacoutcomes following cardiacsurgery, Dr. is workingto further develop clinical sub-specialties and a departmentresearch program. care at UH, and Patricia Murphy, RN, PhD, advanced practice nurse for ethics and ber eavement, were awarded a three-year, $375,000 grant from the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation program, \"Promoting Excellence in End-of-LifeCare.\" Their grant was one of four awarded nationwide. Themodel combines a protocol for trauma and critical care doctors and nurses balanced with more personal elements. Forexample, a mobile comfort care cart offers simple pleasuressuch as CD players, lamps and even massage oil to patients.Teaching this approach to practitioners is beneficial to patientsand their families. Dr. Murphy says, \"It is a very difficult timein a family's life. Our program attempts to ease the burdensfor patients and families.\" Increasing Patient Understanding A best seller for nearly twenty years, the book What to Expect When You're Expecting provides valuable information for pregnant teens and women \u2014 unless they are unable toread. About one-third of patients at urban medical centers are functionally illiterate; the Newark Literacy Campaign estimates that 60 percent of functionally illiterate adults readbelow a fifth-grade level. In the spring of 2003, the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health and University Hospitalpartnered with the What to Expect Foundation. The foundation provided 2,000 copies of an easy-to-read pregnancy book, Baby Basics , or in Spanish, Hola Bebe , to NJMS obstetricians. \" Baby Basics is essentially What to Expect written on a third- to fourth-grade reading level,\" explains Theodore Barrett, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health. \"In addition toexplaining each stage of pregnancy, the guide addresses specific health, economic and social needs of low-income women.\" `continued from page 13 NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT14INNOVATIVELow-literacy patients receive the book at their first prenatal appointment. Doctors andnurses refer to specific parts of the bookthroughout pregnancy, and Dr. Barrett saysthere is discussion with the Literacy Volunteersof America about developing a curriculum forpatients based on Baby Basics. The initiative undoubtedly fills a void, says Dr. Barrett. \"Low literacy is a huge issue.If the patient cannot read the information wegive her, she will not be able to follow instruc-tions. We hope this pilot program paves theway for more patient literacy programs.\" Hospital of the Future Historically, the telephone and the elevator revolutionized the way informationwas delivered throughout hospitals. At itsgenesis, the X-ray offered pictorial data tophysicians in a novel way. Now, signs of thenext transformation \u2014 an information technology-driven paperless hospital \u2014 aretaking shape at University Hospital. The radiology department is now filmless, thanks to a Picture Archival andCommunication System (PACS) based onweb-server technology. \"Images are sometimes simultaneously needed for several different purposes,\" explainsStephen R. Baker, MD, professor and chairof radiology. \"With PACS, multiple peoplewith proper security clearance can access images, either on-site or thousands of milesaway. The images are reliably transferableand ubiquitously available.\" In fact, oneradiologist is based in Israel. CharlesLevine, MD, an associate professor at NJMSand a UH staff member from 1992 to1997, wanted to remain a member of Dr.Baker's team when he relocated. Maintaining a part-time appointment in the department, he returned to Newarkfor two- to three-week assignments severaltimes each year. Now, through PACS, hetelecommutes. Dr. Levine logs on to thesecure system and reviews images taken atUH during the East Coast night shift \u2014daytime hours in his part of the world. Thisarrangement eliminates his need to travel toserve UH patients and ensures that thedepartment is staffed around-the-clock,improving turnaround time for patients. At NJMS's primary teaching facility, the move to technology-based systems isalso altering how radiology is taught.\"Information technology is the new driverof change that complements other treatments,\" says Dr. Baker. \"We provideresidents with early exposure to innovationsthat will greatly change and enhance radiology prac tices of the future.\" A Partner off the Ice While most people at ice skating championships anticipate the next jump combination, Scott Nadler, DO, professor of 14NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT15 CAREphysical medicine and rehabilitation, keeps a professional eye out for potential injuries to the athletes. Since 2000, Dr. Nadler has served on the medical faculty for the U.S. Figure Skating Team, tending to the physical needsof the skaters at training camps and competitions. He was at theU.S. Figure Skating Championships in January 2003, along withOlympic medalists Michelle Kwan and Sarah Hughes, andattended other skating events throughout the year. Dr. Nadler's expertise in lower back injuries \u2014 a common skater complaint \u2014 makes him a logical choice to assist theteam. \"They are prone to back injuries and stress fractures; thelifting required of male pairs skaters can cause shoulder pain,\"says Dr. Nadler, who is also a team physician for four NewJersey colleges. \"The complexity of jumps, such as the quadruple jump series, can be very hard on the body.\" Off the ice, Dr. Nadler's approach to physical medicine and rehabilitation has caught the attention of patients, themedical community and students. Embracing non-surgical,multidisciplinary care, he is known for conservative treatment regimens that reflect all aspects of patient health.\"On a national level, Dr. Nadler is regarded as a role modelfor academic musculoskeletal practitioners,\" says Joel A.DeLisa, MD, MS, professor and chair of physical medicineand rehabilitation. \"He is also among a select group ofNJMS faculty whose clinical judgment and reputation ascaregivers earn them outstanding professional respect andpersonal credibility in the eyes of community-based private practitioners.\" Dr. Nadler's expertise recently earned him several awards. In October, he received a national award from theAmerican Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitationfor his advancements in non-surgical care of lower backpain; in December, the NJMS Faculty Organization namedhim a Faculty Member of the Year, along with Patricia Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, PhD, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine. I Before joining NJMS in July, Mark Jordan, MD, was astaff urologist and professorof urology at the Universityof Pittsburgh for 14 years. Asthe Harris L. Willits Professorof Surgery and chief of thedivision of urology, he two faculty members with specialties inurologic oncology andlaparoscopic urology. Dr. Jordan plans to prostatethermotherapy, robotic ultrasoundand videourodynamics.These the divi-sion's visibility, especially inNewark, where an agingpopulation and heavy concentration of African-American malescreate a demand for urologic care. By fostering strong relationships with thelocal community, NJMS is improving the healthand well-being of its neighbors. t New Jersey Medical School, faculty, staff and students share a commitment to community service. Located in the heart of Newark, the school, through a variety of outreach programs, addresses many pressing needs within the local and surrounding communities. These efforts not only deliver vital healthcare information and services to patients in need, but also help individuals pursue promising career paths and achieve personal success. The House that Caring Built Currently, construction workers at NJMS are building a better campus; meanwhile, faculty and staff are helping build a better community. During 2003, members of the Department of Orthopaedics and other employees sponsored the 51st Habitat for Humanity house in Newark. Fred Behrens, MD, professor and chair of orthopaedics and a long-time financial contributor to Habitat, initiated the project. He and some colleagues first lent a hand on homes being built in Newark by Habitat, a nonprofit organization. That led Dr. Behrens to consider sponsoring a house. Carolyn Suzuki, PhD, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology and a Habitat volunteer, introduced him to the executive director of Habitat-Newark. Dr. Behrens' enthusiasm caught on, with volunteers giving of their skills \u2014 and their Saturdays \u2014 to get the job done. \"Everybody was involved \u2014 faculty, residents, department staff and nurses,\" says Dr. Behrens. \"Administrators and technicians from other departments alsoACOMMUNITYOUTREACH NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT16 continued on page 1817 Augustine Eleje, MD Clinical Assistant Professor of MedicineNEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTCOMMUNITY 18contributed their time.\" Located within a cluster of Habitat homes near the NJMS campus, the house will be owned by a singlemother with three children. Not only did NJMS volunteers work on the house, they reached their goal to raise$80,000 (the cost to fund one house inNewark) through generous contributionsfrom faculty, staff and associates affiliatedwith the department. The Ability to S.H.A.R.E. Beginning with their first year, NJMS students are offered many community service opportunities. The umbrella organization that facilitates these programs\u2014 Student Health Advocates for Resourcesand Education, or S.H.A.R.E. \u2014 has been student-run since its inception in 1996. S.H.A.R.E. supports six programs that serve residents of Newark and neighboringcommunities. The newest, Unite for Sight, provides free vision screenings and education,and accepts eyeglass donations. The otherestablished programs are: the Early Start Mentoring Program, which pairs students withat-risk youngsters; the Student Family HealthCare Center, which offers free medical care tothe uninsured and underinsured; the NewMoms Program, in which first- and second-year students assist young mothers-to-be throughout pregnancy; Students Teaching AIDS to Students, an educationaloutreach program for middle school and highschool students; and Community 2000, apatient outreach and education initiativewhich includes monthly health fairs hostedthroughout Newark. S.H.A.R.E. advisor MariaL. Soto-Greene, MD, senior associate dean foreducation notes, \"The success of our programsare a testament to student-led initiativesstrongly supported by faculty advisors.\" John Fontanilla, student director of S.H.A.R.E. and a second-year medical studentagrees. \"It is a unique opportunity for first-and second-year students to have clinical exposure, while working in the community thatis the setting for their medical education. Yougain as much as you give,\" he says. From Classroom to Career Sometimes, everyone wins. A new School-to-Career Program, a collaborativeeffort with the Newark school system, introduces and trains Newark high school students in some of the less-known, yet essential, healthcare careers. When the students continued from page 16NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTOUTREACH19graduate, this training could lead them to pursue jobs in the healthcare profes- sion, perhaps at NJMS or UniversityHospital. \"This program exposes teensto a full range of healthcare careeropportunities that they might not realize exist: respiratory technician, labassistant, medical recordkeeping,patient services representative andmore,\" says Robert L. Johnson, MD, professor and interim chair of pedi-atrics and director of the Division ofAdolescent and Young Adult Medicine.He is also NJMS's representative to theSchool-to-Career Committee. For an initiative that required a curriculum and approval by the cityand state boards of education, the pro-gram quickly took shape. Discussionbetween Dr. Johnson, Sidney E.Mitchell, FACHE, University Hospitalpresident and CEO, and Marion A.Bolden, Newark Public Schools districtsuperintendent, began in March 2003.By October, the program was in place,enabling 22 sophomores from CentralHigh School and Weequahic High School to participate in the first phase. Students learn about job opportuni-ties by rotating through 12 UHdepartments. By February 2004, theinternship component of the program \u2014 hands-on training indepartments \u2014 is expected to be available to high school seniors. Brotherhood Health Initiative In November, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, through its NewJersey Health Initiatives program,awarded $450,000 to The BrotherhoodHealth Initiative. The initiative is partof the NJMS Division of Adolescentand Young Adult Medicine in theDepartment of Pediatrics. Althoughonly two years old, The BrotherhoodHealth Initiative has made a signifi-cant impact on the local communitythrough its dedication to helpingminority youth. The program creates asafety net for at-risk urban minoritymales by providing case management,targeted outreach and prevention serv-ices. This proactive approach helpsyouth by providing assessments oftheir social services needs, follow-upon referrals and peer group sessions.To date, more than 80 young maleshave participated in the program. I New Practice Opens its Doors When the Department of Family Medicine decided toopen a second off-site prac-tice, it was searching for alocation that would allow it tobuild strong ties with the com-munity while partnering withan innovative faith-basedorganization. The department found such a place at the St. JamesPreparatory School inNewark. A 3,500 square footoffice now houses theUniversity Center for FamilyMedicine. Staffed by JudyWashington, MD, and GuyFrancis, MD, assistant profes-sors of family medicine, thepractice provides care toadults and children, includingcongregants of the St. JamesAME Church, located acrossthe street. It is one of the city'slargest congregations. The practice brings a new level of personal care to theneighborhood. \"This is anopportunity to introduce inno-vative practice says Mark S.Johnson, MD, professor andchair of Family Medicine.Family Medicine also haslocations at the Doctors OfficeCenter and the UniversityFamily Practice Center atVailsburg. Other NJMS departments also serve the community. TheDepartment of Medicine'sFOCUS Community HealthCenter in downtown Newark isstaffed by bilingual physicianswho provide culturally compe-tent care to Latino patientsthroughout Essex County.Ana Natale-Pereira, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine Medical Director, FOCUS Community Health Center20A focus on specialty areas of medicine is helping NJMS grow its reputation and expand its expertise. NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT21 continued on page 22t New Jersey Medical School, five priority areas \u2014 infectious diseases, cardiovascular science, neurological and visual sciences, trauma and cancer \u2014 demonstrate the importance of growing the specialty areas of medicine. These specialties attract world-class researchers and clinicians to the Newark campus, forming the cornerstone of an innovative medical school. Infectious Diseases New Directions When David Alland, MD, associate professor of medicine and Jessica Mann, a research teaching specialist, joined NJMS, neither of them knew that they would soon be working on some of the country's most advanced and well-funded biodefense projects. Dr. Alland, who came to NJMS to continue his research on drug-resistant tuberculosis in 2002, has several new projects in progress. His laboratory's work includes a population-based study of resistance to one of the first-line TB drugs, isoniazid. His diagnostic work, along with long-time Public Health Research Institute colleagues, Fred Kramer, PhD, and Sanjay Tyagi, PhD, has exciting biodefense applications. The researchers developed a way to monitor polymerase chain reactions (a technique by which scientists can replicate DNA in a vial) in real time with AGROWINGSPECIALTIESGROWING SP NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTspecial fluorescent probes called molecular beacons. \"By using a smaller number ofprobes, we can more efficiently differentiatebetween closely related DNA sequences,\" Dr. Alland says. Applied to bioterrorismagents, hundreds of infectious pathogenscould be detected from a single assay well.His lab is working on this project withNancy Connell, PhD, as part of NJMS'scontribution to the newly designatedregional center of excellence for biodefenseand emerging pathogens. When Dr. Connell, who is the director of the Center for BioDefense, spoke on bioterrorism at Ohio Wesleyan Universitythree years ago, she captured the interest ofJessica Mann, a senior microbiology major.Mann began working for Dr. Connell upongraduation, initially conducting TB researchand managing the Biosafety Level 3 lab.When Department of Defense grants startedincreasing, \"I was asked to shift direction,\"Mann says. Today, she is the manager ofthe Ruy V . Louren\u00e7o Center for Emergingand responsibilities include coordinating biodefense research, training personnel,overseeing regulatory affairs and serving onnumerous UMDNJ biosafety committees. Testing a New Vaccine Food and Drug Administration approval of a new smallpox vaccine maydepend on whether an inoculated person'sbody responds, as it should, by making neutralizing antibodies. Two new laboratorytests to measure this are being developed byThomas Denny, MSc, associate professor ofpathology and laboratory medicine, and pediatrics, as part of a $6 million, three-year NIH grant. \"With the old vaccine, testing was labor intensive,\" saysDenny. \"These tests will be more sophisti-cated. As part of the grant, we will analyzeabout 10,000 blood samples to determinehow quickly and effectively these tests work.\" As director of the Center for Laboratory Investigation, Denny has been studyingsmallpox for several years at NJMS. Foranother longstanding research interest, HIV ,he is developing an infrastructure for testingHIV antiviral drugs and treating patients inresource-poor nations. In 2003, Denny balanced these projects with a prestigious fellowship inWashington, D.C. As one of seven RobertWood Johnson Health Policy Fellows, heserved on the Senate Committee on Health,Education, Labor and Pensions. He workedto gather support for Project BioShield,President George W . Bush's $6 billion program to facilitate development and purchase of vaccines and treatments againstpossible bioterrorism agents. continued from page 21 2223ECIALTIES NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTDetecting Pathogens The Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine is well-known for its molecular diagnostics lab.According to vendor data, the lab performs the greatestvolume and variety of molecular infectious disease tests ofany lab associated with a hospital in the state. With morethan 35,000 tests performed in fiscal year 2003, the labplays a key role in detecting and identifying diseases andpathogens. Known for its infectious disease focus, whichincludes a full spectrum of HIV and other pathogens testing, the lab is expanding its services to include molecular oncology. External clientele are growing toinclude research partnerships with Bristol-Myers Squibband Gilead Sciences. Cardiovascular Science A Robot in the OR While the idea of a robot assisting with cardiac surgery might sound futuristic, New Jersey Medical School and UniversityHospital have been using a robotic system for several months. continued on page 24Looking Out for an Unwanted Visitor: SARS Each June, the Portuguese Festival in Newark attracts thousands of visitors. Manycome from another city with alarge Portuguese population:Toronto. While that is usually oflittle consequence, the 2003 outbreak of Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome (SARS) inToronto spurred the NewarkHealth Department to quicklyimplement an enhanced surveil-lance program at city hospitals. \"Every patient who came into the emergency room wasscreened against a checklist ofSARS symptoms and questionsthat we developed,\" notesPeter Wenger, MD, of and communityhealth. Wenger serves withWilliam Halperin, MD, DrPH,MPH, professor and chair ofpreventive medicine and community health, as a consultant to the city healthdepartment. Patient logs werereviewed daily for possiblecases. Fortunately, no one metthe complete criteria for SARS.\"There was one case in which apotential patient was identifiedright away \u2014 proof thatenhanced surveillance works,\"Dr. Wenger says. Thomas Denny, MSc Associate Professor, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, PediatricsNEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT GROWING SPIn March 2003, several nurses and Michael Banker, MD, assistant professor ofsurgery and director of cardiac surgery atUniversity Hospital, traveled to BaylorUniversity for training on the da VinciSurgical System. Now in use at the hospital,the robotic system has two main parts: aviewing and control console and a surgicalarm. During a cardiac procedure, Dr. Bankeris stationed at the console, and the r obotic arm is inserted through small incisions inthe patient's chest. A three-dimensional imageprovided to the surgeon via a computer bankfacilitates precise control and movement of therobot's arm. Cardiac robotic surgery offers many benefits to patients, says Dr. Banker: tinyincisions; the ability to perform procedureswith more accuracy and efficiency; and fasterrecovery times. At UH, the da Vinci SurgicalSystem is used either to harvest a mammaryartery for cardiac bypass or for epicardialpacemaker lead placement for biventricularresynchronization. Dr. Banker has performedabout 50 robotically assisted internal mam-mary artery harvests; he also performed thefirst r obotic epicardial lead placement in New Jersey. He anticipates using the systemfor mitral valve repair in 2004, with more complex procedures to come. \"These are all stepping stones toward using the system forTotally Endoscopic Coronary ArteryBypass, or TECAB,\" says Dr. Banker. \"Thetechnology is still very new. The operations performed with robotics in five years willlook nothing like what we are doing today.\" An Integrative Approach In September 2003, the National Institutes of Health unveiled its Roadmap for Medical Research. One of the major themes ofthis initiative is a more integrative approach tothe research process. And yet Stephen F .Vatner, MD, professor and chair of cell biologyand molecular medicine and director of theCardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI), continued from page 23 24The da Vinci Surgical SystemNEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT ECIALTIEShas been traveling down this path for years. During his distinguished careeras a cardiac researcher, he developedthe concept of integrative cardiovascu-lar physiology \u2014 the incorporation of molecular research into developmentof therapies for patient care. \"Thisidea that what we do in the laboratoryhas direct, clinical relevance is critical,\" he says. Dr. Vatner's research of the underlying causes of congestive heartfailure and ischemic heart disease hasbeen supported by the NIH for more than two decades. In 2003, his labmade inroads in the investigation ofnovel genetic alterations in animalmodels, uncovering areas that potentially can be used to treat heart failure. The researchers are also working toward discovery of newmechanisms to control stroke. Increasingly, CVRI researchers are collaborating with non-traditionalbasic science partners, such as biomechanical engineers from NewJersey Institute of Technology, andscientists from other areas of medicine, such as cancer. \"We arecombining disciplines to explore problems from different areas ofexpertise,\" says Dr. Vatner. And forthe clinical aspects of research, CVRIwill partner with UH as well as twoother Newark hospitals \u2014 NewarkBeth Israel Medical Center and SaintMichael's Medical Center. Neurological and Visual Sciences Going to BAT Against Stroke Even before a stroke patient arrives, the Brain Attack Team(BATeam) at New Jersey MedicalSchool and University Hospital isready. \"Every minute that a strokepatient is not getting treatment, braincells are dying,\" says Adnan Qureshi,MD, professor and UH director of thecerebrovascular program. A dedicated, interdisciplinary 25 continued on page 26Looking at the Very Small Picture For years, scientists have worked to understandgenomes, the set of geneticinstructions that comprisespecies. In 1994, a term wascoined to describe a newrealm of scientific discovery:proteome, which is the protein complement of thegenome. Proteomics involvesthe identification of proteinsin a cell, describing theirfunction, exploring what happens when cells are damaged or diseased andmuch more. Highly sophisticated equipment and a speciallytrained team is needed to runa proteomics lab. Both the NJMS Center forAdvanced directed byHong Li, PhD, assistant professor of biochemistry andmolecular biology. The facility is equipped withstate-of-the-art proteomicsinstruments and bioinform-atics systems that analyzeprotein structure and function. With proteomics of prime interest to researchersand pharmaceutical companies, CAPR currentlyserves 50 investigator groupsfrom academia, privateindustry the scientificcommunity. CAPR is currently working withStephen F. Vatner, MD, professor and chair of cellbiology and molecular medicine, and theCardiovascular ResearchInstitute to investigate causesof heart failure and genderdifferences in heart diseasesat the proteomic level. NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTcontinued from page 25GROW ING S cadre of stroke specialists formed in June 2003, the team is always on call to combatthe nation's leading cause of long-term disability and third most frequent cause of death. Rapid response time and an established medical protocol play an essential role inimproving patient outcomes. According tothe NIH guidelines for acute ischemic stroke,there is a \"golden window\" of rapid identifi-cation and treatment in which to save lives.At NJMS and UH, BAT is accomplishing thisin half the recommended time and withgreater accu racy. The results offer patients real options of survival without disabilities. A Vision to Restore Hope Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of legal blindnessamong Americans over 55. For many more,AMD impairs vision, making everyday tasksdifficult or impossible to perform. With agrowing population of older Americans, thedisease will become even more prevalent. \"AMD affects central vision, precisely what's needed to read or to drive,\" saysMarco Zarbin, MD, PhD, professor and chairof ophthalmology and visual science. Centralvision is provided by a specialized part of theretina called the macula. \"Not only canvision be lost, so can the ability to live independently.\" There are two types of AMD: dry, in which cells within the macula break downand die, and wet, where abnormal vesselsgrow under the macula. The current remedies for AMD are sight-preserving;Dr. Zarbin's research focuses on development of sight-restoring treatmentsthrough the transplantation of healthy retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. RPE cell transplantation faces two barriers: rejection of the healthy cells and abilityof the transplanted cells to grow properly. Of the latter, Dr. Zarbin explains, \"There'ssomething about the transplant surface that is bad for cell sur vival. I'm working to discover exactly what that is, and how to reverse it.\" 26NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTcontinued on page 28PECIALTIESTen Years of Discovery In 1993, Monique Roy, MD, professor of ophthalmology, began a study of 725 AfricanAmericans with Type I diabetes \u2014 the firstpopulation-based study of its kind. A decade later, the retina s pecialist is evaluating data from the study's first phase that reveals someinteresting preliminary observations about TypeI diabetes and its complications. Diabetic retinopathy, abnormalities of the retina'sblood vessels, occurred most often and wasmost severe in African-American women. Dr.Roy also discovered a link between diabetic African-American men and kidney disease.\"Men who developed mild kidney diseasewere at much greater risk of dying thanwomen,\" she says. \"This could underscore the importance of protecting kidney function inAfrican-American men diagnosed with this disease.\" The ongoing second phase of the study, funded by the National Eye Institute and theNational Institutes of Health, assesses diabetes progression among the 600 peoplewho remain in the study. Using Technology to Combat Brain Tumors Staffed by a team of highly trained specialists, the Department of NeurologicalSurgery is known for using state-of-the-artequipment and advanced techniques to treat avariety of neurological needs. The department isled by Peter Carmel, MD, DMedSc, professor andchair of neurological surgery and a world-renowned professor of neurological surgery. One innovation employed by Dr. Carmel's team is Polestar N-10, an intraoperative MRI system that images thebrain during surgery. University Hospital wasthe first in North America and second hospital worldwide to use the powerful tool.Equipped with .12 tesla mag netic fields, optical probe and infrared cameras, Polestar is connected to a normal operating table andoperated via a control mouse. The system helpsneurosurgeons differentiate between tumor andbrain tissue while surgery is in progress, ensuring that tumor remnants are not leftbehind. It also helps compensate for shifting ofthe brain that occurs during surgery, againallowing for more precise tumor removal. Morethan 200 brain tumor patients at UH have benefited from Polestar. But access to state-of-the-art equipment is only part of the reason for the department'ssuccess and growing reputation. \" Ours is a unique service of extremely high quality,\" Dr. Carmel notes. \"T ogether, we are working to discover the causes of central nervous system disease and are promoting innovative therapies for treating these disorders.\" The Big Picture Autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus affect thewhole body, including the eyes. \"Thesepatients can develop inflammatory conditionsin their eyes, which are often treated unsuccessfully with steriod drops,\" explainsDavid Shu-Chih Chu, MD, assistant and an ocular immunologist. \"This is because theproblem goes far beyond the eyes.\" His approach for these patients is similar to that of a rheumatologist:the use of chemotherapy agents, suchas methotrexate, to suppress theimmune system and preserve sight.Even children with juvenile arthritiswho develop uveitis \u2014 inflammationof the iris, choroid or the ciliary body \u2014 can benefit. \"Not many ophthalmologists or uveitis specialists are comfortabletreating these young patients,\" saysDr. Chu. \"I give them the best care I can with immunosuppressantsto control the inflammation andprevent blindness.\" Trauma A Grant to Train Trauma Researchers The sur geons at the New Jersey Trauma Center (NJTC) are not onlyexcellent clinicians, they also are outstanding researchers. In 2003,NJMS received a $1.5 million prestigious, five-year National Institutes of Health training grantthat will enable surgical residents to work alongside these trauma researchers. Officially, the grant is an NIH National Research Service AwardInstitutional Research Training Grant,but is more informally known by itscode, T32. Grants can be in anyhealth-related discipline, but there are fewer than 25 awarded to critical careprograms nationwide. \"The T32 enables surgical residents to gain invaluable experience working in the labs of outstanding trauma researchers,\"says David Livingston, MD, professor During the past five years, the New JerseyTrauma Center (NJTC)at University Hospitalexperienced a 4 percentaverage increase in trauma patients peryear. In 2003, NJTC hada 6 percent increase inpatients from the previous year. One ofonly three Level 1 trauma centers in thestate, NJTC treats a widevariety of patientinjuries, ranging fromeveryday slips fallsto serious ofDecember 2003,physicians at NJTC: Itreated 3,194 patients IOf the trauma patients who wereadmitted, 673 patientswere involved in vehicular accidents; 589 had violence-relatedinjuries; and 325 wereseen for miscellaneouscauses, such falls injuries. Hospital's emergencymedical serviceshelicopter, completed anaverage 50 missions permonth, including flying critically ill patients to thetrauma center and providing interhospitaltransport for ICU patients. THE NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTcontinued from page 27NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT29 PECIALTIES of surgery and chief of trauma at NJTC. Among those researchers are Edwin Deitch, MD, professor and chair of surgery and the grant's principal investigator. Other researchers includeDr. Livingston and Carl Hauser, MD, associateprofessor of surgery and chief of research forsurgery. The first residents for this program willbegin a two-year rotation in July 2004. Trauma Care for the Eyes Eye injuries can be caused by a fast-hit tennis ball, a chemical splash, fire-works, or even a fingernail. With about onemillion cases a year nationwide, eye injuriesare common. And even though many injuriesare preventable, the National Society to Prevent Blindness attributes one-third of eye lossin children under 10 to injury. When accidents happen, the Eye Trauma Center for New Jersey at University Hospital isready. \"An ophthalmology resident is availablearound the clock. No matter how unusual theinjury, the appropriate subspecialist is on call,\"says Marco Zarbin, MD, PhD, professor andchair of ophthalmology and visual science. The 20 ophthalmologists affiliated with the center represent three main areas of ocularexpertise: the retina, the anterior segment andoculoplastic surgery. Serving patients for 10 years, the center is directed by Roger Turbin, MD, assistant professor and director of ocular trauma atUniversity Hospital. The center's experiencewith many types of eye injuries, from commonto complex, has earned it a solid reputation.\"We average two to five surgical emergency callsa week,\" notes Dr. Turbin. \"That kind of frequency builds expertise \u2014 and our reputation.\" The proof of the center's quality is evidenced by an increased number of referralsfrom community-based ophthalmologists. Cancer Masters of Deception Pranela Rameshwar, PhD, associate professor of medicine, has identified two typesof cells that, in the very early stage of breast cancer, leave the breast and enter the bone marrow. \"Both progenitor cells and the cancer stem cells are present,\" she notes. \"However, the Pranela Rameshwar, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine continued on page 30NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT 30 continued from page 29GROWING S cancer stem cells are somehow able to act as healthy cells, remaining undetectable.\"Dr. Rameshwar is nearing completion of afour-year, $873,000 National Institutes ofHealth grant that examines the biomechanism of breast cancer cell integration into bone marrow. Dr. Rameshwar is studying the bone marrow of breast cancer patients and healthywomen with samples supplied by theNational Cancer Institute. In addition to thestem cells, she has also identified HGFIN, a gene that plays an important role in containing breast cancer cells in bone marrow. Comprehensive Cancer Care As the new Cancer Center takes shape to become a spectacular nine-story buildingon the Newark campus (see page 35),NJMS and University Hospital are focusingon a joint goal to establish a nationallycompetitive cancer program. Achieving this goal is attainable. In 2002, a total of 1,100 new cancer cases were seen, representing a 37 percent increasein cases since 1997. Of these, 35 percentwere orphan cancers (those that are lessprevalent overall); 67 percent were minorityor underserved patients. In t otal, 35,000 cancer-related patient interactions arereported each year. Researchers at NJMS are also making great strides forward in the fight againstcancer. Currently, more than 20 investiga-tors are conducting 30 major cancer-relatedstudies and research. NJMS is using National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines to direct its growth tobecome an NCI designated comprehensivecancer center. Among the critical prioritiesand qualities that the NCI has established forcancer centers is a commitment to researchthat advances the field while promoting collaboration between researchers and clinicians. To achieve this, NJMS haslaunched a pilot program that encourages New Jersey Medical School-University Hospital Cancer CenterNEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTPECIALTIESthese partnerships. With a focus on discovering new ways to find and treat cancer, Cancer Center Pilot Projects will be grant-funded for one year. Turning Off a Problem Protein Hormone therapy can slow the progression of prostate cancer or shrink the size of a tumor, appearing for a timeto bring about remission. But when hormone therapy loses its effectiveness,cancer recurs and can metastasize.Chemotherapy is ineffective against hormone refractory prostate cancer, andradiation is an option only when cancer isconfined to the prostate. This problem has researchers such as Beverly Barton, PhD, assistant professor ofsurgery and urology, searching for answerswithin the prostate cell itself. Her researchfocuses on the transcription factor STAT3,a protein that links signals outside the cellto the nucleus. \"STAT3 can be an essentialpart of normal cell function, but in prostatecancer cells, STAT3 is abnormally activated, interfering with gene expressionthat regulates the cell cycle and normal celldeath,\" she explains. Dr. Barton has designed and synthesized molecules that appear to inhibit STAT3directly and its function in prostate cancercells. She applied for a patent on these molecules in October 2003 and her researchcontinues. \"There needs to be additional in vitro and animal studies. The mechanismby which the molecules work has to be established, along with a more formal analysis of function,\" Dr. Barton says. Herresearch is funded by the Ruth EstrinGoldberg Memorial for Cancer Research. Relief is in Her Hands For cancer patients, chemotherapy and radiation treatments can be difficult to tolerate. In January 2003, a nationally certified massage therapist, MargaretO'Connor, began developing a special therapy program for oncology patients. \"Studies show that massage therapy can help relieve pain, improve function andincrease patients' ability to relax,\" saysCharles Cathcart, MD, assistant professor of radiology and director of radiation oncology. Massage therapy is offered to chemotherapy inpatients and chemotherapyand radiation outpatients, either before orafter treatment. Therapy is tailored to thepatient's needs; for example, someone witha headache might benefit from foot reflexology. A stereotactic radiosurgerypatient, who has a \"halo\" attached to his orher head, can receive massage therapy whilesitting in a chair. Massage therapy may bejust the beginning, with additional researchprojects and other therapies to follow. \"Weare looking into a full complement of alternative medicine options for the new cancer center,\" Dr. Cathcart notes. I3132Donors Making a Difference he growing success of New Jersey Medical School would not be possible without strong support from philanthropic organizations, the community and many generousindividuals. In Fiscal Year 2003, the Foundation ofUMDNJ received a total of $6,274,223 in gifts tobenefit New Jersey Medical School, including thelargest single gift ever received from an alumnus ofa UMDNJ school. Together, these gifts are making adifference as NJMS broadens its educational offer-ings, expands its research capabilities and provides top-quality patient care and services. All gifts,whether large or small, are an investment in thefuture of healthcare in New Jersey. Alumnus Teaches Lesson in Giving Since graduating from NJMS in 1972 and the orthopaedics residency program in 1976, Frederick F . Buechel Sr., MD, has had a distinguished career. The award-winning inventor and surgeon travels the world, giving lectures and surgicaldemonstrations of the New Jersey LCS Total Knee Replacement System, of whichhe is co-inventor. Despite his international reputation, the NJMS clinical professor of orthopaedic surgery has not forgotten his roots. In 2003, he gave the largest single gift everreceived from a UMDNJ graduate \u2014 $2 million to the NJMS Department ofOrthopaedics to create the Frederick F . Buechel, MD, Chair for Joint Replacement.\"My wish is for the Buechel Chair holder to push the frontiers of human jointreplacement research into practical, clinical applications,\" Dr. Buechel says. To encourage scientific exchange and research collaborations, the Buechel Chair will work with the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) to establish the Buechel-Pappas Biomechanical Engineering Liaison \u2014 a partnership between theNJMS Department of Orthopaedics and the departments of Biomedical Engineering Frederick F . Buechel Sr., MDT THE NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTand Mechanical Engineering at NJIT. The program encourages collaboration in the same way that Dr.Buechel, as an orthopaedic surgical resident at NJMS,sought assistance from his NJIT biomechanics professor,Michael Pappas, PhD, in constructing a prostheticankle. Since then, the two have received more than100 patents for implants and instruments related to replacement ankles, hips, shoulders, knee and finger joints. Both men were also inducted into theNew Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame. The endowment also establishes the Buechel-Pappas Award for Outstanding BiomedicalEngineering Research, which will be presented everyother year to a surgeon-engineer team from the twoschools. The endowment allows for the establishmentof a clinical research unit on the Newark campus topromote cutting-edge research. A Humanistic Approach For today's patients, finding physicians with well-documented medical and scientific expertise is a priority. But patients also voice concerns about physician professionalism, integrityand the ability to deliver compassionate care. With the help of the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey (HFNJ), New Jersey Medical School will become the first school in the nation to establish a center dedicated to thehumanistic practice of medicine. The goal of the Healthcare Foundation of New JerseyCenter for the Humanistic Practice of Medicine is to support the education of medical students dedicated to providing culturally competent, compassionate and humanistic care toNew Jersey's increasingly diverse patient population. HFNJ has awarded $3.2 million to NJMS to establish the center and a scholarship program; it is the largest grant ever awarded by the foundation. A $2 million endowmentwill be created to sustain the center's growth and development. Faculty associated with thecenter will develop a wide range of learning opportunities for all residents and medical students affiliated with NJMS. Learning opportunities will explore behaviors, attitudes andapproaches to patient care, colleagues and the practice of medicine. 33 NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTcontinued on page 34The remaining $1.2 million will be awarded over four years to create the HFNJ Scholar Program. In addition to providing scholarship funds to 10 students, theunique program will offer recipients a variety of ongoing enrichment and leadershipdevelopment programs involving seminars, preceptorships, one-on-one mentoring,original research and community service projects. To further supplement the scholars program in future years, NJMS will match the $1.2 million gift. Promoting Scholarship This year, NJMS alumni and other friends of the school and UMDNJ were quick to support a new endowed scholarship program to benefit students. By making a gift of $25,000 or more, donors can name their scholarship, select theschool to which it will be allocated and even help determine criteria for recipients.Earned income from the endowment is awarded in perpetuity. To date, $875,000has been contributed to UMDNJ schools; $600,000 of which was designated forNJMS students. Included in that amount is a $250,000 gift made by the NJMSAlumni Association. While the reasons for giving vary, many donors express a desire to give back to the school that gave them their start. \"Supporting the NJMS scholarship programwas a natural decision because of the support that I received as a medical student tomeet my educational goals,\" notes Gerard Malanga, MD 87, associate professor ofphysical medicine and rehabilitation. \"I hope that the personal satisfaction I feel frommy achievement is duplicated for years to come by deserving medical students.\" I For more information or to find out how you can make a difference at NJMS, please visit www.umdnj.edu/foundweb or contact the Foundation at 973-972-4264.34 NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTcontinued from page 33'35 NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 2003 ANNUAL REPORTGrowing Our Campus New Cancer and Ambulatory Care Centers Take Shape n 2003, two new foundations for New Jersey Medical School's future went from blueprintsto construction. Work began on the New Jersey Medical School-University Hospital CancerCenter and the Ambulatory Care Center. On the former site of University Behavioral HealthCare (which relocated in 2002) the footings and foundation have been set for the $100 million, nine-story Cancer Center. In addition toproviding patient care and education, the center willfocus on reducing cancer incidence, mortality andmorbidity among minority populations. Connectedto University Hospital on three levels, the center willfeature welcoming clinical and treatment areas,highlighted by healing gardens and atriums. Theupper floors will house high-tech research laboratories and administrative offices. Constructionwill continue throughout 2004, with an expectedopening in late 2005. Not far from this site, steel has been erected on the six-story Ambulatory Care Center at the frontentrance of University Hospital on Bergen Street.This outpatient center, scheduled for completion bythe end of 2004, boasts 183,000 square feet ofspace for hospital clinics and faculty practices.Adam Henick, vice president of Ambulatory CareServices, notes that the center will increase outpatient care capacity by one-third, up to an estimated 400,000 visits each year. \"We will be ableto dramatically increase the number of communitymembers we serve in a beautiful, caring environ-ment,\" he says.
