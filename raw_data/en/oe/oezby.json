Our sustainability reporting in 2022 is in accordance with the GRI Standards from the Global Reporting Initiative. Standard disclosures, with a reference to external assurance in the GRI content index, have been externally assured by an independent third party. Valmet's annual reporting in 2022 consists of the Annual Review, Financial Statements, GRI Supplement, Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement. The GRI Supplement defines the scope and principles of our GRI reporting, the selected topics and the topic boundaries. The GRI content index included in the GRI supplement specifies where the information for each indicator can be found and explains any omissions in the reported data. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || valmet's sustainability reporting in 20224 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance reportvalmet | gri supplement 2022 || valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022 GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022Reporting principles Environmental data Valmet's HSE organization is responsible for collecting and reporting environmental data from Valmet's own locations. Environmental data are collected monthly and quarterly in a global environmental reporting system based on local invoice, measurements, and consumption records. Environmental data from the new Flow Control business line are reported for the first time in 2022, starting from April 1, 2022. Baselines for reduction targets were restated in 2022 to include data from recently acquired operations. We apply the financial control method outlined in the GHG Protocol \"Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\" of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Valmet assesses its Scope 1 and 2 (location- and market-based) emissions based on the GHG Protocol's \"A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\" and Scope 3 emissions based on the GHG Protocol's \"Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.\" Valmet reports data on five relevant categories (cat.) of Scope 3: cat. 1: purchased goods and services; cats. 4 and 9: upstream and downstream transportation and distribution; cat. 6: business travel; and cat. 11: use of sold products. Valmet's Sustainability team is responsible for collecting and reporting Scope 3 data, and they are collected from various systems and consolidated annually. Personnel data Valmet's Human Resources organization is responsible for collecting and reporting personnel data. The personnel and payroll data published in the financial statements are obtained in conjunction with financial reporting and are managed by Valmet's HR system specialists using a global people management system. Valmet's global people management system allows access to versatile and comparable HR data globally. Harmonized global HR reporting principles and a systematic data validation process form the basis of data quality for reporting related to our personnel. The employee data reported in our sustainability reporting for 2022 include all active Valmet employees. The gender category includes three options (Female, Male, Not Declared). In 2022, the number of individuals in the Not Declared category was not large enough to impact the overall gender figures shown in this report and is therefore not included as a separate gender column. The number of employees not included in the published data - namely, all inactive employees on leave of absence (e.g., study-leave, long-term sick leave, parental leave) - is minor and amounts to less than 1.5 percent of the total number of employees.Our reporting covers the Valmet Group unless otherwise stated. Neles, a Finnish stock-listed company, was merged into Valmet, forming a new Flow Control business line within Valmet starting from April 1, 2022. Valmet targets the reporting of complete data in all GRI indicators, including the acquired businesses from 2022 onwards. Only new supplier data from the merged businesses are excluded in 2022. In the GRI disclosures, the group sustainability reporting excludes associated companies and joint ventures. In the GRI supplement, Valmet reports three-year trend data for material indicators in the respective columns. For some indicators, the 2021 numbers are shown in brackets after the 2022 numbers. Any other deviations in the reported data is noted separately. Economic data In our group financial reporting, we follow the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Figures describing economic responsibility are mainly based on the financial statements. The data on purchases by country have been collected separately from the reporting units, and the country division is determined based on the supplier's domicile. The data on support for non-profit organizations are collected annually from the relevant Valmet units. Health and safety data Valmet's Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization is responsible for collecting and reporting occupational health and safety data. Harmonized global HSE reporting principles and a systematic data validation process form the basis of data quality for our HSE reporting. Health and safety data from the new Flow Control business line are reported for the first time in 2022, starting from April 1, 2022. Injury data are reported continuously by all employees in a global HSE event management system. The data are consolidated and analyzed in accordance with the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology. This methodology is based on the code of practice of the International Labour Organization (ILO) \"Recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases.\" valmet | gri supplement 2022 || reporting principles5 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance reportvalmet | gri supplement 2022 || reporting principles Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022 GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022GRI STANDARD DISCLOSURE LOCATION COMMENTSOMISSIONS ASSURANCEREQUIREMENT(S) OMITTED REASON EXPLANATION GENERAL DISCLOSURES GRI 2: General Disclosures 20212-1 Organizational details AR 10 FS 38, 89-90 Valmet Oyj is a public company, and its shares are listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki.

With our own employees, we conduct annual review discussions and mid-year review discussions at which we emphasize open and active dialogue. We also conduct regular engagement surveys to measure how engaged we are as a company. The survey gives everyone at Valmet the opportunity to be part of the discussion and influence how we move the Company forward. The survey is run every second year, and the results are used to develop the Company over a two-year period. We meet our suppliers regularly. During 2022, Valmet arranged the fourth Global Valmet Supplier Day as a virtual event live-streamed three times to four different continents: Asia, Europe and the Americas. The event's discussion topics focused on three main themes: Building the future together; Moving forward to a carbon-neutral future; and Enabling Supplier innovation. The Valmet Supplier Day was also held in Pune, India as an onsite event for suppliers in India. This year's theme was \"Sustainable Sourcing Development and Opportunities from Asia Pacific Supplies,\" emphasizing the fact that by working with our suppliers, all parties can excel. To ensure good supplier performance management, the Supplier Lean Improvement Program (Lean@supplier) is used as an improvement strategy for supplier relationship management. Valmet also launched an e-learning video for our suppliers to learn more about Valmet's Climate Program. A promotional video to communicate how suppliers can share ideas and innovations with Valmet via our continuous improvement channel was launched. During 2022, Valmet arranged three Supplier HSE Day events in China. The Supplier HSE Day is a program to drive the sharing of good HSE practices with Valmet's key suppliers. It also supports us in achieving the common goal of zero harm in our suppliers' workshops. In 2022, Valmet continued the implementation of the Supplier Sustainability Engagement Program for selected key suppliers globally, in addition to auditing and assessing suppliers regularly. Valmet also launched a new R&D and innovation program called Beyond Circularity, which improves Valmet's readiness to support the green transition in Valmet's customer industries based on the company's technology vision 2030. To support Valmet in achieving these ambitious project aims, Valmet will start building an ecosystem that aims to attract suppliers, universities, research institutes, startups, and customers to participate in making the green transition a reality within the pulp and paper industry. This ecosystem is expected to have more than 100 partners in 2025. Valmet engages shareholders, investors, and analysts in dialogue to ensure that the markets have correct and sufficient information for determining the value of Valmet shares. The financial community's interest in sustainability issues and responsible (ESG) investing continued to increase in 2022. In particular, there was increasing interest in sustainable finance, including reporting related to EU taxonomy and TCFD recommendations. In 2022, we organized a record amount of meetings with our financial stakeholders by introducing our role and progress in the transition to a carbon neutral economy and continued to develop our ESG equity story. The dialogue includes financial statements, interim reviews, the company website, stock exchange releases, press releases, investor meetings, seminars, webcasts, results news conferences, site visits and general meetings. Valmet is also active on social media, for example, on Twitter and LinkedIn, and publishes videos for the investor community. In 2022, Valmet's IR team organized 32 roadshow days and engaged with investors and analysts approximately 300 times through different channels such as conference calls, roadshows, and in-person meetings. Valmet meets with various media representatives through regular meetings and interviews and direct contact at fairs, seminars, and other events. Valmet shares timely information about its operations through press and trade releases, the company website, several publications, and social media channels. In research and development, Valmet collaborates closely with its customers to collect information on their product development needs and to innovate new solutions. We also engage in dialogue with research institutes, as well as universities and vocational schools through joint development projects and specific industry organizations. Continuous improvement through active feedback gathering In addition to the feedback gathered through regular business relationships and other forms of stakeholder dialogue, Valmet actively collects feedback from its stakeholders through specific surveys. For instance, suppliers, investors and customers are systematically asked for feedback at various events. Valmet has an external reporting portal for its stakeholders for collecting feedback on and managing events related to health, safety, environment (HSE) and continuous improvement (CI) in all Valmet operations. The tool is also used to collect innovation ideas for R&D purposes. It is also used by Valmet's own employees. For example, in 2022, we continued collecting ideas regarding the Climate Program and how to reduce CO emissions in our own operations, in the supply chain or during the use phase of our technologies. Internally, we use employee surveys to collect feedback. We also participate in externally conducted surveys assessing Valmet's reputation. In addition, we ask for regular feedback from our customers regarding how Valmet is perceived in the market, how its products and services meet customer needs and expectations, the role sustainability plays in customer perception and expectations, and how Valmet can improve its customer relationships. By reporting to selected third-party sustainability ratings and assessments, Valmet seeks to help its stakeholders assess its sustainability performance. The rankings also serve as a management tool in helping to continuously raise our sustainability performance and define areas for improvement. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on general disclosures18 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022Collective bargaining agreements (GRI 2-30) Valmet supports its employees' right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. We recognize and actively engage with employee representation bodies such as the European Works Council, which has representatives from Valmet countries in the European Union. Working conditions are determined by the employer (Valmet) for employees who are not part of a collective agreement. When determining working conditions, Valmet is committed to ensuring we meet or exceed all compliance obligations. Compliance with applicable local laws and regulations is the foundation for all operations. Overall, 65 percent of Valmet employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Participation in collective bargaining agreements varies significantly between regions, with the highest participation in EMEA (85%), South America (82%), and China (57%), and the lowest in North America (7%) and Asia-Pacific (2%). This reflects common practice in these regions. Disclosures on material topics (GRI 3-1, GRI 3-2, GRI 3-3) In accordance with the GRI 1: Foundation standard, the principles for defining report content were applied in determining material topics. The process was initially conducted in 2013 and updated in 2018 and in 2021 as part of Valmet's Sustainability360\u00ba Agenda renewal. The renewal process started with an analysis of the business environment, benchmarks and peer reviews, industry and corporate sustainability trends, market drivers, future regulatory requirements, and engagement with relevant stakeholders and experts to understand their expectations. On this basis, we identified Valmet's actual and potential negative and positive impacts on the economy, the environment, and people across our value chain, both in the short and longer term. The topics were then assessed on the basis of their significance to Valmet and its stakeholders at an internal workshop with key experts and management. As a result of the process, we defined three sustainability focus areas (ESG) covering the most material sustainability topics for Valmet. The material topics were approved by Valmet's Executive Team. The list of material topics can be found on the GRI content index in this report on pages 9-13 . Management of material topics Sustainability is an integral part of Valmet's strategy process and related Must-Wins. It is integrated in our processes through our Sustainability360\u00ba Agenda. The Agenda takes a comprehensive approach to sustainability across Valmet's value chain covering the supply chain, Valmet's own operations, and the use phase of Valmet's technologies. The agenda is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement's 1.5-degree pathway and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and it is executed through concrete annual action plans. The material topics included in Valmet's 2022 reporting are based on the process described in GRI 3-1 above and create the basis for Valmet's Sustainability360\u00ba Agenda, which was initially defined in 2014 and updated every three years, with the latest renewal in 2022. The agenda is based on the assessment and evaluation of the topics that are most material to the company's business and stakeholders within Valmet's value chain. The nine main material topics of the agenda are grouped around three focus areas: Environment, Social and Governance. For all the material topics, Valmet has defined targets, actions and KPIs, and they are integrated into Valmet's strategic process and annual planning. The topics and indicators related to each focus area are presented in the following tables, which also define the topic boundaries. More information about each focus area and specific actions, targets and achievements can be found in the sustainability sections of the Annual Review (AR 43-65 ). Valmet ties selected sustainability topics such as health and safety and sustainable supply chain KPIs to remuneration. Safety targets are part of team performance targets in bonus plans for the majority of employees and management. Individual performance targets may also include targets for emissions reductions or other sustainability-related topics. In the supply chain functions, Sustainable supply chain targets are used as performance targets or bonus targets for selected groups. The progress of actions related to Valmet's Sustainability360\u00ba Agenda and its related Climate Program is used as a strategic target for Valmet's Executive Team in the company's long-term share-based incentive plan for the performance period 2022-2024. The management approach for the selected material topics is described in more detail in the following tables. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on general disclosures19 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022ENVIRONMENTAL Management approachWe are committed to protecting the environment everywhere we operate. Based on life cycle analysis (LCA) and market data on the customer use phase of Valmet's technology, we estimate that around one percent of the environmental impact of Valmet's entire value chain is from our own locations, and four percent from our supply chain. Most of Valmet's value chain's environmental impact originates from the customer use of its technologies (not applicable to pulp mills). The main aspects are direct and indirect energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions, material consumption, water use, waste production, emissions into the air, discharges of effluent, the use of hazardous substances and noise. Our approach aims to ensure that appropriate management systems, competence and behaviors are in place to protect the environment and promote circularity, climate change mitigation and environmental efficiency across the value chain. Everyone is expected to take responsibility for environmental management as defined in the Code of Conduct, HSE Policy and Sustainable Supply Chain Policy. Compliance with regulatory obligations, internal standards and customer requirements is the basis for all operations and supplier partnerships. We integrate sound environmental management practices in all aspects of our business and promote best practice with our customers, suppliers and partners. We ensure worker participation and engage other interested parties in active and collaborative dialogue toward environmental goals. We have a continuous improvement approach and work proactively through strategic objectives and targets that are cascaded into annual plans for location-based environmental improvement programs, sustainable supplier engagement to minimize impacts, as well as for developing the environmental benefits of our product and service offering. In addition, we monitor and openly communicate our environmental performance to enable the continuous development of our approach. We strive in our locations and supply chain for efficient use of resources, renewable fuels and carbon neutral energy, and to minimize waste and prevent pollution. We design and supply sustainable products and services that help our customers improve their energy, environmental and safety performance and promote the circular economy. We have implemented sustainability guidelines and practices into research and development, product design and engineering. We actively promote the environmental benefits of Valmet's offering to increase awareness among customers, and we educate and encourage our customers to use the products they purchase from us in environmentally responsible ways. We then offer our customers product life cycle support that ensures the best long-term environmental performance. We encourage all our personnel to participate in innovation and finding ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products and services. The aim of our research and development work is to create new technologies, products and services that address customer needs and help respond to climate change, circularity and efficiency needs. Valmet aims to enable fully carbon neutral production for its pulp and paper customers by 2030. Our focus: Enhancing circularity and environmental efficiency, as well as reducing CO2 emissions by setting ambitious 2030 targets and concrete roadmaps to extend them across the value chain. Enabling our customers to apply circularity through longer circulation, closed cycles, and the use of renewable and recycled raw materials. Continuously enhancing environmental efficiency in our own operations. In 2022, we invested EUR 24.7 million in environmental management and improvements. Supporting and developing our sustainable supply chain by securing environmental management practices, engaging in improvement actions and supporting supplier innovation.

Key performance indicators and targets are set for specific governance material topics: See the FS page 15 and AR on pages 43, 62 and 64-65. Evaluation of management approachThe management approach is monitored continuously as part of our operations and processes. We continuously assess the impact of our processes and tools. Valmet measures the effectiveness of its Ethics and Compliance Program through regular reporting on taken actions and targeted auditing. We have a process in place for supplier sustainability risk management that enables the assessment of suppliers by the potential negative indirect impacts and risks related to human rights, labor practices, ethical business practices, environmental performance, and health and safety. Based on the supplier sustainability risk assessment, we may request that our suppliers self-assess their sustainability performance and management. We also conduct supplier sustainability audits with an independent third party to ensure suppliers' compliance with Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy requirements. We evaluate the management approach with external performance ratings such as Dow Jones Sustainability Index inclusion, the CDP Climate ranking and the EcoVadis score. Boundaries Own operations: All Valmet functions and employees work in compliance with our Code of Conduct to ethically create added value for our broad stakeholder base globally. Valmet's Supply Chain organization manages purchases and is responsible for ensuring that all purchasing is done sustainably and cost-effectively. Upstream and downstream value chain: Valmet has truly global operations in more than 40 countries and a broad stakeholder base in all market areas. For example, we provide added value to our stakeholders in the form of dividends, jobs and business opportunities. The biggest countries in terms of net sales are China, the USA, Finland, Brazil and Sweden, and in terms of income taxes, Finland, Brazil, China, the USA and Sweden. Valmet purchases components, products, materials, and services from some 30,000 active suppliers in around 60 countries. Special attention is paid to assessing business ethics and legal compliance, human and labor rights, health and safety, and environmental issues in risk countries. Valmet's strategic target is to increase procurement close to customer projects and its own operations. All indirect purchases supporting Valmet's operations are procured locally. The ten largest countries in terms of purchases (EUR million) are Finland, China, Sweden, the USA, Germany, Brazil, India, Poland, Canada and Italy. China, India, Indonesia and Thailand are defined as having greater potential for negative social and enviromental impacts than the other countries from which Valmet purchases goods and services. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on general disclosures25 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022Information on specific standard disclosures This section provides information on the specific standard disclosures which are not reported in the Annual Review or the GRI content index. Operations assessed for risks related to corruption (GRI 205-1) Group-level risk assessments cover all Valmet's operations. One tool for risk assessments is the FRIME audits, which cover five key units annually and account for about 80 percent of Valmet's turnover within a five-year evaluation cycle. Corruption risks are assessed as part of compliance and crime-related risks, e.g., fraud and misconduct, in the FRIME audits and in Valmet's annual Group-level risk assessment process, including internal audits. In 2022, nine internal audits were conducted at Valmet's locations, including evaluating the effectiveness of anti-corruption and misconduct measures. The most significant corruption risks relate to financial impacts and reputation. Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures (GRI 205-2) Valmet has zero-tolerance of all forms of bribery and corruption. Valmet is committed to conducting our activities in accordance with applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws. Valmet's approach to anti-corruption is based on the Code of Conduct and related Anti-Corruption Policy, which clearly prohibits bribery and corruption. Valmet's Anti-Corruption Policy contains the guidelines, standards and procedures that ensure that all Valmet employees and those acting on our behalf understand and comply with applicable anti-corruption laws in all our business operations.Compliance with the Code of Conduct as an integral part of the employment relationships and the onboarding program is the personal responsibility of each Valmet employee. Corporate Legal, Internal Audit and the Ethics and Compliance functions regularly conduct training sessions and audits. General Managers are responsible for the compliance of their companies with applicable laws, internal regulations, including the Code of Conduct, and for the information and training of their staff. All Valmeteers need to complete a mandatory training session on the Code of Conduct, which includes anti-corruption measures. In addition, we have a specific Valmet Anti-bribery Compliance e-learning course available. Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken (GRI 205-3) In 2022, Valmet concluded investigations on two confirmed incidents of corruption. They were both incidents of minor monetary value, and no evidence was found in either case of repeated practice. Valmet has a formal disciplinary procedure for employees who breach Valmet's Code of Conduct or other policies. Individuals who are found to have violated Valmet's Code of Conduct and/or our policies receive appropriate disciplinary action, which may include the termination of their employment. One of the cases occurred in a company before it was under Valmet's ownership. Valmet could not issue consequences for the incident because the employee involved was no longer working for the company. In the other case, two employees were disciplined for the incident in accordance with Valmet's disciplinary procedure. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on specific standard disclosures26 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022GRI 302-1: Fuel consumption TJ 2022 2021 2020 Renewable fuels 0 0 0 Non-renewable fuels 351 370 331 Total 351 370 331GRI 302-1: Total energy consumption TJ 2022 2021 2020 Total 1,519 1,524 1,362 GRI 302-1: Energy by source TJ 2022 2021 2020 Electricity 871 833 799 Electricity, renewable3176 District heating, total 274 301 223 District heating, renewable3127 Steam 22 20 9 Total 1,168 1,154 1,031 GRI 302-1: Energy sold TJ 2022 2021 2020 Electricity 9 9 10 Heating 3 3 0 Total 12 12 10GRI 302-3: Energy intensity TJ 2022 2021 2020 TJ/EUR Million Net sales 0.30 0.39 0.36 1 Consumption is reported based on local invoicing.

We design and develop all our technologies for water efficiency. Water efficiency is a key design and performance parameter for our pulp, paper and bio-industry customers, and we engage actively with them to minimize their water impacts. Our own operations account for less than 1 percent of the total environmental impact of the value chain. Within our own operations, significant amounts of water are used for cooling in our foundry operations and as process water in our pilot machines at our Nordic R&D centers. We have targets for reducing the overall consumption of water in our operations. Environmental impact assessments are completed when establishing new operations and when planning significant changes in existing operations to ensure that water impacts are considered and mitigated. All our new service workshops are located inside managed industrial estates. Valmet follows local discharge permits and requirements. Valmet's water withdrawal from areas with water stress is small. Based on an analysis using the WWF Water Risk Filter 2021 our workshops or supply centers in Changzhou, Jiaxing, Tianjin, Waigaoqiao, Xian and Zibo (China); (Germany) and Jelenia Gora (Poland) are in geographical areas with a high basin physical risk. In basins with a very high risk, we do not have any workshops or production facilities. One small office in Gurugram (India) is in a geographical area with a very high basin physical risk. The remaining 4 percent of our water impact is from the supply chain, and Valmet has a systematic process for engaging with key suppliers to improve their sustainability practices, including environmental and water management.

There is no water withdrawal from areas of water stress. Valmet merged with Neles on April 1, 2022. The data from the new Flow Control business line are included in the 2022 data from the merger date. 2 Third-party water includes municipal water use and other third-party water. Municipal and other water utilities are reported by each unit based on invoicing. 3 Surface water includes also rainwater. Surface water consumption is in some cases estimated based on pump capacity. The 2021 surface water figure were restated due to minor corrections concerning the surface water data in two Valmet locations and rainwater data in one Valmet location. The restated figure is less than one percent lower than previously reported. 4 Ground water data is based on local records and methodologies. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on specific standard disclosures28 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022Greenhouse gas emissions (GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-3, GRI 305-4) GRI 305-1 and GRI 305-2: Greenhouse gas emissions 1 2)1 1,000 tCO2 2022 2021 2020 Baseline1 1,000 tCO2 e 2022 2021 2020 Category 1: CO2 emissions from purchased goods and services72,237 1,656 1,694 Category 4: CO2 emissions from upstream transportation and distribution845 41 40 Category 6: CO2 emissions from business travel937 18 15 Category 9: CO2 emissions from downstream transportation and distribution8, 1075 71 69 Category 11: CO2 emissions from use of sold products1173,951 70,971 54,141 6 The specific emission factors used in calculating the greenhouse gas emissions are based on databases and publicly available sources using monetary values and technical data from Valmet's monitoring and reporting tools. 7 The analysis is based on the monetary value of purchased goods and services by category and supplier country. The emission flows have been calculated based on environmentally extended input output analysis and emission factors from Exiobase (www.exiobase.eu). The data include direct purchase order amount, excluding personnel, facilities, marketing and communications, office IT, professional services, Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO), travel, transportation, and taxes and charges related indirect spend. Travel and transportation related emissions are covered in Scope 3 category 4, 6 and 9 figures. The direct purchase order amount data used in the calculation cover approximately 73 percent (2021: 80%) of Valmet's total external purchase spend. The 2020 and 2021 figures have been restated due to updated emission factors and improved data accuracy. The restated figures are approximately 40 percent less for 2021 and 16 percent less for 2020 than previously reported. 8 The analysis of upstream and downstream transportation and distribution emissions is based on suppliers' CO 2 emission reports, and when not available, the monetary value of purchased transportation services following the same calculation methodology as for category 1 emissions. Suppliers' CO 2 reports cover around 30 percent of reported emissions in 2022. The calculated transportation modes include air, rail, ocean and road transportation. Data from the new Flow Control business line are excluded from the 2022 reporting. The 2021 and 2020 data has been restated due to the spend and emission allocation methodology change for the upstream and downstream transportation. The upstream transportation is estimated to be around 40 percent of the total transporation emissions. The remaining 60 percent is allocated to downstream transportation. The restated figures are around 30 percent less for upstream and 360 percent more for downstream than previously reported, but the total of upstream and downstream transportation emissions remained on the same level as previously reported. 9 The analysis of business travel emissions is based on emission, mileage and spend data from travel agencies and internal systems. Travel agencies' CO 2 reports cover around 40 percent of reported emissions. The calculation includes air and rail travel, rented cars, compensated mileages and hotel nights. The data used covers 97 percent (2021: 99%) of Valmet's global workforce, including the new Flow Control business line from the merger date. The 2020 figure has been restated due to error in the calculation, the restated figure is 17 percent less than previously reported. 10 The emissions from downstream transportation and distribution are based on an estimated volume of downstream transportation services. The distribution of transportation modes and emission intensity from upstream transportations has been applied for downstream transportations. The upstream transportation is estimated to be around 60 percent of the total transporation emissions paid by Valmet. The downstream transportation and distribution emissions figure is also including the transportations paid by Valmet's customers, which has been estimated to be 10 percent (2021: 15%) of Valmet's total transportation spend. 11 The data include Valmet's entire sold paper, board and tissue production lines, fossil-fired fluidizer bed boilers and lime kilns, during their expected lifetime (25 years). The CO 2 calculation is based on Valmet's average product-specific energy consumption and product specifications, including delivered capacity and intended fuel mix. N2O and CH4 included from biomass combustion in pulp and energy production. CO 2 emissions from electricity are calculated based on the IEA (2020) country-specific emission factors. CO 2 emissions from steam are calculated based on Fisher International installed base fuel mix data. Emission factors for fuels are based on IPCC, Defra and Statistics Finland. The IEA Scenario for current policies (STEPS) power sector emission intensity reduction (CAGR) is utilized in projecting the lifetime emissions for electricity and steam. Quantifying and projecting the future emissions from use of sold products involves many assumptions, and the actual emissions from the use of sold products largely depend on the choices our customers make. For these reasons, the figure reported is an estimate to understand the magnitude of category 11 lifetime emissions, which represents more than 95 percent of Valmet's value chain emissions. The included paper, board and tissue machines represent 71 percent of Paper (PAP) business line's total orders received in 2020-2022, excluding basic machine unit assembly groups and smaller equipment deliveries. The fossil-fired boilers and lime kilns represent 24 percent of Pulp and Energy (P&E) business line's 2020-2022 orders received. The remaining 76 percent of P&E's orders received is assumed to be carbon neutral (incl. bioenergy self-sufficient pulp mills and biomass-fired boilers). The share of total orders received is calculated based on a three-year average (2020-2022) to balance the annual differences between project revenue realizations. The data used cover 86 percent of Valmet's three-year average of total PAP and P&E orders received. The annual fossil emissions of the sold products were around 3,500,000 tCO 2e, whereas biogenic emissions were around 5,400,000 tCO 2e in 2022. Data has been restated for 2020 and 2021 due to data accuracy improvement and an error in the calculation. The restated figures are 9 percent and 30 percent less than previously reported, respectively. Valmet's Services, Automation Systems and new Flow Control business line products are excluded from the calculation as their impact to the total use phase CO 2 emissions are insignificant comparing to Paper and Pulp and Energy business line products. GRI 305-4: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity (Scope 1 and 2)5 2022 2021 0.026 0.028 0.029 1 Only CO 2 is included in the calculation. The amount of Biogenic Scope 1 emissions is 1.9 percent of total Scope 1 emissions in 2022. Baseline 2019 and net sales for emissions intensity for this baseline are calculated based on Valmet's and Neles' emissions and net sales data from 2019 and emissions and net sales from acquisitions from 2019-2021: 21,500 tCO 2 (Scope 1) and 108,900 tCO 2 (Scope 2, market-based), net sales EUR 4,510 Million. The methodology used to calculate emissions is the direct measurement of energy sources consumed based on invoicing at the location level and conversion to CO 2 emissions. Valmet merged with Neles on April 1, 2022. Data from the new Flow Control business line is included in the 2022 data from the merger date. 2 Scope 1 emissions are based on default CO 2 conversion factors for combustion from the \"2006 ICPP Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 2 Energy\". Supplier specific CO 2 conversion factors were applied to natural gas consumption in Horgau, Germany and to biofuel consumption in Sundsvall, Sweden. 3 Location-based CO 2 emission factors are based on 2018 emissions as given by \"the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2020) Emission Factors.\" 4 The following emissions factors have been applied to the 2019 data: ''eGRID 2019 Subregion GHG Output Emission Rates'' (United States Environmental Protection Agency), ''China eGRID 2019 Emission Output Rates'' (Clean Development Mechanism China), ''CO 2 emission factors of the National Interconnected System of Brazil'' for 2019 (Brazilian Technology and Science Ministry) and ''European Residual Mixes 2019'' (Association of Issuing Bodies). The following emissions factors have been applied to the 2020 and 2021 data: ''eGRID 2019 Subregion GHG Output Emission Rates'' (United Environmental Protection Agency), ''China eGRID 2019 Emission Output Rates'' (Clean Development Mechanism China), ''CO 2 emission factors of the National Interconnected System of Brazil'' for 2020 (Brazilian Technology and Science Ministry), ''European Residual Mixes 2020'' (Association of Issuing Bodies) for electricity in Europe and \"International Energy Agency (IEA) (2020) Emission Factors\" for district heating in Europe. The following CO 2 conversion factors have been applied to the 2022 data: ''eGRID 2020 Subregion GHG Output Emission Environmental Protection Agency), ''China 2022 Emission factors'' (China Ministry of Ecology and Environment) for China (excluding Shanghai area), \"China Shanghai 2022 Emission factors\" (China Shanghai Ecological Environment Bureau) for China Shanghai area, ''CO 2 emission factors for Brazil'' for 2022 (Brazilian Science, Technology and Innovation ministry), \"Annual average CO 2 factors\" for 2022 (Chile Energia Abierta - National energy commission) for Chile, ''European Residual Mixes 2021'' (Association of Issuing Bodies) for electricity and steam in Europe and \"International Energy Agency (IEA) (2020) Emission Factors\" for district heating in Europe. Supplier-specific CO 2 conversion factors were applied for electricity consumption in Canada; France; Indonesia; Lenox, the USA; Swiecie, Poland; and hydro-based electricity in Jiading, China, as well as for carbon neutral district heating in Finland and in Swiecie, Poland and solar energy consumption in Brazil, China and Finland. Contract-based specific CO 2 conversion factors were applied for carbon neutral electricity in Scandinavia which is purchased with guarantees of origin. Location-based factors were applied in India, Saudi-Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand. 5 Emissions intensity ratio includes direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2, market-based) CO 2 emissions per EUR Million Net sales. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on specific standard disclosures29 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022NOX, SOX, and other significant air emissions (GRI 305-7)1 GRI 305-7: NOX, SOX, and other significant air emissions t 2022 2021 2020 Hazardous air pollutants (HAP) 4.6 1.8 1.7 NOX 16.0 20.5 12.7 Particulate Matter (PM) 20.1 12.5 9.7 SOX 2.1 2.1 0.7 Volatile organic compounds (VOC) 60.7 58.9 73.7 Other standard categories 4.3 4.1 0.7 1 Significant air emissions are defined as those listed in environmental permits of local operations.

We design and develop all our technologies to support circular material flows and minimize waste amounts. Valmet's process technologies, automation and services enable the circular economy for our customers. For example: Our solutions improve energy, water and raw material efficiency in customer processes. Our solutions for biobased products decrease the need for non-renewable materials and enable cascaded use across industries. Our technologies for onsite recovery of energy and chemicals allow materials to circulate longer and reduce the need for virgin materials. Our energy technologies reduce the need for non-renewable fuels and the amount of waste. Modular machine design and smart engineering enable the use of the same equipment for new uses. Our services support well-planned maintenance and partial replacements, and rebuild solutions significantly prolong our equipment lifetime. We have take-back programs for products like refiner segments and are actively developing other programs. Our products contain mainly recyclable materials. Read more about our technologies in our Annual Review on page 35. About one percent of our environmental impact, including waste, is from our own operations. We invest continuously in process efficiency improvements, and we implement the waste management hierarchy in all facilities with a focus on eliminating landfill waste and reducing hazardous waste amounts. We partner with certified waste handlers in waste disposal. The remaining four percent of our waste impact is from the supply chain, and Valmet has a systematic process for engaging with key suppliers to adopt circularity measures, identify opportunities for waste prevention and improve their waste management practices.

Since Valmet's solutions are complex in nature, their environmental impacts such as energy, water, raw material and chemical use, as well as the amount of emissions, depend on the project specifications. The actual impact of the technologies also depends on factors such as how they are operated and the selection of raw materials. The following examples demonstrate actions concerning the mitigation of the environmental impact of Valmet's products and services. Chip to Board Valmet's holistic Chip to Board approach for linerboard producers enables sustainable packaging with lower wood and power consumption and a decreased carbon footprint - both for existing and new production lines. This unique approach provides many advantages when one supplier covers everything from wood handling to final board, including mill-wide optimization and process control solutions for maximized cost competitiveness and energy efficiency across the line. Stronger pulp and stronger board are achieved through innovative chip impregnation, refining and stock preparation technologies, which reduce the need for virgin pulp and allow its replacement with recycled fibers, while preserving the strength of the board and saving energy. What is more, with advanced tools for board machines, Valmet can maximize the final strength properties of the fibers. With this combination, the basis weight and the overall carbon footprint of the linerboard can be reduced, and companies worldwide can produce linerboard that is both profitable and sustainable. Inspired by the Chip to Board concept, Valmet has started to develop a similar holistic approach for recycled boards. Stationary lime cooler Rebuilding existing technology with innovative solutions can significantly improve the environmental performance of Valmet's customers. Rebuilding existing lime coolers with stationary lime coolers is one example where great environmental benefits can be achieved. In general, compared to normal lime coolers, the stationary lime cooler has a higher cooling efficiency with a lime product temperature of less than 100 \u00b0C. Also, as there is no mechanical load on the kiln shell, rings or bearings, the lifetime is longer, with lower overall maintenance costs. Furthermore, the stationary cooler system is flexible, with high availability compared to traditional coolers. The high heat recuperation not only reduces fuel consumption-related emissions, it can also enable higher capacity in the kiln. With this solution, fuel consumption in the lime kiln can be reduced by 35 percent or more. Upgrading coolers in existing mid-size to large lime kilns with a stationary cooler provides opportunities to reduce fuel consumption, increase availability, improve operational flexibility, and respond to stricter environmental regulations.

Process controls and measurements in pulp mill recovery islands The pulp mill recovery island plays a major role in maximizing biobased heat recovery and the energy efficiency of the pulp mill. Especially in market pulp mills, the recovery boiler can produce more energy than the pulp mill needs for its own operations. This energy can be sold to the grid as green biobased electricity. Valmet's advanced process control (APC) solution can increase the heat recovery per ton of pulp by maximizing black liquor dry solids content and heat recovery in the recovery boiler and by minimizing the inorganic dead load in the liquor circulation. The lime kiln is still often the most significant fossil fuel consumer in older pulp mills, and by maximizing the energy efficiency of the lime kiln, direct CO2 reductions can be achieved. In modern pulp mills, the lime kiln is combined with the biomass gasification process, in which the flame profile measurement from Valmet's camera systems plays an essential role in ensuring high reburned lime quality and continuous production efficiency. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on specific standard disclosures33 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022New employee hires and employee turnover (GRI 401-1) NEW HIRES1 GRI 401-1: Total number and rate of new employee hires by age New hires New hires, % Under 30 624 (501) 31.4 (32.9) 30-50 1,085 (839) 54.5 (55.1) Over 50 281 (184) 14.1 (12.1) Total 1,990 (1,524) 100 (100) GRI 401-1: Total number and rate of new employee hires by gender New hires New hires, % Female 447 (366) 22.5 (24.0) Male 1,543 (1,158) 77.5 (1,524) 100 (100) GRI 401-1: Total number and rate of new employee hires by region New hires New hires, % North America 294 (172) 14.8 (11.3) South America 196 (171) 9.8 (11.2) EMEA 1,062 (883) 53.4 (57.9) China 243 (196) 12.2 (12.9) Asia-Pacific 195 (102) 9.8 (6.7) Total 1,990 (1,524) 100 (100) 1 New hires calculation: (new hires per category/total number of new hires in 2022) *100.

The duty to conduct risk assessments of the HSE hazards and aspects of work activities is satisfied by applying a multi-layered risk assessment methodology, including: Location-specific HSE risk registers Job-specific risk assessments and safe operating procedures Pre-task dynamic hazard assessments Chemical risk assessments Risk and opportunity assessments in sales and delivery projects, including HSE aspects HSE risk assessment of change in operations (such as a new organization, new plant, new/rebuilt facilities, new processes). HSE impacts and risks are managed until they are eliminated, reduced or controlled (based on the hierarchy of controls) to the point of being acceptable through the implementation of safe work systems before any work activities commence. Workers participate in and are informed about the HSE risk and impact management related to their work. HSE risk assessments are reviewed periodically, with an emphasis on ensuring the effectiveness of critical controls, and always in the event of significant changes, as well as after injuries and serious near misses have occurred. Everyone working for Valmet or in a workplace controlled by Valmet is responsible for reporting all incidents, as well as observations of hazards and hazardous situations, without delay to their manager and our global reporting system. This reporting triggers various activities within Valmet to ensure good incident management. Managers are responsible for incident investigations, including root cause analysis and corrective actions, all of which are documented in the reporting system. Workers and their representatives participate in and support the investigation and corrective actions. HSE alerts are produced for all recordable and high-potential near misses and are shared globally as part of monthly reporting. Managers and workers are trained in how to perform risk assessments, incident reporting and investigations. All workers have the right to refuse unsafe work and should inform their manager or site contact immediately of all concerns. Valmet's HSE function ensures the quality of hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation processes, and that improvements and lessons are shared globally.Occupational health services (GRI 403-3 (2018)) Valmet ensures employees' access to qualified occupational health services through country-based approaches that also comply with local legal requirements and provide service in the local language. Information on the available occupational health services is provided to employees during their onboarding. Services are provided during work hours. In the larger production units, these services are available at the location. Valmet contractually requires that the employer of workers who are not Valmet employees ensures their access to these services. Worker participation, consultation and communication on occupational health and safety (GRI 403-4 (2018)) As stated in our HSE Policy, we facilitate the participation and consultation of our people and partners in HSE activities and practices. The backbone of our approach lies in joint management- worker safety committees in all locations with more than 30 employees. Following a global guideline, these committees meet at least once a year and more often in production locations, have elected worker representatives, establish annual budgets and action plans, and follow standard agenda items covering all aspects of the development, implementation and evaluation of the local HSE management system. In addition, we deploy a variety of other methods, including making HSE a routine meeting agenda item at team meetings, townhall events and one-on-one discussions, toolbox talk practices, management safety walk-and-talks, elected worker safety representatives, employee surveys, employee participation in risk assessments and pre-task safety discussions, HSE information on noticeboards, and intranet communications about HSE.

Its design is based on an assessment of legal, customer and industry HSE obligations, as well as HSE risks and impacts. All HSE training is provided free of charge and during paid work hours. Training effectiveness is evaluated through competence tests during the training session. We have two mandatory global training programs, both available in the main employee languages. All employees complete the General Valmet HSE induction e-learning course during their onboarding, location-specific HSE induction. This e-learning course covers Valmet's HSE Policy, rules and minimum safety standards. This e-learning course is also available for all external workers on our Partner Academy platform. All Valmet employees are also expected to participate in Safety Dialogue training as part of their onboarding. In this program, managers and employees explore attitudes, behaviors and skills to promote a positive safety culture at Valmet. Standard training material for our minimum safety standards, travel safety and other global HSE routines is also available in various languages in our learning systems. All employees and external workers are required to continuously complete relevant worksite HSE inductions. During onboarding, inductions in local languages are held for the Valmet location and the specific HSE risks, rules and routines. Valmet HSE inductions are also held for everyone entering our temporary and remote worksites in our installation projects in the main project language and in English if required. In addition, everyone working for Valmet is required to complete customer mill inductions. Role-specific HSE training requirements are defined in country- or location-based HSE training matrices reflective of local regulatory and industry requirements, as well as the Valmet minimum safety standards. These training programs are mainly provided for our employees by qualified external training service providers at the defined frequency and always in the local language. We require that all external workers are provided with relevant role-specific training meeting our requirements by their own employer. All workers are given task-specific training on safe operating procedures as required.Promotion of worker health (GRI 403-6 (2018)) Valmet implements a global approach in which locations with 30 or more employees have a social committee comprised of employees based in the location and with the purpose of hosting social events and coordinating activities that build engagement and collaboration, as well as promoting wellbeing at work. Social committees support wellbeing at work through five evidence-based action areas - connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. The social committee can be combined with the HSE committee - see GRI 403-4 on page 35. Valmet facilitates employees' access to non-medical and healthcare services through a country-based approach utilizing a mix of mechanisms such as health insurance, company clinics and financial contributions. For workers who are not employees, their employer facilitates their access to these services.

Read more about the system in the Annual Review on page 62. The GMS is audited through several Groupwide internal processes, including risk management, logistics, HSE, corporate internal audit, sustainability assurance, and internal audits of the global management system. The GMS is certified as a global multisite system by a third party according to the ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 standards, but to varying scopes of coverage - see the table below. We are continually expanding our coverage, and the target is that all production locations and at least 90 percent of all workers will be covered by the system by 2025. We have defined an expansion roadmap toward this target. Currently, the ISO 45001:2018 certification covers the main production locations and project installations.

Coverage of the occupational health and safety management system is calculated based on employee headcount, and it is assumed that this is also representative of the average coverage of external workers. 2 Data for year 2021 restated due to errors found in the data of locations Atlanta, Neenah and Pune. This resulted one percent lower coverage for ISO 9001, four percent lower coverage for ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 than previously reported.Work-related injuries (GRI 403-9 (2018))1 Based on a consolidation of local health and safety risk registers and an analysis of injuries and near misses, Valmet has identified twelve main hazards that pose a risk of high-consequence injury and defined them for each Minimum Safety Standard - as described in the management approach description (see page 22). These standards are designed to ensure the hierarchy of controls is implemented in all operations to eliminate hazards and minimize risks. Valmet's operations continuously implement injury prevention actions as part of annual improvement plans. In 2022, there were seven high-consequence injuries and two fatal injuries related to working at heights and the use of tools, equipment and machines during work tasks (read more in our Annual Review on page 56). All injuries are investigated, and improvement actions are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of child, forced and compulsory labor (GRI 408-1, GRI 409-1) Valmet employs more than 17,500 professionals around the world in more than 40 countries. Valmet has an extensive supplier network, including 30,000 active direct suppliers in around 60 countries with different sustainability risk levels. In compliance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Valmet has published a statement to promote its commitment to and respect for human rights. Valmet enforces the Human Rights Statement by actively assessing the fulfillment of human rights in its own operations and in its supply chain through supplier sustainability audits. In all its business relations, Valmet requires its business partners to respect all internationally recognized human rights and comply with the international principles related to human rights. Furthermore, the company's suppliers are required to comply with Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy, and the company has built a comprehensive process for ensuring compliance. The process includes suppliers' commitment to the Sustainable Supply Chain Policy, risk assessments, supplier self-assessments, and supplier sustainability audits executed with a third party. Compliance with Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy is the starting point for entering into and maintaining any kind of business relationship with Valmet. We expect all our suppliers to comply with the requirements in the policy, and we have zero tolerance of the use of forced labor or child labor. Suppliers provide Valmet with various metals-based products and components, electronics, as well as different services. According to our assessment, one third of our suppliers have an increased risk in terms of sustainability. We have assessed potential negative social rights impacts and identified Valmet's most salient risks that are connected to Valmet's operations. One of the identified potential salient risks is related to the possible use of forced and child labor. Valmet has also acknowledged that countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Mexico and Brazil, where it has both its own operations and makes purchases, are commonly identified as risk countries in terms of social impacts. Valmet has identified local communities, migrant workers, and third-party contracted labor as potentially vulnerable groups related to the salient social impacts. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on specific standard disclosures42 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022New suppliers that were screened using environmental and social criteria (GRI 308-1, GRI 414-1) Valmet screens all new direct suppliers from a sustainability risk perspective, using environmental and social criteria. The screening criteria are based on Valmet's requirements set in the Sustainable Supply Chain Policy, covering business ethics, compliance, human and labor rights, health, safety, climate and environmental management, and product compliance and safety topics. Sustainability screening is an automated and integrated feature of Valmet's supplier approval process globally. Valmet's key performance indicators related to the sustainable supply chain are integrated into the global supplier sustainability management process. In 2022, 99 percent (94%) of all new direct suppliers were automatically screened for sustainability. The remaining suppliers have been manually assessed regarding potential sustainability risk. Negative environmental and social impacts in the supply chain and actions taken (GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2) Valmet has integrated both environmental and social criteria into company policies and related processes to ensure the environment and human rights are respected and promoted throughout the value chain. Valmet has around 30,000 active direct suppliers in around 60 countries. Suppliers provide Valmet with various metals-based products and components, electronics, and different services. We have assessed that one third of our suppliers have a potential negative environmental and social impact. We have estimated that our supply chain accounts for approximately four percent of the environmental impacts of our entire value chain. Valmet strives to develop the transparency and traceability of its entire value chain from the sourcing of raw materials to the recycling of our products. Valmet has assessed potential negative social rights impacts and identified Valmet's most salient risks that are connected to Valmet's value chain. The identified potential salient risks relate to freedom of association, possible use of forced and child labor, and occupational health and safety. Valmet has identified local communities, migrant workers, and third-party contracted labor as potentially vulnerable groups related to the salient social impacts both in our own operations and in our supply chain. Through our sustainable supply chain activities, we collaborate with our suppliers and develop our products to reduce negative environmental and social impacts. In 2022, we conducted 45 supplier sustainability audits in 14 countries with a certified third-party auditor. The majority of audits took place in countries where the potential negative environmental and social impact is highest, such as China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Mexico and Brazil. The findings of these audits were mainly related to human and labor rights and environmental management. Of all corrective actions agreed with suppliers in 2022, 47 percent had been completed and verified by the end of the year. 90 percent of all actions agreed with suppliers as part of the auditing process since 2015 had been completed and verified by the end of 2022. Valmet has a social impact assessment process for assessing negative social impact in our high- risk locations. Valmet conducts social impact assessments in its own operations, carried out by an independent third party. In addition to its own employees, the assessment covers contractors working at Valmet's premises. Since 2018, Valmet has conducted four assessments globally, covering 67 percent of Valmet employees. The latest assessment was conducted in late 2022 in India. The findings of the assessment were mainly related to occupational health and safety and working conditions. We will define and implement the corrective action plan, and the corrective actions will be completed and verified during 2023. Assessment of the health and safety impacts of product and service categories (GRI 416-1) Safety is an integral part of Valmet's technologies, automation and services. The safety requirements of all Valmet's solutions are carefully reviewed and assessed in the R&D process, and must be fulfilled in each product development phase. Valmet's solutions are required to be safe to use, and they are designed to meet or exceed all applicable safety standards and regulations. To ensure safe operations, customer training is included in all project deliveries. Moreover, the majority of Valmet's operations are certified to quality, health and safety, and environmental management standards, and processes that ensure product safety are followed. In 2022, we started to strengthen the cooperation between our business lines in the area of product safety. Our target is to improve our way to operate on the Valmet level, as well as to increase the synergy between our different operations. A new Product safety management team was introduced in January 2022. The purpose of this team is to develop product safety management processes and practices, create common product safety policies, and increase communication across the business lines and area organizations. valmet | gri supplement 2022 || information on specific standard disclosures43 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022Independent Limited Assurance Report To the Annual General Meeting of Valmet Group We have been engaged by the Management of Valmet Group (hereinafter also the \"Valmet\") to perform a limited assurance engagement on selected sustainability information for the reporting period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, disclosed in selected Information presented in the Report of the Board of Directors in Valmet's Financial Statements, Annual Review and GRI Supplement 2022 (hereinafter the Selected sustainability information). Selected sustainability information The selected sustainability information within the scope of assurance covers: The economic, social and environmental sustainability indicators as identified in the GRI Content Index, which are included in the Valmet's GRI Supplement 2022. Management's responsibility The Management of Valmet is responsible for preparing the Selected sustainability information in accordance with the Reporting criteria set out in Valmet Group's internal reporting instructions described in Valmet Group's GRI Supplement 2022 and the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (collectively Reporting criteria). The Management of Valmet Group is also responsible for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Selected sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Practitioner's independence, other ethical requirements and quality control We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC) 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.Practitioner's responsibility Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Selected sustainability information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) \"Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\". This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected sustainability information is free from material misstatement. In a limited assurance engagement, the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other information in the Selected sustainability information. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Selected sustainability information. Our work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures: Interviewing senior management of the Company. Conducting five site visits in China, Sweden, Germany, Brazil and the USA. Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting the information presented in the Selected sustainability information at the group level as well as at the site level. Assessing how Group employees apply the reporting instructions and procedures of the Company. Testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on a sample basis. Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis. Considering the disclosure and presentation of the Selected sustainability information. Limited assurance conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Valmet Group's Selected sustainability information valmet | gri supplement 2022 || independent assurance report44 Valmet's sustainability reporting in 2022 Reporting principles GRI content index Information on general disclosures Information on specific standard disclosures Independent assurance report GRI SUPPLEMENT 2022for the reporting period ended 31 December 2022 is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria.

Our assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to Valmet Group's for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached.
