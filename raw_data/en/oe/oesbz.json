Any kind of cyst-like bump can cause panic ... but it helps to know that most are benign (non-cancerous) lumps called lipomas or fatty tumors. Prevention is the best way to deal with fatty tumors in dogs. The trouble is that they can surprise you, appearing almost overnight. So here's some background on lipomas and what causes them. This is important information to help prevent fatty tumors in your dog. But if you want to get started managing your dog's lipoma right away, scroll down to the section on Treatment Options For Canine Lipomas. What Are Lipomas In Dogs? Lipomas in dogs are a collection of fat cells found under the surface of the skin. They are more common in middle age to older dogs and have certain characteristics: - They range in size from small to large, sometimes growing bigger than a tennis ball. - Most appear on the chest, flanks, legs and neck. - They're soft and somewhat moveable. This movability is the key difference between a benign fatty tumor in dogs and a liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are a malignant form of fatty tissue tumors. These types of tumors don't move under the skin, and fortunately, they're rare. What Breeds Are Prone to Labrador Retriever are predisposed breeds. Common factors are dogs of larger body weight or those who are overweight. As dogs age, they're also likely to have lipomas. And neutered males and neutered females are also at a higher risk (1). Are Lipomas In Dogs Cancerous? Benign lipomas contain cancerous cells but they lack the ability to spread in the body. A malignant tumor contains cancerous cells that can spread to other areas in the body. Both types can sometimes be infiltrative lipomas, meaning they invade deep in surrounding tissue. They're also more likely to recur after they are surgically removed. The good news is that fatty tumors in dogs aren't painful unless they grow in a nerve-rich area. They really like the endocrine system, muscle tissue, and fascia. Should Lipomas Be Removed? For the vast majority, surgical removal of lipomas from your dog is unnecessary. But sometimes, invasive and giant lipomas impair your dog's movement and this can cause muscle pain. In these situations, surgery is often recommended to offer comfort and mobility. Many holistic methods help soften and dissolve lipomas. These methods stimulate the body to slowly absorb and process the contents of the lump ... which causes them to shrink and disappear. Yes, you read that correctly! You can manage lipomas holistically, especially when found early. Weekly grooming can go a long way in early detection. Before we go into how to shrink lipomas, first let's take a look at some of the reasons your dog gets them in the first place.

The cause of fatty tumors in dogs continues to baffle allopathic medicine. Many vets attribute them to random chance, age and genetics. It's true that age and genetics can contribute to the formation of canine lipomas. But there's something else that needs attention ... toxins. How Toxins Lead to Fatty Tumors The build-up of toxins is often overlooked by mainstream veterinary medicine. But from a holistic viewpoint, lipomas are a sign of body congestion. The energy that isn't flowing well becomes trapped. Toxins and fat get trapped and walled off by the body's immune system as it pushes contaminants to the outside. This is the body's attempt to protect and sustain internal organ function. Your dog's lymphatic system consists of a network of lymph ducts, nodes, and vessels. They all work together to transport lymphatic fluids to the bloodstream. The lymph system is a key player in your dog's immune function ... and it delivers nutrients to cells while removing wastes. When your dog's elimination systems get clogged, the transport system slows down. This stagnation can lead to blocked circulation causing lipomas and other chronic diseases in your dog. This build-up of wastes is sometimes referred to as a dog's \"toxic load.\" So where do these toxins come from? Your dog's everyday environment. Toxins are in: - Vaccines - Environmental contaminants like glyphosates, pesticides, and herbicides - Water contaminants like chlorine and fluoride - Heavy metals - Pharmaceuticals - Flea and tick medications - Grooming products like chemically laden shampoos Diet Is A Factor In Lipomas Another contributing factor to toxic load is diet. Everything you feed your dog either contributes to disease or fights it. The cleaner his diet, the less your dog's body needs to process it. When your dog eats, his liver, gallbladder, and pancreas decide how to react. This means they either release the enzymes needed to break down and assimilate nutrients ... or they assume the body is under attack and trigger an immune response. This leads to inflammation and slow digestive motility. When foods remain in the digestive tract for too long they aren't properly broken down. This causes toxins to build up in the digestive tract ... and the vicious cycle of stagnation leads to chronic inflammation. Can Too Much Fat Cause Lipomas In Dogs? One of the problems with fatty tumor growth in dogs is the belief that too much fat equals fatty tumor formation. This isn't true if the body is breaking down the fats. It's actually the type of fat that's the problem ... like the rancid and oxidized oils found in kibble. Some examples are rendered animal fat, vegetable oil, and GMO soy and canola oils. Sadly, you can find canola oils even in higher-end and \"all-natural\" foods. Your dog's body sees these undigested oils as attackers and the body goes into defense mode. To protect itself it creates fatty deposits and walls off fat mixed with toxins ... in the form of a lipoma. If you suspect your dog isn't breaking down his food properly, start by making these changes: - Make sure he's getting clean filtered water - Feed pre and probiotics and digestive enzymes daily. - If you're a kibble feeder, consider moving your dog to a fresh food diet. If traditional raw isn't in your realm of possibility you can try alternates such as: - Commercial raw food - Freeze-dried dog foods - Dehydrated dog foods Or you can home cook for your dog to add variety, especially if you have a senior dog. How To Prevent Lipomas In Dogs There are also some natural foods that you can add to your dog's food to help prevent lipomas. Here are some of my favorites: Healing Herbs Give a basic regimen of burdock, milk thistle, and dandelion. These can help support liver function, circulation, and elimination. Pulse these herbs by giving them for six days on, one day off. Repeat for six weeks. If this combination works for your dog, you should see the lipomas getting smaller at the end of six weeks. Green-Lipped Mussels Feed green-lipped mussel oil. It offers an excellent source of bioavailable vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. DNM RECOMMENDS: Four Leaf Rover offers Safe-Sea, a sustainable and healthy combination of New Zealand Green Lipped Mussel Oil and ahiflower oil plus astaxanthin for its benefits. [Buy Safe-Sea Now >>](https://thenaturaldogstore.com/products/four-leaf-rover-safe-sea) Antioxidants Feed antioxidants. These help the body work more efficiently and support elimination and cell health. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) You can use apple cider vinegar for dog tumors. Just add ACV to meals. It can be a powerful ally in the prevention and treatment of lipomas. It assists in liver detoxification as it stimulates circulation and energy flow. ACV works with the body's lymphatic system by cleaning out the lymph nodes. It also supports the body's elimination channels. Give ACV based on your dog's weight. 15 lbs or less ... 1 tsp daily 15 to 30 lbs ... 2 tsp daily 31 to 80 lbs ... 1 tbsp daily More than 80 lbs ... 2 tbsp daily Avoid in dogs that have trouble regulating their body heat or have a hard time cooling down. ACV can aggravate dogs that have too much heat. Treatment Options For Canine Lipomas A healthy diet as already mentioned, is an ideal preventative for lipomas and other health concerns. Here are some ways to shrink fatty tumors in dogs. Exercise For Dogs With Lipomas For any dog who's prone to forming fatty tumors, walking and fresh air are a must. That's because circulation is the key to the continuous elimination of toxins from the body. The lymphatic system doesn't have a pump like the circulatory system, the heart. Instead, it needs movement to work well. Chiropractic care, acupuncture, and acupressure help support energy flow ... and so does walking! The average American dog gets less than 15 minutes of exercise per day. That also means 15 minutes or less of breathing fresh air! One of the best things you can do for yourself and your dog to stay healthy is walking outside. Walking helps circulate energy throughout the body and keep the lymphatic system moving. As a bonus, it also stimulates motility in the digestive system. Shrink a Dog Lipoma Naturally With These 6 Herbs Along with exercise, the following herbal remedies can help the body expel toxins. They are also an effective treatment to support the liver, kidney and digestive system as well as shrink and remove fatty tumors in dogs. 1. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) And Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) These bitter herbs can help break down fats in the body by stimulating the digestive system. They're able to clear heat (inflammation) from the body ... and they decrease the stagnation of fluids and energy. Dandelion increases circulation by thinning fluids and supports the lining of the gut. It stimulates the release of bile by the gallbladder to help digest fats. Dandelion is a potent fighter of lipomas in dogs. This is due to its ability to ease the removal of toxins through the kidneys and liver. - You can add dandelions to your dog's diet or use a tincture of whole dandelion (both leaf and root). Give 1/2 drop of tincture for every pound of weight twice daily. - Chamomile makes an effective infusion (a tea steeped 20-30 minutes) added to your dog's food. Add 1 tbsp for every 30 pounds of body weight. 2. Burdock Root (Arctium lappa) Burdock supports the lymphatic system, the liver, and the kidneys. And you can combine it with milk thistle (Silybum marianum) makes a great duo. They help the body rid itself of pharmaceuticals and move heat through the liver. Burdock root helps the gall bladder release bile to support the digestion of fats. Burdock root also cools the inflammatory conditions of the liver and digestive system. - Give as a tincture, 5 drops for every 30 pounds twice a day. 3. Chickweed (Stellaria media) Chickweed moves fluids through the body. It's good for reducing inflammation and removing toxins from tissues. As a bonus, you can use chickweed internally and externally for lipomas in dogs. Caution: Chickweed is diuretic in nature. It helps export toxins through the kidneys ... especially when combined with a lymphatic stimulant like cleavers (Galium aparine). - Give as a tincture, 5 drops for every 30 pounds twice a day. 4. Self-Heal (Prunella vulgaris) This herb is often overlooked for preventing and treating tumors. Like dandelion, self-heal is common in yards and treated like a weed. It's known as a superlative lymphatic herb. It's great at moving fluids in and out of tissues downward through the kidneys. Self-heal removes heat in the liver moving stagnant fluids and improving circulation. Use self-heal internally and externally to redistribute and break up fatty tissue. - Give as a tincture. 1/2 drop of tincture for every pound of weight twice daily. - Rub a few drops of tincture into your dog's lipoma twice daily 5. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) [Turmeric](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/turmeric-dogs/) is a popular anti-inflammatory that increases blood flow with its warming nature. It improves digestion and soothes intestinal muscles. It also protects the liver and stimulates bile secretions from the gallbladder. Turmeric caution: Use cautiously with dogs that can't control their body temperature. Stop using if adding turmeric causes your dog to pant. - Give 150 mg per 30 pounds of your dog's weight twice a day. 6. Violet (Viola odorata) Violet is one of the best lipoma herbs and it's also safe for long-term use. Violets dissolve hard and soft accumulations in the body using the lymphatic system. They're cooling so they work especially well for hot conditions like fatty tumors. You can use violets internally and externally. Herbalist Juliette de Bairacli Levy uses violet leaf as a poultice ... along with an infusion of the leaf and flower to remove any type of cyst or lipoma. To Make A Violet Infusion: - Use 1 tsp for small dogs in a half-cup of water. Divide into morning and evening doses. - For medium dogs use 1 tbsp - For Large dogs use 2 tbsp Or you can use a violet tincture for dogs and give 5 drops for every 30 pounds twice a day. Note: General guidelines for using these herbal dosages is ... - Give them for six days. - Then one day off. - Repeat this cycle for six weeks. - After 6 weeks the lipomas should be shrinking. If not, consult an herbalist or holistic veterinarian. - If lipomas are smaller, take one week off and repeat six-week cycle until clear RELATED: [Top 10 herbs for natural pain relief ...](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/top-10-herbs-for-natural-pain-relief/) Easy Lipoma Salve Recipe For Dogs Here's an easy DIY recipe that you can make at home for topical lipoma support.
