The ancient Chinese practice of moxibustion, in which herbs are burned on or near the skin, has been revived as treatment for a variety of ailments. In this and many other ways, some 5,000 medicinal herbs are being used by the Chinese. American pharmacologists have been impressed by the evidence that some of these seem effective in such surprising applications as nonsurgical treatment of appendicitis, gallstones and kidney stones. To learn why at least some of these practices seem to be effective, an ambitious program has been undertaken here to identify active ingredients in the herbal concoctions. Meanwhile, the traditional practices that evolved over thousands of years, largely from trial and error rather than an understanding of disease, are being encouraged, particularly in combination with Western medicine. 'Barefoot Doctors' as Teachers \"Barefoot doctors,\" trained to take elementary health care to the populous rural areas of China, have been provided by Peking with a manual telling how to prepare traditional remedies from local plants and animals. In addition to 228 drugs derived from various plants, the prescriptions include dried earthworms for high blood pressure, dried scorpion or centipede for convulsions and tetanus, dried leech for insomnia, dried gecko lizard for asthma and the gallstones of oxen for high fever. The analytical work, however, is focusing on herbal concoctions, since Chinese trained in modern scientific methods seem as skeptical of the animal products as their Western colleagues. There are 35,000 plants native to China, and part of the effort reaches beyond the 5,000 now in medical use to seek out new ones with healing properties. According to a report published this year by a team of American chemists after a tour of Chinese laboratories, only 10 percent of the medicinal plants in use here have been examined chemically \"in any serious way.\" The delegation was headed by D. Glenn T. Seaborg of the University of California at Berkeley, Nobel laureate. As long ago as the fifth century the Chinese were treating appendicitis with herbal concoctions. Since the Great Cultural Revolution of the 1960's, they report, more than 20,000 cases have been dealt with in this manner. Plant Mixture for Appendicitis A widely used prescription for appendicitis is a mixture of components from plants of the rhubarb, magnolia, dandelion and sargentodoxa genera. As noted by American pharmacologists who have toured Chinese hospitals to assess herbal medications, relatives of some of these herbs contain substances that kill microbes. That group was headed by Dr. Louis Lasagna, chairman of the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Rochester. At the Nan Kai Hospital in Tianjin, where research is being conducted on nonsurgical treatment of acute abdominal conditions, the visitors were told that of 995 uncomplicated cases of acute appendicitis treated only with herbs, 93.6 percent had uneventful recoveries. Animal experiments are being conducted there to define the effects of the various herbs. At the Lung Hua Hospital of Traditional Medicine in Shanghai, the traditional recovery time reported for herbally treated cases was three and a half days. Out of of all appendicitis cases admitted to the hospital, 70 percent were treated herbally and 30 percent surgically. Where infection of the peritoneum developed, as after rupture of the appendix into the body cavity, antibiotics were used in the Western manner. Typical of Current Treatment Such use of Western medicine to supplement or back up the traditional mode is typical of the current treatment of disease in much of China. The experimental group at Nan Kai uses a nonsurgical approach to gallstones and kidney stones, and about twothirds of perforated ulcers are treated only with herbs and acupuncture. \"While nonsurgical treatment of some of these conditions seems strange to Western observers,\" Dr. Lasagna's group reported in 1975, \"it should be remembered that similar approaches have been utilized in such situations as appendicitis on a small ship lacking a surgeon, or perforated ulcer in U.S. soldiers during World War H.\" Another successful use of combined traditional and Western medicine was reported in The Chinese Medical Journal several months ago to treat cases in which livers had been severely damaged by viral hepatitis, often leaving the patients in comas. According to a research group at the First Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Peking, normally more than 90 percent of such cases die within month or two. The researchers used Western supportive methods, such as dripping a sugar solution and insulin into the veins, administering hormones, heparin and antibiotics, but also traditional herbal preparations (rhubarb, tricosanthis root and other plant substances). These were dripped into the veins or given by mouth. Of 53 cases, 40 survived, a remarkably low fatality rate of 24.4 percent. The American pharmacologists observed that the Western physician who ridicules the use of herbal medications \"forgets that many of our own useful drugs originated through an investigation of herbal medicines.\" Herbal Therapy and Heart Disease The treatment of heart disease by Western methods here is often overlaid with herbal therapy. A favorite drug combines a form of salvia (belonging to the mint family) with dalbergia odorifera (a pea relative). It is inserted underneath the skin in ampule form. Tests on dogs have shown that this reduces blood pressure 50 percent and increases heart output by a similar amount. The more sophisticated efforts to screen native remedies are concentrated at such centers as the Institute of Materia Medica and the Institute of Organic Chemistry in Shanghai and the Institute of Materia Medica in Peking. The Peking institute maintains a 69acre farm 20 miles outside the capital where 1,500 species of medicinal plant are grown. The screening of traditional drugs is hampered, in the view of some pharmacologists, by reluctance of the Chinese in tests on human subjects to use \"controls.\" These people are subjects with symptoms identical with those being treated but who, to provide a reference base demonstrating the drug's effect, are not given the medication. Nor do the Chinese favor placebos, the dummy pills given some patients who do not know whether or not they are receiv- ing the active drug. This helps cancel subjective reactions to treatment. Since the Chinese often believe the drug being tested is efficacious, they feel that to deny it to a patient is unethical. Another difficulty lies in the complexity of the medications. A traditional drug may contain material from eight herbs made up of hundreds of chemical compounds. Finding out which is beneficial and which is harmful is no easy task. The tests are made easier in one respect, however. Many of the drugs under scrutiny have been used for centuries without evidence of harmful effects. As early as 2700 B.C. China had a pharmacopeia listing 365 preparations. With regard to the combined use of traditional and Western medicine, the visiting pharmacologists concluded \"that patients in China seem to do as well as those in the West at the hospitals we visited.\" Furthermore they said, \"the present amalgam of Chinese and Western medicine may be as good (or better than) any other system that might be devised for the Chinese population.\" Chinese medicine strikes the Western visitor as a remarkable mixture of seemingly quaint practices, such as moxibustion, and the most sophisticated modern surgery and therapy. A Discovery by Primitive Nomads According to the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, moxibustion originated among primitive nomads in the frigid north. Warming themselves at fires, they discovered \"that applying heat to or scorching the abdominal region might relieve the symptoms of abdominal pain, distension and fullness.\" The herb most often burned is mugwort. Between it and the skin, according to ancient prescriptions, there can be a layer of garlic, ginger, scallion, leek, chives, soybean, pepper or mud (containing grubs or a toad). When modern medicine was introduced in China under Western auspices, such practices as moxibustion and acupuncture were discouraged. The Peking Union Medical College, with American support, brought the highest standards of modern medicine to China. The revival of traditional Chinese medicine clearly represents a popular return to the \"Chinese way.\" But the ultimate goal appears to be to combine the best of traditional and Western medicine. In view of the constraints on human tests, however, this is likely to be a prolonged process. "}
