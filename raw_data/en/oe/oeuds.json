The new agreement signed with St. George's, University of London (SGUL) will not only enrich the educational experience of our medical students, but will position Jefferson as an incubator for the next generation of physicians who will be well prepared to shape the way health care is designed and delivered on an international stage. About the Partnership Our academic partnership enables SGUL students to com- plete two years of preparatory work in London (required before interacting with patients) and to then attend Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University (SKMC) for years three and four, working toward a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery degree (MBBS is the equivalent of a doctor of medicine degree in North America). This \"2+2\" curriculum begins at Jefferson in July 2016 and we will initially enroll 12 SGUL students each year at SKMC. SGUL and Jefferson have also agreed to establish interna- tional elective rotations during the final clinical year of our undergraduate medical programs. These rotations will begin this May. Population Health Joint Degree Program Our two institutions are also discussing the creation of a joint degree program combining the MBBS with a master's degree in population health, which will include significant course content in international population health under the auspices of the Jefferson School of Population Health. About St. George's SGUL, founded in 1751 as St. George's Hospital, is the United Kingdom's only freestanding healthcare university with programs in medicine, nursing and a wide range of allied health professions, social and biomedical sciences. In February, Dr. Klasko announced that Jefferson received a $14 million grant from The Marcus Foundation, Inc., to establish Marcus Integrative Health at the Myrna Brind Center - Villanova. This site will be the first satellite location of the Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine at Jefferson, and represents another important step in our implementation of Jefferson's Blueprint for Strategic Action. \"We are delivering on our commitment to 'Patients and Families First' by creating patient/ provider-friendly facilities and developing innovative patient engagement processes, opportunities and technologies,\" said Stephen Klasko, MD, MBA, President and CEO, Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and Jefferson Health System. The Marcus Foundation focuses on Jewish causes, children, medical research, free enter -prise and the community, and was created by Bernard Marcus, co-founder of The Home Depot, Inc. Marcus Integrative Health at the Myrna Brind Center - Villanova will occupy 14,000+ square feet to accommodate an expanding number of our clinical experts, and will house laboratories with advanced diagnostic capabilities, a state-of-the-art infusion center and access to wellness programs and products. Jefferson's services will include holistic primary care, an integrated approach to executive health, nutrient infusion programs, novel testing procedures, acupuncture and other complementary therapies. Daniel Monti, MD, Professor and Director of the Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine at Jefferson, will also serve as the Director of the Center in Villanova. Our goal is to open the Marcus Integrative Health at the Myrna Brind Center - Villanova in the fall.Bringing Integrative Health to Our Western Suburban Neighbors\u2014Thanks to Generous $14 Million Gift from Marcus Foundation Vol. 1 Issue 4 2015 Jefferson.edu In this issue: 2 3 4New Partnerships: and Inspira Health NetworkMoving Great Introducing the New Jefferson Accelerator ZoneJefferson at Smylie Times:Heart Care and Urgent Care Now in Northeast PhiladelphiaMark L.

Photo: Medical Media Expanding Education: Bryn Athyn College Jefferson and Bryn Athyn College (BAC) recently signed an agreement that allows BAC students to earn a BSN from Jefferson's School of Nursing (JSN). The partnership enables us to build on our growing number of strategic alliances with leading institutions to help ensure an optimistic future. \"The nursing profession has increasing demands for nurses with a strong liberal arts foundation and we recognize that Bryn Athyn students have what it takes,\" said Beth Ann Swan, PhD, CRNP, FAAN, Dean of JSN. JSN welcomes this opportunity to incorporate Bryn Athyn's strong liberal arts background into the BSN degree program. \"It really is a wonderful opportunity for both of our institutions to work together to prepare critical thinking, successful nurses,\" added Dr. Swan. The program will provide BAC students with two options: the Dual Admission 2 + 2 program allows students to apply and be accepted to both institutions at the same time and the Nursing Track 2 + 2 Transfer Program is designed to incorporate credits earned at BAC directly toward a nursing degree at TJU.\"We are excited to be partners with Thomas Jefferson University's School of Nursing in providing students with both a strong liberal arts foundation and excel - lent technical training,\" said Allen Bedford, PhD, Bryn Athyn College Dean of Academics. Applications are being accepted now for the Fall 2015 semester. Founded in 1877, Bryn Athyn College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college offering associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs. Expanding Health Care in NJ with Inspira Health Network A partnership with Inspira Health Network will provide a new level of specialty healthcare services to residents of South Jersey, and deliver on the \"Seam - less Clinical Enterprise\" vector of Jefferson's plan for growth\u2014the Blueprint for Strategic Action. Jefferson will help Inspira expand several of its key programs by providing the clinical and research expertise normally only available in academic medical centers like Jefferson. We have agreed to work together to initially provide advanced care to patients in South Jersey in the following areas: Cancer Services, Neuro - science and Gastroenterology. As part of the new affiliation, Inspira Health Network and Jefferson have also agreed to construct a new free-standing ambulatory care building in northeast - ern Gloucester County. The building will house a comprehensive cancer center that will be part of the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center Network and the building will also provide physician office space, allowing Inspira to provide a variety of specialty care to the local community.\"South Jersey residents have always been a part of the Jefferson community, and it is very exciting to further expand our care and innovative research across the Delaware River through our new partner - ship with Inspira Health Network,\" said Dr. Klasko.

Personalized, Multispecialty Care for Complex Cardiac Issues and Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease affects up to 30 percent of adults and is the most common liver disease in western nations. It is estimated that by 2020, this form of liver disease will be the leading cause for liver transplant in the United States. The Jefferson Fatty Liver Center offers hope for those affected, and is Philadelphia's first adult center with a multidisciplinary approach to the disease, which is defined as a buildup of extra fat in the liver not due to excessive alcohol use. The Center provides excellent preventive care, management and treatment options, and features a team of specialists\u2014hepatologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, dietitians, bariatric surgeons, pathologists and radiologists\u2014who work with patients and their primary care physicians to create a personalized treatment plan. Learn more about the Jefferson Fatty Liver Center. For additional information, please contact the Center at 215-955-8900.In the Spotlight The Jefferson Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment Program at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University is proud to be one of 16 area grantees to receive an allotment of the $1.3 million distributed by Komen Philadelphia. The Program will use the funds to continue providing breast care to all eligible women, from initial screening to final diagnosis and into survivorship. Using patient navigation, an evidence-based approach, Jefferson links uninsured and/or underinsured women with screening, diagnostic and/or treatment services at Jefferson's Breast Care Center. A few cells could prevent bone marrow transplant infections, Jefferson researchers have found. The data argue for developing new clinical trials focused specifically on using these anti-viral immune cells (T memory cells) in order to determine if it would indeed be better than current therapeutic options. The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University has joined 14 other leading academic medical centers in the nation's premier prostate cancer clinical trials group\u2014the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC). The membership not only gives Jefferson patients access to groundbreaking clinical trials from across the country, but brings Jefferson's research in prostate cancer to centers across the United States. This will help researchers to complete their studies faster, and bring much needed novel therapies to patients sooner. A Jefferson mindfulness program improves mind-body health in the elderly, researchers at the Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine at Jefferson found. Participants in the study reported increased awareness and ability to be present in the moment, as well as greater self-compassion. The research showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction\u2014a cost-effective group model\u2014can help elders improve quality of life and well-being. A multidisciplinary team at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals implemented a successful transition-of-care program, Jefferson Facilitating Anticoagulation for Safer Transitions, or Jeff FAST, for patients presenting to the emergency room with acute, uncomplicated deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The team used evidence-based guidelines to determine which patients could be discharged safely and which should be admitted to the hospital. Patient education is integral to the success of the program, as is provider education\u2014which will be enhanced with a Jeff FAST applica- tion for smartphones, currently in development. The app will provide just-in-time information so emergency room physicians can make the best and most informed decisions. At the recent Radiological Society of North America's 100th annual meeting in Chicago, the Department of Radiologic Sciences in Jefferson's School of Health Professions received top honors as Best Radiologic Technologist Training Program .
