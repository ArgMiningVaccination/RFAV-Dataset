The forms must be completed by a healthcare professional, patients cannot refer themselves. Please refer to latest Green Book Guidance on COVID Vaccine first before using this service as answers to most co mmon queries can be found here. Table 4, Chapter 14a of the Green Book in particular should be consulted. The red, amber and green categories referred to in this document and the forms are referring to the colours in this table. This document supplements the information found in the Green Book and gives specific examples where advice will be and won't be offered. We are dealing with extremely high volume of these enquiries without any addi tional resources on an already overstretched service. We are trying to set aside dedicated time to answer these enquiries in the order in which we receive. Contacting us directly by other means would not expedite this process . Advice will be prioritised fo r patients who are in the vulnerable category. The following notes may help an d have been devised based upon queries received recently. Side effects and allergy It is important to differentiate between side effects of drugs and allergy. Allergy refers to a misguided immunological response to exogenous substance, more specifically in terms of the COVID vaccine it is useful to know about the likelihood of an IgE mediated reaction, to the vaccine or other drugs. An IgE mediated reaction typically presents with urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, wheeze, and collapse (anaphylaxis) which occurs within an hour of exposure. Conversely , side effects are undesirable effects of the drugs which are not immunological. Example 1: Patient 1 has the following in their drug 'allergy' records: Penicillin - itchy rash clarithromycin - diarrhoea doxycycline - photosensitivity Version 1.0 February 2021 This patient would fall into the green category, they do not have immediate anaphylaxis to multiple drug classes. They have side effects to clarithromycin and doxycycline . Vaccine side effects Most vaccines will have side effects including myalgia, headache and irritation at the injection site. This is not an allergy. It is important to determine this when taking a drug allergy history. Example 2 Patient 2 had the following in the drug allergy records: Penicillin - rash Flu vaccine The GP records were interrogated on PPM and the following is found in the patients records the previous flu season: \"had flu vaccine 48 bours ago, patient compl aining of severe headache, bed bound, fatigue (no rash, wheeze, swelling)\". This patient had a side effect to the flu vaccine . They fall into the green category. Food and latex allergy According to the green book patients with food allergies only fit into the green category. Drug allergies should be assessed separately. Example 3 Patient 3 has the following in their drug 'allergy ' records Avocado - anaphylaxis Melon - anaphylaxis Latex - wheeze Ciprofloxacin - tendinitis Penicillin - rash This patient would fit into the green category. The food allergies can be ignored, the patient does not have a history of anaphylaxis to multiple drug classes (the patient has a side effect to ciprofloxacin). Version 1.0 February 2021 Idiopathic anaphylaxis Idiopathic anaphylaxis is anaphylaxis that occurs without a specific trigger, it is in part thought to have an autoimmune basis. It is useful to ask the following questions: 1. When do the episodes happen? If there is clear episodes which occur more than 2 hours after a food/drug, it is unlikely the episode was attributable to the food/drug. This is more suggestive of idiopathic anaphylaxis 2. Is there any urticaria in between ? The patient may have a form of chronic spontaneous urticaria, in severe cases patients may have a severe phenotype which pr esents with anaphylaxis 3. Have the patients tolerated Non -Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDS )? NSAIDs are well known to precipitate anaphylactoid reactions. It is useful to ask if the patient specifically if they tolerate NSAIDs and over the counter c old and flu remedies which often contain an NSAID. Urticaria and angioedema in isolation is not idiopathic anaphylaxis Many cases of urticaria are idiopathic, furthermore urticaria in isolation is NOT anaphylaxis. Some GP records will have urticaria NOS c oded in their records. In such cases it is useful to determine the likelihood of idiopathic anaphylaxis by asking the patient if they get cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms accompanying their urticaria (e.g. ligh t headedness, wheeze, shortness of breat h). PEG (polyethylene glycol) allergy PEGs are synthetic macromolecules present as excipients in multiple medications. Laxatives such as Movicol contain large amounts of PEG, hence if patients can tolerate Movicol it is unlikely that they have a PEG allergy. According the green book a suspicion of a PEG allergy falls into the amber category as PEG is present in the Pfizer vaccine . Example 4 OTC effervescent Vitamin C tablet - urticaria, wheeze, acute services called Gaviscon tablet - anaphylaxis, requi red adrenaline Cream? Brand - urticaria where applied Sudafed capsules - anaphylaxis Chewing gum - mouth itching Version 1.0 February 2021 This patient falls into the amber category and should be referred using the appropriate proforma . They may have a PEG allergy. Anaphylaxis to an injected antibody preparation According to the green book patients with anaphylaxis to an injected antibody preparations fall into the amber category, and advice from allergy specialist should be sought. Monoclonal antibodies are wide ly used and advice should be sought regarding the COVID vaccine if a patient has had anaphylaxis to an injected antibody preparation . Example 5. Patient 5 has the following in their drug 'allergy' record Peanut - anaphylaxis Peach - mouth itching Hydroxyzi ne- headache Clarithromycin - deranged liver test Cyclizine - \"feels spaced out\" Rituximab - anaphylaxis This patient falls into the amber category , solely based on the reaction to Rituximab. The food allergy can be ignored (green category) and the patient h as side effects to hydroxyzine, clarithromycin and cyclizine. Patients who have tolerate d the first dose of the vaccine The advice offered in the Green Book has changed in recent weeks with the addition of Table 4 (Chapter 14a) . It is therefore possible for patients who have received their first dose to fall into the amber category now. If the patient has tolerated the first dose they can have the second dose without further advice. Example 6 . Patient 6 had anaphylaxis following the tetanus vaccine in 1985 . They tolerated the Pfizer vaccine in December 2020. However with the recent changed in the Green Book they now fall into the amber category of Table 4, Chapter 14a -Green Book. This patient can have the second dose without our advice as he/she has to lerated the first dose. "}
