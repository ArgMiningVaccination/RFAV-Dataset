Genome-Wide Association Study of Metachronous Colorectal Adenoma Risk among Participants in the 75(1), 143-153. [More info](#more-journal-publication0)Genetic variants related to colorectal adenoma may help identify those who are at highest risk of colorectal cancer development or illuminate potential chemopreventive strategies. The purpose of this genome-wide association study was to identify genetic variants that are associated with risk of developing a metachronous colorectal adenoma among 1,215 study participants of European descent from the Selenium Trial. Associations of variants were assessed with logistic regression analyses and validated in an independent case-control study population of 1,491 participants from the Colorectal Cancer Study of Austria (CORSA). No statistically significant genome-wide associations between any variant and metachronous adenoma were identified after correction for multiple comparisons. However, an intron variant of gene, rs61901554, showed a suggestive association ( = 1.10 \u00d7 10) and was associated with advanced adenomas in CORSA ( = 0.04). Two intronic variants, rs12728998 and rs6699944 in were also observed to suggestive associations with metachronous lesions ( = 2.00 \u00d7 10) in the Selenium Trial and were associated with advanced adenoma in CORSA ( = 0.03). Our results provide new areas of investigation for the genetic basis of the development of metachronous colorectal adenoma and support a role for involvement in the Wnt/-catenin pathway leading to colorectal neoplasia.Trial Registration number: NCT00078897 (ClinicalTrials.gov). - Bauman, J.

Randomized Crossover Trial Evaluating Detoxification of Tobacco Carcinogens by Broccoli Seed and Sprout Extract in Current Smokers. Cancers, 14(9). [More info](#more-journal-publication1)Consumption of cruciferous vegetables, rich in the isothiocyanate glucoraphanin, is associated with reduced risk of tobacco-related cancers. Sulforaphane, released by hydrolysis of glucoraphanin, potently induces cytoprotective phase II enzymes. Sulforaphane decreased the incidence of oral cancer in the 4NQO carcinogenesis model. In residents of Qidong, China, broccoli seed and sprout extracts (BSSE) increased detoxification of air pollutants benzene and acrolein, also found in tobacco smoke. This randomized, crossover trial evaluated detoxification of tobacco carcinogens by the BSSE Avmacol in otherwise healthy smokers. Participants were treated for 2 weeks with both low and higher-dose BSSE (148 \u00b5mol vs. 296 \u00b5mol washout, randomization to low-high vs. high-low sequence. The primary endpoint was detoxification of benzene, measured by urinary excretion of its mercapturic acid, SPMA. crotonaldehyde, modulation by genotype, and toxicity. Forty-nine participants enrolled, including 26 (53%) females with median use of 20 cigarettes/day. Low and higher-dose BSSE showed a mean 0.04), acrolein ( < 0.01), and crotonaldehyde ( = 0.02), independent of genotype. Retention and compliance were high resulting in early study completion. In conclusion, BSSE significantly upregulated detoxification of the tobacco carcinogens benzene, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde in current tobacco smokers. - Garland, L.

(2022). Clinical Study of Aspirin and Zileuton on Biomarkers of Carcinogenesis in Current Smokers. Cancers, of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on lung cancer risk is supported by epidemiologic and preclinical studies. Zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, has additive activity with NSAIDs against tobacco carcinogenesis in preclinical models. We hypothesized that cyclooxygenase plus 5-lipoxygenase inhibition would be more effective than a placebo in modulating the nasal epithelium gene signatures of tobacco exposure and lung cancer. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study of low-dose aspirin plus zileuton vs. double placebo in current smokers to compare the modulating effects on nasal gene expression and arachidonic acid metabolism. In total, 63 participants took aspirin 81 mg daily plus zileuton (Zyflo CR) 600 mg BID or the placebo for 12 weeks. Nasal brushes from the baseline, end-of-intervention, and one-week post intervention were profiled via microarray. Aspirin plus zilueton had minimal effects on the modulation of the nasal or bronchial gene expression signatures of smoking, lung cancer, and COPD but favorably modulated a bronchial gene expression signature of squamous dysplasia. Aspirin plus zileuton suppressed urinary leukotriene but not prostaglandin E2, suggesting shunting through the cyclooxygenase pathway when combined with 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. Continued investigation of leukotriene inhibitors is needed to confirm these findings, understand the long-term effects on the airway epithelium, and identify the safest, optimally dosed agents. - Jacobs, E.

Design, Physicochemical Characterization, and In Vitro Permeation of Innovative Resatorvid Topical Formulations for Targeted Skin Drug Delivery. Pharmaceutics, 14(4). [More info](#more-journal-publication6)Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most common malignancies worldwide and affect more than 5 million people in the United States every year. NMSC is directly linked to the excessive exposure of the skin to solar ultraviolet (UV) rays. The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist, resatorvid (TAK-242), is a novel prototype chemo preventive agent that suppresses the production of inflammation mediators induced by UV exposure. This study aimed to design and develop TAK-242 into topical formulations using FDA-approved excipients, Pluronic F-127 poloxamer triblock copolymer gel for the prevention of skin cancer. The physicochemical properties of raw TAK-242, which influence the compatibility and solubility in the selected base materials, were confirmed using X-ray powder diffraction The permeation behavior of TAK-242 from the prepared formulations was determined using Strat-M transdermal diffusion membranes, and 3D cultured primary human-derived (EpiDerm). Despite TAK-242's high molecular weight and hydrophobicity, it can permeate through reconstructed human epidermis from all formulations. The findings, reported for the first time in this study, emphasize the capabilities of the topical application of TAK-242 via these multiple innovative topical drug delivery formulation platforms. - Ying, J., Cattell, R., Zhao, T., Lei, L., Jiang, Z., Hussain, S.

Two fully automated data-driven 3D whole-breast segmentation strategies in MRI for MR-based breast density using image registration and U-Net with a focus on reproducibility. Visual computing for industry, biomedicine, and art, 5(1), 25. [More info](#more-journal-publication7)Presence of higher breast density (BD) and persistence over time are risk factors for breast cancer. A quantitatively accurate and highly reproducible BD measure that relies on precise and reproducible whole-breast segmentation is desirable. In this study, we aimed to develop a highly reproducible and accurate whole-breast segmentation algorithm for the generation of reproducible BD measures. Three datasets of volunteers from two clinical trials were included. Breast MR images were acquired on 3 T Siemens Biograph mMR, Prisma, and Skyra using 3D Cartesian with a fat-water separation technique. Two whole-breast segmentation strategies, utilizing image registration and 3D U-Net, were developed. Manual segmentation was performed. A task-based analysis was performed: a previously developed MR-based BD measure, MagDensity, was calculated and assessed using automated and manual segmentation. The mean squared error (MSE) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between MagDensity were evaluated using the manual segmentation as a reference. The test-retest reproducibility of MagDensity derived from different breast segmentation methods was assessed using the difference between the test and retest measures (), MSE, and ICC. The results showed that MagDensity derived by the registration and deep learning segmentation methods exhibited high concordance with manual segmentation, with ICCs of MagDensity derived using the registration algorithm achieved the smallest MSE of 0.370 and highest ICC of 0.993 (95%CI: 0.982-0.997) when compared to other segmentation methods. In conclusion, the proposed registration and deep learning whole-breast segmentation methods are accurate and reliable for estimating BD. Both methods outperformed a previously developed algorithm and manual segmentation in the test-retest assessment, with the registration exhibiting superior performance for highly reproducible BD measurements. - Algotar, A.

Cancers, 14(1). [More info](#more-journal-publication10)There is a need to identify molecular biomarkers of melanoma progression to assist the development of chemoprevention strategies to lower melanoma incidence. Using datasets containing gene expression for dysplastic nevi and melanoma or melanoma arising in a nevus, we performed differential gene expression analysis and regularized regression models to identify genes and pathways that were associated with progression from nevi to melanoma. A small number of genes distinguished nevi from melanoma. Differential expression of seven genes was identified between nevi and melanoma decreased in melanoma, compared to dysplastic nevi or nevi that progressed to melanoma. Further supporting an association with melanomagenesis, these genes demonstrated a linear change in expression from benign nevi to dysplastic nevi to radial growth phase melanoma to vertical growth phase melanoma. The genes associated with melanoma progression showed significant enrichment of multiple pathways related to the immune system. This study demonstrates (1) a novel application of bioinformatic approaches to aid clinical trials of melanoma chemoprevention and (2) the feasibility of determining a gene signature biomarker of melanomagenesis. - Gutkind, J.

[More info](#more-journal-publication11)BACKGROUNDThe aberrant activation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling circuitry is one of the most frequently dysregulated signaling events in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here, we conducted a single-arm, open-label phase IIa clinical trial in individuals with oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) to explore the potential of metformin to target PI3K/mTOR signaling for HNSCC prevention.METHODSIndividuals with OPLs, but who were otherwise healthy and without diabetes, underwent pretreatment and posttreatment clinical exam and biopsy. Participants received metformin for 12 weeks (week 1, 500 mg; week 2, 1000 mg; weeks 3-12, 2000 mg daily). Pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies, saliva, and blood were obtained for biomarker analysis, including IHC assessment of mTOR signaling and exome sequencing.RESULTSTwenty-three participants were evaluable for response. The clinical response rate (defined as a 50% reduction in lesion size) was 17%. Although lower than the proposed threshold for favorable clinical response, the histological response rate (improvement in histological grade) was 60%, including 17% complete responses and 43% partial responses. Logistic regression analysis revealed that when compared with never smokers, current and former smokers had statistically significantly increased histological responses (P = 0.016). Remarkably, a significant correlation existed between decreased mTOR activity (pS6 IHC staining) in the basal epithelial layers of OPLs and the histological (P = 0.04) and clinical (P = 0.01) responses.CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge this is the first phase II trial of metformin in individuals with OPLs, providing evidence that metformin administration results in encouraging histological responses and mTOR pathway modulation, thus supporting its further investigation as a chemopreventive agent.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT02581137FUNDINGNIH contract HHSN261201200031I, grants R01DE026644 and R01DE026870. - Martinez, J.

A Protective Role for Arachidonic Acid Metabolites against Advanced Colorectal Adenoma in a Phase III Trial of Selenium. Nutrients, 13(11). [More info](#more-journal-publication12)Oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid (ARA) have been implicated in the development of colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer. The primary purpose of this work was to determine the relationship between plasma levels of oxylipins and colorectal adenoma characteristics at study entry, as well as with the development of a new adenoma during follow-up within a Phase III adenoma prevention clinical trial with selenium (Sel). Secondarily, we sought to determine whether the selenium intervention influenced plasma oxylipin levels. Four oxylipins were quantified in stored plasma samples from a subset of Sel study subjects ( = 256) at baseline and at 12-months. There were significantly lower odds of an advanced adenoma at baseline with higher prostaglandin E (PGE), with an OR (95% CI) of 0.55 (0.33-0.92), and with 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) ((0.53 (0.33-0.94)); a large adenoma with higher PGE ((0.52 (0.31-0.87)). In contrast, no associations were observed between any oxylipin and the development of a new adenoma during follow-up. Selenium supplementation was associated with a significantly smaller increase in 5-HETE after 12 months compared to the placebo, though no other results were statistically significant. The ARA-derived oxylipins may have a role in the progression of non-advanced adenoma to advanced, but not with the development of a new adenoma. - Selmin, O. I., Papoutsis, A.

[More info](#more-journal-publication13): Concerns are emerging that a high-fat diet rich in -6 PUFA (-6HFD) may alter gut microbiome and increase the risk of intestinal disorders. Research is needed to model the relationships between consumption of an -6HFD starting at weaning and development of gut dysbiosis and colonic inflammation in adulthood. We used a C57BL/6J mouse model to compare the effects of exposure to a typical American Western diet (WD) providing 58.4%, 27.8%, and 13.7% energy (%E) from carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively, with those of an isocaloric and isoproteic soybean oil-rich -6HFD providing 50%E and 35.9%E from total fat and carbohydrates, respectively on gut inflammation and microbiome profile. : At weaning, male offspring were assigned to either the WD or -6HFD through 10-16 weeks of age. The WD included fat exclusively from palm oil whereas the -6HFD contained fat exclusively from soybean oil. We recorded changes in body weight, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, colon histopathology, and gut microbiome profile. : Compared to the WD, the -6HFD increased plasma levels of -6 fatty expression COX-2; and the number of colonic inflammatory and hyperplastic lesions.

[More info](#more-journal-publication18)A chemopreventive effect of aspirin (ASA) on lung cancer risk is supported by epidemiologic and preclinical studies. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study in current heavy smokers to compare modulating effects of intermittent versus continuous low-dose ASA on nasal epithelium gene expression and arachidonic acid (ARA) metabolism. Fifty-four participants were randomized to intermittent (ASA 81 mg daily for one week/placebo for one week) or continuous (ASA 81 mg daily) for 12 weeks. Low-dose ASA suppressed urinary prostaglandin E2 13.79 ng/mg creatinine for arms combined, = 0.02), a surrogate of COX-mediated ARA metabolism, but had minimal effects on nasal gene expression of nasal or bronchial gene-expression signatures associated with smoking, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Suppression of urinary PGEM correlated with favorable changes in a smoking-associated gene signature ( < 0.01). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that ASA intervention led to 1,079 enriched gene sets from the Canonical Pathways within the Molecular Signatures Database. In conclusion, low-dose ASA had minimal effects on known carcinogenesis gene signatures in nasal epithelium of current smokers but results in wide-ranging genomic changes in the nasal epithelium, demonstrating utility of nasal brushings as a surrogate to measure gene-expression responses to chemoprevention. PGEM may serve as a marker for smoking-associated gene-expression changes and systemic inflammation. Future studies should focus on NSAIDs or agent combinations with broader inhibition of pro-inflammatory ARA metabolism to shift gene signatures in an anti-carcinogenic direction. - Jacobs, E.

[More info](#more-journal-publication20)The biological basis for documented in effects of turmeric-derived curcumin is unclear since curcumin is barely detectable in serum, being rapidly conjugated to form what is thought to be an inactive glucuronide. Studies were therefore undertaken to test the postulate that antiresorptive effects of curcumin require deconjugation within bone to form bioactive aglycone that -glucuronidase (GUSB), a deconjugating enzyme expressed by hematopoietic marrow cells, facilitates this site-specific transformation. Consistent with this postulate, aglycone, but not glucuronidated, curcumin inhibited RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis, a key curcumin target in bone. Aglycone curcumin, expressed relative to total curcumin, was higher in bone marrow than in serum of curcumin-treated C57BL/6J mice, while remaining a minor component. Ex vivo, under conditions preventing further metabolism of the unstable aglycone, the majority of curcumin-glucuronide delivered to marrow in vivo was hydrolyzed to the aglycone, a process that was inhibited by treatment with saccharolactone, a GUSB inhibitor, or in mice having reduced (C3H/HeJ) or absent (mps/mps) GUSB activity. These findings suggest that curcumin, despite low systemic bioavailability, may be enzymatically activated (deconjugated) within GUSB-enriched bone to exert protective effects, a metabolic process that could also contribute to bone-protective effects of other highly glucuronidated dietary polyphenols. - Song, J.

[More info](#more-journal-publication21)Increased telomerase activity is associated with malignancy and poor prognosis in human cancer, but the development of targeted agents has not yet provided clinical benefit. Here we report that, instead of targeting the telomerase enzyme directly, small molecules that bind to the G-hairpin of the hTERT G-quadruplex-forming sequence kill selectively malignant cells without altering the function of normal cells. RG260 targets the hTERT G-quadruplex stem-loop folding but not tetrad leading of hTERT expression. To improve physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, we derived a small-molecule analog, RG1603, from the parent compound. RG1603 induces mitochondrial defects including PGC1 and NRF2 inhibition and increases oxidative stress, followed by DNA damage and apoptosis. RG1603 injected as a single agent has tolerable toxicity while achieving strong anticancer efficacy in a tumor xenograft mouse model. These results demonstrate a unique approach to inhibiting the hTERT that functions by impairing mitochondrial activity, inducing cell death. - Zeng, Y., Moscicki, A. B., Sahasrabuddhe, V.

Although the standard regimen requires a two or three-dose vaccine series, there is emerging data suggesting that a single dose of the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine generates persistently positive antibody titers. No similar data is yet available for the nonavalent HPV vaccine, currently the only HPV vaccine available in the United States. The overall objective of our study is to assess the stability and kinetics of antibody titers for 24 months following a single dose of the nonavalent HPV vaccine among preteen girls and boys. - Chow, H.

Nutrients, 10(12). [More info](#more-journal-publication25)Several studies have investigated the potential role of selenium (Se) in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with disparate findings. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence of any association between Se and T2D. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Approach (PRISMA). Sixteen studies from 15 papers met inclusion criteria defined for this review. Of the 13 observational studies included, 8 demonstrated a statistically significant positive association between concentrations of Se and odds for T2D, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) ranging from 1.52 (1.012.28) to 7.64 (3.3417.46), and a summary odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 2.03 (1.512.72). In contrast, among randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of Se, a higher risk of T2D was not observed for those who received Se compared to a placebo (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.951.47). Taken together, the results for the relationship between Se and T2D differ between observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs). It remains unclear whether these differences are the result of uncontrolled confounding in the observational studies, or whether there is a modest effect of Se on the risk for T2D that may vary by duration of exposure. Further investigations on the effects of Se on glucose metabolism are needed. - Nguyen, M. M., Martinez, J. A., Hsu, C. H., Sokoloff, M., Krouse, R. S., Gibson, B. A., Nagle, R. B., Parnes, H.

European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP), 27(6), 557-562. [More info](#more-journal-publication26)Metformin has recently been shown to have potential to reduce prostate cancer risk. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the modulating effects of metformin on tissue and systemic biomarkers of drug activity and its distribution into the prostate tissue. Twenty patients with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive either extended-release metformin or placebo for a median of 34 days before surgery. Prostatectomy and serum samples were analyzed for metformin concentrations, serum biomarkers of drug activity (prostate-specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, sex hormone-binding globulin, and testosterone) and tissue biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mTOR inhibition. For participants in the metformin arm, the prostate tissue and serum metformin concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 51.2 g/g tissue and from not detectable to 3.6 g/ml, respectively. There were no differences between the two groups in either the postintervention tissue biomarker expression in the prostatectomy tissue or pre to postintervention changes in serum biomarkers. We conclude that metformin distributes to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets. However, there was no difference in tissue and systemic drug effect biomarkers between the two treatment arms. Future studies with longer intervention duration and larger sample size should be considered in order to evaluate the potential of metformin for prostate cancer prevention. - Parsons, J.

[More info](#more-journal-publication30)Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in grape skins and peanuts that has demonstrated many health benefits including protection against aging, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, neurological decline, and cancer. The anticancer properties of resveratrol have been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, including its general inhibition of phase I metabolism and induction of phase II metabolism. The effects of resveratrol on these enzymes, however, are still unclear, as in vitro evidence often contrasts with animal studies and clinical trials. Reasons for these variances could include the low bioavailability of resveratrol and the effects of resveratrol metabolites. Due to resveratrol's interactions with drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, individuals concurrently taking pharmacological doses of resveratrol with other supplements or medications could potentially experience nutrient-drug interactions. This review summarizes the known effects of resveratrol and its main metabolites on drug metabolism in order to help characterize which populations might benefit from resveratrol for the prevention of cancer, as well as those that may need to avoid supplementation due to potential drug interactions. - Thomson, C.

Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.), 9(7), 528-33. [More info](#more-journal-publication32)Prior research strongly implicates gastric acid and bile acids, two major components of the gastroesophageal refluxate, in the development of Barrett's esophagus and its pathogenesis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid, has been shown to protect esophageal cells against oxidative stress induced by cytotoxic bile acids. We conducted a pilot clinical study to evaluate the clinical activity of UDCA in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Twenty-nine patients with Barrett's esophagus received UDCA treatment at a daily dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day for 6 months. The clinical activity of UDCA was assessed by evaluating changes in gastric bile acid composition and markers of oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine), epithelium. The bile acid in gastric fluid were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. At baseline, UDCA (sum of unchanged and glycine/taurine conjugates) accounted for 18.2% of total gastric bile acids. After UDCA intervention, UDCA increased significantly to account for 93.4% of total gastric bile acids (P < 0.0001). The expression of markers of oxidative DNA damage, cell proliferation, and apoptosis was assessed in the Barrett's esophagus biopsies by IHC. The selected tissue biomarkers were unchanged after 6 months of UDCA intervention. We conclude that high-dose UDCA supplementation for 6 months resulted in favorable changes in gastric bile acid composition but did not modulate selected markers of oxidative DNA damage, cell proliferation, and apoptosis by Brian J.

Double-Blind, Randomized Trial of Alternative Letrozole Dosing Regimens in Postmenopausal Women with Increased Breast Cancer Risk. Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.), 9(2), 142-8. [More info](#more-journal-publication33)Aromatase inhibitors (AI) profoundly suppress estrogen levels in postmenopausal women and are effective in breast cancer prevention among high-risk postmenopausal women. Unfortunately, AI treatment is associated with undesirable side effects that limit patient acceptance for primary prevention of breast cancer. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted to determine whether low and intermittent doses of letrozole can achieve effective estrogen suppression with a more favorable side-effect profile. Overall, 112 postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer were randomized to receive letrozole at 2.5 mg once daily (QD, standard dose arm), 2.5 mg every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (Q-MWF), 1.0 mg Q-MWF, or 0.25 mg Q-MWF for 24 weeks. Primary endpoint was suppression in serum estradiol levels at the end of letrozole intervention. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum estrone, testosterone, C-telopeptide (marker of bone resorption), lipid profile, and quality-of-life measures (QoL) following treatment. Significant estrogen suppression was observed in all dose arms with an average of 75% to 78% and 86% to 93% reduction in serum estradiol and estrone levels, respectively. There were no differences among dose arms with respect to changes in C-telopeptide levels, lipid profile, adverse events (AE), or QoL measures. We conclude that low and intermittent doses of letrozole are not inferior to standard dose in estrogen suppression and resulted in a similar side-effect profile compared with standard dose. Further studies are needed to determine the feasibility of selecting an effective AI dosing schedule with better tolerability. Cancer Prev AACR. - Martinez, A., P., Thomson, C.

Phase II study of metformin for reduction of obesity-associated breast cancer risk: a randomized controlled trial protocol. BMC cancer, 16, 500. [More info](#more-journal-publication34)Two-thirds of U.S. adult women are overweight or obese. High body mass index (BMI) and adult weight gain are risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including postmenopausal breast cancer. The higher postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women with elevated BMI is likely to be attributable to related metabolic disturbances including altered circulating sex steroid hormones and adipokines, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and insulin resistance. Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic drug that has demonstrated favorable effects on metabolic disturbances and as such may lead to lower breast cancer risk in obese women. Further, the anti-proliferative effects of metformin suggest it may decrease breast density, an accepted biomarker of breast cancer risk. - Thompson, P. A., Ashbeck, E. L., Roe, D.

(2015). Plasma metabolomic profiles of breast cancer patients after short-term limonene intervention. Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.), 8(1), 86-93. [More info](#more-journal-publication39)Limonene is a lipophilic monoterpene found in high levels in citrus peel. Limonene demonstrates anticancer properties in preclinical models with effects on multiple cellular targets at varying potency. While of interest as a cancer chemopreventive, the biologic activity of limonene in humans is poorly understood. We conducted metabolite profiling in 39 paired (pre/postintervention) plasma samples from early-stage breast cancer patients receiving limonene treatment (2 g QD) before surgical resection of their tumor. Metabolite profiling was conducted using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a linear trap quadrupole system and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolites were identified by comparison of ion features in samples to a standard reference library. Pathway-based interpretation was conducted using the human metabolome database and the MetaCyc database. Of the 397 named metabolites identified, 72 changed significantly with limonene intervention. Class-based changes included significant decreases in adrenal steroids (P < 0.01), and significant increases in bile acids (P 0.05) and multiple collagen breakdown products (P < 0.001). The pattern of changes also suggested alterations in glucose metabolism. There were 47 metabolites whose change with intervention was significantly correlated to a decrease in cyclin D1, a cell-cycle regulatory protein, in patient tumor tissues (P 0.05). Here, oral administration of limonene resulted in significant changes in several metabolic pathways. Furthermore, pathway-based changes were related to the change in tissue level cyclin D1 expression. Future controlled clinical trials with limonene are necessary to determine the potential role and mechanisms of limonene in the breast cancer prevention setting.
