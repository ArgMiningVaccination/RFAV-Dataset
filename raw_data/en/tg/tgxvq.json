The 2018 AAHA Diabetes Man- agement Guidelines for Dogs and Cats revise and update earlier guidelines published in 2010. The 2018 guidelines retain much of the information in the earlier guidelines that continues to be applicable in clinical practice, along with new infor- mation that represents current expert opinion on controlling DM. An essential aspect of successful DM management is to ensure that the owner of a diabetic dog or cat is capable of administering insulin, recognizing the clinical signs of inade-quately managed DM, and monitoring blood glucose levels at home, although this is ideal but not mandatory; all topics that are reviewed in the guidelines. Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment for clinical DM. The guidelines provide rec- ommendations for each insulin formulation currently available for use in dogs and cats, the choice of which is generally based on ef cacy and duration of effect in the respective species. Also discussed are non-insulin therapeutic medications and dietary management. These treatment modalities, along with insulin therapy, give the practitioner an assortment ofoptions for decreasing the clinical signs of DM while avoiding hypoglycemia, the two conditions that represent the de ni- tion of a controlled diabetic. The guidelines review identifying and monitoring patients at risk for developing DM, which are important for avoiding unnecessary insulin therapy in patients with transient hyperglycemia or mildly elevated blood glucose.

They were subjected to a formal peer review process. A. Holford and R. Rucinsky were co-chairs of the Diabetes Manage- ment Guidelines Task Force. Note: These guidelines include updates made in 2022. These guidelines were prepared by a Task Force of experts convened by the American Animal Hospital Association. This document is intended asa guideline only, not an AAHA standard of care. These guidelines andrecommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive pro- tocol, course of treatment, or procedure. Variations in practice may be warranted based on the needs of the individual patient, resources, and limitations unique to each individual practice setting .Evidence-based sup- port for speci c recommendations has been cited whenever possible and appropriate. Other recommendations are based on practical clinical expe-rience and a consensus of expert opinion. Further research is needed todocument some of these recommendations. Because each case is differ-ent, veterinarians must base their decisions on the best available scienti c evidence in conjunction with their own knowledge and experience. Note: When selecting products, veterinarians have a choice among those formulated for humans and those developed and approved by veterinaryuse. Manufacturers of veterinary-speci c products spend resources to have their products reviewed and approved by the FDA for canine or feline use. These products are speci cally designed and formulated for dogs and cats and have bene ts for their use; they are not human generic products. AAHA suggests that veterinary professionals make every effortto use veterinary FDA-approved products and base their inventory-purchasing decisions on what product is most bene cial patient. American Animal Hospital Association JAAHA.ORG 1Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a treatable condition that requires a com- mitted effort by veterinarian and client. Due to many factors thataffect the diabetic state, a pet 's changing condition, and variable response to therapy, management of DM is often complicated. Suc-cess requires understanding of current scienti c evidence and sound clinical judgment. Each patient requires an individualized treatmentplan, frequent reassessment, and modi cation of that plan based on the patient 's response. This document provides current recommen- dations for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of DM in dogs and cats. Previous AAHA DM guidelines published in 2010 are still applicable and provide useful background for the 2018 guidelines. 1 Readers will note that the 2018 guidelines use the same organizingframework as the 2010 guidelines. In some cases, essential contentfrom the earlier guidelines has been retained verbatim. Practitionerswillnd several items or topics in the updated DM guidelines to be particularly relevant. These include: /C15Quick-reference algorithms on responding to hypoglycemia, DM monitoring, and DM troubleshooting. /C15New information on commercially available insulin formulations and recommendations for their use in dogs and cats. /C15Recommendations for home monitoring of DM, a disease manage- ment approach that can contribute substantially to a favorable treat- ment response. /C15Information on non-insulin therapeutic agents and treatment modalities such as dietary management. /C15The implications of identifying patients at risk for developing DM and how to monitor and treat them. Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome associated with protracted hyperglycemia due to loss or dysfunction of insulin secretion by pan-creatic beta cells, diminished insulin sensitivity in tissues, or both. Inthe dog, beta-cell loss tends to be rapid and progressive, and is usu-ally due to immune-mediated destruction, vacuolar degeneration, orpancreatitis. 2Intact female dogs may be transiently or permanently diabetic due to the insulin-resistant effects of the diestrus phase. In the cat, loss or dysfunction of beta cells is the result of insulin resis- tance, islet amyloidosis, or chronic lymphoplasmacytic pancreatitis.3 Studies have shown that diabetic cats have remission rates that havebeen reported to be variable (15 -100%). Because remission can occur, cat owners may be advised that remission is a possibilitywhen treated with combination of diet and insulin. 4,5 Risk factors for developing DM for both dogs and cats include insulin resistance caused by obesity, certain diseases (e.g., acromegalyand kidney disease in cats; hyperadrenocorticism and pregnancy/diestrus in both dogs andcats), or medications (e.g., steroids, progestins, cyclosporine).Genetics is a suspected risk factor, and (Aus- tralian terriers, beagles, Samoyeds, Keeshonden) and (Burmese,especially in Australia and Europe) are more susceptible. 6,7Research- ers continue to rede ne and reclassify the different etiologies respon- s i b l ef o rt h ed e v e l o p m e n to fD Mi nd o g sa n dc a t s .8As different etiol- ogies become better understood, treatment can be more speci cally tailored to the individual patient. Treatment that is more speci ct o the underlying etiology will presumably lead to better control of clin- ical signs of DM and possibly increase remission rates. Regardless of the underlying etiology, classic clinical signs of polyuria (PU), polydipsia (PD), hypertriglyceridemia, and increased Eventually, untreated or inadequately controlled, ketonemia, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis develop and result in progressive compromise of thepatient 'sh e a l t h . It is important to differentiate patients with clinical DM from those with transient hyperglycemia or mildly increased blood glucose (BG). The subgroup of patients with mildly elevated BG but without concurrent clinical signs associated with higher levels of hyperglyce-mia may require additional diagnostic and therapeutic measures butnot insulin therapy. At this time, there is not a standard de nition for subclinical DM in veterinary medicine or any validated testing to determine which patients are at risk for developing DM. In lieu of\"subclinical DM, \"the Task Force has elected to use the more descriptive terminology \"patients at risk of developing DM, \"or sim- ply\"at-risk patients \"throughout the guidelines. As potential new eti- ologies emerge for overt or subclinical DM, they will be discussed infuture guidelines or consensus statements. Diagnosis and Assessment These guidelines describe different approaches to DM diagnosis and assessment depending on the level of hyperglycemia and the presence of clinical signs. For cats and dogs who present with clinical signs sug-gestive of DM, perform a physical exam and full laboratory evaluation(complete blood count [CBC]), chemistry with electrolytes, urineanalysis with culture, urine protein:creatinine triglycer- ides, blood pressure (BP), and thyroxine (T4); to con rm the diagno- sis as well as to rule out other diseases. Elevated BG can sometimes beidenti ed on blood work in the absence of consistent clinical signs. In such cases, if stress hyperglycemia can be ruled out, the patient may be classi ed as at-risk for developing DM. Clinical signs of PU/PD do not develop until the BG concentration exceeds the renal tubularthreshold for spillage of glucose into the urine. Glucosuria will typi- cally develop when the BG concentration exceeds approximately 200 mg/dL in dogs and 250 -300 mg/dL in cats. 2 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018Clinical signs of DM will typically be present when there is per- sistent hyperglycemia and glucosuria. Clinical signs are usuallyabsent with glucose levels ranging between the upper reference levelsand the renal threshold values noted above. Blood glucose concentra-tions in these ranges may occur for a variety of reasons, including stress hyperglycemia in cats, corticosteroid administration, the pres- ence of concurrent insulin-resistant disease (hyperadrenocorticism,obesity), or as part of the early stage of developing DM. Dogs and cats in the early stages of nonclinical DM appear healthy, have a stable weight, and are usually identi ed as a result of routine laboratory evaluation. They do not have clinical signs of DM.Stress hyperglycemia needs to be ruled out, as well as correction of any insulin-resistant disorders and discontinuation of drugs associated with impaired insulin release or sensitivity. Reassessing BG or moni-toring urine glucose (UG) levels once the patient is no longer stressedat home or measuring serum fructosamine concentrations may helpdifferentiate between stress hyperglycemia and DM and determine if f u r t h e ra c t i o ns h o u l db et a k e n . Clinical DM is diagnosed based on persistent glucosuria, persis- tent hyperglycemia, and presence of characteristic clinical signs.Documentation of an elevated serum fructosamine concentrationmay be necessary to con rm the diagnosis in cats. 9Fructosamine lev- els may be only mildly elevated with lower levels of persistent hyper-glycemia and should be interpreted as part of a complete evaluation. 9 Animals with clinical DM will present with PU, PD, PP, and weight loss. Some may present with lethargy, weakness, and poor body condition. Dogs may have cataracts, and cats may present witha complaint of impaired jumping and abnormal gait. Some patientswill present with systemic signs of illness due to diabetic ketosis/ketoacidosis, such as anorexia, vomiting, dehydration, and depression. The initial evaluation of the diabetic dog and cat should: /C15Assess the overall health of the pet (history including diet and con- current medications, and a complete physical exam). /C15Identify any complications that may be associated with the disease (e.g., cataracts in dogs, peripheral neuropathy in cats). /C15Identify any concurrent problems often associated with the disease (e.g., urinary tract infections, pancreatitis). /C15Identify any conditions that may interfere with the patient 'sr e s p o n s et o treatment (e.g., hyperthyroidism, renal disease, hyperadrenocorticism). /C15Evaluate for risk factors such as obesity, pancreatitis, insulin- resistant disease, diabetogenic medications, and diestrus in femaledogs. Physical exam results of the diabetic cat or dog can be relatively normal early in the course of the disease. As the disease persists with-out treatment, the physical exam may reveal weight loss, dehydra-tion, poor hair coat, abdominal pain if concurrent pancreatitis ispresent, or cataracts. Some cats with longstanding hyperglycemia can develop peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as a plantigradestance. If ketosis is present, a sweet odor may be noticed on the breath of the pet. Laboratory evaluation includes a basic minimum database (CBC, chemistry with electrolytes, urine analysis with culture, trigly- cerides, UPC, BP, and T4 level in cats). Typical ndings include hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and stress leukogram, as well as increased cholesterol and triglycerides. Dogs frequently show increased levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine aminotransferase. Cats, however, show more variability in the presence of a stress leukogram and elevated ALP. Elevated liver enzymes in a cat may warrant fur- ther evaluation for concurrent liver disease. 10Pancreatitis is a com- mon comorbidity and may need to be addressed.10 Cats and dogs with diabetic ketoacidosis may show very ele- vated BG concentrations, azotemia, and total CO 2second- ary to metabolic acidosis, osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and, in the case of profound hyperosmolarity, coma. Urinalysis will reveal the presence of glucose. It may also show the presence of protein, ketones, bacteria, and/or casts. Because a uri- nary tract infection cannot be ruled out by the absence of an active urine sediment, a urine culture should always be performed in gluco- suric animals, because infection is commonly present. If thyroid disease is suspected in a dog, it is best to perform thy- roid testing after DM is stabilized because of the likelihood of euthy- roid sick syndrome. Cats over 7 yr of age with weight loss and PP should be tested for hyperthyroidism because DM and hyperthyroid- ism cause similar clinical signs and can occur concurrently. Treatment The mainstay of treatment for clinical DM in dogs and cats is insulin along with dietary modi cation. Goals include controlling BG below the renal threshold for as much of a 24 hr period as possible, which will improve clinical signs of DM, and avoiding clinically signi cant hypoglycemia. Treatment for Cats In cats, diabetic remission is a reasonable goal.4Successful manage- ment of DM in cats consists of minimal or no clinical signs, owner perception of good quality of life and favorable treatment response, avoidance or improvement of DM complications, (speci cally, dia- betic ketoacidosis and peripheral neuropathy), and avoidance of hypoglycemia. Predictors of diabetic remission in cats include achieving excellent glycemic control within 6 mo of diagnosis, using intensive home monitoring, discontinuation of insulin-antagonizing medications, and use of insulin glargine (Lantus) or detemir (Leve- mir) along with a low-carbohydrate diet.4A clinically sick, diabetic, ketotic cat should be hospitalized to initiate aggressive therapy. If 242018 AAHA Diabetes Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats JAAHA.ORG 3hr care is not feasible, the patient should be referred to an emergency or specialty hospital. Adjunct therapy for diabetic cats should includeenvironmental enrichment using creative feeding tools such as foodpuzzles, particularly for obese cats. Oral hypoglycemic drugs are nei-ther recommended nor considered appropriate for long-term use.Their use is considered temporary and only if combined with dietarymodi cation if the owner refuses insulin therapy or is considering euthanasia for the pet. The initial approach to management of the diabetic cat is to ini- tiate insulin therapy with glargine (Lantus) or protamine zinc insulin(PZI; ProZinc) at a starting dose of 1 -2u n i t s( U )p e rc a t q12 hr. The decision to monitor BG on the rst day of insulin treatment is at the discretion of the veterinarian. The goal of rst-day monitoring is solely to identify hypoglycemia. The insulin dose should notbe increased based on rst-day BG evaluation. If monitoring is elected, measure BG q2-4h rf o rc a t so nP Z Ia n d q4 hr for those on glargine for 10 -12 hr following insulin administration. Decrease the insulin dose by 50% if BG is ,150 mg/dL any time during the day. Treat the diabetic cat as an outpatient after the rst day of monitoring, if elected, and plan to reevaluate in 7 -14 days regardless of whether BG values are monitored on the rst day. Immediately re-evaluate if clinical signs suggest hypoglycemia or if lethargy, anorexia, or vomit-ing is noted. See Algorithm 2, \"Monitoring blood glucose levels in diabetic dogs and cats, \"andTable 1 ,\"Insulin Products, \"for more information on monitoring and dosing. Treatment for Dogs Treatment of clinical DM in the dog always requires exogenous insulintherapy. U-40 pork Task Force 'srst-choice recommendation for dogs using a starting dose of 0.25 U/kg q12 hr, rounded to the nearest whole U. The dura- tion of action is close to 12 hr in most dogs, and the amorphous com-ponent of the insulin helps to minimize postprandial hyperglycemia.As with cats, a clinically sick, diabetic, ketotic dog should be admittedf o r2 4h rc a r ef o ra g g r e s s i v et h e r a p yo ft h ek e t o s i sa n do t h e ru n d e r l y -ing illnesses. A critical initial goal of treatment is avoidance of symp- tomatic hypoglycemia, which may occur if the insulin dose is increased too aggressively. Feed equal-sized meals twice daily at thetime of each insulin injection. In contrast to cats, diabetic remissionoccurs only rarely in dogs with naturally acquired DM. Performing anovariohysterectomy in intact diabetic dogs will support remission,regardless of the underlying cause of the diabetes. In dogs with subclinical DM, investigate and address causes of insulin resistance, including obesity, medications, hyperadrenocorti-cism and diestrus in intact females. Initiate dietary therapy to limitpostprandial hyperglycemia (see \"Dietary Therapy Goals and Man- agement \"for additional information.) Evaluate the dog closely forprogression to clinical DM. Subclinical DM is not commonly identi- ed in the dog. Most dogs in the early stages of naturally acquired diabetes (i.e., not induced by insulin resistance) quickly progress toclinical DM and should be managed using insulin. Veterinarians use a variety of insulin products, but only two are p r e s e n t l ya p p r o v e db yt h eF D Af o ru s ei nd o g sa n dc a t s .A porcine lente product (porcine zinc insulin suspension, Vetsulin) is approved for both species. Human recombinant protamine zinc insulin, or PZI (ProZinc) insulin , is also FDA approved for both cats (as of 2009) and dogs (as of 2019). It is considered by clinicians as along-acting insulin. Because of limited controlled, comparative studies, most experts 'recommendations are based on a combination of clini- cal and anecdotal experience. The guidelines Task Force strives to make evidence-based recommendations when data are available. However, the ability to make speci c recommendations based on dif- ferences and preferences between veterinary insulin products is lim- ited. Members of the Task Force most commonly use porcine lente insulin (Vetsulin) in dogs and glargine (Lantus) in cats as their rst choice, recognizing that other acceptable options used by many clini- cians include Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH; Humulin N, Novo- lin N) in dogs and PZI (ProZinc) in cats and dogs. Although compounded insulin is available, its use is not recom- mended because of concerns about production methods, diluents, sterility, and insulin concentration consistency between lots. A study comparing commercially available insulin with its compoundedcounterparts showed that the manufactured insulin met all US Phar- macopeia requirements and only 1 of 12 compounders met US Phar- macopeia speci cations at all time points. The variability between compounded insulins was also signi cant enough to have clinical consequences. 11It is also not recommended to dilute insulin because dilution can produce unpredictable results, alter insulin ef cacy, and result in bacterial contamination.5,12 Insulin Products (see Table 1) 1.Lente (U-40 porcine zinc insulin suspension; Vetsulin, Merck Ani- mal Health) is an intermediate-acting insulin commonly used bythe Task Force in dogs. It is FDA approved for use in dogs and cats.It has a close to 12 hr duration of action in most dogs and is usefulfor minimizing postprandial sa insulin commonly used by the Task Force in catsbecause it has an adequate duration of action in most diabetic cats.Several studies have demonstrated that glargine is effective for con-trolling blood sugar levels in diabetic cats and achieving high remis-sion rates. 12Glargine can also be used in dogs. It is a human analog insulin with modi cations that provide variable solubility at differ- ent pHs. Glargine is soluble at a pH of 4.0, the pH at which it issupplied and stored, but in the neutral pH of the body 's blood or subcutaneous tissues it forms microprecipitates, facilitating slowabsorption after injection. This results in rapid onset and long dura-tion of action. Glargine is sometimes described as a \"peakless \" 4 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018TABLE 1 Insulin Products Commonly Used in Dogs and Cats Insulin Product Product DescriptionBrand Name (Manufacturer)Veterinary FDA Approval StatusPeak Action (Nadir) and Duration of Effect Starting Dose Concentration Comments Lente (intermediate- acting)Porcine zinc insulin suspensionVetsulin (Merck Animal Health)Dogs, cats Cats Nadir 2 -8 hr.

Prot- amine zinc insulin can have a prolonged duration of action in dogs and may be tried on once-daily dosing schedule to minimize thechances of clinically signi cant hypoglycemia and/or the Somogyi phenomenon. 15 4.NPH (U-100 human recombinant; Neutral Protamine Hagedorn Humulin N, Lilly or Novulin N, Novo Nordisk) is anintermediate-acting insulin that is used in dogs. The Task Force does not recommend use of this insulin in cats due to its short duration of action. The duration of action of NPH in dogs is often,12 hr. Some dogs can have postprandial hyperglycemia when treated with this insulin. 16A combination form of NPH plus regular insulin (70 NPH/30 Regular) is available that may be suitable if the dog has an appropriate duration of action (8 -12 hr) with an early nadir or postprandial BG spike. Some clinicians use this product indogs who postprandial hyperglycemia when being treated with NPH. (U-100 human recombinant; Levemir, Novo Nordisk) is a long-acting insulin that can be used in both dogs and cats. Detemir is a human analog insulin engineered with modi cations that allow it to bind albumin with high af nity in the subcutaneous and intra- vascular spaces, prolonging the insulin 's absorption. 4,17This pro- longed absorption gives detemir a long and steady duration of action and less variability in biological activity.4Detemir has a very similar pro le to glargine (Lantus) in cats in terms of BG control and remission rates.12However, cats receiving detemir require a lower median maximal dose than cats receiving glargine (1.75 U per cat for detemir versus 2.5 U per cat of glargine).18Dogs are very sensitive to the higher potency of this insulin and require lowerstarting doses (0.1 U/kg). 19Particular caution must be used in small dogs because they are more likely to have more frequent hypoglyce- mic excursions.19 Insulin dosages should be based on the patient 's estimated ideal body weight. Judicious initial dosing is recommended because die- tary change may alter food intake and affect the therapeutic response to insulin. Insulin dosages should not be increased more often than q1-2 wk. The Task Force recognizes that clients are often cost-constrained. However, choosing a less ef cacious insulin can result in higher total costs and careful monitoring. In addition, com- paring per-U costs of insulin is more useful than comparing cost per vial. The cost per U of insulin gives a more accurate assessment of the overall cost of using the insulin versus cost per vial. In the majority of feline diabetes cases, the Task Force recom- mends a starting dose of glargine (Lantus), q12 hr based on theestimated ideal body weight of the cat and BG levels (0.5 U/kg q12 hr if BG .360 0.25 U/kg q12 hr if BG ,360 mg/dL). This equates to 1 U q12 hr in the average cat. Even in a very large cat, the starting dose of insulin should not exceed 2 U per cat q12 hr. Most cats are well regulated on insulin at an average dose of 0.5U/kg q12 hr, with a range of 0.2 -0.8 U/kg. With PZI (ProZinc), a typical starting dose is 1 -2 U per cat. In diabetic dogs, the Task Force recommends a starting dose of 0.25 U/kg of lente (Vetsulin) q12 hr, rounded to the nearest whole U. Most dogs are well controlled on insulin at an average dose of 0.5 U/kg q12 hr with a range of 0.2 -1.0 U/kg. See Table 1 for more detailed information on alternative dosing and insulin selections for both dogs and cats. It should be noted that product pharmacokinetics vary depend- ing on insulin type, product formulation, and the individual patient 's response. One should employ reasonable dosing flexibility based on individual patient response and the owner 's compliance limitations. For example, a 12 62-hour window on each side of the dosing interval and occasional missed doses are considered acceptable bymost practitioners. Other insulin types and other therapeutics can be used in dogs and cats based on the patient 'sr e s p o n s et o rst-line insulin therapy and associated recommendations, as discussed in the\"Monitoring \"section of the guidelines. Although none of the insulin products available for use in dogs and cats have canine- or feline-speci c amino acid sequences, anti- insulin antibodies do not appear to cause a signi cant clinical problem. Insulin manufacturers generally recommend discarding opened and used bottles of insulin after 4 -6 wk or until the date of expira- tion listed by the manufacturer. However, if handled carefully andstored in the refrigerator, the Task Force is comfortable using insu- lins beyond the date of expiration (up to 3 -6 mo) as long as they are not discolored, flocculent, or have any change in consistency. Insulin must be discarded if these changes occur. If a lack of BG regulationis noted 3 -6 mo after using a speci c bottle of insulin, it may be pru- dent to replace the bottle prior to increasing insulin dose. Non-Insulin Therapeutic Agents (see Table 2) 1.Sulfonylureas such as glipizide promote insulin secretion from the pancreas and can be used in cats. Oral glipizide has been used suc-cessfully in cats with DM, with bene ts being reported in approxi- mately 40% of cats. Transdermal application is unreliable. 24Adverse effects following oral administration include cholestasis, hypoglyce- mia, and vomiting. There is concern that glipizide may contributeto progression of DM and pancreatic amyloidosis. 24The Task Force only recommends glipizide for use in cats with owners who refuseinsulin therapy, and only with concurrent dietary therapy. The ini-tial dose is 2.5 mg/cat orally q12 hr. The dose can be increased to 5 mg/cat q12 hr if an inadequate response is seen after 2 wk. If no response is seen after 4 -6 weeks, insulin therapy should be insti- tuted. 24If the cat appears to be clinically responsive, the trial can 6 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018continue for 12 wk to assess response to therapy. Obtaining BGCs is important to con rm therapeutic response. To screen for liver tox- icity, regular liver monitoring should be performed. Glipizide should not be used in dogs because they do not have any functional pancreatic beta cells due to the pathogenesis of canine DM. 2.a-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose are used to inhibit intes- tinal glucose absorption and reduce postprandial hyperglycemia.Acarbose has been used in cats along with insulin and a low-carbohydrate diet. 24Acarbose can be used in dogs along with insu- lin therapy to help improve glycemic control and may decrease thedose of exogenous insulin administration. As a sole agent, acarbose is seldom if ever suf cient, especially in dogs. Advise owners that diarrhea is a possible side effect. 25 3.Incretins such as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) are metabolic or gastrointestinal hormones that can be used in dogs and cats. They can be used along with glargine (Lantus) insulin therapy and diet incats to help achieve remission. 26Incretins can help improve diabetic control in cats and dogs. In healthy animals and potentially diabeticcats, 1 increases insulin secretion (in cats it also protects beta cells from oxidative and toxic injury and promotes expansion of the b-cell population) and functions to help delay gastric emptying and increase satiety. In dogs and cats, improved diabetic control is pre-sumed to be via glucagon suppression. 27Currently, although more research is needed, the most promising results have been reportedin cats treated with exenatide ER (Bydureon) and in dogs with lira- glutide (Victoza). 27,28 Dietary Therapy Goals and Management The goals of dietary therapy are to optimize body weight with appro- priate protein and carbohydrate levels, fat restriction, and calorie and portion control. Weight loss in obese patients and stopping DM-associated weight loss are treatment goals for diabetic canineand feline patients. The following approach is recommended for die- tary management of DM: /C15The cat or dog 's daily caloric requirements, based on lean body mass, should be calculated. /C15Body weight (using the same scale) and BCS should be obtained at least once or twice monthly and adjustments made in dietary intake to maintain optimal weight. /C15A weight loss goal in obese cats is 0.5 -2% reduction per wk and in dogs is 1 -2% reduction per wk. /C15Managing protein and carbohydrate intake is recommended to min- imize postprandial hyperglycemia. Diabetic cats should be fed a high-protein diet (de ned as $40% protein metabolizable energy) to maximize metabolic rate, limit the risk of hepatic lipidosis during weight loss, improve satiety,and prevent lean muscle-mass loss. 29This dietary regimen is neces- sary to prevent protein malnutrition and loss of lean body mass. High-protein diets typically provide the lowest amount of carbohy- drates without impacting palatability. The following dietary princi-ples for diabetic cats should also be considered: /C15Protein normalizes fat metabolism and provides a consistent energy source. /C15Arginine stimulates insulin secretion. /C15Carbohydrate intake should be limited because carbohydrates may contribute to hyperglycemia and glucose toxicity. The Task Force recommends a diet of approximately 12% ME, recognizing that there are a variety of expert opinions on this topic.24,29 /C15Diabetic cats have reported remission rates between 15 and 100% when given a combination of a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet and insu- lin.4,5The highest remission rates occur when glargine (Lantus) andTABLE 2 Non-Insulin Therapeutic Agents Used to Treat Canine and Feline Diabetes Mellitus Therapeutic Class Examples Mode of ActionUsed with Insulin Cotherapy Comments Sulfonylureas Glipizide Stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas.No Only recommended for owners who refuse to use insulin in cats.

Feeding portioned meals has several advantages for dietary manage- ment of diabetic cats: /C15It is easier to monitor intake and appetite. /C15Portion control is facilitated. /C15Free-choice feeding is acceptable if a cat 's eating habits cannot be changed (the Task Force recommends that the daily ration be divided into multiple meals. The use of timed feeders may be helpfulin this scenario). 29 /C15Canned foods are preferred over dry foods. Canned foods provide: o Lower carbohydrate levels. o Ease of portion control. o Lower caloric density; cats can eat a higher volume of canned food and obtain the same caloric intake as smaller volumes of dry food. o Additional water intake. Dietary recommendations for both dogs and cats should be adjusted if concurrent diseases are present (e.g., chronic kidney disease, pancreatitis, intestinal disease). For dogs, a diet that will correct obesity, optimize body weight, and minimize postprandial hyperglycemia is rec- ommended. Unlike cats, dogs are not at appreciable risk for the clinical complications of hepatic lipidosis. Dogs with DM can do well with any diet that is complete and balanced, is fed at consistent times in consis- tent amounts, and is palatable in order to achieve predictable and con- sistent intake. For dogs, diets that contain increased quantities of soluble and insoluble b e ro rt h a ta r ed e s i g n e df o rw e i g h tm a i n t e n a n c ei nd i a - betics or for weight loss in obese diabetics caloric intake in obese dogs undergoing weight reduction. Some clinicians recommend that owners supplement with canned pumpkin, green beans, or commercial ber supplements containing psyllium or wheat dextrin. Additionally, regular and appropriate exercise should be considered an adjunct of any diet-based weight-loss program. In underweight dogs, the principal goal of dietary therapy is to normalize body weight, increase muscle mass, and stabilize metabo- lism and insulin requirements. Underweight dogs should be fed a high-quality maintenance diet or a diabetic diet that has both solubleand insoluble ber and is not designed for weight loss. The diet should be palatable in order to provide predictable caloric intake when fed at consistent times and in consistent amounts. Owners should include treats when calculating daily caloric intake. Monitoring The overarching goal of monitoring diabetic cats and dogs is to con- trol clinical signs of DM while avoiding hypoglycemia. Statedanother way, the de nition of a controlled diabetic is absence of clinical signs and hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels do fluctuate and short periods of mild hyperglycemia are acceptable. The goal is not necessarily to normalize BG, but to keep the BG below the renal threshold (200 mg/dL in dogs and 250 -300 mg/dL in cats) and to avoid hypoglycemia. When BG is above the renal threshold, glucosu- ria occurs, resulting in PU/PD. None of the monitoring modalities are perfect, and they each have strengths and weaknesses. Although normalizing clinical signs (such as resolution of PU/PD/PP and achieving ideal body weight) supersedes all other monitoring indica- tors, every attempt should be made to also monitor BG in thediabetic patient. To illustrate, if a patient is consistently negative for glucosuria, without measuring BG it is impossible to determine if the individual is a \"perfectly regulated \"diabetic or hypoglycemic. Monitoring diabetic pets can be challenging. The algorithm in Figure 1 provides a quick reference for three types of DM patients \u2014 newly diagnosed, previously diagnosed, and previously diagnosed but currently unregulated. Monitoring options include performance of BGCs, monitoring UG, measuring fructosamine, and assessment of clinical signs and weight. Results from different monitoring approaches may con flict. In a review of 53 cases of canine DM, BG measurements and fructosamine concentrations were consistent with good glycemic control in only 60% of dogs judged to have good clin- ical control. Furthermore, although all monitoring parameters were signicantly improved in dogs with good clinical control, consider- able overlap existed between dogs with good and poor clinical responses. 30In cats, no single monitoring parameter best correlates with the level of clinical control identi ed.31 In-Hospital Blood Glucose Curves Blood glucose curves serve two very useful purposes that other moni- toring parameters do not. They identify clinically undetectable hypo- glycemia so that the insulin dose can be decreased before clinical signs of hypoglycemia develop. Thus, a periodic BGC is recom- mended for seemingly well-controlled patients. More importantly, although other techniques and clinical signs may suggest control is lacking, multiple reasons for poor control exist, including too lowand too high an insulin dose. The only way to know how to appro- priately change an insulin dose is to perform a BGC. There are several situations when a BGC should be performed: (1) after the rst dose of a new kind of insulin; (2) at 7 -14 days after an insulin dose change; (3) at least q3 mo even in well-controlled diabetics; (4) any time clinical signs recur in a controlled patient; and (5) when hypoglycemia is suspected. To construct a BGC, BG is generally measured q2 hr for one interval between injections (i.e., for 12 hr if insulin is administered 8 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018twice daily and for 24 hr if insulin is given once daily). When using glargine (Lantus) in cats, BG should be monitored every 3 -4h r . However, when BG is ,150 mg/dL in both cats and dogs during any curve, BG should be measured hourly. The AlphaTrak 2 may be the most accurate BG meter (glucom- eter) for veterinary patients because it has been calibrated in dogsand cats. 32-34Although human glucometers are readily accessible to pet owners, the Task Force does not recommend their use due toinaccuracies when reading canine and feline blood. A normal insulin treatment and feeding schedule must be maintained as much as possible during the BGC. Unless patientseat their normal amount of the normal food at the normal time, aBGC should probably not be obtained. When rst regulating a diabetic patient, assessment of owner technique is crucial. There- fore, it is ideal if the feeding and insulin injection are done in thehospital so the injection can be observed. Obtaining a fastingblood sample for BG measurement prior to insulin injection canalso aid in appraisal of glycemic control. However, this may notbe possible if normal feeding time occurs before a hospital opens or if a dog or cat will not eat in the hospital. If an owner 'st e c h - nique is suspect, the injection time can be changed to occur infront of the veterinarian. Clearly, cooperation between client andveterinarian is necessary to optimize the information obtainedwith minimal disturbance to routine. A BGC should establish duration of treatment effect and the lowest BG (i.e., the nadir). The ideal nadir is a BG of 80 -150 mg/dL. The highest BG should be close to 200 mg/dL in dogs and 300 mg/dLin cats. In assessing a BGC, whether it is the rst curve performed on a patient or the most recent of many, two basic questions need to beasked. First, has the insulin succeeded in lowering BG? And second,how long has the BG been controlled? By answering these questions, logical changes in dosing regimen can be made. Therst aim in regulating a diabetic is to achieve an acceptable nadir. If an acceptable nadir is not achieved, the insulin dosageshould be adjusted (see below). An acceptable nadir with good clini-cal control may not be obtained if the insulin used has a shortFIGURE 1 Monitoring blood glucose levels in diabetic dogs and cats.2018 AAHA Diabetes Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats JAAHA.ORG 9duration of activity. Hypoglycemia must always be avoided. No mat- ter what other BG concentrations are during the day, if BG is ever ,80 mg/dL, the insulin dose must be reduced. Once an acceptable nadir is achieved, duration of action, roughly dened as the amount of time BG is controlled, can be determined. Duration cannot be evaluated until the nadir is optimized. The BG should be controlled for as close to 24 hr per day as possible. The Somogyi or overswing phenomenon, also called hypoglycemia-induced hyperglycemia, refers to hypoglycemia followed by marked hyperglycemia. It results from a physiologi- cal response when an insulin dose causes BG to be ,60 mg/dL or when BG concentration decreases quickly. In either case, counter-regulatory hormones, which act to increase BG (e.g., cortisol, epinephrine, andglucagon), are released. Hyperglycemia usually occurs rapidly and can be followed by a period of insulin resistance. In cats, however, hypogly- cemia does not always trigger a Somogyi phenomenon and resistance may not occur. 35T h es a m ei sl i k e l yt r u ef o rd o g s .I faS o m o g y ip h e - nomenon is observed, insulin dosage must be decreased. Once the nadir is .80 mg/dL, counter-regulatory hormones will no longer inter- fere, and the true duration of effect will become apparent. Glucose curves are not perfect and must always be interpreted in light of clinical signs. Blood glucose curves vary from day to day and can be affected by deviation from the patient 's normal rou- tine.36,37Stress hyperglycemia falsely elevates results. See the Online Resource Center on AAHA 's website for examples of interpreting various glucose curves. At-Home Blood Glucose Curves Obtaining a BGC at home is strongly recommended both for dog and cat owners, but even more so in the case of feline patients due to the chance of stress hyperglycemia in a hospital setting. For home BGC, capillary blood is suitable.38Commonly used sites of blood col- lection are the ear, gums, non -weight bearing or accessory foot pads, or elbow callus. If using devices designed for pricking human nger- tips, one with a variable needle depth should be chosen. A hypoder- mic needle can also be used, especially if the marginal ear vein is the site of blood collection.39 Not all owners are suited to the task of obtaining a home BGC, something that takes time and patience to master. The most frequentproblems encountered by owners are the need for more than one puncture to obtain a blood drop, obtaining a suf cient volume of blood, the need for assistance in restraining a pet, and the pet 'sr e s i s - tance to obtaining a blood sample. 39Curves can vary from day to d a ye v e nw h e nd o n ea th o m ea n dm u s ta l w a y sb ei n t e r p r e t e di nl i g h t of clinical signs.40Practice team members can refer to the Diabetes Management Guidelines Online Resource Center on the AAHAwebsite for more detailed information and resources for pet owners on at-home monitoring utilizing BGCs. Continuous Glucose Monitoring System \u2014FreeStyle Libre BGCs can help identify subclinical hypoglycemia, but large day-to- day variation, in addition to hypoglycemia missed during the night,can complicate interpretation. Continuous glucose monitoring sys-tems (CGMs) that record glucose readings over multiple days canhelp identify problems during the night and allow better assessment of day-to-day trends. The FreeStyle Libre (FSL) is a CGM system that measures inter- stitial glucose concentration every 15 min for up to 14 days. Success-ful use of the FSL has been reported in both dogs and cats. 41-43A 2019 study also reported their use in hospitalized patients with dia-betic ketoacidosis. 44Although not calibrated for veterinary patients, they appear to be generally accurate. However, there are signi cant discrepancies between the FSL and AlphaTrak 2 in some patients, and variation in patients with low glu-cose readings may be more common and more clinically signi cant. Conrming low FSL glucose readings with an AlphaTrak 2, particularly when clinical signs of hypoglycemia are not evident, is recommended. Sensors are easily placed, even in less agreeable patients, and are generally as affordable as a BGC, with signi cantly more useable information. FSL readers and sensors can be purchased from a veter- inary distributor or from a human pharmacy. Clients should beaware that sensors do not always stay functional and attached for thefull 14 days, but the information gained from even a few days of useis usually more helpful than a single BGC. Urine Glucose Measurements Urine glucose measurements can be helpful, but it should be remem-bered that dipsticks have a relatively low accuracy in dogs, oftenunderestimating UG. 45Also, UG concentration is only a re flection of the average BG over the time interval the bladder was lling. Relying solely on UG measurements is not recommended. Regardless, UG concentration can aid in assessment of a patient when other data con flict. Also, regular determination of UG concen- tration (at least weekly) can help in assessment of ongoing DM con-trol (see Table 3 ). Consistently negative UG readings may indicate that insulin dosages are excessive. However, a negative UG reading only means that BG was below the renal threshold (i.e., BG couldhave been 150 mg/dL or 40 mg/dL). The only way to know is to mea-sure BG. 46Lastly, especially for cats for whom stress hyperglycemia prevents obtaining an accurate BGC, UG measurements can be usedto adjust the insulin dose. However, such an approach is a last resort because of the potential for causing hypoglycemia. Although far from 10 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018ideal, there are scenarios where this is the most practical monitoring scheme. Table 3 lists the suggested protocol for using UG test stripreadings in cats is based on the Task Force 's clinical experience. Glycosylated Proteins The glycosylated proteins include fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). Fructosamine, the glycosylated protein used in veterinary medicine, is formed by nonenzymatic, irreversible bindingof glucose to serum proteins, mainly albumin. 47Rate of formation is proportional to the average BG level, so the higher the mean BGconcentration is over time, the greater the fructosamine concentra-tion should be. Because fructosamine concentration is also affectedby the half-life of albumin, it re flects glycemic control over the previ- ous 1 -2 wk. Unfortunately, well-controlled diabetics can have ele- vated fructosamine concentrations. Conversely, uncontrolled diabetic pets can have normal levels. 48Fructosamine may be elevated in sick, hyperglycemic, but nondiabetic cats.48For these reasons, fructos- amine trends are more useful than isolated values. Because fructos-amine is typically not affected by stress, it can help to differentiatestress hyperglycemia from diabetes.One of the best uses of fructosamine is to evaluate trends in gly- cemic control if measured at each recheck. Declining fructosaminevalues indicate a lowering in BG overall, whereas increasing valuesindicate the opposite. A fructosamine concentration below the refer-ence range is highly suggestive of chronic hypoglycemia, in whichcase a BGC should be performed. Additionally, this scenario may bean indicator that a feline patient may be nearing diabetic remission.Cats with hyperthyroidism or conditions that cause hypoalbumine-mia, increased protein turnover rates, or hypoglobulinemia may havedecreased fructosamine concentrations. Corrections can be performedby the laboratory performing the analysis. Commercial testing of canine and feline A1C is available. This glycated hemoglobin is commonly used to monitor diabetes inhumans. More studies are needed to assess clinical use in pets. Home Monitoring Observation of clinical signs is crucial to effective monitoring of DM.Owners should be encouraged to keep a daily log of appetite, observa-tion of thirst (i.e., increased or normal), and insulin dose administered.Where DM monitoring is concerned, clinical signs supersede all else.When the patient has no clinical signs and the body weight is steadyTABLE 3 Interpreting Urine Glucose Measurements UG Result Remarks Suggested Action No color change - Negative for glucose There should be concern that the insulin dose is too high.If the reading stays negative, reduce dose of insulin and recheck in 2-3 days. NOTE: Negative UG in the absence of BGC results could potentially become a dangerous hypoglycemic condition and should bemonitored accordingly. First level color change - 100 mg/dL Ideally, the UG would stay between negative and 100 mg/dL.No change in insulin dose but need to monitor weekly for any changes. Second and third level color change - 250 and 500 mg/dLIn the Task Force 's opinion, this is the hardest level to evaluate without acorresponding BG test.Consider any dietary changes or deviations ( \"cheats \"). If none are noted, and the cat is not exhibiting clinical signs, recheck dailyfor 2 -3 days. If the owner is willing, obtaining additional BG data at this time would be ideal depending on the presence or absence of clinicalsigns. However, if the owner refuses to perform blood work,consider increasing the insulin dosage by half a unit q12 hr at this time. Third, fourth, and fth level change - 1,000 -2,0001mg/dLCat should have clinical signs at this point.Increase insulin by 1 unit q12 hr and recheck in 5 -7 days. NOTE: Continuing to increase the insulin dose more than two or three times is not recommended due to the possible presence ofSomogyi or insulin resistance. Abbreviations: BG, curve; UG, urine Diabetes Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats JAAHA.ORG 11or increasing, DM is likely well controlled. In cats, one of the parame- ters considered to be the most useful and practical indicator of clinical DM control is the amount of water consumed over 24 hr.31Cat owners a r eo f t e nh a p p yw i t ht h el e v e lo fc l i n i c a lD Mc o n t r o l ,d e s p i t en o th a v -ing laboratory evidence of tight glycemic control, emphasizing that thelong-term goal of DM treatment is to normalize clinical signs. 31How- ever, because a placebo effect can occur, judging the adequacy of DMcontrol should not rely solely on owner observations. Monitoring on the Initial Day of Treatment /C15Initiate insulin therapy. /C15Measure fructosamine. /C15Perform a BGC to ensure that hypoglycemia does not occur. /C15If BG is ,150 mg/dL at any time: o Decrease dose by 10 -50% in dogs. o Decrease dose by 0.5 U in cats. o In both species, re-curve the next day and daily thereafter until a nadir.150 mg/dL is reached. /C15If BG is .150 mg/dL, discharge the patient and re-evaluate in 7 -14 days (sooner if concerns for hypoglycemia arise).

Insulin Adjustments if the Nadir Is ,80 mg/dL (see Figure 2) /C15If clinical signs of hypoglycemia are present, treat as necessary. /C15Once the BG becomes .250 mg/dL, reinitiate therapy. o Decrease the dose 10 -25% in dogs depending on the BG level and if there are no clinical signs of hypoglycemia. o Decrease the dose 50% in dogs if there are clinical signs of hypoglycemia. o Decrease the dose 0.5 -1 U in cats depending on BG and if there are clinical signs of hypoglycemia. o A BGC should be obtained after the next dose to ensure hypo- glycemia does not recur. If hypoglycemia recurs with the lowerdose, continue to decrease dose and obtain a BGC until hypogly- cemia is not seen. Obtain a BGC in 7 -14 days. /C15If BG never returns to .250 mg/dL, consider remission, especially in cats. Monitor for hyperglycemia recurrence, in which case reiniti-ate insulin therapy as for new patient. Insulin Adjustments if the Nadir Is .150 mg/dL /C15If clinical signs are present: o Increase the dose 10 -25% in dogs depending on the size of the patient and the degree of hyperglycemia. o Increase the dose 0.5 -1 U in cats depending on the size of the patient and the degree of hyperglycemia. o If giving insulin once daily, consider q12 hr therapy. /C15If clinical signs are not reported: o Consider stress hyperglycemia OR placebo effect. o If weight is stable, leave dose unchanged and recheck in 1 -3 mo. o If weight is decreasing, consider dose increase and recheck in 14 days. /C15Consider the presence of insulin resistance if: o In dogs, insulin dose .1 U/kg/dose with no response or .1.5 U/kg fails to bring BG below 300 mg/dL. o In cats, insulin dose .5 U/dose. Insulin Adjustments if the Nadir Is 80 -150 mg/dL /C15If clinical signs are controlled, no adjustment needed. /C15If clinical signs are not controlled, do not adjust the insulin dose. Consider the following possibilities: o BGC is not re flective of overall control; BGC varies day to day. o There is inappropriate insulin duration of action. If giving insu- lin once a day, consider q12 hr therapy. If giving q12 hr, may need to consider changing insulin. o There is overlap of insulin action. If BG is still decreasing at end of day, the subsequent dose may cause hypoglycemia. May need to give a lower dose in the evening. o Presence of another disease is causing the clinical signs. Ongoing Home Monitoring /C15Log food and water intake and appetite daily. /C15Log insulin doses daily. /C15Note any signs suggestive of hypoglycemia; contact veterinarian if persistent. /C15Periodically test urine; record glucose level and ketones. If ketones are present, contact veterinarian. Key Points about Monitoring /C15The hallmark of an appropriate DM-monitoring approach is to interpret all monitoring modalities in light of clinical signs. /C15In cats and dogs, DM is probably well controlled if the pet is not showing signs of PU, PD, or PP and weight is stable. /C15Senior cats and dogs of advanced age need to be closely monitored. /C15Performing spot checks for BG is not a reliable monitoring modality; obtaining BGCs is a reliable monitoring strategy. /C15Obtaining BGCs at home is preferred to doing so in the clinic. /C15It is important not to place undue importance on isolated hypergly- cemic values without considering clinical signs and stress-related BG increases. /C15Monitoring BG is the only way to identify hypoglycemia. 12 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018/C15If hypoglycemia exists in an insulin-treated patient, the insulin dose must be decreased, even in cases where one low value is obtained onan otherwise normal BGC. /C15In veterinary medicine, stringent BG control is not as critical as in human medicine, although senior cats and dogs should be moni-tored more closely than younger animals. Troubleshooting The uncontrolled diabetic is one with poor control of clinical signs. This may include hypo- and hyperglycemic pets, those with insulin resistance (decreased responsiveness to the insulin, de ned by.1.5 U/kg per dose in dogs or .5U/dose in cats), or those with fre- quent increases or decreases in insulin doses. Any dog or cat withpersistent clinical signs (PU/PD/PP) and unintended weight lossshould be re-evaluated using the following protocol (see algorithm inFigure 3 ): 1. Rule out client and insulin-handling issues rst. A common mis- conception is that a patient who does not respond to insulin has insulin resistance, but this is not necessarily true; other insulin- related factors should be considered.a. Observe client 's administration and handling of insulin, includ- ing type of syringes used.FIGURE 2 Managing hypoglycemia in diabetic dogs and cats.2018 AAHA Diabetes Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats JAAHA.ORG 13b. Assess insulin product and replace if out of date or if the appear- ance of the insulin changes (i.e., becomes flocculent, discolored, or, in the case of glargine [Lantus] or detemir [Levemir],cloudy). 2. Review diet and weight-loss plan. 3. Rule out concurrent medications that could cause insulin resistance, such as glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, and progestins. Speci cally ask owners about steroid-containing eye and ear drops and proges- tins that might be transferred from an owner via medicated cream used as hormone-replacement therapy in women. a. If the concurrent medication can be discontinued, the patient should be reassessed 2 wk later. For example, if the patient is placed on a short course of steroid eye drops before or after cat- aract surgery, the insulin dose does not usually need to be changed despite a short period of increased clinical signs. b. If the comedication cannot be discontinued within 2 wk, the insu- lin dose may need to be increased. Consultation with or referral to a specialist may be helpful in these situations, particularly if the diabetic patient has a concurrent immune-mediated disease that is being managed with glucocorticoids. 4. If not already done, obtain a BGC to rule out hypoglycemia. At-home monitoring is preferred. If hypoglycemia is detected, the insulin dose needs to be decreased. 5. Rule out concurrent disease. a. Repeat a physical exam. Speci cally, evaluate the teeth and gums for dental disease. Ovariohysterectomies must be performed in intact, diabetic female dogs and cats. Note that anesthesia is not contraindicated in otherwise healthy, stable, nonketoacidotic dia- betic patients. See AAHA 'sO n l i n eR e s o u r c eC e n t e rf o rs a m p l e protocols for managing diabetic patients under anesthesia. b. Perform baseline laboratory testing (CBC, serum biochemistry with electrolytes, and urinalysis with culture both in dogs and cats; BP, UPC, and total T4 in cats), if not already completed recently. c. Consider second-level diagnostics, such as abdominal and thoracic IRIS staging. These diagnostic tests, in conjunction with baseline diagnostics, will help identify many causes of insulin resistance, including renal disease, pancreatitis, urinary tract infection, and neoplasia.Acute and chronic pancreatitis can both destabilize a previ- ously controlled patient and make it dif cult to regulate a pet initially. Diagnosis is sometimes challenging and requires a multifaceted approach because not all abnormalities will be present in a given patient. Evaluation of clinical signs in con-junction with clinicopathologic abnormalities, species-speci c PLI, and abdominal ultrasound is critical. Pets with chronic pancreatitis may have variable insulin requirements that increase when the patient has a flare-up and decrease with improvement. If insulin doses are increased, hypoglycemia can occur when insulin resistance resolves with improvement of the pancreatitis. Thus, conservative dose adjustments shouldbe made, and home monitoring for hypoglycemia is ideal. 49 d. Consider speci c diagnostics for hyperadrenocorticism (HAC), acromegaly, and thyroid disease. Hyperadrenocorticism can cause insulin resistance in dogs and cats, and cause persistent PU/PD in diabetic dogs who otherwise appear to be wellregulated. Both species may have alopecia and dermatologic disease, and fragile skin is a hallmark feature of HAC in cats.Note that ALP is often increased in diabetic dogs, so increasedALP alone does not suggest HAC. Generally, endocrine testing for HAC should not be performed before diabetic regulation has been attempted for approximately 1 mo, because unregu-lated diabetes can lead to false-positive results in dogs who donot have HAC. ACTH stimulation tests and low-dose dexa-methasone suppression tests can be used for diagnosis in dogs.The ACTH stimulation test is more speci c (fewer false posi- tives) but less sensitive (more false negatives) than the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. 50The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is preferred in cats, butrequires a higher dose of dexamethasone than that used indogs (0.1 mg/kg). 51A c r o m e g a l yi sm o r ec o m m o ni nd i a b e t i c cats than once believed, and may occur in up to 32% of dia- betic cats.52,53Acromegalic cats are sometimes on high insulin doses, reported to be as high as 35 U q12 hr.52They may lose weight initially, but gain weight (or maintain weight) later inthe course of the disease despite inadequate regulation andsevere PU/PD/PP. Owners may report recent onset of snoring. Physical examination may reveal a large head with prognathia inferior, cranial organomegaly, or stertorous respiration.Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration is mostoften used for acromegaly screening in the United States.Consider testing once a cat has had approximately 6 wk of exogenous insulin. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can both cause signi cant insulin resistance. Diagnosis of hyper- thyroidism in cats is often possible with a total T4 at initialdiagnosis of diabetes, but diagnosis of hypothyroidism indiabetic dogs can be challenging. Many euthyroid diabeticdogs will have a decreased total T4 concentration due to euthy- roid sick syndrome, so a decreased total T4 alone cannot conrm hypothyroidism. In most cases, testing for hypothy- roidism should be delayed for a few weeks after the diagnosisof diabetes to decrease the effects of euthyroid sick syndrome.If there is clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism in a diabeticpatient, a total T4, free T4 by equilibrium dialysis, and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) should be evaluated concurrently. 54 e. If the cause of insulin resistance is identi ed, the clinician should focus on resolving and treating that cause, then return to regulat-ing the DM. 6. If the patient has never been regulated and has only been adminis- tered one type of insulin thus far, consider switching insulin type.This may be attempted prior to item 5c, based on clinicianpreference. 7. Finally, consult with a specialist if the patient cannot be regulated. Recognizing and Managing the Patient at Risk for Diabetes Mellitus Patients with clinical DM must be differentiated from those with mild-to-moderate increased BG without glucosuria or clinical signs. Although the latter group may be at risk for developing clinical DM and may require additional diagnostic and therapeutic measures, 14 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018FIGURE 3 Troubleshooting diabetic dogs receiving the \"upper range \"1of insulin doses.2018 AAHA Diabetes Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats JAAHA.ORG 15FIGURE 3 Continued. 16 JAAHA | 54:1 Jan/Feb 2018they do not require insulin therapy. One well-recognized example is transient stress hyperglycemia in the cat. Stress hyperglycemia should be ruled out in patients presenting with mild hyperglycemia by rechecking BG, potentially in the home environment, or by measur- ing fructosamine concentration. When evaluating patients at risk for DM, clinicians should obtain a thorough history to ensure that the patient is not receiving any medications such as glucocorticoids that can cause insulin resis- tance. At-risk patients should be carefully evaluated for any concur- rent diseases or conditions that may result in insulin resistance, like obesity.55,56These include diestrus in intact female dogs as well as HAC. Chronic pancreatitis has also been implicated as a risk factor for DM in cats.8,49 For patients at risk for developing DM, steps should be taken to prevent the patient from becoming overtly diabetic. Avoid administer- ing medications such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or progestins. Patients should be treated for concurrent disease such as obesity, HAC, and chronic pancreatitis. For dogs and cats, the next step is often dietary modi cation. The goals of dietary therapy include opti- mizing body weight, minimizing postprandial hyperglycemia, and exercising control of calorie, protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake. The section on \"Dietary Therapy Goals and Management \"that appears earlier in these guidelines provides detailed recommendations for maintaining optimum body weight in at-risk dogs and cats and those with clinical DM. Patients identi ed as having chronically mild-to-moderately increased BG without clinical DM should be monitored regularly. Ongoing monitoring of BG and urinalysis should be tailored to the needs of the patient. If overweight, this monitoring will determine if the hyperglycemia corrects as weight reduction is achieved. This is also essential to identify patients that do not respond to conservative therapy or who develop overt DM. Unfortunately, for patients at risk for DM who do not have a treatable underlying condition such as obesity or corticosteroid administration, there is not currently a known way to prevent DM.Client Education The goal of client education is to give the pet owner a realistic idea of the commitment involved in managing their pet 'sD M ,a l o n gw i t h positive encouragement that successful disease management is possi- ble but can take time to achieve. Owners need adequate access to trained veterinary support staff to answer questions and troubleshoot common problems. Client education should provide owners withwritten information on commonly asked questions, what to watch for at home, and how to respond to changes in the patient 'sc o n d i t i o n . Veterinarians should direct owners to helpful web links, including the new AAHA Online Resource Center. Veterinarians should stress the importance of appropriate nutrition and weight management. Key Points of Client Education Insulin Mechanism, Administration, Handling, and Storage /C15Explain how insulin works and its effects on BG. /C15Instruct owners in the proper handling for the speci c type of pre- scribed insulin. o When using Vetsulin, the vial should be shaken until a homoge- neous, uniformly milky suspension is obtained (noted in theVetsulin package insert). o When using other insulins (glargine [Lantus], PZI [ProZinc], NPH [Novolin, Humulin]), roll but do not shake vial. /C15Wipe vial stopper with alcohol prior to inserting syringe needle. /C15Do not freeze insulin preparations. /C15Do not expose insulin to heat; avoid leaving in parked car or pro- longed exposure to direct sunlight. /C15Recommend storage in refrigerator for consistency in environment. /C15If stored carefully, the Task Force is comfortable using insulins beyond the date of expiration as long as they are not discolored, flocculent, or have any changes of consistency. However, the Task Force also recom-mends referral to package insert for instructions about shelf life afteropening and discarding insulin if it becomes out of date. /C15Recommend new vial if insulin changes in appearance. /C15For human diabetic patients, manufacturer recommendations are to maintain glargine for only 28 days and store at room temperature. /C15Discuss what to do if the patient does not eat a full meal or vomits before or after insulin administration. Types of Syringes /C15Always use a U-40 insulin syringe with U-40 a U-100 insulin syringe with U-100 insulin. /C150.3 and 0.5 mL insulin syringes or insulin pens are best to facilitate accurate dosing, especially in cats and dogs getting ,5 U per dose.57 Clinicians should evaluate if the needles in the pens are long enough for their speci c patients. /C15Syringes are for single use. /C15Do not use \"short \"needles. A standard 29 g, half-inch length needle is recommended. Troubleshooting and Follow-up Action /C15If the pet does not eat, contact the veterinarian. Ideally, instruct owners to measure BG at home.

Some experts use a doseof 0.125 mL/kg. Advise client of the risk of aspiration in anobtunded animal. Feed if there is a response within 5 min. Takethe pet to a veterinarian. /C15Home BG monitors should be veterinary-approved products cali- brated for dogs and cats. /C15Client is empowered to decrease or skip an insulin dose if hypogly- cemia is noted, but should never increase the dose or frequency ofinsulin without clear instructions from the attending veterinarian. Conclusion Management of DM requires the commitment and coordinated efforts of the veterinary healthcare team and the client. For this rea- son, proactive client education is an essential component of a DM treatment plan. Client education includes instruction on insulin administration, signs of favorable clinical response or lack thereof, measuring BG levels, and the importance of non-insulin therapies, including dietary management. Diabetes mellitus has a multifactorial etiology, requiring practi- tioners to consider and assess the possible roles of the patient 'sb o d y condition score, diet, concurrent diseases, medications, neutering sta- tus, and genetic predisposition. When the relevant DM-causative fac- tors have been identi ed, a well-de ned, case-speci c treatment plan can be developed with a reasonable expectation for control, and in the case of cats, a chance for remission. The distinction between clinical and subclinical DM and tran- sient hyperglycemia is an important factor in the approach to treat- ment. Insulin therapy is reserved for patients with clinical DM. Patients at risk for developing DM should be managed using moni- toring strategies and non-insulin modalities, with an emphasis on dietary management. Diagnosis of DM focuses on a combination of predisposing factors, characteristic clinical signs, and laboratory diag- nostic values outside the reference ranges. These factors should be considered in their totality rather than as isolated indicators. The mainstay of treatment for clinical DM in dogs and cats is insulin along with dietary modi cation. Goals include controlling BG below the renal threshold for as much of a 24 hr period as possi- ble, which will improve clinical signs of DM, and avoiding clinically signicant hypoglycemia. There are many insulin formulations cur- rently commercially available, two of which are approved for veteri- nary use in dogs and cats: lente (Vetsulin) and PZI (ProZinc). The choice of insulin is often based on duration of effect in the respectivespecies. Dietary management is an essential cotherapy in clinical DM cases, although non-insulin medications may be useful adjuncts to insulin therapy. The goal of DM monitoring is to con rm the absence of clinical signs and avoidance of hypoglycemia, the de nition of a controlled diabetic. Monitoring of BG levels is best done by obtaining a BGC rather than by \"spot-check \"BG measurements. Diabetes mellitus is probably well controlled if the pet is not showing persistent signs of PU, PD, or PP and is not experiencing unintended weight loss.
