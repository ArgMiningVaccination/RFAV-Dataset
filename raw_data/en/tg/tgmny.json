Yet are such high doses of the vitamin genuinely useful? [Vitamin B12](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/overview/) is a healthy and vital vitamin, which [benefits](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/benefits/) the body in many ways. This sometimes leads people to believe that the more they consume, the healthier they will become; a sentiment that is only true to a very limited extent. If optimal doses are exceeded, vitamins can upset the body's sensitive balance and overburden the excretory organs. To this end, megadoses of vitamin B12 should be criticised: they are unnecessarily high for meeting the body's requirement. But are there any instances where this kind of [B12 dosage](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/dosages/) can be helpful? Profile: Megadoses of Vitamin B12 Megadoses can be useful in the following circumstances: - In initial therapy to replenish the [body's store of vitamin B12](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/body-store/)when taken for a limited period of time only - When applied as a therapeutic agent for combating toxicity and nervous diseases To cover the [daily requirement](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/daily-requirement/) and for general deficiency prevention, such quantities of B12 do not make sense.
