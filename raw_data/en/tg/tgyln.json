The program budgets more t han USD 500 million every year for immunizing children against vaccine preventable diseases, including the polio eradication program. Effective vaccine utilization is an integral component of vaccine security and vaccine wastage is one of the key factors to be considered with regards to vaccine forecasting and need estimation. The obje ctives of the vaccine wastage assessment were to provide an estimation of vaccine wastage rate, type and place of occurrence and recommend measures to reduce wastage at various levels. This assessment was carried out in 5 states of India between October 2009 and February 2010. The states were select ed based on the differences in coverage rates of immunization and geographic distribution. Retrospective data from a 6 months period between April 2009 and September 2009 was collected through field visits to selected sites. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Findings suggested that there were poor documentation of vaccine wastage at all levels. Wastage rates vary from state to state and among different vaccines. Highest vaccine wastage oc curs at service delivery level (27% for DPT and 61% for BCG at outreach session site) as compared to the supply chain levels (Measles3.5%, others <1 %). Poor documentation of vaccine wastage at supply chain is one of the responsible factors for this very low value. Session size, vial size, formulation (liquid vs. lyophilized, oral vs. injectable) also influences vaccine wastage. To reduce vaccine wastage with optimal increase in cold chain space and management, it is recommended that the size of the outrea ch sessions should be optimized to cover target beneficiaries. Smaller vials have lower wastage; however it should be balanced with available cold chain space. Any change in formulation should be coupled with refresher trainings of health workers and revis ed micro planning. WHO recommended multi dose vial policy may be considered in fixed sites. Page 1 Vaccine Wastage Assessment BACKGROUND 1 Background India has one of the largest Universal Immunization Programs in the world. The program budgets more than US$ 500 million every year for immunizing children against vaccine preventable diseases, including the polio eradication program. The country is presently developing new strategies to increase immunization coverage and reach more children with quality vaccines. These efforts are challenged by the problems of securing adequate quality and quantity of vaccines for the program. In addition, deficiencies in vaccine management and high wastage increase vaccine demand and inflate overall program cost. Vaccine management and logistics were some of the key issues that were critically appraised in the National UIP Review conducted in 2004. Some of the specific shortcomings observed were: a. Large differences between reported and evaluated coverage was impacting vaccine supply; b. Instances of shortages and stock -outs of different vaccines were affecting the immunization activities at different levels; c. Wastage was high and not monitored; d. There was no matching of vaccine requirements and supplies at lower levels; e. Calculation of vaccine requirements was not linked to micro - planning or realistic coverage or wastage data. The national cold chain assessment carried out in 2008 conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and UNICEF recommended conducting vaccine wastage study to arrive at actual wastage rate. 1.1 Rationale of the assessment Effective vaccine utilization is an integra l component of vaccine security and vaccine wastage is one of the key factors to be considered for vaccine forecasting and need estimations. The lack of knowledge of wastage rates provides inadequate estimations of needs and subsequent stock -outs and/or overstocks. High vaccine wastage inflates vaccine demand and increases unnecessary vaccine procurement and supply chain costs. Page 2 BACKGROUND Vaccine Wastage Assessment In the context of India, any reduction of vaccine wastage will have a positive impact on the ongoing efforts towards vaccine security. One of the priority actions in India's multi -year strategic plan 2005 -10 is to improve vaccine stock management through developing and implementing guidelines to specify standard processes for ordering and maintaining stock levels; monitor stock -outs and wastage. A better sense of vaccine utilization and wastage rates can lead to better planning and management of vaccine stocks. This assessment will give some information about the current wastage level, which could then lead to appropriate guidance and trainings to reduce vaccine wastage. 1.2 Objectives of the assessment Provide an estimation of vaccine wastage rate, type and place of occurrence Provide realistic estimates of vaccine wastage rates to guide procurement and supply of vaccine Recommend measures to reduce wastage at various levels Page 3 Vaccine Wastage Assessment METHODOLOGY 2 Methodology 2.1 Selection of sites The assessment was carried out in 5 states of India. The states were selected based on the differences in coverage rates of immunization and were geographically distributed across the nation. Table 1: Criteria for selection of stat es * NFHS 2005 -2006 Figure 1-: DPT -3 Coverage of selected states for assessment (NFHS 2005 - 2006) State DPT -3 coverage* Geographical South Himachal Pradesh 85.1 Hilly and cold climate Page 4 METHODOLOGY Vaccine Wastage Assessment 2.2 Scope of data collection The assessment req uired data collection from all levels of the vaccine supply chain network. The reasons of wastage of vaccine at supply chain level (national/state and district store s) are substantially different than at the service delivery level. This required separate preparation of data collection forms for the supply chain level and the service delivery level. Figure 2: Scope of data collection using the forms designed for assessment A total of four data collection forms were developed to record the supply and vaccination details of routine immunization. Broadly, data collection forms were classified into quantitative and qualitative, one each for supply chain level and service delivery level. These forms are attached as annexes to this report. 2.3 Baseline assumptions The assessment covered all the vaccines in the national immunization schedule of India. The assumptions of vaccine vial size (number of doses per via l and storage volume per dose of vaccines ) is based on the vaccines supplied for UIP program in India. Table below lists the baseline assumptions used in this assessment. 4GMSD 5States 9districts 17PHCs 34Sub centersData collection forms for vaccine storage level Form A1 (Quantitative) Form A2 (Qualitative) Form B1 (Quantitative) Form B2 (Qualitative) Government Medical Store Depot : National level Vaccine arrives mainly from international sources State level Vaccine arrives from National suppliers directly and also from GMSD District level Vaccine arrives from state store and issues to PHCs and CHCs Primary Health Center Vaccine arrives from district and issues to Sub centers and mobile teams (last vaccine storage point) Sub center level Outreach sessions at sub center and Anganwadi center Sites selected For study Data collection forms for service delivery level Page 5 Vaccine Wastage Assessment METHODOLOGY Table 2: Baseline assumptions Vaccine Type Number of doses per FIC Number of doses per vial Mode of administr ation Storage volume per dose (cm3) Cost per dose BCG Lyophilized Injectable 5.0 9.09 DPT Liquid 5 10 Injectable 3 1.68 TT Liquid 3.5 10 Injectable 3 1.25 HepB Liquid 3 10 Injectable 3.8 4.95 OPV Liquid 4 20 Oral 1 3.6 FIC- Fully Immunized Child The assessment covered the data of vaccinations done at outreach session sites only and it does not include the fixed vaccination sites in hospitals and PHCs (except in Tamil Nadu where vaccination sessions were predominantly held in PHCs under supervision of doctors). 2.4 Timeline for retrospective data collection The study was conducted for the period of 6 months from April 2009 to September 2009. The retrospective data was collected through field visits to selected sites. 2.5 Team preparation and field visits The field visits were planned in consultation with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), state gove rnments and partner agencies. A total of 5 teams were formed. The field visits were carried out in the period of October -November 2009, except M eerut district of Uttar Pradesh that was visited in the month of February 2010. Visits were planned to cover two distr icts from each of the selected states except of Himachal Pradesh where only one district w as visited. Himachal was selected for geographical challenge s of hard to reach areas and sparsely populated terrain. Page 6 METHODOLOGY Vaccine Wastage Assessment Figure 3: Selected sites for assessment 2.6 Methods of data collection The quantitative data was collected from sources ranging from stock book registers , indent challan books to ANMs record book of immunization activities. Wherever available, temperature logbooks and electronic temperature records were reviewed. This information can explain the reasons for vaccine wastage whether due to freezing or exposur e of vaccine to high temperature.

Each site was given a unique number for tracing the data for verification. All the analysis and res ults included in this report were directly produced through this custom made tool. The comments and qualitative data were captured in this report in narrative form though relative sections. 2.8 Method of computation of wastage Vaccine wastage is an expected component of any immunization program. In order to ensure that no child is missed during an immunization session, the vaccine is procured with estimated wastage . However, this should be balanced with optimal wastage, safety concerns, and timely use of vaccines. The key in optimum use of vaccine supplied is by preventing vaccine shortages while limiting overstocks. Vaccine wastage can be minimized by determining avoidable causes of loss of vaccine and taking corrective action. Wastage is often defined as \"loss by use, decay, erosion, or leakage or through wastefulness\" .To understand vaccine wastage, it is important to unde rstand vaccine usage . Vaccine usage is defined as the proportion of vaccine administered against vaccine issued . Equation 1 illustrates formulae used for Computing vaccine usage and wastage . Vaccine wastage is the opposite of vaccine usage. Thus, the Vacci ne Wastage Rate can be defined as 100 minus the vaccine usage rate. The wastage rate directly determines the \"wastage factor\" which needs to be established for each vaccine in the immunization schedule to accurately plan vaccine needs. Page 10 Vaccine Wastage Assessment METHODOLOGY Vaccine wastage can primarily be divided into two categories of: (1) wastage in unopened vials; (2) wastage in opened vials. It is useful to know what type of wastage is more prevalent in immunization settings to better plan corrective action. Common causes of wastage in unop ened and opened vials of vaccines are listed in table below (source: Vaccine wastage in Bangladesh published in Elsevier 2010) . Table 5: Reasons of vaccine wastage Vaccine wastage in unopened vials Vaccine wastage in opened vials The expiry date has reached ; Vaccine exposed to heat and vaccine ; vial monitor (VVM) reached unusable stage ; The vaccine has been frozen ; Breakage ; Missing inventory ; Theft ; Discarding unused vials returned from outreach session . All the cause s listed in the left column and: Discarding remaining doses at the end of the session ; Not being able to draw the number of doses in a vial; Poor reconstitution practices ; Submergence of opened vials in the water; Suspected contamination ; Poor vaccine administration pract ices. The wastage of vaccine happens at multiple levels during transportation, storage and at vaccination session sites (service delivery levels). The method of computation of wastage rates at supply chain and session site is different, as shown in equat ion below. Equation 1: Formulas used for computing vaccine wastage rates Vaccine wastage rate = Wastage at Service delivery levelT otal doses damaged or expired or lost during the assessment period T otal doses supplied during the assessment period (opening stock + doses received) Vaccine utilization rate =T otal doses immunized (T otal doses issued -total doses returned) Vaccine wastage rate = 100 -vaccine utilization rateWastage at supply chain level Page 11 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT 3 Assessment result s The assessment of vaccine wastage at all levels of the supply chain for the six months period reflects that maximum wastage occurs at the session site (BCG vaccine had the maximum wastage of 61%). At supply chain level, maximum wastage found was of Measles vaccine (3.46% of total supplied) at the state vaccine store. All other vacci nes had vaccine wastage of less than 1% at supply chain level. The other key findings from the field are: a. There has been poor documentation of vaccine wastage at all levels . It is difficult to reflect the wastage rates based on documentation. The results in the assessment were derived from computation based on stock movements and vaccination records (refer to equation 1 for formula of deriving wastage). b. The wastage is dif ferent for each vaccine, but the supply of vaccines is computed by 25% wastage r ate for all vaccines except BCG . BCG requirement is computed either based on session size or using 50% wastage rate ; c. The wastage rate varies across the states; d. Unopened vials we re not returned from many sessions (7% of issued OPV vials discarded unopened) ; e. Data mismatch: Doses consumed and number of children immunized1 does not match a t few places ; f. Each session should have at least one vaccine vial of each antigen. This was not a lways followed as assessment reflected that only 47% of sessions had atleast one vial of all the vaccine available during the session. The vaccine wastage rates observed during assessment at various levels are summarized below. 1 Assessment teams r eferred to various sources of information recorded at session sites. Data reported had inconsistencies. Page 12 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT Table 5: Wastage rates Vaccine Vaccine wastage rate State store District store Session 3.463% - - 35.09% 3.1 Wastage rates of vaccine at session site The BCG vaccine had the maximum wastage rates followed by OPV and Measles, TT, HepB below shows the averag e wastage rate of each vaccine while the arrow line shows the maximum and minimum wastage as found in states. Page 13 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT Figure 5: Average wastage rate at session sites Himachal Pradesh had maximum wastage of all the vaccine except for TT and BCG. TT and BCG are also at higher side compared to average wastage of all the states. This high wastage of vaccine is clearly due to sparsely populated area of Himac hal Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh being the most populated state had the lowest wastage rate. This implies that the wastage rate is inversely proportionate to density of popula tion. The difference between the maximum and minimum wastage rate is as much as 39% (DPT) and as low as 14% (BCG). This demonstrate that the wastage of lyophilized vaccine remains high in all the states but wastage of vaccine, that can be used through mul tiple sessions, can be reduced through opti mum planning of sessions. The detailed assessment of individual vaccine is included in section 3.6 ASSESSMENT RESULT 3.2 Wastage across type/form of vaccines The vaccines in immunization schedule are of different sizes and com e in liquid and lyophilized form. Comparison of wastage rate across these different forms of presentation is explained below: Liquid and Lyophilized : Four vaccines, namely, OPV, DPT, TT and HepB are supplied in liquid form and two vaccines, BCG and Measles are freeze dried or lyophilized vaccines. The average wastage rates of liquid form were found to be less (38%) then the lyophilized form (50%). This is because the lyophilized vaccine needs to be discarded within four hours after re -constitution. Figure 6: Wastage across type/form of vaccine at service delivery level Vial size : The vaccines are supplied in three different sizes of vials; five doses (Measles), 10 doses (BCG, DPT, TT and HepB) and 20 doses (OPV) per vial. Among these, there was negligible difference in 3850 35 3547 47 35 liquid Lyophilized 5 dose 10 dose 20 dose Oral Injectable OPV Page 15 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT wastage between five doses and 10 doses vials (both averaging approximately 35%) whereas OPV in 20 dose vial had the wastage rate of 47%. This instigated the detailed analysis on the optimum vial size for each vaccine, which is cov ered in section 3.3. Mode of Administration : All the vaccines except for OPV are administered through injection. OPV is orally given. The average wastage rate of injectable vaccine is 35% and oral (OPV) is 47%. Since OPV is the only vaccine that is supplied in size of 20 dose per vial and only vaccine that is administered orally, there is insufficient ground to conclude that mode of administration affects vaccine wastage. 3.3 Size of vaccine vial The vaccines used in India come in the different vial sizes (refer to Table 2). The number of doses per vial can be crucial in reducing the vaccine wastage. The combinat ion of the average size of the outreach sessions, the cold chain storage space required and cost of vaccine can help in deciding the optimum size of vaccine vials to be used in the immunization program. 3.3.1 Projected wastage rates with different vial sizes Table below shows the vial sizes typically available for each type of vaccine in the UIP schedule. Table 7: Size of vaccine vials (doses per vial) Vaccine Available vial sizes ( Doses per vial ) Used in India 1 2 5 10 20 BCG 10 Measles 5 DPT 10 TT 10 HepB 10 OPV 20 The vaccination coverage data from the assessment (number of doses immunized per session) is used below with different vial sizes to arrive at projected wastage of vaccine. It is shown that the wastage is least with a vial size of 5 doses. But the possible reduction of wastage Page 16 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT by introducing smaller size vials should not result in incremental need of cold chain storage space. Figure 7 and 8 below show the comparative analysis of projected wastage of vaccines against different vial sizes and the storage volume required per dose. The storage volume of 5 doses per vial size is not available for most of the vaccines. The incremental vaccine storage volume for 10 doses vials from 20 doses vial s is 20% for DPT and TT, 33% for HepB and 100% for OPV. Considering the similar ratio between 10 doses vials and 5 doses via ls, the reduction of vial size will have a substantial incremental impact on storage volume requirements, which will increase the de mand of storage and transportation facilities. Figure 7: Projected wastage with different vial sizes Figure 7 show that all the vaccine except OPV are supplied using the optimal size (number of doses per vial). The vaccine vials with less number of doses (5 for example) does reduce the vaccine wastage however, figure 8 show that vials with lesser doses ne eded higher volume of storage. The equilibrium of quantities wasted and optimizing storage space lies in two factors of supply capacity of these vaccines by man ufacturers and cost of procuring vial with different vial sizes 5 dose/vial 10 dose/vial 20/dose per vial Size of vial as used in routine immunization program Page 17 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT Vaccine Average wastage Cost per dose (INR) Number of doses per FIC Cost per FIC (INR) Cost per FIC including wastage % share in FIC cost % share in FIC including wastage 86.4 Even though Measles vaccine is the most expensive vaccine per dose, the OPV and HepB share the 55 % of total cost of fully immunizing the child. Reduction in wastage of these two vaccine s will have an impact on total budget for the program. Likewise, even though the wastage of BCG vaccine is high among all the vaccine, BCG being the cheapest vaccine in immunization schedule, the reduction in wastage of BCG will have negligible impact on program budget. Figure 8: Storage volume of various vial sizes 4.5 3.5 1.234 3.5 23 1.22.53 12.5 00.511.522.533.544.55 BCG DPT HepB Measles OPV TTCubic Centimeter per doseStorage volume per dose 5 Dose 10 Dose 20 Dose Page 18 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT 3.3.2 Doses administered per session Wastage of vaccines has a direct relationship with session size (number of beneficiaries per session) and vial size. Taking OPV as an example, for about 17.5% of sessions where upto 5 doses per session were given , the wastage was more than 75% (as less than 5 doses were drawn from a 20 -dose vial.) Figure 9: Percentage of sessions where the vaccine vial was opened About 36% of sessions, 11 to 20 doses of OPV were administered per vial, which means that vial size of 20 dose of OPV is suitable for only 36% of the total sessions. For the remaining 64% of sessions a vial size of 10 doses would have resulted in less wasta ge of OPV vaccine. The analysis of vaccination data of lyophilized vaccine (BCG and Measles) shows that in about 86% (measles) and 76% (BCG) of sessions , vaccine was administered less than 5 doses per session. This suggests the ideal size of these vaccine s to be 5 doses per vial. The analysis shows that with an increase in session size the wastage of vaccine will reduce substantially. 76.24%86.17%36.02%31.60%19.32%17.51% 23.38%10.95%45.30%31.29%42.63%32.20% 0.38%2.74%15.87%23.62%28.26%36.31% 2.81%13.50%9.78%13.98% BCGMeaslesTTHepBDPTOPVPercentage of sessions where the vaccine was opened for administration Upto 5 doses administered per session held 6 to 10 doses administered per session 11 to 20 doses administered per session More then 20 doses administered per session* Only those sessions where the corresponding vaccine vial was opened Page 19 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT 3.3.3 Session held and availability of vials The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's (MoHFW) guidelines for immunization se ssion sites recommend the following with regards to vaccine logistics: a. Each session planned and held should have at least one vial of each vaccine available; b. The vial should be opened for vaccination even for one child due for vaccination; c. Unopened vial s should be returned to the cold chain point at the end of the day. The returned vials should be clearly marked with the date of return. The returned vial can be re - issued maximum three times, after that it should be discarded; d. Open vials of DPT, TT, HepB an d OPV should be discarded at the end of the day during routine immunization session; e. BCG and Measles should be discarded within four hours of re - constitution. It was evident through the assessment that one vial of each vaccine per session recommendation i s not followed at session sites. Only 47% of sessions held had atleast one vial of each vaccine available. Figure 10: Availability of vaccines at session sites Among the states assessed, Himachal Pradesh has the lowest number of sessions held (10%) wh ere all th e vaccine vials are available. Other sessions 53% Sessions with atleast one vial of all vaccine was available 47% Page 20 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT Uttar Pradesh had maximum number of sessions with all the vials taken (about 65%). Figure 11 : Proportion of sessions with all vials taken It is evident that the one vial of each vaccine per session guideline was not always observed. This indicates that there is certainly a scope of improving the session size such that there is equal demand for vacci nes across sessions. This will result in reduction of wastage. 3.4 Cost impact of vaccine wastage The vaccine is procure d in India based on a coverage assumption of 100% of the target population and a wastage factor of 1.33 for all vaccines except for BCG. For BCG, the requirements are based on session planning. Adding the cost of vaccine (per dose) is to the derived wastage rates fro m this assessment, the total amount spent to procure vaccines about 61% is the base cost of immunizing every fully immunized child (FI C) and 39% is to cover the vaccine wasted. Graph below shows the breakup of base cost per FIC and additional cost incurred as a result of wastage for each vaccine in with atleast one vial of all the vaccines was taken Other sessions Page 21 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT Refer to Table 2 for the baseline cost of each vaccine as used in this assessment. Figure 1 2& 13: Cost per FIC 3.5 Impact on vaccine storage volume The storage volume of each vaccine (per dose) is mentioned in Table 2. The total vaccine storage volume needed is the aggregation of the number of doses required per FIC for each vaccine and its relevant wastage rat e. The analysis suggests that about 34% of extra space is required per FIC to accommodate the additional vaccines resulting from the wastage rate as observed from this assessment. The additional volume required per FIC is shown in graph below.

Figure 1 5: BCG - Wastage rate by state Among the sessions where the BCG vaccine was administered, about 76% of the sessi ons used only up to 5 doses. About 24% of the sessions administered between 6 and 10 doses.

There is a gap of 34% between the maximum and minimum wastage. There is a noticeable differe nce in the session sizes of these two extreme end states (UP having the large session sizes as compared to Himachal Pradesh). With a vial size of 5 doses per vial, the wastage is evidently least in the state with higher vials availability Sessions held Number of sessions with atleast one vial was available Number of sessions where atleast one vial was open Page 25 Vaccine Wastage Assessment ASSESSMENT RESULT Figure 20: Measles - Wastage rate by states Among the sessions where the Measles vaccine was administered, about 86% of the sessions used upto 5 doses per session .

The documentation of vaccine wastage is poor at all the levels. The reporting of vaccine wastage was observed at some places but was not adequately reported from many sites. b. The wastage of va ccine at supply chain is negligible from the selected sites and during the selected time frame of assessment. However, an assessment of the wastage at supply chain should be conducted for a larger period of time (at least one year). c. The wastage of vaccine is substantially proportionate to the session size observed. Higher wastage is observed with smaller session sizes. d. Wastage rate varies among different vaccines. Wastage of Lyophilized vaccine is substantially higher than of liquid formation of vaccine. Also wastage among 5 dose, 10 dose and 20 dose vial differs. Vaccine with 5 dose vial (Measles, though being a Lyophilized vaccine) has lower wastage rate compared to 10 dose vials. OPV being a 20 dose vial has the highest wastage rates in doses per vial category e. There have been instances of vaccine returned unopened and vials discarded unopened. This indicates the scope of improving the session size and logistics management. Page 41 Vaccine Wastage Assessment RECOMMENDATIONS 5 Recommendations 1. Maximum vaccine wastage occurs at the outreach session sites, optim ization of outreach session (Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly based on injection load) will greatly influence overall vaccine wastage. 2. Adopting WHO multi dose vial policy should be considered to reduce the vaccine wasta ge at the session site. 3. Small er vial size though occupies more cold chain space however has lower wastage, therefore smaller vial size is recommended for: a. Vaccines which have only one dose in UIP schedule (e.g. BCG and institutional HepB and OPV) . b. New er and underutilized expensive vaccines (eg. Pentavalent, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus vaccine etc) 4. In mass vaccination campaign s targeting high numb er of beneficiaries , wastage is minimal hence larger vial size will be appropriate to save on cold chain space . 5. Any change in vaccine vial size, or formulation should be complimented with revised micro -plans and training of frontline workers.
