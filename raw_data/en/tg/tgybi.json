The hair becomes shinier and silkier right from the first application. The pleasant heat development makes the application a wellness experience and ensures that the care substances can penetrate the hair structure particularly well. Natural extracts of blueberry, blackberry and sea kelp restore the original colour brilliance of the hair and reduce split ends. The thermal function of the Thermal Treatment Wrap ensures a better transfer of active ingredients into the hair structure. Afterwards, it is sufficient to rinse the hair out briefly and style it as usual. The application is therefore very simple. The Thermal Treatment Wrap is suitable for any hair structure and offers professional intensive care at home, as you only know it from the hairdresser, in only 20 minutes! How to use: Use Ikoo infusions Thermal Treatment Wrap Detox & Balance Mask immediately after opening. Single use only. Rinse hair and towel dry. Slip the wrap over the head to hold all the hair, and fix it with the sticker. Leave on for 15-25 minutes and massage frequently. Rinse thoroughly. Depending on the type of hair, use at least 2-3 times a month.
