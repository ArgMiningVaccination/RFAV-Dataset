Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has a long history of use in certain parts of the world and has gained increasing interest over the last decades in Western countries. In countries with a Western-based type of medical system, people with epilepsy (PWE) take natural products or engage in other forms of CAM mainly to enhance general health, but also to prevent seizures or to alleviate symptoms of comorbidities or side effects of antiepileptic medications. In other countries, well developed medical systems, such as traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda, are often the basis for treating PWE. Based on anecdotal reports of efficacy in PWE, natural products from these and other traditions are increasingly being studied in animal models of epilepsy, and candidates for further clinical development have been identified. It is likely, therefore, that natural products will be further evaluated for safety, tolerability and efficacy in PWE with drug-resistant seizures.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2010-05-12", "cleaned_text": "Natural Products in Epilepsy\u2014the Present Situation and Perspectives for the Future /journal/pharmaceuticals/special_issues/antiepileptics )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Surgery is highly effective and safe for selected patients with treatment-resistant focal epilepsy [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], but is still underused, even in high-income countries [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Many PWE may not be candidates for surgery because a single site of origin of their seizures cannot be localized or exists within eloquent regions of the cortex. Other treatment strategies are primarily palliative (vagal nerve stimulation) or still under investigation (closed loop cortical stimulation) [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Although the newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may offer a better adverse events profile in comparison to the older generation AEDs, they may still have significant undesired CNS effects such as decreased cognitive abilities and psychiatric complications [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Notwithstanding these limitations, the ease of use and ready availability of medications, as well as the prompt reversibility of dose-related side effects, will keep AEDs as the mainstay of epilepsy treatment for the foreseeable future. Therefore, new drug therapies with efficacy against drug-resistant seizures, favorable adverse events profiles, especially in regard to neurological and psychiatric effects, and, if possible, low costs to patients and high worldwide availability are clearly needed. [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Four domains of practices are recognized: mind-body medicine (meditation, prayer, mental healing, art, music, dance), biologically-based practices (use of substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, animal compounds), manipulative and body-based practices (chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, massage), and energy medicine (biofield and bioelectromagnetic therapies). Separately recognized are whole medical systems, such as homeopathy, naturopathy, Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), each of them characterized by a complex and unique system of diagnostics and therapeutics. For example, the practitioners of TCM use herbal medicine, acupuncture and moxibustion as therapeutic methods. [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Despite the large amount of published information on the use of different CAM interventions for epilepsy, the efficacy of these approaches has not been adequately proved in clinical trials. For example, three Cochrane reviews evaluated the published data on the use of acupuncture [ [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], yoga [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], and TCM [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)] for epilepsy and none found sufficient evidence of efficacy of any of these techniques. Indeed, publications of CAM clinical trials for the treatment of epilepsy that have encouraging results generally use inadequate methodologies. Many do not adequately randomize study subjects or use proper controls, while others are not blinded or do not rigorously monitor the results of the interventions. While the requirements of evidence-based medicine have become familiar to conventional/western practitioners, incorporating these principles into trials of other medical systems is problematic because these systems may involve a holistic, personalized approach to treating patients rather than one that is disease focused and therefore applied in the same way to all patients characterized by a specific disease. 2. Use of Natural Products in Countries with Western/Conventional Medical Systems [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. These therapies were used more frequently by people with higher levels of education, women and the Native American population. The most commonly utilized form of CAM was natural products, which were used by 17.7% of the surveyed adults. Concordantly, the annual out-of-pocket cost in the US for purchase of natural products for 2007 was estimated to be $14.8 billion, which is one third of the out-of-pocket amount spent on prescription drugs [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. The frequency of use of specific natural products in developed countries appears to parallel the available evidence supporting their use. Despite an overall minor increase from 2002 to 2007 in the estimated frequency of CAM use by American adults (from 36% to 38.3%), there was a marked change in the particular natural products most widely used between these two surveys. The survey performed in 2007 found that the most commonly used products were fish oil/omega-3 fatty acids (14.1%); whereas according to the 2002 survey, echinacea was used by 40.3%, ginseng by 24.1%, Gingko biloba 21.1%, garlic 19.9% and glucosamine 14.9%. These trends generally parallel findings in the western medical literature. For example, a 2000 Cochrane review concluded that echinacea preparations from aerial parts of the plant were effective for the treatment of the common cold [ [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], while an update published in 2006 expressed much more equivocal conclusions [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Similarly, dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has recently become a mainstream recommendation for many medical conditions and especially cardiac disease [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], following several studies reporting decreased mortality in treated patients [ [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Not surprisingly, then, fish oil/omega-3 fatty acids was the most-often used natural product in high-income countries ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-03-01426-t001)). According to these studies, between 24 and 56% of the adult patients and 12 to 32% of children with epilepsy have used CAM therapies at some time. Although only 2 to 44% of these patients reported using these products specifically for control of seizures, the reasons noted by many patients may be relevant to known comorbidities of epilepsy such as depression or to common AED adverse events such as impaired memory. Some of the differences in the frequency of CAM use between studies may pertain to differences in the definition and types of CAM included in each study. However, another possible factor could be inclusion of patients with different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, as exemplified by studies of patients originating from south Asia in the UK [ [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)] and an ethnically diverse population in Brooklyn, New York [ [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. These ethnic and cultural differences could influence the frequency of CAM use as well as the types of CAM used [ [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-03-01426-t001)). We performed a Medline search on the characteristics of all 35 mentioned products, in regard to main uses, adverse events and potential for drug interactions, as well as known or presumed effects on seizures and on AEDs and report our findings in [Table 2](#pharmaceuticals-03-01426-t002). Of the six reports, five included more specific numerical data on the use of natural products. We were therefore able to calculate percentage of overall estimates of use in PWE. Although integrating information from studies performed on different populations and over the course of 10 years has clear methodological limitations, this estimate may provide helpful information for physicians who treat PWE. [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. While all three herbs have been reported to have beneficial effects on seizures, it is concerning that each has been reported to aggravate seizures as well. Interestingly, in the case of Gingko biloba, there is evidence to suggest that part of the plant may be epileptogenic (the seeds) while other parts (the leaves and the stem) may protect against seizure activity [ [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. In contrast, the effect of St. John's wort on seizures may depend on the extraction method [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Gingko biloba and St. John's wort [ [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)] may also have clinically relevant interactions with hepatically-metabolized AEDs. [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)] could potentially be explained by a lower self perceived level of general health among PWE, as previously suggested [ [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. These products have not been reported to have either beneficial or detrimental effects on seizures. However, their presumed effects on the P450 system could potentially lead to interactions with AEDs metabolized by the liver. [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], kava kava and kava kava [ [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)] have also been associated with aggravation of epilepsy. Evening primrose is used for alleviation of menopausal symptoms, and some of its compounds have mechanisms of actions consistent with anticonvulsant properties [ [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. |Publication||Studied population||% using CAM||Associations||Doctor's knowledge||Most known)||Reason for use||Outcome measures||Most used non-vitamin, non-mineral natural products (in & interactions||Overall estimated extent of use in PWE*||Possible effects of natural products). $This reference reports on neurological conditions in general, including epilepsy. with [47](#B47-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]), and omega-3 fatty acids (treatment of epilepsy and prevention of SUDEP [ [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]). However, others have been linked to pro-convulsive effects, such as ephedra and caffeine [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. In addition, grapefruit juice is a potent inhibitor of the enteric P450 system, therefore increasing the bioavailability of many drugs, including certain AEDs [ [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. However, patients typically report overall subjective benefit in these studies; whether this is consistent with the general population's view of CAM as \"natural\" and therefore beneficial requires further study. [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Two publications noted that treatment with natural products was generally widely affordable [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], whereas a third one reported on a relatively high annual cost of 1170 euro [ [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. 3. Use of Natural Products in Countries Where Traditional Medicine Is Widely Practiced [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. [52](#B52-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. The theory of TCM for PWE is difficult to understand from a western perspective because of the TCM approach to diagnosis and treatment, and the related principles of holism and differentiation. Four subtypes of epilepsy are recognized, but, as is the case with the classification of seizures in Ayurveda, they do not match directly to the ILAE classification of seizures and epilepsies. Treatments typically involve mixtures of different herbal extracts (each containing many active compounds), some to directly treat the seizure disorder and others to maintain the general wellbeing of the host. The treatment may be applied in three phases. First, seizures are treated by herbs and acupuncture; then, herbs, acupuncture and moxibustion are used for tonic strengthening of organs; and finally, daily life guidelines are recommended to prevent relapse [ [52](#B52-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. However, as mentioned earlier, there is insufficient evidence at the present time to recommend the use of TCM for treatment of epilepsy [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Nevertheless, extracts used for seizure control in TCM, as well as single compounds derived from these extracts, are being tested alone and in combinations for anticonvulsant effects in animal models of epilepsy. [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Some healers only recognize epileptic seizures as those that would be classified in the west as generalized tonic-clonic seizures [ [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], whereas others may use broader definitions [ [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Treatments are based on spiritual measures and natural products derived from herbs and animals that naturally exhibit behavior resembling convulsions or loss of consciousness. [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)], by oral delivery, inhalation and topical application. However, there is inadequate study of these treatments to understand their relative frequency of use, efficacy and adverse events. 4. Perspectives for the Future [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. This new regulation will prevent significant variation from lot to lot, bottle to bottle, or pill to pill for any dietary supplement [ [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)] has sparked an interest in developing strategies for systematically evaluating the efficacy and safety of these products, and increases the potential for industry to invest in their clinical development. In the case of epilepsy therapies, evaluation of candidate products in animal models of epilepsy should precede clinical studies, as is done with pharmaceuticals. Notably, there was a more than 4-fold increase in the number of papers found on PubMed reporting pre-clinical studies of herbal products or their derivatives from 9 in 1998-1999 to 37 in 2008-2009. Some studies report in vivo effects and others on mechanisms of action. [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]: i. modifications of existing AEDs to enhance their efficacy and safety; ii. New molecular targets and classes of drugs; derived from knowledge of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy and epileptogenesis; iii. Miscellaneous substances first found to have antiepileptic activity and subsequently being evaluated for their mechanisms of action. The investigation of natural products for use in epilepsy has proceeded using the second and third strategies. One such approach is to test natural products for actions relevant to known mechanisms of actions of AEDs. This approach has the advantage of being able to screen a large number of products at once. At the request of healers, Awad et al. tested 34 plants used by the Q'eqchi' Maya to treat epilepsy and anxiety for their ability to inhibit gamma aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) and to bind to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site of the GABA A receptor [ [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. At the highest tested concentrations, they found greater than 50% inhibition of GABA-T by 10 plants and greater than 50% binding to the GABA A receptor by 23 plants. Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between the degree of GABA-T inhibition and frequency of use for epilepsy and between the degree of affinity to the receptor and frequency of use for anxiety, suggesting a plausible scientific basis to their use. However, the correlation coefficients were low, implying that other mechanisms may also be important. The limitation of the approach used in this study is that by design it focuses on a known mechanism of action and therefore is not likely to identify natural products with unique mechanisms of action. [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)]. Sucher screened natural products traditionally used in TCM for stroke, and assessed activity at multiple molecular targets in the glutamate-receptor triggered signaling pathway leading to neuronal injury and death. He found that many of the herbal drugs contained different compounds that act with low affinity at multiple molecular targets in the pathway. Since these processes occur in parallel and may be hypothesized to predispose to the development of chronic epilepsy after different types of brain injury, he proposed that their combined synergistic activity may give rise to neuroprotective and, possibly, antiepileptogenic effects, with a good safety profile. [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-03-01426), [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-03-01426)] and is the subject of the first clinical trial from our program. 5. Summary References - Kwan, P.; Brodie, M.J.
