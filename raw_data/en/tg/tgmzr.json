This systematic review w as conducted as part of the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months (P/B -24) Project by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR). The purpose of the P/B -24 Project was to conduct a series of systematic reviews on diet and health for women who are pregnant and for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiati ve led by USDA and HHS, and USDA's NESR carried out all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a broadly representative group of Federal researchers and program leaders , also provided input throughout the P/B -24 Project. More information about the P/B -24 Project has been publishedii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project -specific - overview -pb-24-0. NESR, formerly known as the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL), specializes in conducting food- and nutrition- related systematic reviews using a rigorous , protocol -driven methodology . To conduct each P/B -24 systematic review, NESR's staff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) , which is a group of 7- 8 leading subject matter experts . NESR's systematic review methodology involves developing and prioritizing systematic review questions , searching for and s elect ing s tudies , extracting and assessing the risk of bias of data from each included study , synthesizing the evidence, developing a conclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement, and recommending future research. A detailed description of the methodology used in conducting systematic reviews for the P/B -24 Project has been publishediii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/pb- 24-project -methodology -0. In addition, starting on page 16, this document includes details about the methodology as it was applied to the systematic review described herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope of the question, including the population, the interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes of interest , is found on page 16.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between types and/or amounts of complementary foods and beverages and bone health? What is the answer to the question? Insufficient evidence is available to draw conclusions about the relationship between the types and/or amounts of complementary foods and beverages consumed and bone health. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified and prioritized as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. How was this question answered? A team of Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review staff conducted a systematic review in collaboration with a group of experts called a Technical Expert Collab orative What is the population of interest? Generally healthy infants and toddlers who were fed complementary foods and beverages from ages 0- 24 months and had bone health examined through 18 years of age. What evidence was found? This review includes 2 studies. These studies examined the dietary patt erns consumed by infants and bone health. Complementary foods and beverages are foods and beverages other than human milk or infant formula provided to an infant or young child. There are limitations in the evidence as follows: only a few studies were done, and they varied too much to be able to answer the question. How up -to-date is this review? This review includes literature from 1/1980 to 7/2016. 10 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background Complementary feeding is the process that starts when human milk or infant formula is complemented by other foods and beverages, beginning during infancy and typically continuing to 24 months of age. This systematic review was conducted by the Nut rition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. The goal of this systematic review was to answer the following research question: What is the relationship between types and/or amounts of complementary foods and beverages and bone health? Conclusion Statement and Grades Insufficient evidence is available to draw conclusions about the relationship between the types and/or amounts of complementary foods and beverages consumed and bone health. Grade: [Grade Not Assignable] Methods This systematic review was conducted by a team of staff from NESR in collaboration with a Technical Expert Collaborative. A literature search was conducted using 4 databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed) to identify articles published from January 1980 to July 2016 that examined the the types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages (CFB) consumed and bone health. CFB were defined as foods and beverages other than human milk or infant formula provided to an infant or young child. Bone health outcomes included bone, biomarkers of bone metabolism, and incidence and prevalence of osteoporosis, osteopenia, rickets, and fracture. A manual s earch was done to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened in a dual manner, independently by 2 NESR analysts, to determine which articles met predetermined criteria for inclusion. Data from each included article were extracted, risk of bias was assessed. The body of evidence was qualitatively synthesized, a conclusion statement was developed and the strength of the evidence (grade) was assessed using pre- established criteria including ev aluation of the internal validity/risk of bias, adequacy, consistency, impact, and generalizability of available evidence. Research recommendations were identified. Summary of Evidence Two prospective cohort studies published since 1980 met the inclusion criteria for this review, both of which examined the relationship between infants' and toddlers' dietary patterns and bone health. The ability to draw conclusions about the relationship between the types and/or amounts of CFB consumed and bone health is limited by an overall lack of research. Although both cohort studies included in this review assessed dietary patterns 11 at 12- 13 months, in relationship to a single assessment of bone mineral content at 4 or 6 years of age, it is not possible to draw conclusions for types and/or amounts of CFB and bone health given the non- specific nature of the dietary patterns, as well as the long interval between the assessment of dietary pattern and radiological measurement of bone health. 12 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the r elationship between types and/or amounts of complementary foods and beverages and bone health? Conclusion statement Insufficient evidence is available to draw conclusions about the relationship between the types and/or amounts of complementary foods and beverages consumed and bone health. Grade Grade Not Assignable Summary Complementary foods and beverages (CFB) were defined as foods and/or beverages (liquids, semisolids, and solids) other than human milk or infant formula provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. Because fluid cow's milk may serve as a substitute for, r ather than a complement to, human milk or infant formula in the first year of life, only data for cow's milk consumption between 12 and 24 mo of age were included in this systematic review. However, milk products, such as a cheese and yogurt, were consider ed as CFB. This review includes studies that examined the relationship between consuming different types and/or amounts of CFB and bone health during childhood. Two prospective cohort studies published since 1980 met the inclusion criteria for this review, both of which examined the relationship between infants' and toddlers' dietary patterns and bone health. The ability to draw conclusions about the relationship between the types and/or amounts of CFB consumed and bone health is limited by an overall lack of research. Although both cohort studies included in this review assessed dietary patterns at 12- 13 months, in relationship to a single assessment of bone mineral content at 4 or 6 years of age, it is not possible to draw conclusions for types and/or amounts of CFB and bone health given the non- specific nature of the dietary patterns, as well as the long interval between the assessment of dietary pattern and radiological measurement of bone health. Description of the Evidence Two prospective cohort st udies, from the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the Netherlands, were included in the systematic review that examined the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB consumed and bone health during childhood (through 18 y of age) ( Table 2) (1, 2) . Both studies examined the relationship between infant dietary patterns (derived using principal component analysis) and bone health. Harvey et al. (1) examined adherence at 6 mo and 12 mo of age to the \"Infant 13 Guidelines Pattern\", which conformed to U.K. infant feeding guidelines (i.e., high frequency of consumption of vegetables, fruit, meat/fish, and home- prepared foods). Results showed no significant associations between degree of adherence to the Infant Guidelines Pattern at either 6 mo or 12 mo of age and areal BMD, volumetric BMD, BMC, or BA at 4 y (Table 3). van den Hooven et al. (2) examined adherence at ~12.9 mo of age (range 12.2 to 19 mo) to 3 dietary patterns : Dairy and Whole Grains Pattern: higher intakes of whole grains, dairy, cheese, and eggs, and lower intakes of human milk and infant formula Potatoes, Rice, and Vegetables Pattern: higher intakes of potatoes, pasta, rice, vegetables, meat, meat products, fish, shell -fish, oils, condiments, and sauce Refined Grains and Confectionery Pattern: higher intakes of refined grains, solid fats, confect ionery, snack bar products, savory snacks, and sugar -containing beverages Results showed that higher adherence to the Dairy and Whole Grains Pattern at ~13 mo was associated with higher BMD and aBMC at 6 y; but no associations were found with the Potatoes, Rice, and Vegetables Pattern or Refined Grains and Confectionery Pattern. Further analyses showed that among those who did not receive vitamin D supplements at 14 mo, adherence to the Dairy and Whole Grains Pattern was associated with higher aBMC, but low er BA. Among those who did receive vitamin D supplements , there were no associations between dietary pattern scores and any measure of bone health. Evidence synthesis Only 2 prospective cohort studies published since 1980 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review on types and amounts of CFB consumed and bone health, both of which examined infants' and toddlers' dietary patterns. The dietary patterns examined in each study differed in terms of the combinations of foods and food groups included, making it difficult to compare and contrast the results of the studies. Furthermore, both studies examined dietary patterns in infancy (6- 12 mo of age) or in early toddlerhood (~13 mo) and looked at bone health outcomes that occurred several years later at 4 y or 6 y of age, and did not account for changes in dietary patterns that likely occurred during the follow -up time period. Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to whether the types or amounts of CFB consumed impact bone health. Researc h recommendations Given that evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions, additional research is needed to determine whether the age at which complementary feeding begins impacts bone health later in life. This includes research that addresses key gaps and limitations in the evidence, such as: Well- conducted and adequately powered studies that focus on CFB containing nutrients that are likely to impact bone health that are likely to impact bone 14 health. Accounting for whether infants were fed breastmilk and/or infant formula, and other aspects of the overall diet quality consumed from the time at which CFB are introduced to the time when bone health is assessed, including whether infants received vitamin D supplements. Adjusting for key confounding factor s in observational studies, including: education, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, child sex, gestational age, birth weight, growth pattern (or status), diet quality and vitamin D and calcium intake, sunlight exposure, and physical activity. Including diverse populations with varying racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Including sufficient duration of follow -up, through the second year of life and into childhood, to assess the longer -term effects of complementary feeding on bone health, including functional outcomes (i.e., risk of fracture). 15 Table 1.

The results of an electronic database search were screened independently by two NESR analysts in a dual, step- wise manner by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full text articles to determine which articles met the criteria for inclusion. A manual search was done to ascertain articles not identified through the electronic database search. The systematic review on tim ing of introduction of CFB included three articles, and the systematic review on types and amounts of CFB consumed included two articles. The literature search was conducted for multiple systematic reviews that addressed complementary feeding and various health outcomes; the systematic reviews on developmental milestones and growth, size, and body composition are described in separate reports . 28 Excluded articles The table below lists the excluded articles with at least one reason for exclusion, but may not reflect all possible reasons.
