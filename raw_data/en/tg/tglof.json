NIH 22,000 11 MN EHR Consortium Project: COVID-19: Tracking Influenza and COVID in Real Time Covid -19 surveillance data for Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). Major goals: To share summary aggregated data relevant to COVID- 19 surveillance from health systems with Departments of Health (e.g., MDH). This information fills gaps in surveillance sy stems without the sharing of individual -level data. The data is used to inform the allocation of health care resources during surges, to monitor viral activity and immunity in the community, to examine COVID -19 disparities, and to assess testing and treatm ent capacity. MDH 183,833 12 MN EHR Consortium Project: Vaccine Breakthrough - Demonstration Project 1 of 2 (part of COVID -19) Provide vaccine breakthrough data to Minnesota Department of Health MDH (part of COVID-19) 13 MN EHR Consortium Project: SUD: Trends in Substance Use - Related Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits in Hennepin County, Minnesota To assemble summary data from healthcare partners in Hennepin County to look at real -time trends in substance - related hospitaliz ation and ER admissions. Generate a county -wide, aggregate dataset. Hennepin County will then use this data to guide opioid and substance use prevention and response program prioritization and implementation. Hennepin County 24,750 14 MN EHR Consortium Project: Vaccine coverage study: Understand vaccine coverage among people experiencing homelessness and those impacted by incarceration This project addresses the State's need for coordination of the Minnesota Electronic Health Record (EHR) Cons ortium, Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) and Department of Corrections (DOC) data to understand vaccine coverage among Minnesotans experiencing homelessness and those impacted by incarceration. CRIA contribution: Integrate and merge vaccine/D OC/HMIS data with Allina COVID -19 intermediate files and provide up to 60 completed weekly reporting templates, which include information on vaccine distribution by social determinants of health related to homelessness and incarceration.

Vaccine Effectiveness study. Title: Virtual Network to Investigate the Trajectory of COVID-19-Related Severe Outcomes (VISION): MN EHR Consortium VISION COVID -19 Vaccine Efficacy Provide population health surveillance data to CDC. Major Goals: Participating health systems will run vetted R code once per month on the existing MN EHR consortium files (i.e., intermediate and hospitalization) to evaluate incidence rates of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection and COVID related hospitalization stratified by COVID- 19 vaccination status. Combined results from all sites, including summary tables and estimates from models, will be returned to CDC or Westat, providing summary data of COVID -19 infection incidence. CDC 40,174 17 MN EHR Consortium Project: OMOP CDM implementation: Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) Develop a common data model to enhance summary data sharing and analysis functions across collaborating health systems. The OMO P common data model will allow the MN EHR Consortium to conduct disease surveillance, research, and respond to evolving needs for sharing summary data relevant to public health surveillance with health systems, the Minnesota Department of Health, and local public health agencies more efficiently .
