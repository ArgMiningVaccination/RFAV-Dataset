Therefore, I thought you might find the following information from Chinese herbalist, [Dom Joire](http://www.acupuncturemeditation.net/) helpful: Do not have a vaccination on a day you are feeling unwell or rundown. Based on growing evidence, you can optimise your immune system with natural herbal products. For 3 weeks before and after your vaccination take the following: \u00b7 Reishi mushroom: 1200mg twice a day \u00b7 Vitamin C : up to 1000mg a day (preferably from bioavailable sources) \u00b7 Vitamin D: 10 micrograms a day (preferably from bioavailable sources) \u00b7 A diet rich in multi coloured vegetables and good pre-biotics, as a healthy gut health leads to a healthy immune system (e.g. turmeric, garlic, berries, apples, asparagus, green vegetables etc) On the day of your vaccination: \u00b7 drink plenty of diaphoretic herbal teas like peppermint, elderflower and camomile (ideally all together) \u00b7 make time to rest after the vaccine - go to bed early for a few days and have siestas if you can I received my vaccination two weeks ago, and whilst I felt fine, I was happy to have had a couple of days afterwards to take it easy and have some early nights. If possible, I would highly recommend you do the same.
