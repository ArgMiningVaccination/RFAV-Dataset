Children and pets often explore and experience new things by putting them into their mouths. This can be a problem with some plants. Each year poison centres across North America get thousands of calls about plants and whether they are poisonous (toxic) or not. Finding out about the plants you have in your home or garden can help keep your child or pet safe. Non-toxic plants are not poisonous if you eat them. They may still cause mild symptoms like minor skin, eye, or mouth irritation. Toxic plants can cause many symptoms like nausea and vomiting, and more severe skin and mouth irritation. Some toxic plants can cause heart problems, confusion or kidney damage if eaten. If the plant you are looking for isn't on the list, or you have questions or concerns about exposure or eating these plants, please call [ PADIS (Poison and Drug Information Service)](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/findhealth/service.aspx?source=mha&Id=1656&facilityid=1011654) 1-800-332-1414 (Alberta).
