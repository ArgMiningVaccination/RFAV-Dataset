INSTRUCTOR BIO: Krysia (pronounced Kri-sha) was born and raised in Poland where the rich legacy of herbal healing was still alive when she was young. Every child in her backyard knew to apply plantain leaf to a scraped knee and drank chamomile tea when her tummy was hurting. At the same time Krysia was exposed to a mysterious book of her doctor grandmother's called Vademecum that listed all the side effects of pharmacological drugs. The list of side effects was much longer than the description of benefits. The choice between an herbal or pharmacological approach was clear to a young and uninhibited mind. Soon after Krysia moved to the United States she became shiatsu practitioner and natural foods cook, both disciplines deeply rooted in 5 elements-based Traditional Chinese Medicine. It was no surprise when the fascination with medicinal plants flared up within her, in the last several years, prompting Krysia to go back to school to study herbalism at UMass and also with Master herbalists Chris Marano and Bonnie Bloom, from the Pioneer Valley area. The farm and Herbalism CSA were a logical next step as she realized that - in the drastically changing world - locally sourced plant medicine might not only be a safer, better quality option but possibly the only one. Many years ago she was initiated to the Bodhisattva Medicine Buddha paths, events that heightened her commitment to the health and well being of her fellow humans and inspired the design of this website banner. Krysia has lived in Great Barrington for the last 25 years offering her healing modalities to the Berkshire community.
