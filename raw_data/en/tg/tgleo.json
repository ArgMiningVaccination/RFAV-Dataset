Immunizing Your Child but Still Concerned? Chinese medicine bridges the gap in the controversial debate to immunize or not. TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM) IS AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY PRE AND POST IMMUNIZATION TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND DECREASE UNWANTED SIDE EFFECTS. Acupuncture/acupressure and Chinese herbal medicine support the immune system by bolstering the energy of the body so that it can effectively fight off the strain of virus that has entered the body via immunization, also known as a pathogenic factor in Chinese medicine terms. According to Chinese Medicine it is especially important to treat the body prior to being immunized because unlike contracting an actual childhood illness, where the body encounters the virus or bacteria at the surface and is able to mount an immune response, immunizations enter deeply at the blood level, bypassing the body's initial defense response, known as \"wei qi\" in TCM. ACCORDING TO CHINESE MEDICINE, IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY A STRONG DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. Signs of weak digestion are: reflux, colic, failure to thrive, constipation or diarrhea, gas/bloating, chronic runny nose and cough, allergies, asthma, eczema/any skin issue, fatigue, and easy to catch colds and flu. Traditional Chinese medicine believes the energy or \"qi\" of the digestive organs are not fully formed until the age of seven. Until that time young children are more prone and sensitive to changes in their diet and environment that can further compromise their system. Unfortunately, Western medicine does not consider any of these factors when recommending immunizations for children. Supporting the digestive systems and immune systems in children will benefit their health long term and lead them into adolescence and young adulthood healthy and strong. After my son's 8-week shots, he was really fussy, cranky and lost interest in the bottle. Obviously, my husband and I were concerned, and after some research and talking with our post-partum doula, we ended up at The Nest. They were wonderful. We worked together to develop a treatment plan for my son and within a day he was feeling better and back to his \"old\" self. Based on our positive experience, I would recommend that concerned parents explore the option of using acupuncture/acupressure before and/or after immunizations. -HM Our Office Hours Tues-Fri: 10:30 - 6:30 pm Saturday: 9:00 - 3:00 pm Sun-Mon: Closed Acupuncture & Natural Medicine Clinic located in Rockville/North Bethesda Maryland, and close to Bethesda, Potomac, Chevy Chase, Silver Spring, Columbia, and Gaithersburg, MD, Washington D.C., McLean, Alexandria, Great Falls, Vienna, Virginia and Northern Virginia and more.
