Front a novel Corona [virus] [strain], was first detected in Wuhan, [China], in December 2019. As of December 16, 2021, almost 4,822,472 people had died and over 236,132,082 were infected with this lethal [viral infection]. It is that the [human] [immune critical [role]in the [viruses]invade the host [cells]. Although some effective [vaccines]have already been on the market, [researchers]and many bio- [pharmaceuticals]are still working hard to develop a fully functional [vaccine]or more effective [therapeutic]agent against the COVID-19. Other efforts, in addition to functional [vaccines], can help strengthen the [immune system]to defeat the corona [virus infection]. Herein, we have reviewed some of those proven [measures], following which a more efficient [immune system]can be better prepared to fight [viral infection]. Among supplements]like- fresh [vegetables]and [fruits]offer a plentiful of [vitamins]and [antioxidants], enabling to build of a healthy [immune system]. While the pharmacologically active components of [medicinal plants]directly [aid]in fighting against supplementary supplements the [intermittent fasting], been proven to [aid]the [immune system]in becoming an efficient one. Maintaining each of these [will]strengthen the [immune system], allowing [innate immunity]to become a more defensive and active antagonistic mechanism against corona- [virus infection]. However, because dietary [treatments]take longer to produce beneficial effects in adaptive maturation, [personalized nutrition]cannot be expected to have an immediate impact on global outbreak.
