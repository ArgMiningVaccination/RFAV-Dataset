Humans have always depended on plants for a wide range of primary needs, and a deep understanding of nature was fundamental to people's survival and well-being. Since our earliest origins, people have used plants for all kinds of purposes, including food, medicine, fiber, art, housing, and ritual. Our spiritual connection to plants has led humans to incorporate them into ritual and prayer, weaving the energies of plants into the creation of our cultural identities. The spiritual or magical power of plants has been cataloged through centuries of observation and use. These botanical allies have been attributed magical properties and purposes as people learned about their habitat and growing conditions, how they can be used medicinally, and have analyzed scents, flavors, and colors. Through time and experience, people have assigned specific energies or qualities to certain plants and both ancient and modern cultures have used plants to attract the positive and repel the negative. People craft amulets, hang poppets or charms, make incenses and perfumes, blend elixirs and potions, and make offerings to deities. From smudging to strewing, people have harnessed the power of plants for protection, health, prosperity, love, wisdom, or any other purpose imaginable. Here in Colorado, there are endless varieties of plants that can be added to the garden to offer spiritual support, protection, and benefit.
