How Much Do We Know? - There has been a fair amount of research in people on the use of kava for anxiety, but few studies have been done on other conditions. What Have We Learned? - Kava supplements may have a small effect on reducing anxiety, but they have been linked to a risk of severe liver injury. - There isn't enough evidence to show whether kava is helpful for any other conditions. What Do We Know About Safety? - The use of kava has been linked to liver injury that is sometimes serious or even fatal. The exact cause and frequency of the liver damage are unclear. - Kava can cause digestive upset, headache, dizziness, and other side effects. The use of kava may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery. Long-term use of high doses of kava may cause kava dermopathy, a condition that involves dry, scaly, flaky skin with a yellow discoloration. - Kava may have special risks if taken during pregnancy or while breastfeeding because of the presence of harmful pyrone constituents.
