Rush employees also commit themselves to executing these values with compassion . This translates into a dedication \u2014 shared by all members of the Rush community \u2014 to providing the highest quality patient care . History of Rush University Medical Center Rush University Medical Center is one of Chicago's oldest health care organizations . Its heritage extends back to 1837, when Rush Medical College was established . St . Luk e's Hospital, founded in 1864, and Presbyterian Hospital, founded in 1883, merged in 1956 to form Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital . The subsequent incorporation of these pioneer institutions in 1969 created Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Medical Center, which was renamed Rush University Medical Center in September 2003 . Rush is an academic health system comprising Rush University Medical Center, Rush Copley Medical Center and Rush Oak Park Hospital . Renowned Patient Care Rush University Medical Center encompasses a 675-bed hospital serving adults and children, including the Johnston R . Bowman Health Center, which provides medical and rehabilitative care to older adults and people with short- and long-term disabilities . It includes Rush's 376-bed Tower hospital building, which opened in 2012 as part of the Medical Center's major campus renovation . Rush's commitment to sustainability innovation earned the Tower LEED Gold certification . It is the largest new construction health care project in the world to be LEED Gold certified . Rush' s renova - tion also includes Rush's Orthopedic Building, which opened in 2010, and the ongoing campus-wide implementation of an elec- tronic medical record system, enhancing patient care and safety . A unique combination of research and patient care has earned Rush national rankings in eight of 16 specialty areas in U . S . News & World Report's 2017-18 America's Best Hospitals issue, among other recognitions of our quality of care and accreditations . Our nurses are at the forefront of our efforts to provide quality care, receiving Magnet status four times for making outstand- ing nursing care the standard at the Medical Center . Rush w as the first hospital in Illinois serving adults and children to receive Magnet status - the highest honor in nursing . And some of the world's best athletes trust themselves to the hands of our physicians . Rush is proud to be the preferred hospital for the Chicago Bulls and the Chicago White Sox . Educating Future Health Care Providers Rush University is home to one of the first medical colleges in the Midwest and one of the nation's top-ranked nursing colleges, as well as graduate programs in allied health, health systems management and biomedical research . In addition, the Medical Center offers many highly selective residency and fellowship programs in medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties . Rush's unique practitioner-teacher model for health sciences education and research gives students the opportunity to learn from world-renowned instructors who practice what they teach . Committed to Community In addition to patient care, education and research, Rush main- tains a strong commitment to the community . Many students , faculty and staff at Rush generously donate their time and skills both within and outside of our campus . Their efforts include numerous health outreach projects in which Rush collaborates with neighborhood clinics, churches, schools and other organi- zations to provide health screenings and vital health information for underserved children and adults .9 Our education and research endeavors, community service pro- grams, and relationships with other hospitals are dedicated to enhancing excellence in patient care for the diverse communities of the Chicago area \u2014 now and in the future . Rush University Mission, Vision and Values Mission Rush University provides outstanding health sciences education and conducts impactful research in a culture of inclusion, focused on the promotion and preservation of the health and well-being of our diverse communities.

Core Values As the academic component of Rush University Medical Center, the University shares the Medical Center's core values: innova- tion, collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence . The I CARE values guide the efforts of Rush University students, faculty, researchers and staff . History of Rush University Rush University is the academic component of Rush University Medical Center . F ounded in 1972, the University has expanded from one college and fewer than 100 students to four colleges and more than 2,400 students . It includes Rush Medical College , Rush University College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences and the Graduate College . Rush Medical College is named for Benjamin Rush, a physician from Pennsylvania, and signer of the Declaration of Independence . Rush Medical College w as chartered in 1837 and opened officially on Dec . 4, 1843, with 22 students enrolled in a 16-week course . During the first century of oper ation, more than 10,000 physicians received their training at Rush Medical College . Rush Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago from 1898 until 1942, when the medical college tem- porarily suspended its educational program, though it continued its corporate existence . Its faculty continued undergr aduate and graduate teaching of medicine and the biological sciences as members of the faculty of the University of Illinois . The charter of the medical college was reactivated in 1969, when it became part of the Medical Center . Rush Medical College reopened in 1971 with a class of 66 first-year students and 33 third-year students . First-year class size reached its projected maximum of 120 in 1976 . Rush University College of Nursing represents a com- bined heritage dating back to the late 19th century when its first antecedent, the St . Luk e's Hospital School of Nursing, opened in 1885 to offer diploma education to nurses . In 1903, the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing accepted its first students . F rom 1956 to 1968, nurses were taught at the merged Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital School of Nursing . Before the establishment of the College of Nursing in 1972, more than 7,000 nurses had graduated from these three schools . The College of Health Sciences, established in 1975, traces its origins to the School of Medical Technology sponsored by Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital from 1959 to 1972 . This school was the second-largest of its kind in the city of Chicago . During its operation, it provided a one-year professional internship program to more than 200 baccalaureate students in medical technology . Today, the College of Health Sciences offers doctoral programs in audiology and health sciences, 10 programs at the master's level, and bachelor's programs in health sciences, imaging sciences and vascular ultrasound technology . The Graduate College was established as a separate academic unit in January 1981, having previously been orga- nized as the Graduate School within the College of Health Sciences . The Graduate College is responsible for educational efforts in the basic sciences and offers three master's degree programs and one doctoral degree program . The Seal of Rush University The seal of Rush University is a shield, a classic Greek symbol of preservation and protection, and also a medieval British emblem used for identification . It recognizes the University' s overarching commitment to educating health professionals who preserve life and protect patients . Its two colors , green and gold, merge the tradition of the past with the custom of the present: Gold was the single histori- cal color of Rush Medical College, and green is used for the modern Medical Center .10 hospitals in 1957 and the foundation that created the vision for Rush University . Superimposed on top is the stylized version of the anchor cross that was adopted in 1971 upon the merger of Rush Medical College and Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital . The final elements are Chicago, the city that is home to the University, and the date of the University's founding, 1972 . The Rush University Board of Overseers adopted the seal in 1999 .

In certain instances, the implementation of this policy and our goals in this area require the use of affirmative initiatives . At Rush, these initiatives are focused on strong recruitment, development and retention efforts - not on quotas - and these recruitment and programming efforts will be continued, consis - tent with federal, state and municipal guidelines . Rush University is committed to attracting students who will enable the student body to achieve the educational benefits of diversity and to providing services to all students, faculty and other employees on a nondiscriminatory, equitable basis . Discrimination or harassment against any member of the Rush University Medical Center community because of age, ancestry, color, disability as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, gender, gender identity and/or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sexual orientation, vet-eran's status or any other category protected by federal or state law is prohibited and will not be tolerated, nor will any person for those reasons be excluded from the participation in, or denied the benefits of any program or activity within Rush University . Shanon Shumpert, associate vice president for Institutional Equity, has been designated to oversee the implementation of this policy for Rush University and can be contacted by telephone at (312) 942-5239 or via email at Shanon_Shumpert@rush .edu .

As essential as academic honesty is to the trust that is fundamental to the educational process, academic dishonesty violates one of the most basic ethical principles of an academic community and will result in sanctions imposed under the University's disciplinary system .26 Examples of conduct that would subject a student to disciplinary action include but are not limited to the following: All forms of academic dishonesty including but not limited to the following: cheating; plagiarism; collusion; gaining or seeking unfair advantage in relation to any work submit- ted; helping others to gain an unfair advantage; removing examination materials from a secure examination area; the unauthorized downloading or copying of examinations that are given online; fabricating assigned academic work, includ- ing clinical assessments, and presenting them as authentic; facilitating academic dishonesty; and unauthorized examina- tion behavior Obstruction or disruption of teaching, research, adminis - tration, clinical practice and community outreach or other University or Medical Center activities F alsification of student records, transcripts or financial aid forms or applications T heft of, or damage to, University or Medical Center property or the property of a member of the University or Medical Center community T hreatened or physical abuse of any person, or action that threatens or endangers the safety of others Misrepresentation, falsification, alteration or misuse of University or Medical Center documents, records or identifica-tion, or research data Unauthorized use or entry of University or Medical Center facilities Conviction of a crime deemed serious enough to render the student unfit to pursue their profession Conduct that is inconsistent with the ethical code of the profession the student is preparing to enter Unlawful use or possession of controlled substances on the University or Medical Center campus Unauthorized possession or concealment of firearms or other weapons on the University or Medical Center premises at any time Attempting to gain access to another' s email or computer account, username or password Knowingly setting off false fire , safety or security alarms An accusation of student and/or faculty academic dishonesty or misconduct made in bad faith Rush University Honor Code I pledge that my academic, research and/or clinical work will be of the highest integrity .I shall neither give nor receive unauthorized aid; I shall not represent the work of others as my own; I shall not engage in scientific misconduct, and I shall treat all persons with the great- est respect and dignity, just as the ethical codes of Rush University Medical Center and my future profession demand . I recognize that behaviors that impede learning or undermine academic, research and clinical evaluation \u2014 including but not lim - ited to falsification, fabrication and plagiarism \u2014 are inconsistent with Rush University values and must be reported . Implementation of the Honor Code This Rush University Honor Code (from now on referred to as the Code) sets the standards for expected professional behavior within the University and the Medical Center . Commitment to this Code is a shared responsibility of all faculty, staff and students within the Rush University community to ensure the highest standards of behavior - whether in the classroom, the laboratory or in the clinical setting - and to ensure that education obtained at Rush provides a sound foundation for each student's future success as an academic, scientific, or health care professional . Code Enforcement Any violations of this Code or suspicion of student or academic misconduct should be reported to the student's college for further review in accordance with the procedures specified by that college . Each college will be expected to set standards for addressing Honor Code violations and cases of misconduct in a fair and consistent manner that best fits their respective student population . Students refusing to sign must submit a letter to their dean's office explaining why . Adherence to the Code is required for matriculation, whether or not the document has been signed . The Code may also be enforced for off-campus actions when the student is representing themselves as a member of the University . Inappropriate Degree Usage A student may not indicate they have earned a specific degree until the following has been fulfilled: All degree requirements have been successfully completed A completed Degree Approval Form has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar and the official date of graduation for a particular term has been reached . A student who disregards this policy will be referred to the commit- tee that addresses professional ethics violations for that student's program or college . Continuous Enrollment Rush University requires continuous enrollment in the majority of its academic programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation . Exemptions for the summer term only include Health Systems Management majors . Students who are not officially 27 enrolled or have not submitted a Petition for Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal form risk being administratively with- drawn from the University . A student enrolled in a noncredit residency or academic enrich-ment program prior to receipt of a degree must be registered for the Continuous Enrollment course to retain student status . Any degree or certificate student not enrolling in a new course but needing to replace an outstanding incomplete grade must register for the Continuous Enrollment course until the grade is satisfied . A student who is auditing a course and not allowed in other courses during the same term must register for the Continuous Enrollment course to be charged appropriately . Credit by Proficiency A student who passes a proficiency examination at Rush University will earn academic credit toward the degree . Programs have the discretion to offer credit by proficiency (e .g ., standardized examinations, such as ACT-PEP Challenge or Advanced Placement exams) and/or achieved prior learning (such as continuing education units) . Rush Medical College does not offer credit by proficiency . Credit by proficiency and/or achieved prior learning is based on documented equivalence with courses offered by the program . The minimum standards and format for demonstrating profi- ciency are determined by program faculty . F ormats for dem - onstrating proficiency may include departmentally developed examinations, licensure/certification exams, portfolios and competency demonstrations . Credit awarded by proficiency will equal the credit value of the course(s) as listed in the Rush University Catalog under which the student matriculated . Information that is posted on the transcript for approved credit is the prefix, number and title of the course section, the credits awarded and a K grade . Credit for the course will appear in the appropriate term as credit earned . Credit earned by this mechanism will not be used in calculating the student's grade-point average . A fee or partial tuition may be assessed based on what the student would have been charged . Academic Credit Academic credit is awarded to a student upon the success-ful completion of an approved instructional course or by the demonstration of competencies, proficiencies or fulfillment of learning outcomes equivalent to that provided by an approved instructional course .One unit of academic credit is the measure of the total time commitment a typical student is expected to devote to learning per week of study . Total time devoted to learning includes but is not limited to the following: classroom or faculty instruction in either a synchronous or asynchronous mode; time devoted to individual conferences with instructors; reading and completion of learning activities and assignments; posting in online discussion folders; performance demonstrations; examinations; work associated with completion of capstone assignments, theses or disserta - tions; laboratory work; clinical practicums; or any other activity required of the student . One hour of credit is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates the following: not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one term hour of credit or 10-12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit or the equivalent of at least 37 .5 hours of work for one semester or one trimester hour of credit or 25 hours of work for one quarter hour of credit . In this context, an hour of work is defined as 50 minutes . Course credits are not calculated for Rush Medical College, or second- or third-year Physician Assistant Studies courses; how- ever, the number of weeks of clinical experiences appears on the student's transcript . Credit hour assignment for time spent in clinical practicums, internships, seminars and laboratory work vary according to college or program requirements . Grade-Point Average A grade-point average, or GPA, is not reported for Rush Medical College students . Transfer credits from institutions outside of Rush University are not included in the GPA calculation . Transfer credits internal to Rush University are included in the GPA calculation . Separ ate GPAs are calculated for a student's under - graduate and graduate records . The GPA is calculated using all grades in courses that could count toward the program . The GPA is recalculated from 0 when a student successfully completes a program and matriculates into a new program at the graduate or professional level . Transcripts show the GPA for each term in which grade points are earned and show a cumulative GPA for all work taken at Rush University for each program degree level . When a course is repeated, only the most recent attempt is computed in the GPA, though all grades will display on the transcript .28 Grading and Numbering System Gr ade P oints Description A 4 . 0 Excellent B 3 . 0 Good C 2 . 0 Satisfactory for undergr aduates but may not be acceptable at the graduate level D 1 . 0 Minimal pass for some undergr aduate programs . May not be acceptable at gr aduate level . Not used at the gr aduate level by the College of Nursing, the Graduate College, or the Department of Health Systems Management . F 0 F ailure P 0 P assing HP 0 High P ass (only used by Rush Medical College for third- and fourth-year clinical courses) N 0 No P ass H 0 Honors (only used by Rush Medical College) W 0 Withdrew between weeks 2 through 5; also used by Rush Medical College when a circumstance beyond the student' s control prevents completion of course requirements regardless of withdrawal date during the quarter K 0 Credit earned through proficiency examination T 0 Credit accepted in tr ansfer from another college/university CIP/IP 0 Course in progress and gr ade not reported I 0 Incomplete NR 0 No Record (not used after summer 2009) CC 0 Course continues into the next term . Gr ade received at end of series is grade for entire course . AU 0 Audit XX 0 P articipation in an ungraded course or residency XIP 0 Mandatory tr aining course completion is in progress . XC 0 Satisfactory completion of mandatory tr aining course . XS 0 Student separ ated from the University prior to completing the mandatory training course . XN 0 Administr ative enrollment error . Student removed from the mandatory tr aining course .No grade points are assigned for work taken on a pass/no-pass basis, and therefore such work is not computed in the GPA . Undergraduate students who are required to enroll in courses that typically are taught at the graduate level will have these courses count toward their undergraduate programs of study; thus, the credits and grade points will be calculated as part of the undergraduate transcript .Grade Report Students can access the Rush University Portal for their grade report . Gr ade reports are not mailed to students . Printed copies of a student's grade report are unofficial and intended for the student's personal use and should not be accepted by another college/university in lieu of an official transcript .29 Graduation and Commencement Registration Students must be registered for the term in which they graduate . Application for Graduation Only Rush University students who are candidates for a degree may participate in the commencement ceremony . Certificate candidates are ineligible to participate . Although Rush University has multiple graduation dates during which degrees are conferred, the University has only one commencement ceremony . Students are invited to participate in the commencement ceremony under the following conditions: T hey graduated in the fall or spring term immediately preceding the current academic year's ceremony T hey are anticipated to graduate at the end of the summer term that immediately follows the current academic year's ceremony (thesis and dissertation students see below) Students completing a thesis or dissertation must have success- fully defended six weeks prior to commencement and submitted a final copy of their thesis or dissertation to the Library of Rush University Medical Center two weeks prior to commencement in order to participate in the current academic year's ceremony . Students who complete their degree requirements during the summer term after commencement are invited to participate in the following year's ceremony . Students who are not required to complete a thesis or disserta-tion may participate in the current academic year's commence- ment ceremony if they anticipate graduating at the end of the summer term that immediately follows the ceremony . PhD students completing a dissertation must provide the title of their work to the Office of the Registrar by the intent to graduate form submission deadline in order to have that title included in the commencement program . Publication of a student's name, academic credentials and/ or dissertation title in the commencement program does not indicate that a degree has been officially conferred by Rush University . All students who anticipate graduating must submit the intent to graduate form to the Office of the Registrar, via the Rush University Portal, by the published deadline or risk delayed graduation.Students who do not submit either the intent to graduate form or the degree approval form by the published deadline risk a delayed graduation and may be charged a processing fee . Submission of the intent to graduate form signals that the student is ready to graduate; allows, only for purposes of the commencement ceremony, the release of directory information restrictions enacted by students through their signature on the directory information restriction form; permits release of the student's name and address to the external photography vendor with whom Rush contracts and to have the vendor place photographs of the student on its website; permits the University to publish the student's picture in a picture composite; for medical students, permits publication of the student's name, photograph, prior degrees and universities/colleges attended in the Rush Medical College yearbook; permits Rush University to print and/or announce the following: Student' s name as indicated on the intent to graduate form Honors or aw ards received Previous colleges/universities attended Prior degrees earned The degree approval form must be submitted after all academic degree requirements are completed . Requirements include the following: All progr am prerequisites, including general education requirements All courses required in the major progr am of study and completion of required cumulative credit hours Residency requirements Dissertation/thesis defense (if required by college) Submission of the dissertation/thesis to the libr ary (if applicable) Achievement of the minimum cumulative GP A of 2 . 0 for undergraduate students and 3 .0 for graduate students (not applicable to Rush Medical College) Awarding of Degrees Rush University degrees are dated the day following the last day of the term in which the degree requirements are completed . Degree requirements must be fully met before the next term offi- cially begins; otherwise, the student will be required to register for the subsequent term and will graduate at the end of that term . The student's transcript, diploma and other notification of degree conferrals will be held until a student's financial obliga - tion has been met . Outstanding financial obligations have no effect on the awarding of degrees .30 Latin Honors Candidates for the Bachelor of Science degree who have demon- strated academic excellence are honored at commencement by the Rush University faculty . Those earning a 3 . 40 to 3 . 59 cumulative GPA at Rush are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree cum laude; 3 .60 to 3 .79, magna cum laude; 3 .80 to 4 .00, summa cum laude . Only Rush University courses are calculated into the GP A . Latin honors appear on the student's transcript and diploma and are typically announced during the graduation exercises, includ - ing the commencement ceremony and at college/departmental convocation/awards ceremonies . Graduation Prizes and Awards Many prizes and awards are given at the time of graduation . Award winners are identified in the commencement ceremony pro- gram and in college/departmental convocation/awards ceremony programs . Thesis/Dissertation/Scholarly Project Requirements for Graduation Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates must complete a disser - tation . The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program requires completion of a scholarly project . Some master' s programs require a thesis to meet degree requirements . Each thesis/dissertation/scholarly project must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university . Each student will have a committee whose role is to ensure that the student's thesis, dissertation or scholarly project is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the University for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation . Review of a thesis/dissertation/scholarly project will follow the sequence of steps as described by each college, including the prescribed preparation manual for each degree . Students must give a public presentation of the knowledge devel-oped through the thesis, dissertation or scholarly project process to the academic community . Public presentation of the thesis/dissertation/scholarly project must precede the final approval by the thesis or dissertation committee . A copy of the thesis or dissertation must be approved by the director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center for con- formance to publishing requirements and copyright compliance . Scholarly projects are not reviewed by the library . Hazardous Exposure Procedures Exposure Incident Definition: Eye, mouth, mucous membrane, non- intact skin contact or parenteral exposure to blood or potentially infectious or hazardous materials that result from the perfor - mance of a duty related to a student's educational program .

Students must comply with annual health and immunization requirements . Students who do not submit the proper proof of fulfilled health and immunization requirements by the designated deadline will be prohibited from registering for the next term and may be disengaged from the program until these requirements are met . Late registr ation fees will apply . Students should be aw are that clinical sites outside of Rush may have additional requirements . Students with a medical or religious exemption will be required to adhere to state and hospital policies concerning infection control . Incomplete Grades The grade of incomplete (I) is given only when circumstances beyond the student's control prevent completion of course requirements and the student has received permission to defer completion of these unmet course requirements . Students must be enrolled during the term in which course requirements are completed . Students enrolling only to com - plete requirements for a course in which a grade of incomplete was given must register for the Continuous Enrollment course (XXX999) for zero credit hours . Upon completion of the course requirements, the incomplete grade will be replaced by the new grade earned in the course . A student receiving an incomplete grade =in a course may not begin another course for which the incomplete course is a prereq- uisite . A student who fails to remove the incomplete grade within the specified time period will receive a final grade of F or N in the course . It is the student' s responsibility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade . Students in the College of Nursing, College of Health Sciences, the Graduate College and students-at-large must complete the unmet course requirements, typically within one term after the term in which the incomplete grade was assigned, and not to exceed one calendar year, unless an extension is approved . Students in the College of Nursing may not register for new courses if they have two or more incomplete grades . Rush Medical College students will be informed by the course instructor and the Office of Medical Student Programs regarding the specific time frame in which an incomplete grade must be resolved . Additional college-specific policies may apply . Pass/No Pass Grading Option Designated letter grade courses may be taken as pass/no pass based on approval by the course/program director . The pass/no- pass option is college- and course-specific, as is the proportion of courses that can be taken as pass/no pass . The decision to take a course for a pass/no-pass grade cannot be changed after the first Friday of the term .32 Repeated Courses Some courses, such as research and clinical, may be repeated . These are usually indicated in the course description . All grades and grade points are counted in the GPA for these courses . F or all other courses that are repeated, only the most recent grade is counted in the GPA . Both the original course and the repeated course appear on the student's transcript . Repeated Courses: Rush Medical College All instances of a course are represented on the student's official transcript . Course and exam remediations are also represented . Room Reservations Individuals looking to schedule the use of classrooms, lecture halls and auditoriums in the Armour Academic Center should contact the Office of the Registrar, which will assist in making room reservations for classes, meetings and campus events based on room availability . Priority for rooms is given to instructional/ class meetings, followed by standing meetings, ad hoc meetings, student organizations and other requests on a first-come, first- served basis . Student events must have the approval of the Office of Student Life and Engagement regarding the date and time, and approval from either the organization faculty sponsor or the Office of Student Life and Engagement regarding the sponsorship of the event . RULearning (Blackboard) RULearning (Blackboard) is a web-based learning system for course management and delivery . Instructors may use Blackboard to provide students with course materials, discussion boards, online exams, virtual chats and more . The degree to which Blackboard is used in a course varies . Some courses may be conducted entirely online through Blackboard without any on-campus sessions while others may use Blackboard as a supple - ment to face-to-face sessions . Account Creation Students have RULearning accounts created for them automati - cally . Students will gain access to their R ULearning account approximately a month prior to their first term at Rush, but they typically will not be able to review course content until the term begins . Account Deactivation Student RULearning accounts will remain active for the duration of their affiliation with the University . Students' accounts will be deactivated 14 days after their graduation or their affiliation with the University ends .Course Availability and Retention Courses in RULearning are available to students on the term's start date . Courses will be retained in RULearning for one year past their expected end date . Courses will be archived and removed from RULearning after that time . Students will be informed how to download relevant information from their courses that they might need after leaving Rush . System Availability The Blackboard system is available on campus via the Rush network and off campus via public Internet . System maintenance is performed every Sunday between 2 a .m . and 6 a . m . CST . The system may be unavailable during this time . Students-at-Large Individuals who have not formally matriculated to a degree or certificate program but wish to enroll in a course may apply to do so by completing the student-at-large application within the Rush University Portal . Completing the application does not guar - antee admission as a student-at-large . Each college determines which student-at-large applications are accepted or denied . Representatives from each college will contact their applicants directly to inform them of the decision . The Office of the Registrar will register all student-at-large applicants approved by their respective colleges . Rush Medical College and clinical courses from all colleges are not available to students-at-large . A final, transcripted grade will be assigned to any course taken as a student-at-large . Prospective students are responsible for being academically prepared for requested courses . Current degree- and certificate-seeking students have enroll- ment priority over students-at-large, who may be removed from courses if degree- or certificate-seeking students need to enroll in them . Refunds will be issued if payment has already occurred . A student may accumulate no more than 12 credit hours of academic credit as a student-at-large . These hours may be taken within one term or over a period of time . Registr ation as a student-at-large that results in more than the allowable number of hours in the student-at-large status can only be authorized by the dean or associate dean of the college offering the course(s) . Credit earned as a student-at-large will not necessarily apply toward a Rush degree or certificate program if the individual is subsequently admitted to a degree or certificate program . Any incomplete (I) grade earned as a student at large will revert to a permanent failing grade (F) unless completed by the end 33 of the next academic term . It is the student' s responsibility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade . Each college determines the Student-at-Large application window for their courses being offered in a given term . Late applications will only be accepted if authorized by the dean or associate dean of the college offering the course(s) . If a student is admitted and enrolled as a student-at-large, their payment is due to the Office of Student Financial Affairs via the Rush University Portal by the end of the first week of classes of each term . Rush employees seeking to use internal tuition assis - tance (LEAP Online) should apply by the deadline designated by Human Resources . Students cannot be admitted to a Rush University degree or certificate program if they have a current probationary event as a student-at-large . Students who have already been admitted when a probationary event occurs will have their admission rescinded or be dismissed from the program . An applicant must be considered in good academic standing in order to be consid- ered for admission . Student Email Accounts Rush University creates an email account for each student prior to the student's first term . Students are expected to check their email account regularly since Rush University considers email an official means of communication . Often, students receive impor - tant news and deadlines via the campus email system . Students should also use their Rush email account to communicate with faculty and staff rather than using a personal email account . If a student has a problem with their email account, they should contact the Help Desk at (312) 942-4357 or help@rush .edu . Graduates of Rush University and students who end their affili- ation with Rush prior to graduation should have access to their Rush email account for 14 days after graduation .

For graduate-level programs, no more than one-third of the total number of required credits may be granted to a student as transfer credit for work done at another graduate institution . Rush University will not accept transfer credit from non- accredited institution . Continuing education units cannot be transferred in for credit . Undergraduate courses must be completed with a C grade or better to be awarded credit . Graduate courses must be completed with a B grade or better to be awarded transfer credit . Only letter-graded courses are eligible for evaluation as transfer credit; pass/no-pass courses will not be considered . Undergraduate-level courses cannot be transferred to meet the requirements of a graduate-level course at Rush . Transfer credits can only be applied to satisfy the degree require- ments of one program . Once credits are applied, they can't be used a second time for a new degree program . Previously earned program credits at Rush University may only be used to satisfy the requirements of another program if they are at the same level (e . g . , master's or PhD) and if they meet the current curricular standards . The number of credits granted for a given course cannot exceed the number awarded for the course on the transcript of the school where the course was taken or the number earned for the corresponding course at Rush University . Credits earned on the quarter system will be converted into semester credits where applicable . A quarter credit is equal to two-thirds of a semester credit (e . g . , three quarter-system credits equal two semester credits) . Course information, including grades, from transferred courses is not recorded on the student's transcript; only the number of cred- its is recorded and added to the cumulative number of credits . Enrollment Enrollment Status Definitions Students working toward a degree or certificate and who are enrolled at least half-time may be eligible for student financial assistance . These students may also be eligible to have their fed - eral educational loans deferred . Students are considered full-time or half-time based on the below credit criteria for each term .Full-Time Registration for PhD Students A full-time PhD student is one who is matriculated and meets the conditions noted below for each term: Registers for nine or more gr aduate credit hours in an academic term Or registers for a minimum of two hours of dissertation course - work in a fall, spring, or summer term . Note: A student may register for additional courses as needed or required . But if a student registers for less than nine hours, this must include a minimum of two dissertation hours to be considered full-time . A student must be registered for one of the above-defined statuses during fall, winter, spring or summer term sessions to maintain status as a full-time matriculated student . Individual gr aduate programs may set guidelines on research enrollments, including which academic milestones must be passed before permitting enrollment in dissertation hours . Once students successfully defend their dissertation, no further research enrollments are necessary or allowable, and graduation should not be deferred . Each student will be allowed one term of enrollment to finalize all work related to the defense of their dissertation . During this term, the student should apply for graduation, and graduation should not be deferred beyond this point . Effective fall 2015, all dissertation courses will be corrected to be similarly named following University guidelines and hold fixed credit hours starting at a minimum of 2 .0, thereby always confer - ring full-time status . Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid about full-time status for financial aid purposes.

It is the student's responsibility to communicate directly with their college regarding the disposition of the request for the LOA . Students who request a LOA may be displaced into a subsequent cohort, required to take a revised program of study upon return to the University or be delayed in their progression through the program based on availability of courses or clinical placements, or both . Students may be eligible for an LOA only after they have com-pleted and submitting to the Office of the Registrar the petition for leave of absence required by each college . F ailure to complete and submit the petition for leave of absence form will make the student ineligible for any refunds and obligated for the full term's insurance charges . The date that the student begins the process of applying for an LOA is the official date that will be used in processing the form . The day after the end of the current term will be the official date used in processing an LOA form submitted during the current term for the next term or during a break period . For all approved LOAs, the last date of actual class attendance will be the date of record for calculating financial aid disbursements and returns . A student who initiates a petition for leave of absence form after the first week of the term will receive a withdrawal grade on the transcript for any coursework . 38 No classes may be withdrawn during the last three weeks of any term . A student who initiates a petition for leave of absence form on or after the Monday beginning the last three weeks of the term will receive grades in the registered courses and will be subject to an academic progression review based on the assigned grades . Each degree has a time limit for completion that includes LOA time . The decision to include the LOA in calculating the time limits for completion of the degree is within the discretion of each col- lege . The maximum time that will be approved for a single LOA is 12 consecutive months . Each college may have a maximum length of accumulated LOA . Returning From a Leave of Absence Students are responsible for registering themselves for the term in which return from an approved LOA . This registration must occur during the designated priority registration period . Registr ation outside of this period will result in a late registration fee .

If a specific priv acy or confidentiality question is not answered in this text, please contact the Office of the Registrar . Nothing in this policy may be construed to prohibit the University from disclosing information provided to the institu- tion under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act concerning sex offenders who are required to register . Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of students' educational records . Educational records are those that contain information or documentation directly related to a student that is recorded in any way, including records produced by handwriting, computer, email, audio, video, etc . Educational records contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by Rush University or any party acting on its behalf . FERPA protects the privacy of students' educational records by setting strict instructions and limitations governing the release of information about students . Though FERPA contains excep - tions for the release of directory information without a student's prior written consent, students have the right to request that even directory information be withheld from disclosure to third parties . Given the restrictions of FERPA, faculty and staff should assume all students must provide written consent that follows the format specified in FERPA before any educational records may be released to anyone other than the student . Information can - not be released to any third party, including students' parents, relatives and friends . P articularly sensitive information includes students' Social Security numbers, race or ethnicity, gender, nationality, academic performance, disciplinary records, financial aid information and grades . 39 Privacy During the Admissions Process Rush University has chosen to take additional steps to protect a person's privacy by extending to individuals who are applying for admission similar benefits afforded to enrolled students . This privacy protection covers all applicants and their application materials throughout the admissions process . The application process exists between the applicant and a Rush University admissions office; therefore, any communication about candidates and their application status to parties beyond these entities is not acceptable unless school officials has a legitimate educational interest to know this information in order to fulfill their professional responsibilities . All those involved in the admissions process (e . g . , admissions committee members, interviewers, admissions staff) must adhere to these guidelines .

The decision to restrict directory information will apply to all requests from third parties (other than those who already have legal access to these data elements), including prospective employers . A student must formally rescind a restriction of direc - tory information by submitting a subsequent directory informa- tion restrictions form . * Rush University records both visually and audibly many campus events and daily activities, such as classes, commencement, convoca - tions, student events and other public occasions. These images, as well as other information about students, are published (e.g., print media; Rush website) regularly as part of the University's coverage of campus life and portrayal of the University to a variety of audiences. The University's policy is to restrict the use of any photograph/elec - tronic image to the representation, marketing or promotion of Rush activities only.

Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing .40 3. T he right to consent to disclosure of personally identifi - able information contained in the education record, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educa- tional interests .

However , the funds are limited . All Rush Medical College applicants who will be under 30 years old prior to the start of their program must provide parental data and meet the institutional criteria for eligibility . Visit the Office of Student Financial Aid webpage for www . rushu . rush . edu/ office-student-financial-aid students who have not received a prior bach-elor's degree may be eligible to receive grant assistance through federal and state need-based programs . Employment through the Federal Work-Study program may be possible throughout Rush University Medical Center . F ederal Work-Study will be awarded as part of the financial aid package . It is the student' s respon - sibility to secure employment . The Office of Student Financial Aid is available to assist students with locating jobs within the Medical Center . Financial Aid Determination Financial assistance programs at Rush University are provided to assist students who cannot otherwise afford to pay the full cost of education on their own . In gener al, financial need is the basic criterion for the awarding of funds . Accordingly, students and their families will be expected to contribute toward educational expenses to the fullest extent possible . The level of the expected contribution is determined by using a standard set of criteria to analyze financial information provided by students and their families . Submission of parental data for institutional grants and loans is required for Rush Medical College students and any dependent undergraduate students . Complete information about this policy is found on the Office of Student Financial Aid webpage . Student Financial Aid counselors are available to consult with students and parents (with the student's authorization) about financing a 45 Rush University education . Students and authorized parents are welcome and encouraged to make use of these services . Financial Aid Awards After evaluating student and family resources in addition to assistance from outside the University, the Office of Student Financial Aid will award students federal, state and institutional funds they qualify for each academic year . In order to distrib - ute available funds in the most equitable manner, the Office of Student Financial Aid establishes a formula that designates the sequence in which funds are awarded to students and the maximum amount awarded under each program . The formula provides for a specific amount of loans and employment before students are considered for grants . These formulas are applied consistently during any given year among all students at a given class level and in a given college, pending availability of funds . The formulas may be adjusted annually due to differences in the availability of funds from year to year and changes in eligibility requirements . Veterans Benefits Rush University participates in federal veterans education ben- efits through the U . S . Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA .

Satisfactory Academic Progress The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by Congress, mandates institutions of higher education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory progress for students receiving federal financial aid . These standards apply to all federal Title IV aid programs, including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS Loan and Federal College Work- Study programs . Accordingly, the Department of Education regulations require that Rush University's Office of Student Financial Aid monitor 46 the academic progress of all financial aid recipients toward the completion of their degree . This process is called Satisfactory Academic Progress, or SAP . This SAP policy is enforced in conjunction with all other institutional policies and procedures, including the academic progressions policies of Rush University's colleges and aca- demic programs . F or undergraduate and graduate students, the below criteria are checked at the end of each term . F or medical students, the below criteria are checked annually at the end of spring term . Enforcement The Office of Student Financial Aid has the primary responsibil- ity in enforcing the SAP policy . The Office of the Registrar and other Rush University offices that maintain student information relevant to the SAP policy shall provide such information, as requested by the Office of Student Financial Aid . SAP Requirements SAP requirements vary by academic level (undergraduate, graduate and medical students) . Please refer to the appropriate section to find the requirements that fit your academic program . UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for undergraduate students is monitored using three fac-tors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative grade-point average, or GPA . SAP is mea - sured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete the program . The total allowable attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush (excluding the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) by 1 .5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . F or example, for a program that requires 107 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush (not including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program), a student may attempt up to 160 hours . Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 66 .667 percent of the courses they attempt . This will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program . F or the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a gr ade of A, B or C for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass/fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . Proficiency credit (K gr ades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other gr ades, including incomplete grades, are counted in the attempted hours total but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete gr ade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses but remain enrolled at the University will not have those dropped courses counted in the attempted hours total if they are dropped prior to the census date . Dropped courses after the census date will be counted in the attempted hours total . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . T ransfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade-Point Average Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum cumula- tive GPA of 2 .0 . Students who have a term GP A of less than 1 .0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . GRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for graduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative (GPA . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete their program . The total allow - able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush by 1 .5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . F or example, a student may attempt up to 169 hours for a program that requires 113 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush . Please note: non-degree certificate programs are approved by the U . S . Department of Education for financial assistance at a specific number of credit hours . Regardless of a student' s actual 47 plan of study, maximum time frame is calculated using the number of hours for which the program was approved with the US Department of Education . Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 66 .667 percent of the courses they attempt . This will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program . F or the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a gr ade of A or B for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass/ fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . Proficiency credit (K gr ades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other gr ades, including incomplete grades, are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete gr ade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses prior to the close of the published add/drop period each term will not have those dropped courses counted in the total attempted hours . . Dropped courses after the close of the published add/drop period will be counted in the total attempted hours . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . T ransfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade-Point Average Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3 .0 . Students who have a GP A of less than 2 . 0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS SAP for Rush Medical College students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of comple- tion and grade requirements . SAP is measured at the end of each academic year once final grades are in and at the time of awarding . Time Limits on Financial Aid Eligibility The normal time frame for completion of required coursework for the MD degree is four academic years . Due to academic or personal difficulties, a student may require additional time . In such situations, the Rush Medical College Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion may establish a schedule for the student that departs from the norm and may require repeating a year of study . F or the purposes of this financial aid policy, no more than three years may be devoted to the first- and second- year curriculum and no more than three years may be devoted to the third- and fourth-year curriculum, for a maximum time frame of six years . Summer enrollment, if required, is considered part of the academic year for the purposes of this measure . Approved LOAs do not count in this measure .

F oreman, PhD, RN, FAAN The John L . and Helen K ellogg Dean of the College of Nursing 67 College of Nursing Description Rush University College of Nursing is a private, not-for-profit graduate college of nursing . It is currently comprised of three degree programs \u2014 Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing Science (PhD) \u2014 as well as a postgraduate certificate program . The College of Nursing faculty thoroughly prepare students to advance the quality of patient care and nursing practice in a multitude of health care environments and to be leaders focused on improving health outcomes, whether at the bedside, in a research setting or directing an organization . The education and preparation of students to meet the health needs of a culturally diverse society is facilitated at Rush by the integration of academic, research and clinical practice compo- nents . Rush students have the adv antage of attending a private university that is a vital part of a nationally recognized academic medical center . This unique integration stimulates excellence in education, practice, scholarly activities and professional leader - ship by the faculty and the graduates of the College of Nursing . The MSN and DNP programs at Rush University College of Nursing are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education . Mission The mission of Rush University College of Nursing is to educate a broadly diverse student body that will deliver exceptional health care, generate innovative knowledge and provide transformative leadership to improve health outcomes for all populations . Vision The vision of the College of Nursing is to lead health care transformation through innovative nursing education, practice, research and scholarly inquiry . Philosophy The College of Nursing philosophy expresses the beliefs of the faculty regarding the meta-paradigm of nursing and nursing education . Person The faculty believes that a person is a unique being who pos-sesses innate dignity and worth with the right to self-determi- nation . P ersons live as individuals and as members of families, communities, and national and global societies .Environment The environment includes the multiple systems in which persons interact . This environment includes personal, physical, family, community, societal, economic, cultural and political systems . P ersons influence, and are influenced by, their environments . Health Health is a dynamic state of well-being that interacts with per - sonal factors and the environment . It is perceived in the context of a multi-system environment . Nursing Nursing is both a discipline and a profession . The focus of the discipline is the generation of knowledge related to persons and their environments for the purpose of maximizing the well- being of individuals, families, communities and society through health promotion, restoration and maintenance . The focus of the profession is the care of individuals, groups and communi - ties through application of discipline-specific and discipline- related knowledge . Nurses contribute both individually and collaboratively with other professionals to promote positive health outcomes . Nurses apply a professional code of ethics and professional guidelines to clinical practice and demonstrate compassion, advocacy and cultural sensitivity . Nursing Education The education of nurses is a process by which the knowledge, skills, values and culture of nursing are transmitted to the learner . The faculty believes that professional nursing education is accomplished in a university setting and in an environment where nursing education, practice, and research are integrated . Nursing education is built upon knowledge from the sci-ences, arts and humanities so students understand and value the human experience and its relationship to health . Nursing faculty members foster student growth by providing learning experiences in a variety of health care settings so students can understand the complexity of health care and learn the nursing role . The education of nurses is an interactive process whereby students are actively engaged learners who take responsibility for their education and practice . The curricula of the College of Nursing are designed to produce nurses who are the following: Competent, caring practitioners; lifelong learners that value scholarship; and collaborative members of interprofessional teams and leaders in the profession Clinical scholars who contribute to the scientific basis of nursing practice, improve clinical outcomes through evi-dence-based practice and positively influence the profession and the health care system68 College of Nursing Diversity Statement The best future for nursing depends on our ability to prepare a broadly diverse student body to become nurse clinicians, researchers and leaders who will improve health care outcomes for all populations. The preparation of a diverse nursing workforce is paramount to the delivery of effective, culturally congruent and accessible health care in an increasingly diverse nation . A broadly diverse student body promotes an enriched environment and deeper learning for all students and a more capable health care work- force . Diversity is defined broadly and includes but is not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion and veteran status . Rush University College of Nursing uses a holistic admissions process where a student's experiences, attributes and academic performance all have merit in making an admissions decision . Each candidate brings a unique set of personal attributes, characteristics, culture and experiences, but all students can contribute to the creation of a diverse and inclusive learn- ing environment . These important elements are considered in combination with how the individual will contribute value as a health professions student and future nurse . The Rush community strives to be an intentionally inclusive setting where students will thrive in learning, cocurricular and community experiences . An inclusive environment empow - ers all participants to reach their highest potential, learn from each other and develop a thoughtfulness that values diverse perspectives .

Student Progression in the College of Nursing Student progress in the College of Nursing is reviewed and evaluated in several ways . The progressions policies established by the faculty are interpreted and applied by the student's aca- demic adviser, the Office of the Dean and the College of Nursing Progressions Committee . The College of Nursing reserves the right to request a leave of absence or the withdrawal of any student whose conduct, physical or mental health, or perfor - mance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession . Should a student' s behavior come into question, policies and procedures to determine the student's continuing status in the college are delineated in the College of Nursing Student Handbook . Since much of the work in nursing assumes that students will achieve a progressively higher level of understanding and skill, high academic performance is expected . The individual student is responsible for acquiring knowledge inside and outside of formal classroom and clinical settings .72 Academic Progression Policy A student must achieve an A or B grade in all required clini- cal nursing courses . If a student receives a C gr ade in a single clinical seminar course or a single clinical practicum, the student must repeat the course prior to graduation . A student may repeat only one clinical seminar or clinical practicum in a program of study . An F or N grade in any required course places the student on academic probation and may result in dismissal from the program . A grade of F , N, or a second C in a required clinical seminar or clinical practicum may result in dismissal from the program . P ermission may be given to retake a course at the discretion of the Progressions Committee . If permitted, a student has only one opportunity to achieve a passing grade . An F or N grade in the repeated courses may result in dismissal . Students in all graduate programs must maintain a cumula - tive 3 .0 average in graduate coursework to remain in good academic standing . If a student' s cumulative GPA drops below 3 .0, they will be placed on academic probation . A student may enroll for no more than two consecutive terms as a probation- ary student . Students may be dismissed from the College of Nursing upon failing to achieve satisfactory academic standing in the required period of time or if the student incurs a second probationary event . To be awarded a degree or certificate, a student must be in good academic standing at the completion of the program . Please refer to the College of Nursing Student Handbook for a complete review of the college academic progression policy .

Students who are appealing an academic decision that could result in a dismissal from the University may be allowed to con - tinue to progress in the program until the issue is resolved . If the academic decision is upheld and the student is dismissed from the University, they will be withdrawn from their current classes . 157 This withdrawal will be backdated to before the beginning of the term, and the student will receive 100 percent tuition reimburse - ment for that term . A student wishing to appeal an academic decision should follow the process summarized below in the sequence indicated: Step 1. In the academic community, the responsibility for course development, course delivery and the assessment of student achievement rests primarily with each course instructor . Any stu - dent who has a complaint of inappropriate treatment related to a course should first seek to resolve it informally with the course instructor . If the course instructor is the department chairperson or if the complaint does not pertain to a specific course, the student should seek resolution with the department chairperson at the outset . 1 . A student with such a complaint must request reconsider a- tion, in writing, of the application of a rule, procedure or policy, or unfair or improper treatment within five working days following the incident that forms the basis for the com- plaint (e . g . , five days after grades are posted) . 2 .

Some individu - als may acquire knowledge through experience and on the job training . When such persons apply for admission into the pro - gram, an attempt is made to grant academic credit for equiva - lent educational courses, equivalent knowledge acquired from experience and/or successful completion of the National Board for Respiratory Care's certification and registry examinations . All students graduating from the Respiratory Care program must meet the same standards for graduation; the awarding of advanced standing does not signify a lesser quality educa- tion than that offered through regular course work . What it does, however, is attempt to exempt the student from those areas of the formal program where the student already has the knowledge and expertise in those skills that would be offered . The program has identified the minimum competencies that a respiratory therapist must have in order to provide safe, high- quality patient care . The identification of these competencies is a complex task, and a great deal of care must be taken to ensure a standard of excellence . The following policies and procedures are designed to ensure that those individuals who receive advanced standing are qualified to do so, and that the screening process adheres to University and departmental policies at all times . It is not in the student's or program's best interest to allow indi- viduals who are not qualified to receive advanced standing . To allow individuals who are not qualified, to receive advanced standing, is not in the student's or the program's best interest . Definition Advanced standing is defined as a special and individually determined status granted to a student in a formal educational setting who has already gained professional experience through other sources or through non academic experiences, knowledge, skills and professionalism taught in the program courses . Purpose of Advanced-Standing Procedures The purpose of the advanced-standing procedures is to recog-nize and give formal educational credit for knowledge and/or ability gained through previous training or experience .Methods of Granting Advanced Standing 1 . Adv anced standing can be awarded through transfer credit . 2 . Adv anced standing can be awarded through the passing of an equivalency examination covering a certain area of knowledge . (An equiv alency examination is an instrument or means by which a student accepted into the Respiratory Care program can demonstrate mastery of a knowledge area, content area or skill, and thus be exempted from a course in the program that teaches that area or skill .) 3 . Adv anced standing can be awarded as credit for successful completion of national registry examinations (RRT/RPFT) . Eligibility for Advanced Standing 1 . T ransfer students who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care program may receive a transfer credit for equivalent courses within the Respiratory Care program curriculum . 2 . Credentialed students (RR T, RPFT) who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program may receive transfer credit and will also be eligible to take equiva- lency examinations in certain courses . Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed coursework at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific coursework in the Rush University program . Students must submit a tr anscript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit . The syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related information . These courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours . The Department reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in coursework transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow such transfer credit in such coursework in cases which the student cannot dem- onstrate acceptable proficiency . All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . The student must also have a minimum grade of \"C\" (2 .0) for each course being transferred . A student cannot receive transfer credit for any respiratory care coursework if he or she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension or exclusion . All University policies regarding transfer credit must be satisfied .170 Policy for Individuals Who Hold the RRT Credential Advanced standing is available to individuals who have suc- cessfully completed the National Board for Respiratory Care's Respiratory Therapy Registry, or RRT, who hold a baccalaure- ate degree from a regionally accredited college or university . Those eligible for advanced standing must submit the following documentation: 1 . A notarized copy of the RR T certificate indicating that it is a true and accurate copy 2 . Official tr anscripts of all previous respiratory care and general education coursework attempted and/or completed indi-cating award of the bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university 3 . A notarized copy of the certificate of completion from an approved respiratory care training program as applicable 4 . A completed application (av ailable in the Office of Admissions) for admission to the advanced-sanding program 5 . A letter directed to the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care requesting advanced standing RRT Advanced Standing (MS): Admissions Requirements Individuals holding the RRT credential and a baccalaureate degree may apply to enter the Respiratory Care graduate program prior to any term . Submission of an application for admission should be made to the Office of College Admission Services with all official transcripts, NBRC RRT certificate and a personal interview at least 30 days prior to the first day of the term when the individual desires to begin classes . Professional prerequisites must be completed prior to graduation . All other program policies and procedures apply .

Toward that goal, we teach the highest levels of competence and integrity in education, leadership and research, and provide professional development and research mentoring by established scholars across the continuum of health sciences . The underlying educational philosophy of the program is grounded in a triad of learner-centered thought: progressiv- ism in which the learners' experiences, needs and interests are explored and fostered; reconstructionism in which the learners see their growth applied to real-world problems; and existential- ism by which learners are challenged to own their future and become leaders in the evolution of health care . Mission Our mission is to produce experienced health science profes- sionals with a broad-based, interdisciplinary education who are prepared to lead, teach, practice clinically and perform research at the highest levels of competency and integrity . Vision To become the highest quality PhD in health sciences program in the United States . Health Sciences (PhD): Curricular Design We offer a rigorous curriculum that emphasizes fundamentals and advanced concepts in leadership, education, research and professional development . We provide high quality, asynchro - nous online courses in leadership, education and research . The role of the curricular design is to provide a logical progression to learner growth . The guiding principal of the curricular design is three-fold and presented in a continuum of foundations (theory), application (real-world problem resolution) and vision (synthesis and cre- ative/critical forward thinking regarding the future trajectory of health care) . The curricular design first establishes a foundation of past and current thinking (epistemological framework) and theory associated with leadership, education and research . The curriculum challenges learners to address real-world applica-tions through focused seminar courses and learner-centered projects . The curriculum progresses and challenges the learners' axiological considerations, encouraging the value of moving health care forward through research, demonstration projects, dissertation focus, ownership of learning and philosophical chal- lenges to the status quo . The program director provides general academic support and oversees the professional development courses . Transition to doctoral candidate occurs upon successfully completing all core courses, passing a comprehensive qualifying exam and passing a dissertation proposal presented to the dissertation committee . Doctoral candidates conduct research and publish under the guidance and supervision of a research mentor . The dissertation committee consists of the research mentor, the program director and at least three additional qualified members . The dissertation committee ensures students are well-prepared to identify and fill important gaps in knowledge through the generation and dissemination of new knowledge, and endorses the awarding of the PhD degree . Health Sciences (PhD): Program Overview The Doctor of Philosophy in Health Sciences program was launched by the College of Health Sciences in fall 2011 . The program is designed to prepare health science professionals to assume major leadership, research and educational positions within their professions, as well as to foster career advancement opportunities . The program provides a broad-based, interdisciplinary education that prepares graduates to teach, practice and perform research across the continuum of health care . The program prepares individuals for careers in research, education and leadership within allied health and, more broadly, within health care and higher education . The program of study for the Doctor of Philosophy degree involves formal courses in leadership, education and research . It also involves mentored professional development within a health science specialty field . The publication of scholarly work in a peer-reviewed journal and the passing of a comprehensive oral examination upon completion of all course work are also required . In addition, students must complete and present a dissertation proposal that meets the approval of their advisory committee prior to beginning a dissertation research project that culminates in the writing and oral public defense of a dissertation . The PhD degree demonstrates the capability for independent research and recognizes a unique contribution to scientific 203 knowledge . The program may be taken on a part-time basis, however, in all cases must be completed in seven years or less . The program consists of five major core areas: leadership (12 CR), education (9 CR), research (18 CR), professional devel- opment (3 CR) and dissertation research (12 CR minimum) . The professional development courses are based on learning contracts that provide opportunities for advanced mentored learning and skill development in the allied health profession matching the students interests . Student learning objectives have been developed for each major core area and are mapped to individual courses . Students entering the program must have a master's degree in an area related to health sciences/health care administration or substantial professional experiences in a health sciences related field .

Such requests are handled on a case-by-case basis . Hepatitis B Virus Vaccination Before students are allowed to begin the program, they must have on file documentation that they have either begun or have finished the course of inoculations for the hepatitis B virus vac- cine . This documentation must be sent directly to Castle Branch . If the student has started but not yet finished the series of inoculations at the start of the program, documentation show- ing completion of the course of inoculations should be provided as soon as possible in order for the student to remain in the program . This information will be reviewed quarterly, and the student will be notified if not in compliance with this require- ment . Students who fail to complete the hepatitis B virus vaccination protocol in a timely manner will not be allowed to register for the following term until providing documentation of compliance . In addition, students must submit a hepatitis B virus titer as proof of immunity . Tuberculosis Testing All students must provide the results from tuberculosis screen- ing tests in order to begin the program . Students must be tested annually for tuberculosis and must submit the results to Castle Branch . F ailure to comply with this policy can lead to dismissal from the program or prevention of attendance at the clinical site regardless of GPA . In cases where the tuberculosis screen is positive or contrain-dicated, students must be screened annually by a physician for symptoms of active tuberculosis and submit documentation that they have been screened and are symptom-free .OSHA, HIPAA and Safety Training Students are required to take all Rush University Medical Center training courses that apply to medical laboratory scientists .

Students failing to remain current in these training areas will not be allowed in the clinical laboratories . Criminal Background Check and Drug Screen All students entering the Master of Science in Medical Laboratory Science program are required to have a criminal background check before matriculating . The student's ability to begin the clinical portion of the program and to complete certi-fication and licensure requirements for entry into the profession may depend on documentation of such things as drug screening and a background check for a history of criminal offenses . A drug screen is required before entering the clinical practica . Academic Policies Midterm Warning Notices Students not maintaining a passing-level grade at midterm time will be given a written warning notice . It is the student' s respon - sibility to contact the course instructor immediately to ascertain how the grade can be improved . Academic Progression High academic performance in required courses is expected . Students will be considered in good standing at Rush University unless placed on academic probation . A cumulative grade-point average of at least 3 .0 is required in the graduate programs . Cumulative gr ade-point averages will be reviewed after each term . No student will be permitted into the clinical rotation portion of the program unless they have the required GPA . The faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a student whose conduct, health or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession . Any such student not voluntarily withdrawing will be dismissed from the University . Academic Probation Academic probation is assigned to any student who receives a term grade-point average below 3 .0 or whose cumulative grade-point average falls below 3 .0 . Students placed on proba - tion have two terms to regain the status of good standing as follows:231 In the next term after being placed on probation, the student must attain a term grade-point average of at least 3 .0 . T wo terms after being placed on probation, the student must have a cumulative grade-point average above 3 .0 . F ailure to make the minimum term grade-point average one term after probation, or the minimum cumulative grade-point average two terms after probation, will result in dismissal from the University . Note that the receipt of financial aid may also be impacted when the grade-point average falls below 3 .0 . C, D, F or N Grades Graduate students may not receive more than two grades of C or lower in the program . Gr aduate students who receive a third grade of C or lower will be dismissed from the program . Graduate students who receive a D, F or N grade in any course must repeat that course . If that a student is required to repeat a course that is a prerequisite for an advanced course, the advanced course may not be taken until the student successfully passes the prerequisite course . Thus, the student's progression in the program may be affected . Students who receive a second D or F grade in the same academic year will be dismissed from the program . All work in practicum courses must be at or above the B grade level . If a student earns a gr ade less than B in a clinical practi - cum course, the course must be repeated but may be repeated only once and must be taken within one year, with the new grade replacing the failing grade in the cumulative grade-point average . A second grade below B in any practicum course will result in dismissal from the program . Comprehensive Examination All students must take and pass a comprehensive examination at the end of the second year in order to graduate from the Medical Laboratory Science program . Any student who fails the cumulative examination must retake the examination until pass- ing . A diploma will not be given until the student has passed all sections of the comprehensive examination . Graduate Research Projects See the Graduate Research Bulletin and Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences policy document for policies and procedures regarding graduate research projects . This bulletin lists specific deadlines for each component of the research project . F ailure to meet these deadlines will delay acceptance of the research project and graduation from the program .Certification The comprehensive technical curriculum at Rush University prepares the student to enter the practice of medical labora- tory science . Gr aduates are eligible to take the medical labora - tory scientist's certification examination given by the American Society of Clinical Pathology Board of Certification . Service Work Policy Service work is defined as performing the duties expected of an employee who is paid to perform those tasks as an unpaid student . Service work by students is not required nor permitted by the program . Students are present in the clinical labor atory to learn the operation of the clinical laboratory . While learning, and upon demonstrating proficiency, students may perform clinical tests under the supervision of an instructor who is a certified medical laboratory scientist . As such, students work on actual patient samples but at no time are they expected to, or allowed to, perform service work without pay . There are numerous work-study jobs available to our students in the clinical laboratories as well as throughout the Medical Center and at our affiliate hospitals . Students are notified of openings as the faculty are informed . Students and supervisors at the clinical site must make a distinction between the stu-dent's time in the laboratory as a student learning and not being paid and when the student becomes an employee and is work- ing in the laboratory for pay on tasks they have been specifically trained to perform . Students should not be treated as employees during rotation time, which is typically from 7 a .m . - 3:30 p . m . What students do outside the time at which they are expected to be learning in the clinical laboratory is beyond the scope of control of the program . Graduation Requirements The Master of Science degree in Medical Laboratory Science requires a minimum of 80 term hours . Candidates for the Master of Science degree must earn a 3 .0 cumulative grade-point average in all computed upper-division credits taken at Rush University .

Occupational Therapy: Program Overview Professional Description The Department of Occupational Therapy offers a graduate program that prepares students for unique contributions to the field of occupational therapy . This professional-level program is designed for people with baccalaureate degrees in other fields who are seeking to become occupational therapists . Philosophy on Educational Occupational therapists recognize humans as complex beings engaged in and organized around occupations occurring within the physical, temporal, cultural, psychological, spiritual, and virtual environments (AOTA, 2014; AOTA 2017) . When dysfunc - external contexts limit or prevent participa- tion, occupational therapists enable doing in a variety of ways . The practice of occupational therapy involves clients, individuals, groups, or organizations, their attributes, and the multiple envi- ronmental contexts that comprise occupational performance . Occupational therapy interventions are designed to facilitate people to adapt and change in order to improve their engage- ment in occupational performance across the lifespan . Rush University Department of Occupational Therapy faculty members fulfill roles as practitioner-teacher and investigator, a combination that infuses the curriculum with contemporary and scholarly perspectives to prepare students to meet the occupational needs of society . Gr aduate courses and clinical experiences build on students' past knowledge and skills to encourage transformative and integrative learning . The critical self-reflection of the transformative learning process encourages examining, questioning, validating, and possibly revising prior knowledge so that new perceptions and meanings may evolve (Cranton, 2006) . Integr ative learning expands on this process by facilitating students' ability to connect ideas, concepts, and experiences to better adapt to novel and complex issues (Huber & Hutchings, 2004) . The end result is a learner who is intellectu - ally flexible to meet the needs of complex clients in a continually changing society . A program based on transformative and inte - grative learning builds on a student's past, connects it to present activities, and predicts a future in which they are competent and capable to respond to the ongoing needs of the profession and the clients we serve . The curriculum builds towards leadership in professional reasoning and meeting the needs of an increasingly dynamic profession . Self-directed learning and critical thinking using evidence-based research and practice are fostered through faculty mentorship, problem solving, collaborative activities, and critical inquiry in the classroom, clinic, and community to promote entry-level performance . The individualized doctoral experience establishes a trajectory that enables students to become an emerging leader in their professional practice . Rush occupational therapy graduates are prepared to work in traditional and emerging practice settings, but more impor - tantly, are ethical, flexible, creative, autonomous, and informed practitioner-teacher-investigators . Professional Orientation Since Rush graduate will be prepared to work in a variety of traditional and nontraditional settings, their practice base is the result of broad experiences within the many arenas of occu- pational therapy . Gr aduates have the ability to add increasing amounts of depth and validation to their intervention programs as a result of their involvement and experiences with problem- solving approaches to therapy . Given the combination of breadth and depth of knowledge and experience related to occupational therapy intervention, the primary strength of Rush University graduates will be their abil- ity to function as highly resourceful practitioners . As in the past, and for the foreseeable future, the role of the practitioner is the core of all occupational therapy . The practitioner who is able to base intervention on established fact, use internal and external resources, and engage in professional reasoning and problem solving is the practitioner who will contribute to the credibility and viability of the profession . It is this type of pr actitioner who is expected to be the product of the Rush program . Graduates of the program are able to enter the clinical arena competently and confidently, applying their clinical skills and expanding upon those skills as situations require . This continu - ous process of assessment and expansion contributes to the personal and professional growth vital to occupational thera - pists . The role of the clinician, as it is understood in this context, incorporates other major roles of the therapist . As the Rush pro - gram is designed, the students have the opportunity to explore the functions of the therapist as an educator, researcher and 237 manager from the practitioner's perspective . The involvement of the student in these other roles is another major strength of the program . The additional roles of educator, manager and researcher cannot be separated from the practitioner's role . Accreditation and Certification The Occupational Therapy program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education, or ACOTE, of the American Occupational Therapy Association . Additional information can be obtained: Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education c/o Accreditation Department American Occupational Therapy Association 4720 Montgomery Lane, Suite 200Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 652-2682 www . acoteonline . org Graduates will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist that is administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy, or NBCOT .

Vision Basic and clinical scientist graduates of the Graduate College will become leaders in their respective research fields, secure leadership positions in academia or industry, compete suc- cessfully for extramural grants, and train the next generation of research scientists . Success in this regard relates to embr ac- ing the culture of team science and understanding how your efforts can ensure sustained productivity in addressing strategic biomedical problems and to lead in the advancement of the medical sciences and the promotion of health . Philosophy Rush University provides outstanding health sciences education and conducts impactful research in a culture of inclusion, focused on the promotion and preservation of the health and well-being of our diverse communities. This statement outlines a vibrant role for the Graduate College in preparing leaders to help Rush, and other institutions that share similar aspirations, to achieve success in transforming our health care system . The Graduate College was originally established in 1981, to provide opportunities for students to work with nationally recognized faculty to earn doctoral degrees in the sciences basic to health care . Students are engaged in highly individualized training to maximize opportunities for self-realization . F aculty members share their scholarly expertise and hands-on labora- tory and clinical research experiences with students in a variety of settings . The Graduate College is also focused on emerging training concerns as communicated by the National Institute of Health in regard to optimal biomedical workforce preparation . To address issues with the torrid pace of research innovation as well as the realities of the rapidly evolving workplace, we have placed a deeper emphasis on presenting course material from an integrated conceptual framework so that students are better prepared to manage the rapidly expanding body of complex biomedical information . Our curriculum moves from an inter - disciplinary orientation that is intensely collaborative in nature . Thus, all laboratory-based graduate students jointly participate in a common, integrated first year curriculum exploring the shared foundations of biomedical sciences . This approach lever - ages the significant interaction of students with interests across the spectrum of biomedical sciences and provides a common knowledge base to allow students to move more fluidly into the team-based research phase of their specific programs . This integrated biomedical sciences curriculum also creates a more inclusive and welcoming feeling among students to encourage group learning and problem solving . The Graduate College also includes specialized master's programs for integrated biomedical sciences, laboratory-based biotechnology research and clinical science research . We con - tinue to evolve course offerings to address the expanding need for clinical scientists and highly trained technical staff, respec- tively, to advance science in the 21st century . These programs also share the Rush unifying features including a high degree of individualized faculty and student interaction through the educational processes of the college grounded in a productive, high quality translational research/clinical environment . Students find the open collaborative environment across the college with a shared focus on translational research through team-based research and care to constitute a highly favorable educational environment . The Graduate College: Program Organization Doctor of Philosophy in Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program To facilitate its educational mission, the laboratory-based research PhD and MS programs, called the integrated biomedi- cal sciences programs, are organized into five tracks correspond - ing to interdisciplinary areas of research excellence at Rush that are also highly aligned with areas of clinical strength . This align - ment forms a fertile nexus for sustained, innovative translational collaboration . The tracks typically involve fluid interactions of relevant scientists, clinicians and other professionals working in flexible team structures . This organizational approach builds on 250 the strong legacy of the Graduate College but is re-designed to create a more stimulating learning environment for the stu- dents . This entails moving from the traditional discipline-focused curriculum to a more integrated, systems biology approach, embracing multi-disciplinary team-based science required for greater success in addressing existing complex biomedical chal- lenges . The learning environment in the new program format will enhance the student to student interaction as they are immersed into the Rush research environment . All students participate in a shared integrated curriculum and then select to conduct their doctoral or thesis research in one of five inter-disciplinary tracks that related to areas of excellence in clinical care as well as funded research at Rush . At the same time, we have broaden the array of faculty representing a wider range of disciplines from basic to clinical to community working together to address criti- cal biomedical problems into five track areas . The five educational/ research tracks of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences are as follows: Cardiov ascular & respiratory biology Function and disorders of the musculosk eletal system Function and disorders of the nervous system Infection, immunity & inflammation research T ranslational cancer research The primary goal of each track is to provide excellent graduate education in the sciences basic to medicine . The track constructs are flexible and responsive to the changing needs and experi- ences in their disciplines . This approach is highly aligned with our shared vision: The Rush learning community will be the leading health sciences university committed to transforming health care through innovative research and education . The educational process for the first year of integrated curricu-lum is coordinated by an Associate Program Director who works to ensure that the integrated first year curriculum supports student mastery in approaching complex biomedical problem solving . The overall program director is responsible for the learn - ing environment for the remainder of the dissertation years and is charged with achieving full programmatic integration includ- ing learning assessment as well as timely student progression . Each track leader interacts with the other track leaders and the integrated biomedical sciences directors through the educational committee to ensure smooth functioning of this program .Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing Science Program The PhD in Nursing Science program prepares students to be a clinical researcher who advances the nursing care of individuals and communities through scientific discovery .

This program is also an excellent preparation for further training in graduate school or professional doctoral programs . The student will take the Graduate College's core curriculum series of didactic courses covering principles of molecular biology and genetics, cellular biochemistry, cell biology, tissue biology and system physiology and pharmacology . Additional 252 courses designed specifically to prepare students for a career in the laboratory and research, including Experimental Design and Models in Disease, Biostatistics, Research Ethics, Communication and Management, are also required . Finally , students will participate in hands-on laboratory courses designed to cover the common and most important techniques and methods employed in research today . The student will also participate in the IPE 502 university course, which will expose students to inter-professional teamwork in healthcare settings . The course will appear on the student's transcript . The laboratory and research experiences will ensure proficiency in a wide variety of techniques, making the student highly competitive for employ- ment in this ever-expanding and understaffed job market . This program also gives an excellent expansion in basic sciences and its applications in translational research, thus serve well those students who wish to further their studies in professional schools (medical, dental, pharmacy, and other health sciences) or join a PhD program . The program, together with its courses and their teaching faculty, as well as the fiscal health of the program, is over - seen by the Program Director who is advised by the Program Education Committee . The program director is responsible for the implementation of the program goals and the assessment of the program and student learning . The program director is the main advisor/mentor for the students and assures that the learn - ing environment is supportive of student success . The program director is also responsible for representing the program at the college and University levels, as well as for marketing the program nationwide . Master of Science in Clinical Research Program The Masters of Science program is designed to provide physi-cians and other health care professionals the tools necessary to undertake and evaluate clinical research . The five-semester the - sis-requiring program involves two semesters of didactic lectures in the late afternoon followed by three semesters of mentored clinical research experience . The two year format is designed to provide the necessary skills needed to perform clinical research in the 21st century . The coursework covers experimental design and historically important clinical trials, regulatory science as well as a review of medical bioinformatics . The program also requires the completion and potential publincation of clinical research thesis with a faculty mentors to enhance the profes- sional development of an insightful and capable investigator .The Graduate College: Admission Requirements The faculty of the Graduate College encourages diversity among the student population and therefore seeks to admit persons from various backgrounds . The Graduate College uses the following guidelines to evaluate candidates for admission . Individual programs within the college may have additional requirements and criteria for admission .

Courses used tow ard completion of another degree can be used to waive a requirement for a specific course, but cannot be transferred . The Graduate College: Shared Curricular Elements The Graduate College Shared Curriculum is designed to enhance interaction among students from all the programs . Some Graduate College courses are shared by more than one program . However all GC courses are open to all students . Each GC program decides what course work is appropriate for its students . The curriculum is designed to provide the basic knowledge base the faculty have deemed necessary to become successful in science . The Graduate College shared curricula elements provide introductory training in molecular genetics, genomics cellular biochemistry, cell biology, tissue biology . Students will also learn basic theories underlying modern scientific technique . In addition, the student will take courses in ethics, scientific writing and basic statistics . These courses will be supplemented by specialized, advanced courses offered by the individual programs . Each progr am selects the curricula neces - sary to fulfill graduation requirements . These courses will be selected from the list below, as well as program specific courses . The following courses comprise the Graduate College shared curriculum: GCC - 501 Molecular Biology: Genome to Proteome GCC - 502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins, Transport and Signaling GCC - 503 Functional Cell Biology GCC - 504 Functional Tissue Biology GCC - 505 Techniques in Biomedical Sciences GCC - 506 Research Ethics GCC - 507 Biomedical Statistics GCC - 508 Scientific Writing GCC - 510 Introduction to Pharmacology GCC - 515 Readings in Core Sciences GCC - 544 Advanced Statistics GCC - 546 Principles of Biostastics I GCC - 547 Priciples of Biostastics II GCC - 551 Ethics in Biomedical Research and the IRB GCC - 593 Introduction to Gr ated Topics GCC - 715 Advanced Study on Molecular, Cellular and Tissue Biology The Graduate College: MS and PhD Degrees The Graduate College prepares students for the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees . An undergraduate record of scholastic excellence is an important background for the Graduate College experience . The process of application review includes a search for evidence of creativity and scholarly potential in the applicant . Non-degree (special) students may take selected courses but are not candidates for advanced degrees . Upon approv al by a course director, any individual may audit a course .254 Doctor of Philosophy The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is the highest degree conferred by Rush University . The Doctor of Philosophy is awarded in recognition of high achievement in a particular field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a dissertation that demonstrates independent investigation and contributes new information to the body of existing knowledge . The PhD is restricted to those scholars who have demonstrated superior ability in a recognized academic discipline . While each program has identified requirements, the PhD degree is not awarded following the completion of any specific number of formal courses nor on the basis of miscellaneous course studies and research . The entire PhD program must be integrated and highly research oriented . It should culminate in a work of liter ary and scholarly merit, which is indicative of the candidate's ability to conduct original research in a recognized specialty . A first- authored scientific manuscript of the student's original research is a degree requirement . PhD progr ams are directed by selected faculty members who work closely with graduate students . In practice, each program is composed of formal courses, guided individual study in a chosen field or discipline; study in such cognate subjects as may be required by the candidate's advisory committee and original research that serves as the basis of scientific publication research presentation and a scholarly dissertation . Admission to Candidacy Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral student has successfully completed all preliminary coursework and is prepared to move into his or her intensive research experience . Depending upon the program's requirements, these exams will test accumulated knowledge, scientific reasoning and the ability to develop hypotheses and test them with appropriate designs . Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining require- ments of the program . Students failing to achieve admission to candidacy will not be allowed to continue in the program PhD . If they wish, they may apply the coursework and research that they have completed toward a related MS degree . Any PhD sti - pends and tuition waivers would not continue once the student has become a MS student and the student would be required to complete any remaining requirements for MS degree program .Dissertation A doctoral student must complete a dissertation . This document is developed through faculty-guided independent research proj- ects . Review of the dissertation will follow the sequence of steps described in the manual, \"Preparation of Theses and Doctoral Dissertations .\" Copies of this manual are available in each graduate program and in the Library of Rush University Medical Center . The dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university . Each student will have a Dissertation or Advisory Committee whose role is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the College for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presenta- tion . The Committee is also to assure that the student is making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree . The com - mittee is chosen by the student in conjunction with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least five total mem- bers . The composition of this committee should be approved by the Program's Advisory Committee and should comply with the guidelines listed here as well as with any specific require- ments of the individual program . The primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College . At least one member of the committee should be from outside of the program or track, and preferably from outside of the institution . Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson who cannot be the stu- dent's primary advisor . The chairperson will oversee the schedul - ing and activities of the committee . At or near the completion of the dissertation, each student will share, by means of a public defense with the academic com- munity at large, the knowledge that the student has developed . Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulletin boards and e-mailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the dissertation, the student's name, and the location, date and time of the public defense . This public presen - tation must precede the final approval of the dissertation by the Dissertation Committee . Upon completion of the public defense, the student will meet with the dissertation committee to review the presentation, question the student about their research, discuss the written dissertation document and the student's preparedness to enter the scientific community . F our of the five of members of the committee must sign the dissertation certifying the completion of all requirements for the doctor of philosophy degree .255 Master of Science The Master of Science degree is offered in many programs . This degree is designed to offer students an intermediate step in a career path, provide research experience to supplement their primary professional path or provide supplementary training for other reasons . The College offers two types of MS degrees: 1) the IBS MS in basic sciences and the MS in clinical research are thesis-requiring programs that traditionally take 5 semesters to complete; and 2) a non-thesis 2-semester accelerated MS that is a consequence of the successful completion of a series of classes and laboratory skills and a research capstone (i .e . , the MS in Biotechnology) . Thesis The research MS degree requires the successful completion of course work and publication of a scientific thesis that reflects the research experience of the student . This thesis should reflect original work, which can be published in a peer-reviewed journal . The student, together with the advisor, will form a thesis committee comprised of three members: the advisor (who must be a member of the Graduate College) and two additional members . The advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program . The committee members will assure the quality of the work and of the thesis document . Upon completion of the thesis, the student will present the findings in a public forum open to the University . The members of the committee that includes the student's advisor must sign off on the thesis, certify - ing the completion of all requirements for the MS degree . The Graduate College: Academic Policies The Graduate College adopts college-wide policies and pro- cedures and reviews program-specific regulations . Students follow the college and program-specific policies in effect at the time of initial matriculation in the Graduate College . However , the Graduate College reserves the right to make substan- tive changes in its programs after the student's matriculation . Students will be informed in writing by the program director of any changes made during their tenure in the program . Students re-entering the college after an absence will be guided by poli- cies and procedures in effect at the time of re-entry . Examination Policy Re-enforcing the examination policy of the college is the respon- sibility of the individual course director, who will inform students and the proctors about the examination requirements for that particular course . A period at the end of the semester is pro - vided for final examinations; however, any form of assessment can be conducted at any week of the semester . This information will be included in the course schedule and syllabus . Pass/No Pass Grades Each program identifies all courses required of its students . Required courses are usually taken for letter grade and not under the pass/no pass (P/N) option . Research hours are gener - ally graded using the P/N option . However , a program may opt to provide a letter grade for research classes . The grading policy for post-candidacy research hours (over 600) for doctoral students is graded as P/N . Good Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3 .0 and meet the require - ments of their program . A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy and to graduate . Students failing to maintain a GPA of 3 .0 will be notified by the Registrar in writing that their student status has been changed to \"on probation .\" Students who fail to remediate their deficiencies within one academic year or are placed on probationary status a third time, are subject to dismissal by the Graduate College . Academic Difficulty Each program has policies and procedures regarding students who fail to maintain good academic standing . While the respon - sibilities of informing students of their academic problems and of establishing conditions for regaining good academic standing reside within the program, the Graduate College Council moni - tors the progress and promotion of all students and gives final approval to award students' degrees . Dismissal Recommendations for student dismissal are initiated by the programs and follow the Rush University process . Each pro - gram establishes grounds for dismissal beyond the minimal criteria established by the Graduate College . Should a progr am recommend the dismissal of a student, the director will forward such recommendation to the Graduate College Council for final action . Letters of dismissal come from the Dean . Appeal of a dismissal action begins within the appropriate program . Full-time Enrollment Full-time enrollment is required of all Graduate College students with the exception of the clinical research students and students 256 within the PhD programs in nursing science and health sciences . Full-time students must register for at least nine semester hours for each term or at least two semester hours when enrolled in GCC 598, GCC 599 or GCC 699 . Enrollment in two credit hours of GCC 598, GCC 599, and GCC 699 constitutes full time registration . Students must obtain written permission from the program director to register for less than a full time course load . Students receiving a thesis-requiring master's degree from the Graduate College as a full-time student must be enrolled for all terms between their matriculation and graduation . The average length of this program is five semesters . P art-time students earning a master's degree must be enrolled a minimum of two semesters per academic year . The accelerated, non-thesis master's program's length is two semesters . The minimum requirement for graduation from the college is program specific . At the time of graduation, the student must be enrolled in the College . The expected time for graduation from a full-time thesis-requiring master's degree program is 5 semesters starting the first semester of official enrollment and for the PhD degree is expected to be five years . These limits do not include time intervals related to approved leaves of absence . Residency Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates are expected to meet all requirements for graduation within five enrolled academic years in the Graduate College (excluding leaves of absence [see below]) . This period begins with the semester in which the student formally matriculates . The program director of a student exceeding that time limitation must submit to the graduate council, in writing, a request to extend their candidacy beyond that time period . This request must identify the reasons for the extension and provide a written plan with reasonable dead- lines for completion . This document will be co-signed by the student's advisor and program director . The council will then vote whether to accept the extension or not (passed by simple majority) . The student's advisor will then provide an update on the student's progress after six months . One year after the extension is granted, the student is expected to complete all requirements . A second request may be made by the student's advisor and program director, but will be accepted only through a two-thirds majority of the voting members present at a formal hearing of the Graduate College Council . Within one year of that second request, the student must complete all requirements for the PhD degree or face dismissal . Alternatively, the student may be awarded a MS degree upon the recommendation of the student's graduate program .Readmission Any student who has withdrawn from the University or any dismissed student may apply for readmission by submitting an application for this purpose to the Graduate College admis- sion office . An interview may be required . A re-entering student must meet the conditions for re-enrollment stated in his or her dismissal or re-entry acceptance letter and all policies, require - ments and course sequence in effect at the time of re-entry . The student will pay tuition and fees at the rates in effect at the time of re-enrollment . Application deadlines may vary by program . Academic Progression The graduate program, in concert with the rules of the college and Rush University, develops specific regulations governing the process that results in final awarding of the degree . While such regulations differ slightly from one program to another, the Graduate College Council reviews each program's regulations for approval . In all cases , graduate programs are required to be explicit and clear about regulations that will affect the candi- date . This must be stringently observed in program regulations concerning selection of principal advisors, advisory committees, and a plan of study . Similarly , programs will be explicit and clear concerning academic policies and procedures surrounding qualifying, preliminary and final examinations when they are required . The programs are also responsible for providing the candidate with the support needed to plan and conduct the dissertation research . At the same time, a major responsibility of the student is to become familiar with the regulations and expectations of his or her chosen program . These regulations and expectations are included in this catalog within the sections devoted to each program and are also included within program publications . The student is responsible for understanding the regulations, and monitoring changes that may occur during their tenure in the program . Student Academic Appeals Policy Any student of the Graduate College may appeal a final course grade, failure on a preliminary or comprehensive examination, or failure of the thesis or dissertation that results in his or her academic probation or dismissal from the University . A student may also appeal an unreasonable delay in his or her graduation from the University . No other issues may be appealed through this process . The process for filing an appeal is maintained by each program . The student may request a copy of the program appeal process from the program director . This process will be completed within one semester . If a resolution cannot be achieved at the Progr am 257 level, the following procedure must be followed . At any step in the process, the student may withdraw the appeal by written notification to the program director with a copy to the Dean . In the event of a dismissal decision, a student may continue to enroll until the appeal process is completed or the student withdraws the appeal . Step 1: If the student wishes to appeal the decision beyond the program, within two weeks of receiving a decision from the pro - gram, the student will submit a written statement to the Dean requesting consideration of his or her case by an advisory panel . The student must provide the following in the written statement . Course number and gr ade being appealed or other cause for probation or dismissal, i .e . , failure of preliminary or compre - hensive examination, or thesis or dissertation Action being requested Justification for the request An outline of the efforts and actions already tak en to obtain consideration of the request The student will send copies of this communication to the program director and the Dean's office . In addition, if a course grade is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the course director . If the ev aluation of a thesis or dissertation is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the chairper - son of the thesis or dissertation committee . The advisory panel will be the Graduate College Council . Its chairperson will be appointed by the Dean from among the members . The program director of the student's program and any other member who is evaluating the student's academic status will not vote . Step 2: Within two weeks after notification to the Dean, the Chairperson of the Advisory Panel will arrange a meeting of the Advisory Panel . It will submit a written recommendation to the Dean . Step 3: Within two weeks following receipt of the advisory pan - el's recommendation and upon discussion with the student and with others as appropriate, the Dean shall reach a final decision and notify each party of the decision . The decision reached by the Dean is final . The issues discussed and the outcomes of all meetings in this appeal process are documented . This record- keeping is the responsibility of a faculty member who is to be designated at each meeting . Copies of the documentation should be distributed to the individuals present at a meeting, to the program director, the Dean and to the student's academic file .Academic Honesty and Student Conduct The Graduate College and its programs follow the University policies on academic honesty and the University statement on student conduct . Each student is expected to conduct himself or herself at all times in a professional manner - a manner which conforms to the ethics of the profession, and which instills con- fidence in one's abilities as a working scientist . Irresponsible , unprofessional or unethical behavior, as determined by the Graduate College Honor Code Committee may result in dismissal from the program . The college and its programs will not condone cheating in any form . Allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the program director with the help of an ad hoc committee . If merited, the report will be forwarded to the Graduate College Honor Code Committee . Rush University Academic Policies The Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains additional Rush University academic policies . This Rush University catalog also details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities, as well as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment . Students who may need special accommodations can access this information at https://www . rushu . rush . edu/students-disabilities . The Graduate College: Governance Organization College Specific Committees The Graduate College Council is the senior representative body of the college . Its membership includes elected members of all programs including Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD, Integrated Biomedical Sciences MS, Biotechnology, Clinical Research, the PhD in nursing science and the PhD in health sciences, and three students from these programs (elected by the students annually) . An elected member of the Graduate College Council serves as the chair of the Council . The Program Directors, Dean and Associate Dean serve in a non-voting, Ex-Officio Capacity on this committee . The Council is constituted to represent the College faculty and advise the dean regarding: (i) the organization, function, and coordination of educational and research resources, services and activities among the vari- ous units of the College; (ii) adequacy of College facilities and infrastructure, (iii) effectiveness of College support services (e . g . , student services, technology, information systems, etc .); (iv) election of faculty for the Graduate College; (v) faculty grievance process; and (vi) amendments to the Policies and Procedures . Under the Rush University Governance, the Graduate College 258 Council has a number of defined responsibilities in govern- ing the College, such as in conducting periodic reviews of all Graduate College program policies and procedures and evaluating program reports . The Graduate College Council is responsible for setting poli- cies for the admission of students; the formulation and adoption of general operating policies, standards and procedures of the college; the appointment of the Graduate College faculty; and the approval of those recommended for degrees . Although the Dean and the Council maintain significant oversight of programs in the Graduate College, the programs also establish policies and procedures, consistent with the policies and procedures of the College and the University . The Graduate College Council periodically reviews all program policies and procedures . The faculty of the Graduate College is drawn from the faculty of the other colleges of Rush University, who hold the same rank in the Graduate College as in their primary colleges . All of our programs are administered out of the Dean's office and are overseen by the Graduate College Council . F aculty members from several programs participate in the education of students in each program . The Graduate College Student Council will be an open forum, whereby any student member of the Graduate College (MS or PhD) can attend meetings held by the elected graduate student representatives . These meetings are for the students to discuss concerns related to the Graduate College, including the curriculum, insurance, academic matters, fund raising, degree requirements, professional development opportunities, as well as community engagement . All issues raised at these meetings will be brought to the attention of the Graduate College Council . Also, the GCSC coordinates awards given to the faculty by the graduate students (Mentor of the Year and Excellence in Teaching Award) . All students are encouraged to participate to ensure your input is communicated . Students serving on the council are provided the opportunity to take an active role in college governance; serving as liaisons that interact between the student body, the Graduate College, and the University . Also, as part of a community of science professionals, the Graduate College Student Council should partake in university or community outreach programs such as fund-raisers, elemen- tary school science demonstrations, and philanthropic work deemed appropriate by the members of the council that year . In more recent years, the GCSC have instituted the Emerald Event, their largest fund-raiser for the students of the Graduate College to attend scientific conferences and present their research . Since its beginning, the GCSC has raised money to pay for well over 50 travel awards . The GCSC has also helped in various charitable endeavors which raise money for research; as well as university-sponsored fund-raisers including golf-outings, wine and cheese art auctions, and smaller projects throughout the year . The GCSC also organizes several social outings from BBQs to whirly ball competitions, to intra-departmental sporting competitions . Program Specific Committees All Graduate College programs have committees that advise the Program Director on the process of student acceptance, progression and deal with curricular issues . Respective Progr am Directors chair these Committees .259 The Graduate College Academic Programs Biotechnology (MS) Clinical Research (MS) Integrated Biomedical Sciences (MS and PhD) 260 Biotechnology (MS) Biotechnology (MS): Program Overview The Graduate College offers a two-semester, non-thesis academic, research and laboratory master's level training program designed to prepare the student for a research career in the pharmaceuti- cal and biotechnology industries or the university laboratory . This program is also an excellent preparation for further training in graduate school or professional doctoral programs . The student will take the Graduate College's Core Curriculum series of didactic courses covering principles of molecular biology and genetics, cellular biochemistry, cell biology, tissue biology and system physiology and pharmacology . Additional courses designed specifically to prepare students for a career in the laboratory and research, including Experimental Design and Models in Disease, Biostatistics, Research Ethics, Communication and Management, are also required . Finally , students will participate in hands-on laboratory courses designed to cover the common and most important techniques and methods employed in research today . The program will culminate in an independent research capstone experience, where students complete a small research project complete with research design, execution of laboratory experi - ments, data analyses and the defense/presentation of their work . The student will also participate in the IPE 502 university course, which will expose students to inter-professional teamwork in healthcare settings . The course will appear on the student's transcript . The laboratory and research experiences will ensure proficiency in a wide variety of techniques, making the student highly competitive for employment in this ever-expanding and understaffed job market . This program also gives an excellent expansion in basic sciences and its applications in translational research, thus serve well those students who wish to further their studies in professional schools (medical, dental, pharmacy, and other health sciences) or join a PhD program . Biotechnology (MS): Admission Requirements Admissions to the biotechnology program are offered for the fall semester only . The Graduate College feels that a qualified and dedicated student can complete the requirements of the full-time curriculum within the two-semester academic plan . It must be emphasized that this is a rigorous program that will require full attention and commitment by the student . The faculty of the Graduate College encourages diversity among the student population and therefore, seeks to admit persons from various backgrounds . The Graduate College uses the following guidelines to evaluate candidates for admission:1. Deadline for applications: All F-1 visa holders are encouraged to apply by March 15 . F or U .

Students with other advanced degrees including nursing and pharmacy degrees and experience in clinical trials may also apply, however an advanced degree is not required . Many stu - dents in the program are physicians in fellowship programs at Rush and Stroger Hospitals . Students seeking admission to the Master of Science in Clinical Research program must complete an application and provide formal transcripts from all institu - tions of higher education that were previously attended . The deadline for application is generally July 30, although exceptions can be made . Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester, which starts early September . The majority of students applying to this program are current health professionals, and if an advanced health professional degree is documented, no entrance examination is required . If the applicant does not hold a professional degree, the GRE must be taken except in instances where professional experience would demonstrate performance in the field . If evidence of performance in the 50th percentile in national examinations (e . g . , MCAT or USMLE step I or an equivalent test scores or DAT) is provided, the GRE requirements can be waived . Applications will be reviewed by the Program Director and students will be notified when they are accepted . Clinical Research (MS): Thesis Process After identifying a mentor, the student and mentor will begin to outline the research project during the spring and summer of the first year . This can be of the student's own design or, alternatively, a student may participate in a large multi-centered trial provided permission is received in advance for publication of the subset of that data collected by the student as a thesis . Any project that involves patient-oriented research (requires IRB approval, or involves a systematic review of patient data) can be submitted . By midterm of the spring semester the student will present the project in the form of a scientific abstract with anticipated methods, statistical analyses, power analysis and possible outcomes . The Program Director must approve the abstract . Once approved, an IRB application can be submitted The student will be required to complete the research project and write up the findings as a research thesis . The student is then encouraged to formulate the thesis into a scientific journal article and submit the manuscript as a publication in a peer reviewed journal . If a manuscript is not written and submitted, the student must still present a written thesis for consideration for degree completion . All students will present their work publicly prior to graduation . The mentor and Program Director sign the completed thesis document indicating acceptance of the thesis for completion of the degree . There are no written or oral qualifying exams for the program . Clinical Research (MS): Academic Policies To remain in good standing, the Graduate College requires that the student has a passing (\"B\" or higher) cumulative average for all required coursework . F or this purpose a P will count as a B for grade averaging . Students are expected to attend all classes and participate in discussion . Students are also expected to participate in the various computer laboratories that are routinely held in the McCormick Educational Technology Center (METC) throughout the first year of the program where the Biostatistics courses are taught . Students are expected to conduct themselves in a profes- sional manner . This includes respecting the rights of others and being kind and courteous to students, faculty/staff and patients . Intimidation of other students and faculty/staff will not be tolerated and is grounds for dismissal . Sexual har assment as well as harassment related to race, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or parental status, or disability is prohibited . The University Bulletin details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities as well as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment . The Graduate College understands that many of the students are clinicians, but it does expect for them to be available for class time (generally 3:30 to 7:00 p . m . on Tuesdays and Thursdays) . The Master of Science, major in Clinical Research, program follows the University Policies on Academic Honesty and the University Statement on Student Conduct . Student Grievance Procedure Numerous checks are in place to assure the fair treatment of students . However , if a grievance does evolve, the student should speak with the Program Director first in an attempt to resolve the problem . If this is unsuccessful or the griev ance involves the Program Director, the student's grievance can be appealed to the Dean of the College .263 Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog .

Please see the v arious clinical departments/sections at Rush University for their respective research interests . Clinical Research: Curriculum The curriculum for the program is single track the first year and self-directed the second year . All students in the program are required to maintain a cumulative average of \"B\" or greater (or pass) . Courses offered are gr aded in year one as either pass/ no pass or with a letter grade . With the exception of the IRB modules, all classes in the first year are scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 to 7:00 p . m .264 For graduation, students are required to complete a minimum of 32 credit hours . Students are recommended to tak e the readings courses in the second year along with Grantsmanship course . The students will also meet periodically with the Program Director during the second year to monitor progress on their master's thesis research project . A trainee who fails a class or receives a no-pass in a course will have an opportunity to retake the exam or rewrite the paper to reverse the no-pass grade . A cumulative average of \"B\" or greater (pass) in required courses is needed to continue in the program . F ailure to remediate the no-pass grade will automatically require the Program Director to review the trainee's status and officially place the trainee on academic probation for a period of one semester . The course director will develop a remediation plan to ensure the trainee has mastery of the subject area covered . Required courses are GRE-557, CRE PVM 553 . The second year is designed to provide an intense mentored clinical research project under a mentor's guidance and the preparation of a Master's Thesis . Students usually enroll in at least six credit hours per semester . These are typically research hours (CRE-597) or elective readings classes . The student and mentor will identify a clinical research project and will submit that project in the form of an abstract by the end of the spring semester of year 1 . The student and mentor will further refine the proposal in the summer between the first and second years . Only projects relating to clinical research questions will be con- sidered for this program . The student is expected to complete all of the data collection by the beginning of the spring semester for submission of the thesis by the end of the spring semester of the second year . Minimum Credit Hours Required Successful completion of the clinical research program requires 32 semester hours as a minimum for graduation along with preparation and public defense of a written thesis, as well as submission of a completed thesis to the Rush Library for publication . Of the 32 semester hours required to complete the program; 13 credit hours should come from required courses, a minimum of 12 semester hours from Thesis Research, and a minimum of 2 semester hours of electives . Students may opt to take additional credit hours beyond the required 32 credit hours, but are financially responsible for the additional tuition cost .Integrated Biomedical Sciences Integrated Biomedical Sciences (MS) The MS in Integrated Biomedical Sciences (IBS) is a research master's degree that will introduce students to the scientific approach . Students who do well in the IBS MS progr am are encouraged to apply for the IBS PhD program . Gr aduates will be prepared to perform advanced biomedical research at colleges and universities, government agencies, hospitals, non-profit agencies and industry . In the past Rush offered master' s degrees in Anatomy, Biochemistry and Immunology/Microbiology; however the IBS master's program includes additional basic science disciplines, such as neurological science, physiology and pharmacology, as well as the original three areas . Since collab - orative interdisciplinary teams of scientists perform transforma - tive biomedical research, singlediscipline based science degrees will no longer be offered . Instead our new integr ated program emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach to biomedical educa- tion and research . Students in the program will work with faculty to generate new knowledge in biomedicine using sophisticated research methods and statistics . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (MS): Track/Research Opportunities The research tracks for the program are translational cancer research; cardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflammation and infection; functions and disorders of the musculoskeletal system; and functions and disorders of the nervous system . The tracks include qualified faculty from Rush University Medical Center who have an interest in research in these tracks . They come from academic departments as well as clinical departments, which enables students to select a variety of individuals with basic and clinical expertise to serve on their advisory committees and guide them through their projects .265 Integrated Biomedical Sciences (MS): Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester to begin the required course work in the core curriculum . The priority deadline for admission consideration is March 30 and the pre- ferred final date that applications will be accepted is May 1 . The program has the following requirements for admission: A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college . Course work in biology , cellular biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and mathematics, including calculus, is highly recommended . Upper-level biochemistry or physiology courses are also highly recommended . Official academic tr anscripts from all baccalaureate and post- baccalaureate educational experiences are required . These should provide a minimal grade point average of 3 .0 overall (out of 4 .0) . Higher gr ades are expected in science courses . Applicants from foreign countries must have their tr anscripts evaluated by the independent agency, ECE . GRE or MCA T scores are required . All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) . A statement of the applicant' s interests, previous research experience, and goals needs to be included as an essay in the application . The personal statement must include a ranking of a student's interest in the five different research tracks . If the student's research track interest is not clear, then he or she should list \"undecided .\" T hree letters of recommendation, two of which must come from academic resources, are required . Letters will prefer - ably be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, the applicant's academic and research performance, and the applicant's ability to think and work independently . The admissions committee will evaluate applications . All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for success in the program . With rare exceptions, MS applicants will interview online or by phone with faculty members before admission to the program . Acceptance is on a rolling basis and will be limited by the availability of faculty to act as mentors . We will begin accepting qualified applicants after the priority deadline until the cohort is complete .266 First Year Cr edit Hours Fall Term GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology 1 GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry 1 BTN-525 Experimental Models in Disease & Experimental Design 2 GCC-501 Molecular Biology: Genome to Proteome 3 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins, Transport and Signaling 3 GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-530 Labor atory Rotations I 1-9 GCC-505 T echniques in Biomedical Sciences 2 Spring Term GCC-504 Functional Tissue Biology 3 GCC-506 Research Ethics 1 GCC-507 Biomedical Statistics 2 GCC-533 Labor atory Rotations II 1-9 Cognates and Electives For graduation, students will need 7 credit hours of cognates and 4 credit hours of electives.

Note GCC = Graduate College coursesBTN = Biotechnology courseThe specific courses or hours of cognates and electives will vary each semester depending upon the student's choice of track V = Variable number of credit hoursThe specific courses or hours of cognates and electives will vary each semester depending upon the student's choice of track and specific course selections . A low number of credit hours are considered to be a full-time commitment to research .267 Integrated Biomedical Sciences (MS): Program Progression Year 1: Classes The goal of course work in the first year is to expose students to the biomedical sciences in a logical progression and to provide the students with tools for approaching their future research experience . The reading courses provide a critical understanding of the literature and existing base of knowledge . They will also show students how new knowledge in these areas can help us understand diseases and use this information to identify new therapeutics . This broad-based approach to disease is the core of the integrated biomedical sciences program . Year 1: Research Experience, Advisor and Research Track Selection During the first year, students will typically have two lab rota- tions in different laboratories . Labor atory rotations will expose students to diverse research environments and allow them to assess how they fit in to a particular laboratory or men- tor situation . Students are expected to learn techniques and attend all scheduled experiments, lab meetings, mentor/student discussions, etc . Based on these rotations , students will submit the name of a potential advisor and their track choice to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences Education Committee . The com - mittee, in consultation with the potential advisor, will approve advisor-student matches . Specific research projects will be deter - mined by the thesis advisor after advisor-student discussions . If a student cannot choose a thesis advisor based on the first two laboratory rotations, a third rotation may be taken in the spring or summer . The selection of a research advisor and project will determine the student's selection of a research track . Year 2: Classes, Research Experience, Thesis Committee, Thesis Proposal and Thesis Presentation Any classes will be dictated by the track cognates and electives available that academic year . Course selection should comple - ment research activity and the student's interests and should help prepare him or her for the career choice identified through the use of the individual development plan website and addi- tional resources provided by the Graduate College . When the student is not in class or studying, the student should be work- ing on his or her research project . The student's assessment at this time relates to the following student outcomes: The student is able to acquire research skills, collect and analyze data, and interpret results to address an original research question .In addition, this step begins the continuing assessment of the following outcomes: A graduating student is capable of independent critical thinking and writing, as well as proposing, performing and effectively presenting his or her research . The graduate is able to work collaboratively with other scien- tists, physicians and health care professionals to give and obtain feedback concerning the approach to research problems, data analysis and implications of research . The student creates an individual development plan (IDP) to bet- ter define his or her areas of interest, including teaching, admin- istration, and research in industrial or academic environments or further professional education . Upon gr aduation, the graduate will have used the IDP , mentorship and training opportunities to refine his or her career path . In consultation with an advisor, the student chooses a the- sis committee consisting of the advisor, and two additional Graduate College faculty members . Committee members should be familiar with either the research area or crucial technical aspects of the student's project . Each student will write a suc - cinct research project proposal which will be presented to the committee for approval . The proposal serves to keep the student focused on achieving project aims and allows the committee to track student progress based on the stated aims . Students should view the committee members as a resource for didactic and technical assistance . The student is expected to write a thesis and present his or her research to the Rush research community (thesis presentation) . The thesis committee will then meet with the student to address any questions or issues related to the data or format of the thesis document . The student may be asked to make revisions before final committee approval . Minimal Credit Hours Required for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences MS Degree The program is designed to be completed in five consecutive semesters and requires completion of at least 37 semester hours . These hours include 20 credit hours of core courses, seven credit hours of track-specific cognates, four credit hours of elective courses, and six hours of thesis research credit . The core curriculum focuses on developing knowledge and skills in research theories and methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . In addition, students will work with faculty advisors to select one area from five available tracks: translational cancer research; cardiovas- cular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflam- mation; function and disorders of the musculoskeletal system; 268 and function and disorders of the nervous system . Students will each have a research project, write a thesis and give a thesis presentation at project completion . The core curriculum, which is common to all students, builds knowledge and skills in research theories and methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . These courses will provide systematic exposure to the contemporary process of scientific discovery and will serve as the basis for the remainder of the curriculum . Students will be required, in conjunction with their advisors, to select seven credit hours of courses from concentration-focused cognates in their chosen tracks and a minimum of four elec- tive credits from the Graduate College courses offered . Finally , students will be required to accrue a minimum of six credit hours of thesis research . Master' s students will be encouraged to participate in track-specific advanced topic seminars in the second year . Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The program's assistant director functions as the academic advisor to the students during the first year of matriculation in the program . After two rotations, the student will identify the track that he or she wishes to enter and will begin working in the laboratory of his or her research advisor . At this time, both the track director and research advisor will serve as mentors for the student . Research Advisor Selection During the first year, the student, in consultation with the assistant program director and track directors in areas related to the student's interests, will select two laboratories for research rotations . Based on these rotations , the student will identify the track that he or she is interested in and submit the name of a potential advisor to the IBS education committee . The commit - tee will match students with advisors . Master's Thesis Research Committee After the student selects a research advisor and begins to collect preliminary data, the student and advisor will select a research committee in consultation with the track director . This committee will advise the student and evaluate his or her pro- posal and thesis documents . The thesis committee will consist of the advisor and two additional Graduate College faculty members . Committee members should be familiar with either the research area or crucial technical aspects of the student's project . Committee members are intended to be a resource for the student and their advisor to enhance didactic and technical knowledge towards the completion of the student's project . The track director (or designated representative) will serve as an ex-officio non-signing member of the thesis committee to oversee the procedural aspects of the committee meetings and student progression through the program . The thesis committee will strive for consensus in all its actions; however, a majority vote of the committee's membership is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the thesis, in which case only one member may disagree with the final decision . Research Proposal Each student will write a succinct research project proposal to be presented to the committee for approval . The proposal serves to keep the student focused on achieving project aims and allows the committee to track student progress based on the stated aims . Proposals should contain the following elements: A background section with relev ant literature citations in the specific research area T he specific aim or aims (appropriately limited in scope) T he experimental design and methods to be utilized Any preliminary data collected The target date for proposal presentations is within the first 45 days of the fall semester of year two; it is also acceptable for the proposal presentation to be held in the summer term between years one and two . The thesis committee evaluates the feasibility and scope of the project and recommends alterations as needed to ensure adequate student progress through the program in a timely fashion . Students must maintain a B aver age in the first year . If they drop below a B aver age, they should discuss the possibility of remediation with the director of the course causing difficulty . The course director may issue an incomplete grade for a limited time in accordance with university policy while agreed- upon remediation takes place . However , once a failing grade (No Pass or letter grade less than B) has been given, the education committee must approve a remediation plan . Until a gr ade is remedied or the average is improved in some other way, the student is on probation . A student who remains on probation for two semesters will be dismissed . Students who have entered a track must receive at least a B grade in any courses deemed required by their track director . Failure to remediate a grade of less than B in a required course or a no-pass grade in a pass/no-pass course or the receipt of another such grade while on probation will result in dismissal .269 Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD) Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Program Philosophy The PhD in integrated biomedical sciences is designed to educate science professionals for leadership in research and academic positions, as well as to provide career path education relevant to their specialized fields . In the past, Rush offered doc - toral degrees in anatomy, biochemistry, immunology, neurologi- pharmacology . Since collabor ative interdisciplinary teams of scientists perform current and future biomedical research, we no longer offer, individual basic science degrees . Instead our new doctor al program emphasizes an integrated interdisciplinary approach to biomedical research . Graduates of this program will perform high-quality, impactful biomedical research at colleges and universities, government agencies, hospitals and nonprofit agencies and in industry . Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists to generate new knowledge in the fields of biomedicine using sophisticated research methods . As a part of the program, students are required to demonstrate their knowledge of core and concentration-specific course work pass a comprehensive preliminary examination and a qualifying exam based on their research proposal . They will design and conduct research that culminates in a dissertation, and they will disseminate their sci- entific findings through scholarly publications and presentations . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required course work in the core curriculum . The deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1 . The Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program has the following requirements for admission to the program: A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college . Course work in biology , cellular biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and mathematics, including calculus, is highly recommended .

Higher gr ades are expected in science courses, and evidence of research experience is preferred . GRE or MCA T scores are required . All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) . Applicants from foreign countries must have their transcripts evaluated by the independent agency, ECE . A statement of the applicant' s interests, previous research experience, and goals needs to be included as an essay in the application . The personal statement must include a ranking of the student's interest in the five research tracks . If the student's research track interest is not clear, then the student should list \"undecided .\" T hree letters of recommendation, two from academic resources, are required . We prefer these to be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, the applicant's academic and research performance, and the applicant's ability to think and work independently . The admissions committee will evaluate applications . All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for suc- cess as a graduate student and future independent investigator . With rare exceptions, PhD applicants will be required to inter - view with faculty members before admission to the program . Acceptance into the doctoral program is limited by the availabil- ity of stipends . Accepted doctoral students receive a competi - tive University supported stipend and tuition scholarship, are supported by a funded faculty member or have stipends from external sources . In most cases University funded stipends are awarded to US residents . The stipend and tuition scholarship is renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree .270 Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Curriculum Cognates and Electives For graduation, students will need 16 credits of cognate hours and 9 credits of elective hours in courses that they select .

GCC-699 Dissertation Research Credit(s): 1-9272 Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Dissertation Program Progression Year 1 Classes and Comprehensive Exam: The goal of the course work in the first year is to expose the student to the biomedical sciences to enable them to design and approach a research problem from molecular, biochemi- cal, cellular and organ system perspectives . This broad based approach to disease is the core of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences program . The Topics in Biomedical Integration course (GCC 531) is offered in the spring semester of the first year . In this course, a specific disease will be studied from the molecular perspective to organ system failure under Faculty direction . The students will then be assigned a group project in which they use the approaches they have learned to study another disease . This project will strengthen student skills in preparation for the com- prehensive exam . In the summer , GCC 532 Topics in Biomedical Integration II is the comprehensive exam in which students will be given an individualized disease topic related to their planned research . They will be required to write a literature review approaching the topic from each biomedical prospective . Year 1 Research Experience: During the first year, every student will have three laboratory rotations: GCC 530, Laboratory Rotation 1 (variable), GCC 533, Laboratory Rotation 2 (variable), and GCC 534, Laboratory Rotation 3 (variable) . Each rotation must be in a different laboratory . A student registering for the 3 required Laboratory Rotations should consecutively use GCC 530, 533 or 534 . These laboratory rotations will expose the students to a range of research environments . Students are expected have a small project with a hypothesis and aims, to learn techniques and attend all lab meetings . Based on these rotations and other discussions with potential advisors, at the end of these rotations the student will submit the names of three potential Research Advisors with a priority ranking to the IBS Education Committee . The IBS Education Committee in consultation with the potential advisors will decide which student will be matched with which advisor (see Track Selection below) . Students committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the Research Advisor's grants) are also required to do 3 laboratory rotations . Exposure to other laboratories and research will give the student a greater breadth of knowledge . Students are expected to select a Research Advisor and a Research Track by the end of their first summer term . IBS MS to PhD students will follow their tr ack of courses and may either do a rotation (GCC 534) or if they did not change laboratories, they may immediately begin Pre Dissertation research with their research advisor . All advisors must meet the criterion established by the program (see below) .Year 2 Track Selection, Research experience, Qualifying Exam The selection of Research Advisor will significantly influence the student's selection of a research track . Subsequent classes will be dictated by the track cognates and electives and by relevant electives offered in other tracks . The selection of electives should complement research activity and the interests of the students and should help prepare him/her for the career path identified through the use of the Individual Development Plan (IDP) web- site (http://myidp . sciencecarreers . org) and additional resources provided by the Graduate College . The goals of the second year are to learn the relevant laboratory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunction with their Research Advisor . The research project will advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield \"first author\" scientific publications for the student . The student's research proposal should include Specific Aims and be written up as an F31 grant (See \"Dissertation Proposal and Presentation\" on the next page) . The student must select a Dissertation Committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the second year . The proposal pre - sentation to the Committee is considered the Qualifying Exam . Acceptance of the proposal by the Dissertation Committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . The student's assessment at this time relates to the following Student Learning Outcomes: T he graduate will be able to acquire research skills, collect and analyze data, and interpret results in order to address an original research question . In addition, this step begins the continuing assessment of the following outcomes: A graduating student will be capable of independent critical thinking and writing as well as propos- ing, performing and effectively presenting his/her research . T he graduate will be able to work collaboratively with other scientists, physicians and health care professionals to give and obtain feedback concerning the approach to research problems, data analysis and implications of research . The work environment in basic and clinical science is evolv- ing . Students need to be aw are of the many different types of opportunities available in the workplace and need to prepare themselves for the opportunities and challenges that they will encounter when they graduate . In addition to the research and the coursework that the student will be involved in the student will create an Individual Development Plan (IDP) to define their areas of interest including teaching, administration, research in industry, or academic research . At the end of the first year the Program and Track Directors will review each student's IDP plan and progress in the program . Upon gr aduation, the graduate 273 will have used the IDP , mentorship and training opportunities to refine their career path . Student progress is assessed at the end of years two through five . F or year two the assessment of student progress to meet expected outcomes will be evaluated by the student's Research Advisor and Track Director . See section on Dissertation Proposal and Presentation . Year 3-5 Research Progress/Publications/ Dissertation For evaluations in years three through five, the student will sub- mit a written report documenting their progress . The research advisor and Track Director will also submit their assessment of student progress for each year . A meeting with the student, Research Advisor, and Track Director will take place at the end of each year to discuss the student's progress . The Research Advisor monitors the day-to-day progress of the student . The Dissertation committee will meet at least once per year to monitor progress and to approve any changes to the proposed research project . They may meet more frequently, especially after the approval of the student's research proposal . The student is expected to attend national meetings, make presentations, posters etc . and become a part of the scientific community . Lik ewise, the student should be submitting research articles . The Integrated Biomedical Science PhD program requires that the research project yield at least one first authored research article accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal . The publication requirement is necessary for graduation but not sufficient . The Dissertation Committee will continue to assess student progress on the aims and determines when the student has completed his/her dissertation . (See Dissertation Proposal and Presentation, below) . The student's assessment continues on the outcomes listed above with emphasis on the growth of research and commu- nication skills . Lik ewise, it is expected that the communication outcomes will also become more centered on written commu-nication in the form of abstracts, peer-reviewed journal articles and the dissertation as the student begins to complete the following outcome: T he graduate is able to contribute to the scientific literature in an area of expertise via published abstracts, a dissertation and by the publication of a first-authored research article in a refereed journal . Thesis Document, Presentation and Approval The student is expected to write a thesis document (approved by the director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center) and present the work in a public lecture attended by the thesis committee, and University faculty and students . The thesis committee will then meet with the student in a closed ses- sion to address any additional questions and to deliberate on approval of the thesis . Typically the meeting immediately follows the public lecture . The student may be asked to make revisions before final thesis approval by the committee . The registrar's office must be notified of impending completion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate Form at the beginning of the final semester . As the thesis is reaching final form, the student should consult with the University librarian to assure that the document is formatted correctly . Once the thesis is approved, the student will complete the final checklist to assure that all necessary approvals have been obtained . Each student will be required to have an exit interview and provide feedback concerning his or her experience at Rush University . Minimal Credit Hours Required for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD) Degree The PhD in integrated biomedical sciences should be completed in five years and requires completion of 80 semester hours of credit distributed as follows: core courses (37), concentration specific cognates (16), electives (9), and dissertation research (18) . Students must also pass the Cumulative Exam and the Qualifying Exam and publish a 1st authored scientific paper on their research project . The core curriculum, which is common to all students, builds knowledge and skills in research theo-ries and methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . These courses provide systematic exposure to the contemporary process of scientific discovery and will serve as the basis for the remainder of the curriculum . Advanced students entering with a Master of Science (MS) degree in a biomedical science or a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree may have satisfied the requirement for some of the core classes based on their prior records . Therefore some core course requirements may be waived, then the requirement of core course hours can be compensated by taking extra hours of laboratory rotations or pre-dissertation research . These students may be able to complete the degree in a shorter time period providing that they progress through the other program require- ments . IBS MS students who enter the IBS PhD progr am will be on a separate track which requires fewer Cognate and elective hours based on the number of hours of cognate and electives required for the IBS MS program . Students will be required, in conjunction with their advisors, to select from concentration-focused cognates in one of five tracks: translational cancer research; cardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflammation and infection; disorders of the musculoskeletal system; and disorders of the nervous system . 274 All students will be required to participate in track-specific advanced topic seminars and to complete a minimum of 18 semester hours of dissertation research following admission into candidacy for the PhD . Dissertation hours in the Gr aduate College encompass laboratory research required for comple- tion of the dissertation, including analyzing published data; developing a research proposal; learning and applying advanced methodologies and statistical data analyses; developing skills to write and submit a pre-doctoral training grant application; practicing presentation skills to disseminate one's own research findings in national conferences; writing a research publication; and developing and defending a dissertation project . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Academic Policies Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The Program Director functions as the academic advisor to the student during the first year . During this time , the Program Director determines the course schedule with the student and monitors the student's progress . In the second year the Track Director works with the Research Advisor and assists the student in selecting the proper cognates and electives . Research Advisor Selection: During the first year, the student, in consultation with the program director and track directors in areas related to the student's interests, will select three laboratories for research rotations . Based on these rotations , the student will identify the track he or she is interested in and submit the names of three potential advisors with a priority ranking to the IBS educa- tion committee . The IBS education committee, in consultation with the potential advisors, will match students with advisors . Students who are already committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the research advisor's grants) are still required to take three laboratory rotations . The student's research project should advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications for the student . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Track/Research Opportunities The research tracks for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD Program are translational cancer research; cardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflammation and infection; func - tions and disorders of the musculoskeletal system; and func- tions and disorders of the nervous system . The tracks include qualified faculty from Rush University Medical Center who have an interest in research in these tracks . They come from academic departments as well as clinical departments, which enables students to select a variety of individuals with basic and clinical expertise to serve on their advisory committees and guide them through their projects . Milestone Exams Comprehensive exam - In the summer quarter following the first year of classes, all students will take GCC 532; Topics in Biomedical Integration II . This course is their comprehen - sive exam where each student will be given an individual- ized disease topic related to their planned research . They will be required to write a literature review approaching the topic . This comprehensive exam assures that the student can approach a research or clinical problem from a variety of perspectives, accounting for the published literature that illu- minates the molecular, cellular and organ systems manifesta- tions of the disease process . Qualifying Exam (Dissertation Proposal and Presentation) - The student must select a Dissertation Committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the 2nd year . The student's research proposal should include at least three Specific Aims and be written up as a NIH F31 grant . Acceptance of the proposal by the Dissertation Committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . Advisory Committee After passing the comprehensive exam, the student selects a Research Advisor and begins to collect preliminary data . By the end of spring of the second year the student and advisor select a dissertation committee in consultation with the Track Director . This committee advises the student and serves as the Qualifying exam committee and the Dissertation Defense Committee . The Graduate College requires that the committee is comprised of five members . One member will be the student' s Research Advisor . A majority of the Committee (at least three members) must be faculty at Rush University who are members of the Graduate College . The chair of this committee, who cannot be the student's Research Advisor, will be chosen at the first com- mittee meeting and will preside at all subsequent meetings and arrange for a timely completion of the dissertation work . The dissertation committee strives for consensus in all its actions . A majority vote of the committee's membership, however, is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the dissertation . In addition to the five committee members, a member of the IBS Education Committee will serve as an ex officio member of the committee . Ex officio members can participate in the meetings but cannot vote . IBS Education Committee members are eligible 275 to be selected to the five-person committee as full members; if they are selected, they cannot serve as the required ex officio member . The purpose of having an ex officio member is to moni - tor the quality of the exam experience . The ex officio member will ensure that the Graduate College rules are followed; they will report back to the Education Committee . Qualifying Exam The goals of the second year are to learn the relevant labora - tory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunc- tion with the student's Research Advisor . The research project will advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield \"first author\" scientific publications for the student . F or the Qualifying Exam, the student's research proposal should include a hypoth - esis and specific aims and be written up as an F31 grant . The student must select a Dissertation Committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the second year . All members of the Advisory Committee or appropriate substitutes must be present at the Qualifying Exam and the Dissertation Defense either in person, on the phone or using electronic media . If the student does not complete the Qualifying exam by the end of the Summer of their second year they will be on proba- tion during the Fall of their third year . If they have not tak en the exam by the end of that semester on probation the student will be dismissed . Since the advisor also has a responsibility to mak e sure that their students complete milestones in the program on schedule, advisors of students who do not take the Qualifying exam by the end of Fall semester their third year will not be allowed to take a new student into their laboratory for the next two years . If possible , students will submit their proposal as an Individual National Research Service Award (F31) [see: grants . nih .gov/training/nrsa .htm#fellowships for more information] . Once a student has passed the Qualifying exam they are a can-didate for the PhD and will register for GCC 699, Dissertation Research . Once the Qualifying Exam has been passed, the student will present an annual update to their committee in an identical format as the original proposal meeting with exception of the anticipated year for graduation . They will also present their work in an open seminar in GCC 693 during their third and fourth years (unless the student is graduating in their fourth year) . The annual Advisory Committee update will consist of an oral presentation research progress by the doctoral student to their committee . This oral presentation will be followed by a discussion of progress in the last year; their career develop- ment will also be reviewed . A detailed written account of each of these areas will be distributed to the committee prior to this meeting . It is recommended that the myIDP website (http:// myIDP . sciencecareers . org) be used whenever possible to track and report all professional development activities .Data Defense and Dissertation In the candidate's final year, a Dissertation Data Defense will be presented to their dissertation committee demonstrating that satisfactory progress has been made on the project to justify development of a plan to complete all experiments and to start writing their dissertation . Upon completion of the data defense and writing of the dissertation, the student will provide the dissertation to their committee for approval at least two weeks prior to their public defense . The public defense will be com - prised of a public one-hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty and students of the University . The disser - tation committee then meets in closed session to examine the candidate and approve the dissertation . Typically the meeting immediately follows the public lecture . In line with the rules and procedures of the Graduate College, the committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objec- tions of a single committee member . However , if two committee members disapprove the dissertation, then it is not approved . The awarding of the PhD degree requires the demonstration of a capability for independent research and a contribution to scientific knowledge . As for the Qualifying Exam, all members of the committee or appropriate substitutes must be present at the Dissertation Defense either in person, on the phone or using electronic media . It is assumed that one or more research articles are included in the dissertation . Since a peer reviewed first authored research article is required for the degree, the dissertation is not consid- ered complete until its publication . If publication is pending, the committee may sign off on the dissertation but the Program Director will not sign off on the graduation form until the paper is accepted or published as verified by appearing on Pub Med . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Tuition Scholarship and Stipend Acceptance into the doctoral program is limited by the availabil- ity of stipends . Accepted doctoral students receive a competi - tive University supported stipend and tuition scholarship, are supported by a funded faculty member or have stipends from external sources . University funded stipends are aw arded to US residents . The stipend and tuition scholarship is renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree . Outside employment is forbidden without prior graduate college approval as it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program . This excludes activities that would be in line with Individual Development Plan goals like tutoring, teaching and proctoring .276 Rush University Course Descriptions 277 Rush University Course Descriptions Audiology AUD - 576 Counseling The major focus is on understanding the process of the help- ing relationship in counseling individuals with communication disorders and their families .
