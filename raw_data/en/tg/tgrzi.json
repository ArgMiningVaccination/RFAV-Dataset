What we usually don't know is that our doctor's knowle dge is based on experience and on evidence. However, the evidence can be flawed, exaggerated, or may not actually apply to us. While the re are many things that can go wrong in clinical studies, the main focus of this dissertation is on the concept of confo unding. Confounding occurs when a specific exposure a nd outcome have a common cause. For example , more breast cancer patients receiving surgery as the observed \"exposure\" survive than those receiving chemotherapy. Concluding that surgery is better for surv ival may , however, be confounded by cancer stage because those who were operated on had a less advanced cancer stage and thus were more likely to survive to begin with . Minimizing the impact of such confounding in research studies on treatment effects is i mportant because it can alter the estimates of a treatment effect and thus may lead to wrong conclusions and ultimately to wrong treatment decisions. For many health topics, there are myriads of studies available and whether or not their results can give us reliable answers to what we want to know depends on a variety of factors. The most important factor is the study design. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the current gold standard to produce evidence for treatment decisions. They measure the causa l effect of a treatment versus a control on a specific outcome. The key element is that study participants are randomly assigned to treatment or control (which could be a placebo or another treatment). The randomization tries to balance all known (such as age) and unknown characteristics (such as undiagnosed diseases) of the participants which means that they also balance all known and unknown confounding factors. The only difference between the participant groups will then be the allocation to a treatment or control . This would be the perfect study design if the circumstances were ideal, i.e. if every participant adhered to the assigned treatment and stayed on the study until the end. In reality, the participants often do not adhere (e.g. because the exerci se program of a weight -loss study is too demanding) or they become lost to follow - up (e.g. because they moved away or did not want to be on the study anymore). However, not every clinical question can be answered in an RCT. Another important research desig n are observational studies, where the exposure of patients to an intervention or a control is not decided by the study investigators (thus observational) and may thus depend on a number of other known and unknown factors, e.g. doctors' decisions or patien t's preferences . This study design is very prone to confounding and requires careful statistical analyses . Statistical methods can then be used to retrospectively address issues like confounding or confounding that changes over time. One such statistical method is marginal s tructural models (MSM). MSM allow a causal interpretation of results under the assumptions that all confounding factors are known , correctly measured and properly implemented in the statistical models. However, even with the latest stati stical methods, RCTs and observational studies may not give the same answer when trying to solve the same question . Hence, the aims of the doctoral projects were 1) to evaluate the extent to which confounding is actively considered in the conclusions from observational studies; 2) to evaluate the agreement of treatment effects from non- randomized studies using MSM with reported effects from RCTs on the same topic ; 3) to evaluate when MSM is used in RCTs and how these results differ from the main (non -MSM) results of the same trial. First, we assessed the scope of the issue within the health professionals' literature. Are authors of scientific papers aware of the problem of confounding for the interpretation of their results and do they present their results in light of its possible impact? Second, if observational studies use MSM to x reduce the impact of confounding and allow a causal interpretation, the results should be similar to those from RCTs on the same clinical question. To assess how well they agree, we used established approaches to compare the effects , for example we determined how often the effects from both designs indicated concordantly that a treatment is beneficial or not . Third, we conduct ed an empirical analysis of where and why MSM is used to analyze randomized comparisons, a rather new and emerging approach to address confounding within randomized trials, and how these results compare to non -MSM results from the same trial. We found that observational studies in general tend to have unsatisfa ctory or no discussion of confounding at all. If confounding was mentioned, it was either deemed irrelevant for the respective research or results are not brought in context of necessary cautious interpretation. Studies that did, however, report possible l imitations due to confounding were actually cited more by other researchers than studies that deemed an influence due to confounding unlikely. This means research that is carefully reported may have more impact on science than other research. When MSM was applied to observational study data, the effects often had opposite directions (i.e. one showed harm and the other benefit of the intervention) and were more favorable for the experimental treatment than in randomized studies on the same research question. This was even more so when the studies focused on informing health care decision making rather than statistical methodology. MSM was applied to RCT s to minimize the influence of confounding that arises when study participants do not adhere to the protocol . Within the main publication and the publication reporting MSM -based results (sometimes the same), authors reported on average 6 analyses for one outcome in the same population and at the same point in time. Most of these results, however, pointed in the same direction and had more or less similar effect sizes, which means that the clinical interpretation is often similar . We can never be certain that we know all confounding factors, measured them correctly and implemented them correctly in the statistical models. Even research that used causal modelling techniques may still come to different answers than RCTs evaluating the same clinical question would . Hence, c onfounding should be more carefully acknowledged in non -randomized research , doing so is not ass ociated with lower citation impact. Results from causal modelling can be useful sensitivity analyses that can help researchers to get a bigger picture of the impact of other influencing factors. Health care decision makers should remain cautious when using non-randomized evidence to guide their health care decisions. 1 Introduction In evidence -based medicine , the best available clinical evidence, the clinician's expertise, and the patient's values and preferences are applied to make an individualized , medi cal, evidence -based decision1. Study designs to gather evidence are frequently classified into two main categories : randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where patients are randomly allocated to an intervention or a control, and observational studies , where the exposure of patients to an intervention or a control is not controlled by the investigators (thus observational) and may thus depend on a number of other known and unknown factors, e.g. doctors' decisions or patients ' preferences2. The estimated effects from both study designs can deviate from the true (and unknown) effect of the treatments for many reasons including random error and bias . The key advantage of RCTs over observational studies is better control of a number of biases. Bias is any error that leads to the systematic over - or underestimation of an effect and thus systematically undermines the intern al validity of a study . Bias is systematic insofar that - other than random error - it does not decrease when replicating the study several times or when increasing sample size , the result will always deviate from the true effect3 4. Methodologists have defined a large number of individual biases, and the definitions are not always clear5 6. One important type of bias is selection bias. It arises when grou ps are not comparable because of an uneven distribution of patient characteristics and prognostic factors7-9. For example, if a study concludes that vegetarianism prolongs life, that may simply be because compared to non-vegetarians, vegetarians tend to smoke less. This is a systematic difference that would introduce selection bias if not controlled for through statistical methods (the effect of not smoking would ov ershadow the effect of not eating meat). While observational studies are extremely prone to this bias , RCTs can also be concerned when recruiters can guess an d alter upcoming treatment allocations , e.g. by lack of allocation concealment leading to a broken randomization7-9. Another type of bias is information bias (also called detection or measurement bias) which stems from errors in measurement and determination of exposure and outcome . As these are essential for most statistical analyses , such errors can result in mislead care3 7. RCTs are especially prone to this bias when outcome assessors are not blinded3. Another major bias in obser vational studies is confounding. The concept of confounding generally refers to a problem of comparability but it can have different meanings in different scientific fields and eras8 10. In epidemiology , a confounder is a factor that influence s both the exposure to an intervention and the outcome7. For example, cancer stage is a prognostic factor which influences the treatment decision but also the chance of survival (Figure 1). At the level of study design, RCTs provide methods to control for confounding bias. At the level of analysis, a number of statistical methods are available that aim to control for confounding bias in observational stud ies: Traditional approa ches to control the influence of confounding are, for example, restriction, matching, stratification, multivariat e regression , and propensity scores7 11 12. These techniques focus on balancing characteristics between comparison groups at baseline . This can be as simpl e as in the cancer stage example (Figure 1), but confounders cannot always be clearly determined or remain unknown . For example, a study finds a strong association between frequently taking vacations and living longer13. It is easy to imagine that stress reduction and increased physical activities may have a positive impact on health and hence on lifespan. A possible confounder could be stress level at work: people with very demanding jobs may not take vacation as often but may have a higher 2 risk for cardiovascular disease which could shorten their lifespan. I t is also possible that people who can afford to go on vacation more frequently have a higher socioeconomic status which is associated with better access to healthcare which can increase their lifespan13. The data cannot tell investigators what cause and effect are, or through which factors (or mediators) exposure leads to a specific outcome , or by which other factors i t could be influenced. Sometimes investigators can find plausible mechanistic or biologic explanations of exposure as cause for a specific outcome (i.e. causal pathways), e.g. bacteria as cause for many diseases . But still, experts may fail in the attempt to completely understand all underlying factors and base their assumptions on wrong conclusions . For example, many experts criticized the hypothesis that smoking causes cancer and is an important confounder in cancer research14. Hence, even wh en mechanistic explanations are absent, a strong prac tical effect may still be found . For instance, w ithout understanding why, Ignaz Semmelweis discovered that when he washed his hands with chlorine solution before attending a delivery, more women survived giving birth15. In a time where bacteria seemed ridiculous fantasy, this practical approach could still establish cause and effect and saved many lives15. To establish cause and effect , RCTs apply a fundamentally different way than observational studies . Instead of trying to statistically control for basel ine confounding and risking uneven distributions of patient characteristics between groups , RCTs use chance in their design . By randomly allocating patients to one treatment or the other , RCTs aim at creat ing equal groups that only differ in the treatment they are intended to receive2 16. All known and unknown confounder s should, per chance, be divided equally between both groups. If all patients adhere d to the protocol, the measured effect would then be the true causal (unconfounded) effect of the treatment17. However, perfect adherence is unlikely. As with observational studies, cause and effect can be seen in a mechanistic and a practical way which may both have important aspects in inform ing treatment choices18. Those interested in the mechanistic pathways may now ask how effective the treatment would be if all patients adhered to it, i.e. what is the biological effect. For example, to safely avoid pregnanc y, a woman may be more interested in the effect of taking the anti -baby pill at the same time daily (full -adherence) than in taking it with a delay of some hours (non -adherence) . This mechanistic question can be answered with a per protocol analysis in whi ch only patients are analyzed that adhered to the treatment protocol. The greater the non -adherence in a trial, the greater the analyzed groups may deviate from the originally randomized ones and confounding is re-introduced . The reason for this is that those who adhere and those who do not may be systematically different, and because adherence may depend on the allocated treatment as well . Conducting a per -protocol analysis then face s the same statistical challenges as observational studies do19 20. Those interested in a practical approach may ask how effective the treatment is in general (e.g. the gynecologist canno t know whether or not the patient will actually adhere to taking the anti-baby pill at the same time daily and neither does the patient know this upfront despite her motivation ). The practical question is best answered with an intention -to-treat analysis, in which all patients are analyzed according to the groups they were randomly assigned to18. The intention -to-treat effect remains unbiased, even if confounding occurs after randomization such as high drop -out rates or treatment switches (i.e. post -randomization confounding)19. For example, a physical therapist wants to know if a demanding workout will help patients lose weight compared to a light workout . Because the interventional workout is too demanding, many patients stop working out (drop out ) or switch to the light workout . The per -protocol effect may find that the demanding workout resulted in higher weight reduction. However, this effect may be confounded by known and unknown factors : those who adhered to the demanding workout may have had a different body mass index at baseline (this could be statistically controlled for) . Their life -situation may have better allowed them 3 to do t he workout regularly (this is less likely to be measure d in a trial ; factors could be number of people in the household, previous experience with physical programs, motivation, working hours) and also unconscious psychological factors that are not measured or measurable at all may have played a role. Even if a ll these factors had been know n, they would also had to have been adequately measured and then correctly implemented in the model. The unbiased ITT effect, analyzing all patients according to the groups they were allocated to, may not detect a difference b etween the results of the two interventions. While this does not mean that there is no mechanistic difference between the two interventions21, it is likely that the less demanding workout would result in a larger average effect than the (in theory) stronger but more demanding workout that only a minority will adhere to. The physical therapist may in future think twice about which patients could benefit from a demanding workout. Confounding can get even more complex when it varies over time in a longitudinal study . A time- varying confounder is an intermediate variable , i.e. the confounding variable is influenced by previous exposure or changes of the exposure over time . While adjusting for baseline confounders (e.g. prognostic factors that do not change over t ime, such as sex) reduces bias, adjusting for time -varying confounders may introduce bias when using standard statistical methods22. Conventional per -protocol and other standard analyses cannot address this adequately23. Marginal structural models (MSM s), a new class of model , can be used to control for time -varying variables and to make causal interpretations24 25. They model an alternative scenario, e.g. what would have happened had a patient not taken the treatment but the placebo25 26. MSM s are \"marginal\" because within this framework, the patient population is re -weighted in such way that possible out comes are independent of possible confounders. For example, if 50 patients receive treatment A and 50 patients receive treatment B, the patients are re -weighted so that each group has 100 patients. This simulates the alternative scenario of what would have happened had the patients who received treatment A actually received treatment B and vice versa. MSMs are \"structural \" because they attempt to measure a causal effect. To make valid inferences, three main assumptions need to be met : exchangeability, consi stency, and positivity26-28: Exchangeability means that the groups need to be exchangeable, i.e. there should be no unmeasured confounding (i.e. they are \"com parable\") . Ideally, t his would be the case for the baseline groups of an RCT with perfect randomization and an infinitive large sample . Consistency requires that the exposure is so well defined that variants of it will all lead to the same effect on the ou tcome. For example, when taking a specific dose of diclofenac for pain relief, there must be no difference in treatment effect when using the products of different pharmaceutical companies . Positivity means that it should be possible for every patient to receive either treatment . For example, positivity is not given if patients are included in the study dataset with an absolute contraind ication against the study drug. Overall, MSM is a complex method to plan, conduct , and report but it may give insightful perspectives for study interpretation. Aims Confounding is the connecting theme of all projects in this thesis. It may have far -reaching consequences for clinical decision -making29 30. Our overall aim was t o improve health care decision making by identify ing factors that may strengthen or weaken the confidence in evidence used for health care decision -making, a nd by providing empirical guidance on the utility of MSM s. To achieve this goal, we applied several meta -epidemiological approaches. By using the framework of systematic reviews and meta -analyses , meta-epidemiological research explore s the impact of specif ic study 4 characteristics on treatment effects and the underlying factors of epidemiological and medical research as a special form of research on research (or meta -research )3 31. Objectives The first doctoral project had the objective to assess whether authors of observational epidemiologic studies consider ed confounding bias when interpreting the ir findings. We used a random sample of 120 cohort or case -control studies reporting any exposure -outcome association . The studies were published between 2011 and 2012 by general medical, epidemiological, and specialty journals with the highest impact factors. We evalu ated whether the consideration of confounding depended on specific factors, specifically journal types, study types , exposures, journal impact factor and article annual citation rate . The second doctoral project had the objective to evaluate the agreement between estimated treatment effects of non-randomized studies using causal modelling with marginal structural models and RCTs on the same clinical question. We first included any non-randomized healthcare stud y that provided an effect from causal modelling with MSM . Then we searched and included RCT s on the same clinical question . In a c ompar ison of the two study designs, we evaluated the direction of treatment effects, effect sizes, and confidence intervals for primary effectiveness outcomes , and the overa ll absolute de viation. W e determined if the effects of the experimental treatment were more or less favorable in non -randomized studies and how the results changed when more RCT evidence was published before the respective non -randomized study . Intrigued by the emerging use of MSM in RCTs, the third PhD project was a meta -epidemiological analysis with focus on marginal structural models in RCTs . The first objective was to systematically identify and describe situations where MSM had been used to (re-)analy ze results from randomized comparisons of medical interventions . Considering all reported results for all available analysis methods within each eligible RCT (e.g. MSM, intention -to-treat, per protocol , as treated ), the second objective was to assess the v ibration of all effects32 and the relationship between results of MSM - and intention -to-treat -based analyses.

Status The manuscript was published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 2017 ahead of print33 and finally in January 201834. Abstract Background and Objective Confounding bias is a most pervasive threat to validity of observational epidemiologic research. We assessed whether authors of observational epidemiologic studies con sider confounding bias when interpreting the findings. Study Design and Setting We randomly selected 120 cohort or case -control studies published in 2011 and 2012 by the general medical, epidemiologic, and specialty journals with the highest impact factors . We used Web of Science to assess citation metrics through January 2017. Results Sixty -eight studies (56.7%, 95% confidence interval: 47.8 -65.5%) mentioned \"confounding\" or Discussion sections, another 20 (16.7%; 10.0 -23.3%) alluded to it, and there was no mention or allusion at all in 32 studies (26.7%; 18.8 -34.6%). Authors often acknowledged that for specific confounders, there was no adjustment (34 studies; 28.3%) or deem it possible or likely that confounding affected their main finding s (29 studies; 24.2%). However, only two studies (1.7%; 0 - 4.0%) specifically used the words \"caution\" or \"cautious\" for the interpretation because of confounding -related reasons and eventually only four studies (3.3%; 0.1 -6.5%) had limitations related to confounding or any other bias in their Conclusions. Studies mentioning that the findings were possibly or likely affected by confounding were more frequently cited than studies with a statement that findings were unlikely affected (median 6 .3 vs. 4.0 citati ons per year, P = 0.04). Conclusions Many observational studies lack satisfactory discussion of confounding bias. Even when confounding bias is mentioned, authors are typically confident that it is rather irrelevant to their findings and they rarely call f or cautious interpretation. More careful acknowledgment of possible impact of confounding is not associated with lower citation impact. 7 What is new? Key findings - Many highest impact observational studies lack any discussion of confounding bias. Even when mentioned, authors are typically confident that it is rather irrelevant for their findings and they rarely call for cautious interpretation. What this adds to what was known? - There is no evid ence that acknowledging the po tential impact of confounding dimi nishes citation impact of epidemiological studies. What is the implication and what should change now? - There is a need to encourage researchers and to sensitize reviewers and editors to discuss and communicate study limitations introduced by confounding. 8 Introduction A confounder may create spurious associations between an exposure and an outcome observed in epidemiologic studies [ 1]. For example, many more people drinking coffee have lung cancer than people not drinking coffee, but this is because they mo re often smoke [ 2]. Many confounders are difficult to pinpoint with certainty, many are entirely unknown, and many others are known, but are still not measured and thus cannot be considered in the analysis of epidemiologic studies. Understanding confoundin g and separating it from causal effects can be very difficult. For example, even smoking's causal role in cancer, and its potential to confound other observed associations in cancer studies, was not clear across many years of early epidemiologic research [ 3]. Bias caused by unknown confounders is directly addressable only by randomization, and thus, confounding bias can never be entirely ruled out in nonrandomized studies. Consequently, in the most widely applied framework to assess quality of evidence for healthcare decisions (GRADE), evidence from observational research is initially considered low quality [ 4]. Because bias due to confounding is a core limitation of observational research, numerous recommendations and statements call for a careful considera tion when reporting, discussing, and making conclusions from observational research [ [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. For example, the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement, the most widely endorsed guidelin e for reporting of observational research, prominently emphasizes the discussion of confounding and explicitly states \" It is important not only to identify the sources of bias and confounding that could have affected results, but also to discuss the relati ve importance of different biases, including the likely direction and magnitude of any potential bias \" and \" due consideration should be given to confounding [...]. Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecise mea surement of confounders \" [6]. Despite these recommendations, many investigators might feel that acknowledgment of confounding will cast doubts on their findings. They might prefer to either be silent about this possibility or explicitly discredit the possi bility that confounding may have affected their conclusions. Important questions can be asked: Do authors of epidemiologic studies published in major journals acknowledge confounding properly and sufficiently? Does more explicit acknowledgment of confoundi ng as a limitation decrease the subsequent citation impact of their work? To address these questions, here we conducted a meta -epidemiologic survey of observational studies published in high -impact journals. Our primary aim was to assess whether authors of observational epidemiologic studies consider confounding bias when interpreting the findings in the Discussion sections and concluding statements of their articles. Our secondary aim was to determine whether such explicit discussion is associated with low er citation impact. Methods Data identification and eligibility We selected 24 journals with the highest impact factors (Journal Citation Reports 2010): The top eight from the \"medicine, general, and internal\" category [New England Journal of Medicine, La ncet, JAMA, Annals of Internal Medicine, PLOS Medicine, BMJ, Archives of Internal Medicine (currently JAMA 9 Internal Medicine), CMAJ], the top eight from the \"public, occupational, and environmental health\" category (Environmental Health, Epidemiology, Inte rnational Journal of Epidemiology, American Journal of Epidemiology, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, European Journal of Epidemiology, Genetic Epidemiology), and the journal with highest impact factor in each of eight \"medical specialty\" sub -categories (cardiology and cardiovascular disease, gastroenterology, gynecology, oncology, pediatrics, rheumatology, surgery, urology and nephrology; i.e., Circulation, Gastroenterology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Pediatrics, Annals of Rheumatic Diseases, Annals of Surgery, Journal of the American Society of Nephrology). We did not consider journals focusing exclusively on reviews (e.g., Epidemiologic Reviews) or on basic an d/or preclinical research (e.g., Cancer Cell). We searched MEDLINE for cohort and case -control studies published in these journals in 2011 and 2012 (last search on December 4, 2015; details in Webappendix 1 ). The articles retrieved were stratified by journ al category. Two independent reviewers (H.E. and F.N.) evaluated randomly selected articles for eligibility until they identified 120 eligible articles (20 per journal type and year; which would allow for standard deviation of <4% for estimated proportions of 75% or 25%). The study flow is shown in Webappendix 2. We included any study clearly described as \"cohort study\" or \"case -control study\" (explicitly using these terms) and reporting any exposure - outcome association and thus being theoretically prone to confounding bias. No further eligibility criteria were applied. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or with a third reviewer (L.G.H.). The random sample included studies published in 22 of the 24 eligible journals (exceptions were Bulletin of th e World Health Organization and Genetic Epidemiology), and each journal contributed a median of four studies [interquartile range (IQR) 2 -6]. Data extraction Two independent reviewers (two of L.G.H., H.E., F.N.) extracted the reported study design (i.e., c ase- control, prospective, retrospective, or unclassified cohort study or nested case -control study; we applied these specific terms to categorize the study design as self -reported by the authors) and categorized the area of research for all pertinent artic les. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or with the third reviewer (L.G.H., H.E., or F.N.). In addition to manual extractions, two independent reviewers (L.G.H. and H.E.) searched all full -texts automatically (using PDF viewer software) for term s related to propensity scores or marginal structural models anywhere in the articles and they assessed if propensity score -based methods or marginal structural models were used in the studies. There was perfect agreement (100%) between reviewers. One revi ewer (L.G.H.) extracted from Web of Knowledge bibliographic data, specifically the journal's 2010 impact factor and how often the study was cited (Web of Science Core Collection) through January 2, 2017, to calculate an annual citation rate (total citation s received per years elapsed since publication). Evaluation of confounding statements and bias consideration We systematically evaluated the consideration of confounding bias in the Abstract and Discussion sections of included studies using six standardize d prespecified questions ( Table 1). We focused on the Abstract and Discussion because these are the sections readers typically focus on the most and from 10 which they are most likely to draw bottom line conclusions on what the research means and what caveats might exist. We did not evaluate the Introduction, Methods, or Results sections of the publications. First, we evaluated if the term \"confounding\" in any form is mentioned at all, regardless of whether it is actually used to discuss the findings of the st udy or not. We specifically screened Abstract and Discussion sections of the articles for the term \"confounding\" or variations thereof (Question 1). We also captured any allusions or statements referring to the concept of confounding bias without explicitl y using such terms. We also specifically screened the articles for the term \"bias\" (Question 2) and explicitly perused any mentions of bias for possible relations to confounding. Details with examples are shown in Table 1. Second, we evaluated if the autho rs explicitly mention specific potential confounders that were not adjusted for in the analyses (Question 3), or if the authors explicitly discuss whether confounding bias is likely, possible, or unlikely to affect their main findings (Question 4). Third, we evaluated if confounding bias is considered when interpreting the results or drawing conclusions. Specifically, we evaluated if the authors state that their main results need to be interpreted with caution due to confounding, using the term \"caution,\" \" cautious,\" or variants thereof (Question 5). Finally, we specifically screened whether their concluding statements include any limitation or uncertainty related to confounding or bias at all (Question 6). This was evaluated in the section either headed \"co nclusion,\" \"summary,\" or similar; if such heading did not exist, we evaluated all paragraphs following a concluding statement beginning with, for example, \"in conclusion,\" or \"in summary,\" or evaluated the last paragraph of the Discussion. We developed and pilot tested the operationalization of the questions and iteratively specified the wording of the questions to arrive at detailed extraction instructions. Two reviewers (two of L.G.H., H.E., F.N., A.L.) then assessed all articles independently (unaware of any extractions in the pilot), resolving any disagreements by discussion or with a third reviewer (L.G.H. or H.E.). Data analysis In addition to an overall description of the study sample and the statements on confounding, we analyzed whether the consider ation of confounding (Questions 1 -6) differed between the journal types (general medical vs. epidemiology vs. specialty journal), study types (cohort vs. case -control), exposures (modifiable vs. nonmodifiable), and whether it was associated with journal im pact factor and article annual citation rate. We tested differences between continuous variables with the Mann - Whitney U test, differences between categorical data with the Fisher's exact test. Results for continuous measures are medians with IQRs. All ana lyses were done with Stata 13.1. P values are two tailed. 11 Results Evaluated studies Of the 120 articles, 90 described cohort studies (75%) and 30 case -control studies (25%; Table 2; details in Webappendix 3). Case -control studies were typically published in epidemiologic journals (17 of 30; 56.7%). The 120 studies covered a wide spectrum of medical areas, and there were differences in the areas covered between general medical journals and specialty journals, with pediatrics and oncology being more common in the latter. Most studies (74; 61.7%) analyzed effects of exposures that cannot practically be investigated in experimental studies as they are either not directly modifiable or are harmful (e.g., associations of health outcomes with environmental factor s, biomarkers, or demographic characteristics). Effects of potentially modifiable exposures (e.g., drugs, diets, or surgery) were analyzed in 35 studies (29.2%) and were less common in epidemiologic journals. The median impact factor of the 22 journals was 7.9 (IQR, 5.6 -13.5) in 2010 and the studies received a median of 5.1 (IQR, 2.5 -9.2) annual citations, with clear differences depending on journal type. Of the 120 studies, only six used propensity score methods and one used marginal structural modeling. Mere mentioning of confounding or bias Confounding bias was not mentioned or alluded to at all in Abstracts and Discussions of 32 of the 120 studies (26.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.8 (16.7%; 95% CI: 10.0 - 23.3%), there was some allusion to the concept of confounding indirectly without using this specific term, and 68 of 120 (56.7%; 95% CI: 47.8 -65.5%) mentioned the term \"confounding\" or some same - root variant. The term \"bias\" was used in 72 of the 120 studies (60%; 95% CI: 51.2 15.0 -30.0%) mentioned neither confounding nor bias at all in their Abstracts and Discussions. Any mention that confounding may affect results Among the 68 of 120 studies that used the term \"confounding\" or related terminology, three (2.5%; 95% CI: 0 -5.3%) said that it is likely that confounding affects their main findings, 26 (21.7%; 95% CI: 14.3 95% CI: 4.0 -14.3%) said it is unlikely, and the remaining 28 did not co mment in this regard. Acknowledgment of unmeasured confounders Authors of 34 studies (28.3%; 95% CI: 20.3 -36.4%) acknowledged that for specific confounders, there was no adjustment, and the reason provided in the majority (28 of 34) was that these confound ers had not been measured. Another eight studies mentioned unmeasured confounding in general without specifying the unmeasured confounders. Cautious interpretation and limitations in conclusions An explicit statement in the Discussion section (or Abstract) that the interpretation of study results should be made with caution due to possible confounding was made in only 2 of 120 studies (1.7%; 95% CI: 0 -4.0%). Specifically, in a study of caffeinated beverage and soda consumption and time to pregnancy, Hatch e t al. clearly stated \" We caution that these associations may reflect unmeasured confounding by diet or other lifestyle factors \" [11]. In a study of the association of different biomarkers and risk of type II diabetes, Montonen et al. stated \" Caution is nee ded when interpreting the results of the analyses on proportion of the association explained. First, the proportion estimates [...] may be 12 biased if there is unmeasured confounding between the biomarkers and the outcome [References] \" Only 4 of 120 stud ies (3.3%; 95% CI: 0.1 -6.5%) mentioned any limitations related to bias or confounding in their Conclusions. Of the three studies where the authors' discussion expressed that confounding likely affects their main results, this caution was clearly expressed in the Conclusions in one of the three. Such caution was conveyed in the Conclusion in only 2 of the 26 studies where the authors mentioned possible confounding. Of the 42 studies where unmeasured confounders were discussed (specifically or in general term s), only one (2.4%) explicitly stated that the interpretation of the results should be made with caution and only four (9.5%) expressed in their Conclusions limitations because of confounding or any other bias. Overall assessment The interrater agreement w as very high for all assessed questions, ranging from 86.5% to 99.2%. Figure 1 shows the overlap we observed between the different ways of handling and characterizing the potential presence and impact of confounding bias. Associations with type of journal and impact The findings were overall the same across the types of journals ( Table 3). None of the evaluated aspects of considering confounding bias were associated with journal impact factor or subsequent citation impact, with one exception ( Table 4). Stud ies with a statement that the findings were possibly or likely affected by confounding bias were more frequently cited than those studies with a statement that the findings were unlikely affected (median 6.3 vs. 4.0 citations per year, P = 0.04). We found no differences between cohort and case -control studies or between studies evaluating modifiable vs. nonmodifiable exposures (data not shown). Discussion Our analysis of 120 randomly selected epidemiologic studies showed that while a narrow majority studie s do mention confounding bias to some degree, very few acknowledge that it is a reason for major caution in interpreting the key findings. More than a quarter of the articles completely ignored \"confounding\" in the Abstract or Discussion sections, and most of them do not even mention the term \"bias\" in general. Despite the frequent presence and even awareness of specific unmeasured confounders and the often reported possible impact on the main findings, conclusions are almost never made with explicit cautio n. We found only two cases with explicit statements that cautious interpretation is required because of confounding. Interestingly, in one of them, this caution owing to unmeasured confounding is immediately diluted in the text by stating \" In the present s tudy, we included a large variety of known risk factors as well as of biomarkers, thereby minimizing unmeasured confounding \" [19]. This illustrates the overall impression we gained during our evaluation, that many discussions of confounding in these top jo urnals are superficial and appear to be attempts to negate the importance and impact of confounding in the published work. We found no indications that this phenomenon is limited to certain areas of research, as findings were similar across types of journa ls, their impact factors, and study types and topics. Of note, many of the 13 studies we evaluated were from journals that published the STROBE reporting guidelines in 2007 (i.e., Lancet, Epidemiology, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, BMJ, PLOS Medi cine, Annals of Internal Medicine). The observed association of higher study citation numbers with statements acknowledging that confounding bias could exist might be just a chance finding, or be due to confounding. Nevertheless, it suggests that statement s acknowledging potential methodological weaknesses have no negative citation impact. Investigators should not worry that their observational study will be discredited if they acknowledge (as they should) that their work is subject to confounding that migh t affect their results. Acknowledgment and thorough discussion of the impact of confounding bias may be a marker of researchers with more epidemiologic training being involved in the study, who may have better institutional access to better, larger dataset s, and work in larger research teams, all of which may also help explain higher citation rates for articles that explicitly discuss confounding. We did not adjust for any of these potentially explanatory variables in our descriptive analyses as we do not a im to make any causal inferences. If anything, we observed more citations for articles that acknowledged confounding than for those that did not. The acknowledgment of unmeasured confounding (in accordance to the STROBE reporting guideline) has been system atically assessed in previous empirical work for observational research published in five general medicine journals and five epidemiologic journals (most of them included also in our analysis) for the years 2004 -2007 and 2010 -2012 [ [22], [23]]. Comments on the likelihood of unmeasured confounding were present in 59 -85% of the studies, but only 16 -32% gave any qualitative statement about the impact on the findings, which agrees well with our overall study results. However, both of these previous empirical st udies narrowly evaluated observational research specifically focusing on medical interventions, while we examined the broader landscape of observational investigation within the medical literature, only the minority of which pertained to interventions. Som e limitations of our work deserve closer attention. First, we analyzed only a small sample of the observational study literature. Perhaps, a larger sample may have allowed us to detect small differences between journal types or other factors affecting the consideration of confounding. However, large differences are unlikely to have been missed. Second, we evaluated studies that were published 4 and 5 years ago, which was necessary for a meaningful analysis of subsequent citation impact. Previous evaluations have found that the introduction of STROBE in 2007, arguably the most influential effort to improve reporting quality, has had only modest impact on reporting quality [ [22], [23]]. No new major similar efforts have been launched in the last 5 years; there fore, we have no reason to believe that reporting of observational research would have changed substantially in the last few years. Third, by only looking at 24 high -impact journals, it is uncertain if our findings are generalizable to the rest of the medi cal literature. It is quite possible that we may even underestimate the extent to which implications of confounding bias go unaddressed in the medical literature. We also acknowledge that confounding bias might be seen by some researchers as an inevitable limitation of observational studies that is too well -known to merit discussion. However, as causal interpretations depend on the validity of the implicit assumption of no unmeasured/residual confounding, the implications of bias due to failure of this assu mption should be considered. Dealing with confounding bias, understanding its impact (e.g., through qualitative discussion of the magnitude 14 and direction of bias and more quantitative sensitivity analyses [ [24], [25]]), minimizing its influence, and acknow ledging the residual uncertainty is an integral core for inference -making in epidemiology. In some situations, authors might not be much interested in causality and expressions about cautious interpretation, for example, when they explore associations for developing diagnostic rules. However, only very few studies in our sample addressed such topics. Underreporting of limitations may exaggerate conclusions and could sometimes be perceived as sensationalism, overall diminishing trust in research. We found no evidence that considering the possibility of confounding bias diminishes citation impact. This agrees also with recent evaluations of press releases of observational studies showing that cautious interpretations and wide media coverage are well compatible [[26], [27]]. This is reassuring for researchers and may encourage them to discuss and communicate any limitation introduced by confounders in a thorough and determined way and \"not take them as mythical or uncontrollable phantoms that destroy studies \" [28]. Overall, we believe that there is a need to encourage researchers to report more careful and determined considerations of confounding bias and to encourage peer -reviewers, journal editors, and research funders to appreciate this. Many of the journals w e analyzed have published the STROBE guideline, and some explicitly refer to them in their Instructions for Authors. Recently, PLOS Medicine intensified the requirements for authors of observational studies, asking that they \" must complete the appropriate reporting checklist not only with page references, but also with sufficient text excerpted from the manuscript to explain how they accomplished all applicable items \" [29]. Our results demonstrate that such activities are well justified. Given that not much has improved over many years, facing the tsunami of big datasets with all their promises, limitations, and risks of spurious findings [30], we believe that more concerted action is needed to improve the appropriate discussion of epidemiologic findings. Conclusion Confounding bias is a pervasive threat to the validity of observational epidemiologic research. Inadequate consideration and lack of discussion of implications of confounding bias are very frequent among the highest impact observational studies. Despite reasonable cause for careful discussion and cautious interpretation, authors often convey confidence, without cause or supporting evidence, that confounding bias is largely irrelevant for their findings. We think that such confidence is not justifi ed. 15 Conflict of interests All authors have completed the Unif ied Competing Interest form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare no financial support for this project.

Do the authors mention confounding using explicitly the terms \"confounder(s),\" \"confounding,\" \"confound,\" or do they allude to it without using those terms, or is confounding not considered at all? Examples for \"yes\": \"We caution that these as sociations may reflect unmeasured confounding by diet or other lifestyle factors\" [11]. Example for \"alluded\": \"Another potential limitation is our inability to control for age at menopause among women having a hysterectomy before natural menopause; for these women, age at menopause is unknown\" [12]. \"When we included the characteristics we could define in multivariable models the association of arm injection site with a significantly higher risk of medically attended local reactions persisted, but it is possible that bias may have influenced the findings\" [13]. 2. Do the authors mention bias using explicitly the term \"bias\"? Example for \"yes\": \"Where available, we relied on HIV diagnosis based on clinical features, which may be subject to biases in assessing the factors contributing to diarrheal disease among participants since HIV infection at early stages may have been missed and not all data were routinely captured\" [14]. 3. Do the authors mention specific confounders that have not been adjusted for? (If yes, what were the reasons? If not, were there unspecified unmeasured confounders without specifically stating which ones?) Example for \"yes\": \"We were unable to adjust for additional confounding variables with a known association with mortali ty (for example, blood glucose and postarrest pH) that were not collected as part of the PICANet data set\" [15]. 4. Do the authors state that their main findings are likely, possibly, or unlikely affected by residual confounding? Example for \"yes, likel y\": 19 Example for \"yes, possibly\": \"However, although we adjusted for severity of the initial diagnosis of depression, we could use only a crude measure as we did not have a validated depression severity score. We cannot therefore exclude the possible effect of residual confounding on our results\" [17]. Example for \"yes, unlikely\": \"Minimal differences were observed between the crude and adjusted odds ratios for the exposure variable, suggesting that SEIFA and ethnicity were unlikely to be major confounders in this analysis\" [18]. 5. Do the authors state that their main findings need to be interpreted with caution due to confounding? We answered this question with \" yes\" in cases with a clear statement that cautious interpretation is required because of confounding. Example for \"yes\": \"Caution is needed when interpreting the results of the analyses on proportion of the association explained. First, the proportion es timates, decomposed from the total effect by adjusting for other biomarkers, may be biased if there is unmeasured confounding between the biomarkers and the outcome [Reference]. In the present study, we included a large variety of known risk factors as wel l as of biomarkers, thereby minimizing unmeasured confounding\" [19]. 6. Do the authors call for caution or indicate limitations or uncertainty due to possible confounding or other bias in their conclusions? Example for \"yes\": \"We caution that these ass ociations may reflect unmeasured confounding by diet or other lifestyle factors\" [11]. \"Given the small sample size, however, the potentially confounding effects of maternal IQ cannot be excluded and should be evaluated in a larger study\" [20]. \"In summa ry, notwithstanding the possibility of residual selection bias, patients who [...]\" [21]. 20 Table 2: Characteristics of studies 21 Table 3: Statements on confounding 22 Table 4: Citation impact 23 Figures Figure 1: Venn diagram on different aspects o f consideration of confounding bias in discussions of epidemiologic research.

We plan to submit it to another high -impact journal in April 2 018. Abstract Objectives To evaluate the agreement of estimated treatment effects between non-randomized studies using causal modelling (with marginal structural models) and randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on the same clinical question. Design Meta -epidemiological study. Data sources PubMed , Scopus and citations of key references searched up to April 2017 . Methods Any non-randomized study using marginal structural models for causal modelling provid ing an effect estimate on any healthcare outcome of any treatment was eligible. We systematically sought RCTs on the same clinical question and compared the direction of treatment effects, effect sizes , and confidence intervals for primary effectiveness outcomes between study designs. We evaluated the overall absolute deviation between study designs and we assessed if non-randomized studies found more or less favorable effects for the experimental treatment. We used the ratio of odds ratios (ROR; the summary odds ratio of trials divided by the reported estimate from non -randomized studies) for each clinical question and then combined the RORs using random -effects meta -analysis. Meta - regression was used to assess whether the agreement between study designs is associated with previous knowledge of RCT -effects. Results The main analysis included 19 non -randomized studies with 1039570 patients and 141 RCTs with 120669 patients . Non -randomized studies indicated treatment effect estimates in the opposite direction from RCTs for 8 clinical questions ( 42%), and their 95 % confidence interval did not include the RCT estimate in 9 clinical questions (47%). The effect estimates deviated systematically by 1.29 - fold (summary absolute deviation OR 1.29; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.48). Overall, causal modelling studies te nded to show more favorable results for the experimental treatment (summary 26 ROR 1.14; 95% co nfidence interval 0.93 to 1.41), in particular when they clearly focused on healthcare decision making and clinical interpretation not on statistical methodology (1 6 studies, summary ROR 1.34; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.75) , and when more RCT evidence was previously available (p=0.037). Conclusions Non -randomized studies using causal modelling with marginal structural models may give different answers than RCT s evaluating the same clinical question. Caution continues to be required when non- randomized \"real world \" evidence is used to guide health care decisions. 27 What is known on this topic: - Many health care stakeholders call for use of non-randomized \"real wo rld\" evidence for decision -making - Non-randomized studies are prone to bias due to confounding - Causal modelling with marginal structural models may theoretically overcome such biases under the critical assumption that all confounders are known, correctly measured, and precisely included in the models What does it add: - Non -randomized \"real world\" studies using causal modelling may give different answers than randomized controlled trials with effects that typically deviate and sometimes show stronger benefi ts of experimental treatments - Caution remains crucial when non -randomized evidence is used to guide health care decisions - even when causal modelling techniques were applied and especially when no evidence from randomized controlled trials exists 28 Intro duction Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are able to determine the causal effects of choosing between two or more treatment options for an intervention.1 2 However, RCTs are not available for many important healthcare questions . Since healthcare decisio n makers then have to rely on non -randomized observational studies as the only evidence , attempts are made to increase the reliability of these studies.2 3 To assess the causal effect of a treatment choice, i t would be inadequate to simply compare outcomes between patients selecting different treatments. The reason is that in the \"real world\", the choice is not random. It often depends on specific factors, such as comorbidities or personal values and preferences of patients and care providers, that are also associated with future health outcomes (confounding by indication). Many health care stakeholders call for use of non-randomized \"real world \" evidence and its evaluation in the context of health care decision -making - even for drug approval as in recent U S legislation .4-7 Although only randomization can directly eliminate confounding, several methods are used in observational studies in the attempt to address this issue, for example multivariate regression analysis or methods using propensity score .8 9 We have recently shown that studies based on routinely collected health data analyzed with propensity score method s may substantially overestimate treatment benefits and may provide very different answers than RCTs on the same clinical question .10 However, t hese methods balance confounders at baseline without address ing confounders arising during follow -up when patients switch or stop treatments because of unsatisfactory results .11 Novel approaches have been proposed aiming to eliminate this time -dependent co nfounding and to measure causal effects of treatments in such situations.12 The most frequently used method involves marginal structu ral models (MSM) . MSMs are a relatively new class of statistical models that are increasingly applied for causal inference in non - randomized studies over the last two decades.11 13 14 The underlying essential inherent limitation of all non-randomized study designs remains the same,15 that is the assumption that all relevant confounders are known, measured, and correctly integr ated in the analyses. There is no meta -epidemiologic analysis evaluating if non-randomized \"real world\" evidence using causal modelling with MSM 16 can reliably estimate effects as found in RCTs, which would be a prerequisite for reliably using this evide nce for healthcare decision -making. We aimed to evaluate the agreement of treatment effects estimated by non-randomized studies using MSM for causal modelling with effects of RCTs investigating the same clinical question in a comprehensive meta -epidemiolog ical study. Methods We analyzed non-randomized studies that evaluated any healthcare intervention with causal modelling using MSM (MSM -studies) . We systematically compared the findings from such studies for various clinical questions with the findings fro m RCTs on the same clinical question. Identification of non-randomized studies using marginal structural models We included any observational , non-randomized study that (1) provided at least one effect estimate of any binary health outcome clearly based on the use of MSM, ( 2) mentioned the intervention, the evaluated population, and any result (not necessarily MSM -based) in the abstract , (3) investigated a clearly defined treatment and comparator . We applied no language restrictions. 29 We screened the biblio graphy and citations of 12 key references11 13 16 -25 on MSM using Web of Science (last search 23 June 2014) to identify relevant MSM -studies. We then used the search results for the development of a PubMed search strategy (including terms related to \"margi nal structural models\"; last search 15 October 2014; Webappendix ) to identify further pertinent articles. Two reviewers (HE, LGH) independently screened all titles, abstracts and full -texts, and solved any disagreement through discussion. One reviewer (HE) then identified the clinical questions (following the PICO scheme26, i.e. the composite of population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) addressed in each eligible MSM - study and a second reviewer (LGH) verified this. Identification of corresponding r andomized trial evidence First, we searched for systematic reviews that reported treatment effects of RCTs that assessed the same clinical question as the MSM -study. One reviewer (HE) developed search strategies for all clinical questions using a standardi zed search building approach and applying standard filters for systematic reviews and meta -analyses.27 Potentially relevant RCTs cited in the MSM -study were used as benchmark to maximize the sensitivity of the search , i.e. we adapted the search until we retriev ed all these potentially relevant studies. All search strategies were checked by a second reviewer (LGH). One reviewer (HE) then searched PubMed (last search 21 April 2016), screened all titles, abstracts, and full - texts. She recorded any article that she deemed possibly eligible; a nother reviewer (LGH) verified eligibility of all included or possibly relevant studies (LGH) . Another reviewer evaluated a random 10% sample of all clinical questions that were not deemed included or possibly relevant (LGH or AL). The interrater agreement was perfect (100%). Second, we hand -searched the reference lists of eligible MSM -study publications for any mentioned or cited RCTs on the same clinical question. Third, we screened all studies citing eligible MSM -study pu blications for eligible RCTs using SCOPUS (last search 28 March 2017). Fourth, whenever we found eligible RCTs that were not covered by a systematic review discovered in the first step (this was the case for 3 clinical questions), we updated our search for systematic reviews and also did a complete search on PubMed for RCTs on that clinical question using the PubMed standard filter for RCTs (last search 12 April 2017). One reviewer (HE) screened all reference lists, titles and abstracts. All potentially re levant full -texts were independently screened by two reviewers (HE, LGH) who solved any disagreement through discussion. Data Extraction From each MSM -study, we extracted each clinical question with corresponding MSM -based treatment effect. We extracted RCT-based treatment effects from available systematic reviews of RCTs (we used individual trial results if available for all but three clinical questions28-30 where we extracted the summary effect estimate s with confidence intervals from meta -analyses in th e systematic review) . We used RCT publication s when there was no systematic review. I nformation on the conduct of intention - to-treat analyses, the number of patients missing (i.e. lost-to-follow -up, withdrawn, discontinued or dropped out), and the number o f patients who switched their allocated treatment were extracted from 30 RCT publications . For i nformation on risk of bias of the RCTs , we extracted the assessments from available systematic reviews , otherwise we used the original RCT data applying Cochrane s tandards .27 We asked systematic review authors for bibliographic information if it was not clear to us which RCTs were included in their meta -analys es. One reviewer extracted and assessed all data (HE) and another verified them (KM). Statistical analysis For the consistent reflection of treatment effects across all clinical questions from the MSM -studies and RCTs , we inverted the effect estimates and confidence intervals where necessary so that the results represent effects of experimental treatments versu s control treatments for an unfavorable outcome. The first treatment comparator always reflects the experimental group (i.e. newer, less established, treatment of interest) and the second comparator the control group (i.e. standard of care, placebo, older treatment). Where this classification was not clear, we consulted experts in the field. Whenever the outcome was favorable, we inverted the reported study effect to reflect the complementary unfavorable outcome (e.g. death instead of survival). For the RCT s, we used the same outcome and direction of comparison as we had used in the MSM -studies. When an MSM -study evaluated several outcomes for the same treatment comparison in the same population, we selected the (all -cause) mortality outcome for the main ana lysis because mortality is of high relevance for decision makers, rather unambiguously measured, and probably less prone to data accuracy problems in routinely collected data sources (mortality was the primary endpoint in 2 of 3 MSM -studies that were conce rned31 32). When there were multiple effect estimates reported for the same outcome (i.e. different results for one clinical question, derived from various MSMs), we used the effect estimate mentioned first. We assumed that reported relative risks or hazar d ratios in MSM -studies are close approximations of ORs (which is reasonable when the event rate is low ,33 as was in our sample with a median event rate of the intervention and control groups of 5.5%, IQR 1 % to 12%). Treatment effects of multiple RCTs on t he same clinical question were combined to obtain one summary OR per clinical question with random effects model meta -analyses using the DerSimonian and Laird method. First, w e examined how often MSM -studies and RCTs differed in the direction of the point estimates; how often the MSM -study and the respective RCTs had the same direction in the presence of statistical significance (their 95% confidence intervals excluded the null effect); how often the RCTs' summary estimate was not included in the 95% confid ence interval of the respective MSM -study; and how often the treatment effects from MSM -studies and RCTs differed beyond chance. Second, w e quantified the absolute deviation between OR estimates from MSM -studies and estimates from corresponding RCTs for e ach clinical question (calculated as absolute difference between the RCT-based and MSM -based log(OR)s and back transformed on the OR -scale). This provides an estimate of deviation between study designs independent from assumptions about effect directions, experimental and control treatments. The absolute deviation estimate and the confidence interval limits are positive by definition and reported as x -fold deviation on the OR scale. For example, the absolute deviation would be 1.25 -fold when one study desig n finds an OR = 1 and the other design finds an OR = 0.8 or an OR = 1.25. 31 Third, we assessed the directions of deviations to explore if effects found in MSM -studies for experimental treatments would be more or less favorable than in RCTs. For this, we used the ratio of odds ratio ( ROR ) approach , i.e. the division of the summary OR of RCTs by the MSM -based treatment effect (after log -transformation) .34 A ROR for experimental treatment effects above 1 indicates that the MSM -study measured a more favorable res ult of the experimental treatment benefit than the RCTs , a ROR below 1 indicates less favorable treatment benefits found in MSM -studies. The absolute deviation ORs and the RORs for experimental treatment effects of all clinical questions were each synthesi zed with random effects models (DerSimonian and Laird) to obtain overarching summar ies of the relationship of effects in non -randomized studies using causal modelling versus corresponding randomized trial evidence. Fourth, we explore d if there were indica tions to assume that results of MSM -studies would be different when they are done without pre-existing randomized evidence on treatment effects35. Because almost all clinical question s in our analysis had pre -existing randomized evidence when the causal mo del results were published, w e could not apply the cleanest approach by including only MSM -studies without pre-existing trials .35 Instead we conducted a meta -regression in which we estimated the association between the ROR per clinical question and the amo unt of randomized evidence available at the time of the publication of the MSM -study. The amount of evidence was expressed by the inverse of the variance (i.e. by the weight in the random -effects meta -analysis of all the RCTs with publication dates before the MSM -study) . We also conducted sensitivity analyses excluding all RCTs with a publication date before the MSM -study or excluding all RCTs published after the MSM -study . We conducted further sensitivity analyses (whenever data were available on at least 5 clinical questions) excluding 3 MSM -studies focusing on statistical methodology of causal modelling without having any clinical interpretations for healthcare decision making in their conclusions16 36 37; including only all -cause mortality effects; incl uding only non -mortality effects (here, in case of several pertinent estimates, we selected the most precise one, i.e. the one with smallest confidence interval ); excluding clinical questions with active treatment controls; excluding clinical questions wit hout active treatment controls; excluding RCTs with either high risk of bias in any of the bias domains, and/or missing data of more than 10%, and/or where more than 10% of the patients switched their allocated treatment; and using a fixed -effect model to combine data from RCTs. We used Stata 14.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) for all analyses. We used the 'metan' - command for meta -analyses, the \"metareg\" -command for meta -regression, and the 'heterogi' - command for the confidence intervals of I2 38. P-values are two tailed. Patient involvement No patients were involved in this research. Results Studies evaluated The literature search for MSM -studies resulted in 3916 references; we screened titles and abstracts and obtained 646 articles in full -text. We found 98 eligible articles on causal modelling studies using 32 MSM . In search for corresponding RCT -evidence, we screened 9 926 references . Overall, we found 168 RCTs corresponding to 25 clinical questions addressed in 19 of the 98 MSM -studies (Figure 1, Table 1). Three of the 19 MSM -studies31 32 39 evaluated more than one clinical question, i.e. they assessed several outcomes (all including all -cause mortality which we used for the main analysis) in the same population and treatment comparison ( Table 1). Of the 19 MSM -studies included in the main analysis , 14 (76 %) had all -cause mortality as outcome. Most MSM -studies were related to HIV (6 /19, 32 %) or nephrology (8/19, 42%) and explored drug treatment comparisons (15/19, 79%). This was similar to the topics in were mostly from registries (8/19, 42%) and electronic medical records (6/19, 32%) routinely collected in various countries. MSM -studies wer e published between 2001 and 2014 and RCTs between 1968 and 2017. In total, 133 of 168 RCTs were clearly published before the date of publication of the MSM -study (79%). For 11 (58%) of the 19 MSM -studies, all corresponding RCTs were published before the M SM-study . Agreement of treatment effects Overall 1039570 patients (median of 9939 patients per clinical question , IQR 990 to 51037) were evaluated from causal modelling studies and 141 corresponding RCTs were identified with overall 120669 patients (media n of 229 patients per RCT, IQR 68 to 946) for the 19 clinical questions included in the main analysis. The direction of effect estimates was in opposite directions in 8 of 19 clinical questions (42%). In 9 of 19 (47%) clinical questions, the 95% confidenc e interval of the MSM -studies did not include the RCT treatment effect estimate ( Table 2). In 9 clinical questions ( 47%), the two designs differed on whether or not they showed statistically significant differences between the compared treatments (signific ant differences found only by MSM -studies in 8 cases, and only by RCTs in 1 case), and in 4 of these 9 clinical questions, the point estimates of the two designs were in opposite directions . The 95% confidence intervals for one or both designs were typical ly large, thus the estimates differed beyond chance in only 1 of the 19 clinical questions (i.e. the 95% confidence interval of the ROR excluded 1). The absolute deviation of effect sizes between study design s across all 19 clinical questions was 1.29 - fold (summary OR 1.29 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.48). When we summarized the RORs , we found a non -significant trend for more favorable results for the experimental treatments estimated by non-randomized studies with causal modelling than by RCTs ( 1.41; Table 2; Figure 2). The non-randomized studies tended to have more favorable results for the experimental treatment when there was more evidence from RCTs previously available (meta -regression p = 0.037). In all sensitivity analyses ( Table 2), the absolute deviations of effect sizes between study designs were quite similar, ranging from 1.18 -fold to 1.72 -fold. Causal modelling studies with a clear focus on guiding healthcare decisions and making clinical in terpretations systematically overestimated benefits of experimental treatments ( summary ROR 1.34; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.75). Causal modelling studies underestimated treatment benefits when only trials that were published after the MSM -study were included (summary ROR 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.11) . 33 Discussion Principal findings This comprehensive meta -epidemiological analysis found that results of non -randomized \"real world \" studies using causal modelling with MSM frequently do not agree with RCTs evaluat ing the same clinical question. Although our results need to be interpreted with caution due to the limited sample size, the principal finding was that MSM -stud y result s deviate from RCTs 1.29 -fold and show greater benefits of experi mental treatment s than RCTs . The direction of treatment effects estimated with causal models is often opposite to that estimated in RCTs (4 3%), and their 95% confidence intervals provide little guidance to tell what RCTs on the same topic would show. When causal model ing studies focus on healthcare decision making, they systematically and significantly exaggerate d clinical benefits . Comparison with other studies To our knowledge, this is the first systematic empirical study on how treatment effect estimate s derived from non -randomized studies using causal modelling analyses agree with RCTs.40 Previous evaluations of the credibility of results from \"real world\" non -randomized evidence analyzed with causal modeling were based on comparisons with trials in ver y specific and selected situations .11 18 41 This study evaluated all MSM -studies identified with a large, reproducible, highly sensitive search strategy. Overall, our findings are very similar to recent analyses of \"real world \" evidence based on propensity scores .35 Assumptions that reported results from observational data analyses are substantially influenced by knowledge of expected treatment effects from RCTs receive further support.35 Limitations This study has some limitations that merit closer attent ion. First, although we found 98 MSM -studies , our final sample covered only 19 of them. For the other studies and their clinical questions , we did not find any relevant randomized trial. We sought for close agreement of the research questions in both study designs to minimize bias. There may have been more clinical questions that our search did not capture as it was widely based on published systematic reviews . However, conducting more than 300 de-novo , high -quality systematic reviews for all clinical quest ions with sensitive search strategies to identify, assess, and extract any individual trials would not have been feasible. However, our citation - based searches rarely detected randomized evidence and also t he large number of empty reviews (i.e. reviews tha t searched for pertinent trials on a clinical question but did not find any) indicates that for numerous clinical questions there is indeed no trial. Overall, t he clinical fields covered by our sample, with many questions in the field of HIV, nephrology, a nd on drug effects, are very similar to the overall use of MSM in observational research. Second , several MSM -study authors have known the results from pre-existing RCTs on the explored topic, and some explicitly used them to improve their modelling, illustrate methodological aspects or to compare treatment effects between the study designs. Most of the MSM -studies were published after the corresponding RCTs and MSM -study authors cited a corresponding RCT or systematic review for almost half of the clinical questions (45%) . This may have created publication or reporting bias as it may affect the decision to report or publish results that are in strong disagreement with pre-existing trial evidence. A clean approach avoiding such influences and resembling the natural situation of decision -making in the absence of clinical trial evidence and comparison with subsequently generated knowledge35 was not possible. These mechanisms may have resulted in a better agreement between 34 MSM -studies with RCTs in situations wit h existing trial evidence . This is supported by the results from the meta -regression showing an association of prior RCT knowledge with observational estimates and also by the sensitivity analysis excluding the three MSM -studies focusing on statistical met hodology . Third , from the trials , we preferred intention -to-treat analyses as they theoretically allow causal estimation of effects and are most robust against biases. This approach may lead to smaller treatment effect estimates in the trials especially wi th high rates of treatment switching and missing data and no active control.42 43 However, excluding clinical questions with no active controls resulted in even larger absolute differences between the study designs. Excluding trials with high rates of treatment switching or missing data and high risk of bias also showed larger absolute deviation of effects. However, the reporting quality was often insufficient and for many trials the switching rates, attrition and risk of bias were unclear. C onceptual diver gences between starting and adhering to the treatment instead of the intention to treat43 44 were difficult to assess as the reporting was often also unclear in the MSM - studies, which is a known problem.41 Although such theoretical issues may explain some of the observed d ifferences between both designs, more and better reported information would be needed for further evaluation . Clinical conclusions of the MSM -studies never highlighted this issue. A ny interpretation in this regard should be made with cauti on. Fourth , we decided not to assess the quality or risk of bias of the MSM -studies as this is not straightforward in observational studies, particular ly in those using MSM . The recently published ROBINS -I tool (\"Risk Of Bias In Non -randomised Studies of Interventions\") is the only suitable instrument we are aware of but it only asks general questions on time -varying confounding.44 The critical assumption for unbiased causal inference in observational research is that all relevant confounders are known, co rrectly measured, and precisely integrated in the analyses. The absence of unmeasured confounding has been explicitly stated by many of the study authors but typically without clear justifications or calls for caution . It would be entirely subjective to judge whether confounders or other known or unknown factors were truly irrelevant, which would be a prerequisite of a low risk of bias. It is generally unlikely that confounding would be completely eliminated, for example, when patient preferences and values determine treatment choice or adherence and outcomes. Overall, it is important to note that our evaluation neither intended to nor can compare the theoretical advantages of causal modelling versus well conducted randomized trials. Instead, we aimed to com pare results of published evidence on treatment effects derived from studies reporting the use of such approaches as health care decision makers such as clinicians would use them as guidance. The main focus of three of the MSM -studies was not the support o f healthcare decision making but statistical methods . They were done under more extraordinary circumstances with selected topics and data sources, much larger and clearer existing randomized evidence, and overall more exemplary characteristics than studies conducted by researchers who focus more on guiding every day healthcare decisions. When we only included \"real world \" evidence clearly focusing on guiding healthcare decisions , the difference between study designs was larger with a clear overestimation of clinical benefits beyond chance in the MSM -studies compared to RCTs . Conclusion The use of non -randomized \"real world \" evidence in the context of health care decision -making needs to be seen with caution. Causal modelling may have theoretical advantages and offer valuable insights but only when certain assumptions hold true. The critical assumption s that all factors which may bias 35 the results are known, correctly measured, and precisely included in the models may be unrealistic. Available randomized evide nce on treatment effects may influence reported results of non - randomized studies which adds further uncertainty to situations in which decisions must be made without any trial evidence . When randomized trials are unavailable and clearly unfeasible, decisi on makers may rely on such analyses , but they should be very aware that benefits may often be smaller and more uncertain than non -randomized \"real world \" evidence suggests - despite causal modelling with marginal structural models . To better protect patien ts from hazardous consequences of misguided decisions from non-randomized analyses, efforts should be undertaken to generate, whenever possible, randomized \"real world evidence\", such as simple, large, pragmatic trials that address critically important cli nical questions and guide health care more reliably. 36 Acknowledgements The authors thank K\u00fcbra \u00d6zoglu, University of Basel, for her administrative assistance and support with literature management, Michael Koller, MD, University of Basel, for assistance in the interpretion of study data from nephrology , and authors of original systematic reviews for their responses to information requests.

Submission to Trials is planned for March 2018 . Abstract Objective Marginal structural models (MSM s) are increasingly used to estimate causal effect s of treatments, typically in non -randomized studies. They are one method to deal with time -dependent confounding arising fro m non -adherence. We determined how MSM s are used in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and compare d their results against those obtained with intention -to-treat (ITT) or other analyses. Study Design and Setting We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, cit ations of key references, and Clinicaltrials.gov till May 2017. We included RCTs reporting effects of any health care intervention s based on MSMs and on at least one other (ITT, as treated, per protocol) analysis . Results We included 12 RCTs published bet ween 2002 and 201 6 including a median of 1972 patients (interquartile range ( IQR) 870 to 17006 ) reporting 138 analyses for 24 treatment comparisons (median 6 analyses, IQR 3 to 7 per comparison). On average, the largest reported effect estimate from any analysis was 1.19 -fold (median on a relative risk scale ; IQR 1. 13 to 1.34) larger than the smallest reported effect estimate for the same comparison. All MSM and ITT -based results were in the same direction and had overlapping 95% confidence intervals, and i n 71% (12 of 17 with CI) they also agreed on the presence or not of nominal statistical significance . For 13 of 20 comparisons (65%) , MSM -based relative risks were more extreme (deviated more from the null) than ITT (p=0.18) (median, 1.11-fold (IQR 0.99 to 1.22 )). The MSM - and ITT -based estimated relative risks differed on median 1.12 -fold (IQR 1.02 to 1.22 ). Conclusion MSMs typically provided similar results as ITT and other available analyses. Some of the differences in effect estimates or nominal signif icance may nevertheless become important in clinical decision making, but also require utmost attention of possible selective reporting bias. 51 Introduction Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are usually the best way to measure causal effects of treatments. RCTs allow to measure the causal effect of being assigned to a treatment using the intention -to-treat (ITT) approach [1], and they may allow to estimate the effect of initiating and continuously being adherent to the treatment using the \"per protocol \" (PP) or \"as treated\" (AT) approach [2]. Trials may be designed to answer clinical questions about the practical consequences of deci ding to initiate a treatment, such as prescribing an antibiotic, beginning a life -style intervention or a treatment which requ ires good adherence. Ideally, the decision to initiate a treatment (the \"intention to treat\") is followed by an actual start of the treatment with close adherence to the protocol. Randomization allows to measure effects of such decisions without confoundin g baseline variables . Such trials focusing on health care decision making are often pragmatic or practical [3]. Explanatory or mechanistic trials aim to better understand the underlying causal pathways of the decisions, such as biological mechanisms of tre atment effects, or effects specifically in highly -motivated patients with high probability to be compliant to study protocols [3]. For such research questions, PP effects (evaluating only patients who adhere to the study protocol) or AT effects (evaluating patients according to the treatment they received, not the treatment they were assigned to) may be of specific interest. The conceptual difference of the ITT and PP effects (or estimands) has gained mo re attention for clinical trial design recently , for e xample through the ICH E9 (R1) addendum on estimands [4]. With perfect adherence to the treatment strategy and study protocol, ITT, PP, and AT results would be identical. Compared to PP and AT effects , ITT effects are theoretically unbiased estimates of th e randomly assigned treatment regardless of the adherence [2], but they may increasingly deviate from PP and AT effects with increasing non -adherence. The reasons for adherence are frequently not random but associated with prognostic factors (e.g. sicker p atients may have more difficulties to follow the intended treatment schedule, or they may be more motivated to adhere to the treatment). When there are confounding factors which are associated with both adherence and the outcome of interest, unadjusted PP or AT analyses would be biased. Such confounding factors may be prognostic factors available at baseline, such as age, disease stage, or preferences and values of patients. Standard statistical approaches adjusting for such variables at baseline may, at le ast theoretically, address some of this confounding. However, t here are often a lso time -varying confounder s, which also include the randomly assigned treatments that the study aims to explore [2]. This can , for example , be unsatisfying weight loss leading to non -adherence to a demanding workout intervention. In such cases, standard approaches for confounder control could be inappropriate [5]. Marginal structural model (MSM) analyses are used to adjust for confounding in observational research [5, 6] and th ey can address time -varying confounding. If the relevant confounders are known, measured and adequately implemented in the modelling [5], MSM should theoretically allow to provide valid estimates of the PP and AT effect. Beyond conceptual considerations a nd frameworks, there is to our knowledge no comprehensive empirical evaluation of using MSM analyses in clinical trial research. We conducted a meta - epidemiological analysis aiming to systematically identify situations where MSM analyses have been used in RCTs , understand why these analytical approaches were chosen, how answers to clinical questions agree between these different clinical trial analysis approaches and how this may impact health care decision making [7]. We specifically focused on the relatio nship of MSM -based effects and results from ITT analyses. 52 Methods Search We conducted four separate searches. First, w e searched PubMed using textwords and the medical subject heading for MSM applying the Cochrane sensitivity - and precision -maximizing RCT filter [8] (Webappendix 1 ). Second, w e used the citation search function in Web of Science to screen the titles and abstracts of all articles cited by potentially relevant studies identified through the PubMed search . Third, w e screened all references and citations of 12 key references (selected by expert opinion of the authors group) in the field of MSM s [9-20]. Fourth, w e also used and updated the search strategy from a related ongoing project in which we compared the effects from non -randomized studies u sing MSM s with those from systematically identified RCTs not using MSM s. All full-text publications were assessed by two independent reviewers (HE, and one of AL, BS) and disagreements were resolved by discussion or with a third reviewer (LGH). Selection o f studies We included any RCT (including re -analyses of RCTs) that reported the effects of any health care intervention analyzed using MSM and at least one effect from an ITT, as treated or per protocol analysis . When we were unsure whether a reporte d eff ect was analysed using MSM analysis, ITT, or another approach, we asked authors by email for clarification. We contacted authors of 54 trials, in which the use of MSM analysis was not clearly stated but alluded to, to clarify whether or not MSM analysis wa s used at all and also to analyze the randomized comparison (response rate 52%). For 23 effect estimates from 8 included RCTs [21-28] where we coul d not clearly determine the ITT effect, we contacted the trial authors for clarification (response rate 88%) . We did not verify the methodology of these approaches but relied on the reported description of the methods in the articles or responses to requests, i.e. when the authors described their approach using the words \"marginal structural variations thereof . No other eligibility criteria were applied. For each eligible RCT, we searched the first publication reporting the results of the primary endpoint (typically the \"main\" publication). We also searched trial protocols to obtain supplemental information on pre -specification of analyses and to clearly determine the primary outcomes (e.g. by evaluating details of the sample size calculation) . To identify these publications, t wo reviewers (H E, BS) independently screened the reference lists of the MSM -publications, trial homepages, PubMed, and clinicaltrials.gov. Data extraction From each eligible RCT, we selected all clearly MSM -based effects on any outcome using any metric (in one case [29], both risk difference and hazard ratio were reported and we extracted only the hazard ratio) . For each reported MSM -based effect, we identified any corresponding non-MSM -based effect in the same publication and the main trial publication (where applicabl e) that was based on the same comparison (i.e. population, intervention, control, outcome ) and follow -up time -point (allowing for up to 12 month deviance). We specifically identified any effect from ITT and other analyses such as analyses reported as \" per protocol \" or \"as -treated\" . We extracted the MSM -based and corresponding non-MSM -based effect estimates (with 95% confidence intervals), and details on the analysis approaches. For two comparisons of one trial with continuous outcomes, there was no between -group difference and we calculated it using the reported changes from baseline [30, 31] . We extracted the 53 effects for the overall trial population where possible. In one case, we extracted the results for two mutually exclusive subpopulations (aspirin user s and non -users) as no MSM -effect was reported for the overall population [24]. In three other cases, the MSM -based effect was only reported for a subpopulation of the main trial [23, 32, 33] and we only used non -MSM analyses for the same subpopulation. We extracted general trial characteristics , determined the primary endpoint and whether an MSM analysis was pre -specified according to the protocol or clear statements in the study publications. To determine why MSM analyses are used in RCTs, we extracted a ny statements on the authors' motivations for using MSM s. Data analysis For each eligible trial and outcome, we specifically juxtaposed MSM -based with ITT-based results as well as MSM -based with any other results. Firstly, using the results from all avail able analyses, w e assessed how frequently trea tment effects reported from MSM and other analyses were in the same or in opposite directions, how often there was no overlap between the 95% CIs of the results, and how often the MSM -based effect lay within the 95% CI of the other effects. We also determined the overall vibration of treatment effect estimates per comparison, i.e. the spread between the largest and smallest effect size (on a relative risk [odds ratio or hazard ratio] scale) derived from differen t analytical methods on the same comparison [34], excluding two trials where we only had effects for continuous outcomes. Secondly, to specifically focus on MSM -based versus ITT -based results across all comparisons, we selected the main MSM - and main ITT -based effect for each comparison . When multiple variations of such effects were reported, we selected the one described as \"main\" or \"primary\" (in the MSM - publication for the MSM -based effect and in the main publica tion for the ITT effect). When this was unclear , we selected the one first mentioned in the abstract (or in the results section, if none were mentioned in the abstract). Thirdly, to specifically compare the MSM - and ITT -based results on a trial level, we selected one main comparison of each trial . When there were multiple comparisons on different outcomes in the same trial, we selected the primary outcome or, if unclear , the one first mentioned. For two trials, we selected two comparisons (one trial compared two interventions with one control [35] and another used MSM for two mutually exclusive subpopulations [24]). We determined if MSM -based relative risk estimates for binary outcomes deviated more or less from the null , i.e. were more or less extreme than ITT -based effects. We tested if one appro ach more frequently provided more extreme effects than the other with the test for one proportion [36]. We then determined the ratio of these deviations from the null with MSM - versus ITT analysis (by calculating the difference between the deviations on th e log -scale and then back transforming to a relative risk scale ). For example, when the relative risk estimates are 0.5 and 2.0 with the two approaches , the difference from the null are identical and the ratio of the deviations is 1-fold. A ratio of > 1 in dicates more extreme effects for MSM -based results. Finally, we determined how similar the estimates of MSM - versus ITT analyses are using the ratio of the estimated relative risks (by calculating the absolute difference between MSM -based and ITT -based effect sizes on the log -scale). E.g. if the relative risk estimates are 0.5 and 2.0 with the two approaches , 54 the ratio of the estimated relative risks is 4 -fold. This ratio is >1 by definition as it reflects the absolute difference . We considered hazard rat ios or risk ratios equivalent to odds ratios , when odds ratios were not available. The approximation is sufficiently accurate for modest event rates as those observed in the eligible trials . We used Stata 14.2, R 3.3.2 and Excel 14.0 for all analyses. Results The search yielded 4372 records (last searched 19 May 2017), 176 were assessed in full -text. We included 14 publications reporting results of 12 RCTs with a median of 1972 included patients; IQR 870 to 17006) (Figure 1; Table 1). They were published between 2002 and 2016 (median 2013). Six of the 12 RCTs stopped early, 4 for benefit [28, 35, 37, 38] and 2 for harm [27, 39] . The studies evaluated treatment effects of aspirin, anticoagulation, hormone therapy, anticancer drugs, timing of circumcision, a ntiretrovirals, dietary interventions, antipsychotics, or prevention of mishaps. In 6 of 12 RCTs, the control was inactive, i.e. placebo [27, 28, 39] no intervention [30, 40] , or intervention [37]. They reported gerontology [30], and physical education [40] (Table 1). Double blinding was reported in 6 of 11 RCTs [27, 28, 37 -39, 41] . For 30, 35, 39 , 41, 43] , we identified a protocol or design paper. The application of MSM was pre -specified only in 1 of the 12 trials [30]. The first or last author of the publication presenting MSM -based results also co -authored the main and, where available, the prot ocol publication for 9 of 12 trials [38, 39, 43] . The MSM -publication was published a median of 3 years after the main trial publication. The stated motivations for applying MSM were diverse: MSM was used to adjust -varying\" -up\" -line treatment [32], and \"to analyze the data as if it were from an observational study ra ther than a randomized, controlled trial\" [23]; Webappendix 2). Across the 1 2 RCTs, we identified 24 clinical questions, i.e. comparisons (median 6, IQR 3 to 7 per comparison). Overall, 138 analyses were reported for these 24 comparisons of which 38 were MSM - based (including sensitivity analyses, \"crude\" and adjusted analyses, different censoring, and different forms of MSM) . For 20 of the 24 clinical questions there were ITT analyses reported ( in 11 RCTs), AT analyses for 9 (4 RCTs), PP analyses for 3 (1 RCT), and other analyses for 5 (2 RCTs) (Figure 2). Twenty - one comparisons had binary outcomes and 3 comparisons (2 RCTs) had continuous outcomes. Two analyses using MSM were clearly pre -specified (1 trial), and 4 analyses using MSM were described as \"sens itivity analysis\" (2 trials). MSM was used to evaluate the primary endpoint in 11 of the 12 RCTs. Overall relationship of treatment effects Across all 24 comparisons, the MSM -based results and those from any other reported analyses were all in the same dir ection in 19 cases (79%), overlapped with all of the 95% CIs (100%), and the MSM - effect lay within all 95% CIs of all other effects in 19 of 22 cases (86%). 55 Among the 123 analyses reported for 21 comparisons with binary outcomes, the median spread between the largest and smallest effect estimate was 1.19 on a relative risk scale, i.e. the largest effect estimate was 1.19 -fold (median; IQR 1.13 to 1.34; Table 2) larger than the smallest. Relationship of MSM - and ITT -based results MSM -based and ITT -based re sults were all in the same direction across all 20 available comparisons (100%; Table 2). Their CIs overlapped in all 18 cases with available CI information (100%), and the MSM - effect lay within the 95% CI of ITT effects in 16 cases (89%). Twelve of 17 (71%, 3 cases with at least 1 CI missing ) had both the same direction of effect and were both nominally significan t or both nominally non-significan t (i.e. both 95% CIs included the null or not; Table 2). MSM -based effects were more extreme in 13 of 20 compa risons (65%); and in 7 of 20 (35%), ITT -based effects were more extreme (p=0.18). The median deviation from the null of the MSM -based effects was 1.35 (IQR 1.19 to 1.59) and of ITT effects 1.24 (IQR 1.10 to 1.29) on a relative risk scale. On average (media n), the ratio of these deviations indicated 1.12 -fold more extreme MSM -based effects than the corresponding ITT effects (IQR 0.99 to 1.22; Table 2). When analyzing only the 13 main comparisons (1 trial had no ITT -based result at all), MSM -based effects we re more extreme than ITT -based effects in 7 comparisons (54%). In 46%, ITT -based effects were more extreme (p=0.78). The median deviation from the null of the MSM -based effects was 1.39 (IQR 1.19 to 1.69) and of ITT effects 1.24 (IQR 1.15 to 1.34). Here , MSM-based effects were 1.11 -fold more extreme (IQR 0.98 to 1.20; Table 2). The ratio of the estimated relative risks from MSM and ITT was 1.12 -fold (IQR 1.02 to 1.22; Table 2), i.e. half of the MSM -based effects deviated at least 1.12 -fold from ITT effects . Among the 11 main comparisons, this was 1.11 -fold ( IQR 1.02 to 1.20; Table 2). Discussion Principal findings In this empirical analysis, we found 12 trials with 138 effect estimates for 24 clinical questions (comparisons) which reported results from MSM -based and conventional analyses (Figure 2). The main motivation s for using MSM were related to missing data and other protocol deviations . The differences between MSM -based and other effects , including ITT effects, were typically within chance and the effects were in the same direction . However, t he quantitative differences across reported effects even within the same trial for the same outcome and the same author groups using different methods can be substantial. MSM does not consistently yield more extre me effects than ITT. Overall , MSM and ITT effects were similar, the absolute difference was less than 1.12 -fold in half of the comparisons . However, while a difference of 1.12 -fold may be modest for some outcomes, it may be clinically very meaningful for o thers (e.g. death). The substantial vibration between effect sizes from different analytic methods may be of less relevance for clinical decision -making as all effect estimates had the same direction. However, when quantifying effect estimates and their CIs across several studies (e.g. in meta -analyses, health technology assessments, or indirect comparisons of treatment effects), it may make a substantial difference which analysis method is chosen. When it comes to weighing benefits and harms of treatments or informing 56 shared decisions, for example when relative risks are translated to numbers needed to treat or harm, variations of effect sizes could matter. There were on average 6 estimates of the very same outcome (we explicitly searched for trials with at least 2 analyses of the same outcome and many analyses were explorative to demonstrate the analytic approaches ). However, when publications offer several effect estimates for one and the same outcome, it may be difficult for healthcare decision makers t o know which to base their decisions on. In one study, for example, there were 11 ITT effects, and many studies had two or more ITT effects. The analyses for these estimates followed different approaches and had different degrees of statistical adjustments (e.g. crude and adjusted for various covariates) [48]. Essentially, almost all of the analyses were not clearly pre -specified and this could add uncertainty in the results [48, 49] . In such a setting, the substantial vibration of effects magnifies the imp act of selective reporting biases. Post hoc calculations of effect estimates may impact the overall assessment of treatments substantially and further increases the risk for misguided care or policy making. It is also unknown how many additional analyses, with different models and adjustments might also have been performed, yet were not reported at all. Our findings highlight that mere pre -specification of the outcomes (and not specifically the analyses thereof) in clinical trials may not be sufficient to p revent selective reporting bias. Even when the results for an outcome are reported fo r the same time -point as pre -specified in protocols and trial registries, the results from various statistical approaches may provide different effect sizes and can be sel ectively reported. Overall, the spread between the effect estimates from the statistical analyses on the very same outcome was substantial (1.19 -fold) . In the present sample of trials, the use of MSM was often an explorative approach. However, c onducting s everal analytical methods in addition to the pre -specified analyses , especially methods as complex as MSM that give plenty of options for specification, could increase the risk for selective reporting of only some of the statistical analyses. Even when the approach itself would be pre -specified, statistical details of applying such a complex approach may still have great impact on the results. This complexity requires highly detailed pre -specification because of the possible impact of selective reporting bi as, which could possibly be larger than the impact of selecting conceptually different analytical approaches (or estimands [4]). Comparison with other studies This is, as far as we know, the first meta -epidemiological analysis comparing the results from c ausal modelling analyses with conventional analyses within trials across all medical fields . Several empirical studies compared ITT and PP analyses within one medical field or a specific time range [50-52]. A re- analysis of an RCT evaluating interventions for symptom management compared the conclusions from ITT (without imputing missing data) with those from PP analysis [50]. While the conclusions did not differ, the PP analysis also indicated which intervention and dose strategies affected symptoms [50]. A systematic review of RCTs reporting both ITT and PP analyses on a primary binary endpoint found effects from PP analyses more extreme and the ratio to ITT analyses varied greatly (0.39 to 2.53) [51]. In line with our findings, they concluded that protocol deviations can lead to systematic and unpredictable bias and that a trial's conclusion should not be based on the effect of either ITT or PP alone [51]. A meta -epidemiological study compared the results from conventional ITT analyses with those from modifi ed ITT analyses or non -ITT analyses. Similar to our results, they found that the ITT results had less extreme effects [53]. 57 Limitations Our study has several limitations. First, we only identified 12 trials for which we had MSM - and non - MSM -based effects and that focused on clinical decision making. Many of the excluded RCTs did not use MSM to analyze the randomized comparison but merely used the trial database to evaluate associations of non -randomized exposures or patient characteristics with outcomes. Second, we encountered various different forms and descriptions of MSM , IPW, G different timepoints [25] and adjusted for different covariates with or without two -way interactions between randomization status and each covariate [25]. Some of our included studies even report ed the results of multiple different forms of MSM within their study [25, 26, 40, 46] . Third, we did not verify the analytic approaches and relied on the authors' descriptions of them. Although we believe that the authors are probably the best experts for their data and analyses and have correctly classi fied and described them, details of the definitions may still be inconsistent [54]. Fourth, the trials that applied MSM to analyze the randomized comparison were mainly very large and highly cited (median citation count of main publications 1388 (IQR 142 t o 2121; SCOPUS 7 January 2018). All but 3 studies [30, 40, 42] were among the top 1% of the related medical trial literature (\"SCOPUS Citation Benchmarking Compared to Medicine articles of same age and document type\" ; 1 study not found on SCOPUS and not co unted [44]). Many (5/12) trials were also discontinued early, more frequently than in the typical clinical trial literature [55]. Hence our sample appears not to be representative of all RCTs. Fifth , we encountered problems with vague reporting of the anal ysis methods used . E.g. an analysis was merely described as \"conventional Cox model\" and it was unclear who was analyzed or how missing patient data were imputed. Several terms are not globally defined, e.g. \"patients evaluable . This may confuse readers as they have differe nt meanings to different people [54]. Sixth, the reporting of adherence, protocol violations, treatment switches, and missing data was typically not sufficiently clear to allow us to consider this in further analyses. We were not able to explore the agreement between effects sizes in relation to these factors. Seventh, the application of MSM in many studies was for very different reasons. MSM was sometimes applie d by highly experienced teams of biostatisticians who developed the approach and who conducted the analyses post -hoc for methodological demonstration purposes and not with the direct intention to inform healthcare decision making. This further adds to the very limited generalizability of this small but nevertheless systematically derived sample of trials. Finally, for each outcome, we intended to extract information indicating potential problems that may motivate authors to use MSM or other specific models . While we found statements that clearly indicated such issues, the reporting quality was very heterogeneous. Overall, MSM analyses require more sophisticated modelling than ITT analyses. It is difficult to pre - specify and collect the detailed high -quality data that are required for analyzing all possible post - randomization confounders, such as non -adherence [56]. Since patients' preferences and values 58 leading to non -adherence are almost never included in data collection, important confounders very likely r emain unmeasured and hence cannot be included in the modelling. Therefore, probably there is always some residual confounding bias even in MSM -adjusted effects. Furthermore, caution is required to pre -specify analyses where possible and apply strict safegu ards to avoid selective reporting or biases introduced by unblinded analyses. These limitations are less relevant in ITT analyses which don't require such adjustments and are more straightforward to pre -specify. Selective reporting bias may have more impac t on results used for decision -making than using conceptually different statistical approaches per se. Without very detailed and strict measures as safeguards to avoid research - associated biases such as selective reporting, the theoretical value of this pr omising approach may be entirely neutralized under \"real world\" research conditions. Conclusion Overall, we conclude that MSM -based results in randomized trials typically agreed with ITT and other conventional analyses of RCTs. They may theoretically prov ide very helpful insights and different perspectives in treatment effects, especially when there are high rates of attrition and non -adherence. However, there is a wide spread across all reported effects for the same outcome that requires utmost attention and complex safeguards to prevent selective reporting bias and related problems. 59 Acknowledgments We thank the authors of the primary studies for their timely responses to our information requests.

The main MSM -based result was a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.87) in aspirin users and a HR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.08) in aspirin non -users [24]. We identified an ITT analysis with a HR of 0.72 (95% CI 0 .53 to 0.98) for aspirin users and a HR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.04) in aspirin non -users [41]. Physicians' Health Study (PHS) The Physicians' Health Study (PHS) explored the effects of aspirin compared to placebo on cardiovascular mortality (Table 1). The main MSM -based result was a relative risk (RR) of 0.74 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.15) favoring aspirin [26]. The main ITT analysis was RR = 0.96 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.54) [28]. Women's Health Study (WHS) The Women's Health Study (WHS) studied the effects of aspir in vs placebo on major cardiovascular events (Table 1). The main MSM -based result was a RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07) [45]. The main ITT effect was a RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.03) [27]. Ranapurwala The study by Ranapurwala et al. assessed the effec t of a pre -dive checklist on diving mishaps (Table 1). The main MSM -based result was a RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.93) [40]. The main ITT analysis was a RR of 0.8 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.08) [40]. PREDIMED The PREDIMED study investigated the effect of Mediter ranean diet supplemented with extra -virgin olive oil or nuts versus advice on a low -fat diet on major cardiovascular events (Table 1). MSM -based effects were only reported for the secondary outcome type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence. The MSM -based HR was 0.7 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.94) for extra -virgin olive oil and 0.82 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.09) for nuts versus advice on a low -fat diet [23]. The according main ITT effects were HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.92) and 0.81 1.08), respectively [23]. Women's H ealth Initiative (WHI) 79 The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) explored the effect of estrogen -plus-progestin versus placebo in postmenopausal women with intact uterus on coronary heart disease (Table 1). The main MSM -based effect was a HR of 1.69 (95% CI 0.9 8 to 2.89) [29] and the main ITT effect was a HR of 1.29 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.63) [39]. AIDS Clinical Trial Group 320 study (ACTG 320) The AIDS Clinical Trial Group 320 study (ACTG 320) compared the effect of zidovudine and lamivudine plus indinavir versus zidovudine and lamivudine alone on AIDS or death in HIV positive, immunosuppressed, ART -experienced patients (Table 1). The main MSM -based result was a HR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.74) [25]. The main ITT result was an HR of 0.5 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.76) [38]. POINTBREAK Study The POINTBREAK Study assessed the effect of pemetrexed/carboplatin/bevacizumab followed by maintenance pemetrexed/bevacizumab versus maintenance bevacizumab on the overall survival of patients with lung cancer (Table 1). Th e main MSM -based result was the adaptively truncated MSM (truncating the longitudinal inverse -probability computations) with a HR of 1.12 (95% CI not reported) [46]. The main ITT result was a HR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.16) [43]. Tunis reported Tunis et al. [44] and Faries et al. [33] studied the effect of or versus a \"fail -rst\" algorithm (conventional antipsychotics then olanzapine if indicated) on change in the brief psychiatric rating scale in patients with schizophrenia o r a schizoaff ective disorder (Table 1). The main MSM -based estimated treatment difference (olanzapine - conventional) was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3) [33] and the corresponding ITT estimated treatment difference was 0.2 (95% CI -1.8 to 2.1) [44]. Negoro / Yamaguchi The RCT reported by Negoro et al. [42] and Yamaguchi et al. [32] explored the effect of irinotecan hydrochloride versus cisplatin in patients with lung cancer on overall survival (Table 1). An MSM -based effect was reported for overall survival in the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB lung cancer. The HR was 1.2 (95% CI 0.64 to 2.28) [32]. The main ITT analysis was HR = 1.24 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.91) [42]. CALERIE Study 80 The CALERIE Study explored the effect of calorie restriction (behavioral approach with dietar y modications) versus no dietary restriction on resting metabolic rate (kcal/d) and core temperature (\u00b0C) in healthy young - and middle -aged non -obese men and women (Table 1). We used resting metabolic rate as main comparison. The main MSM -based mean diffe rence was -36 (95% CI not reported) [31] and the corresponding ITT mean difference was -64 (95% CI not reported) [30]. Kisumu RCT The Kisumu RCT assessed the effect of immediate versus delayed circumcision on HIV incidence (Table 1). The main MSM -based result was a HR of 0.42 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.66) over a 6 -year follow -up. There were no ITT -based 6 -year follow -up results available (planned duration of the trial was 2 years) [22]. Hence, this trial was not used in the main comparison of MSM vs ITT. 81 Discussion Overall findings In doctoral project I, we found that many observational studies in high impact journals lack satisfactory discussion of confounding bias. When confounding bias was mentioned, authors were often confident that it was rather irrel evant to their findings and they rarely call ed for cautious interpretation. Studies that discussed possible limitations due to confounding were actually cited more by other researchers than studies that deemed an influence due to confounding unlikely. In doctoral project II, we found that effects of the tested treatments in non -randomized studies using MSM often pointed in the opposite direction than when RCTs tested the treatments . Overall, MSM - studies tend ed to show more favorable effects of the experime ntal treatment ; this was more pronounced when the MSM -studies focused on informing health care decision making rather than statistical methodology. In doctoral project III, we found that MSM was thus far sometimes applied to RCTs, often to adjust for prot ocol deviations . They were typically not pre -specified , exploratory analyses. Within the main study publication and any corresponding publication reporting MSM -based results, trial authors reported on average 6 analysis results for one clinical question and the spread between the smallest and largest effect estimate can be substantial . The effect estimates of these analyses rarely pointed in different directions. MSM -effects and ITT -effects always pointed in the same direction (i.e. benefit or harm) with MSM-based results being more extreme (i.e. further from the null) in more than half of the cases, and differences in effect sizes were substantial in some cases. Findings in context Confounding bias is a pervasive threat to validity of non -randomized studies and deserves utmost attention. The assumption to know all confounding factors, to measure them correctly and to implement them correctly in the statistical models is very unrealistic . In light of the results of this doctoral thesis , major questions can be asked, including \"How much impact does confounding have on healthcare decisions ?\" or \" How should healthcare decision makers decide which estimate to trust in? \". There is no unified answer to the question how much impact confounding has. A simulation study found that the bias in the treatment effect estimate decreases or increases depending on the correlation of the confounders to each other (i.e. whether they consistently bias the effect in the same direction or not), the measurement error, the degree of u nmeasured confounding, and the correlation between confounders with the exposure35. The impact of unmeasured confounding is greater when the confounders are not correlated as omitting even one confounder from the analysis can lead to substantial bias in the estimated effect35. When researchers try to minimize confoundi ng and other biases in observational studies, the size of effect estimates, even the conclusions they draw, may still differ from those they would have obtained in an RCT , even when modern causal models are used (doctoral project II). However, the impact o f confounding on the results is rarely discussed in the highest impact literature of general medical, epidemiologic, and specialty journals (doctoral project I)33. This is, however, clearly suggested by reporting guidelines, in particular by the Strengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline. A recent study evaluated the quality of reporting changes after the introduction o f STROBE36. The authors concluded that despite 82 some improvements, the reporting quality of confounding remained overall suboptimal36. To improve the reporting beyond STROBE, the journal PLOS Medicine requires authors to complete the reporting checklist along with explanations how each item was accomplished37. Our findings highlight that such approaches may be urgently needed to improve the reporting of research results. There are many areas in healthcare where no RCT evidence is available and treatment decisions are made based on obser vational studies which rely on the assumption of no relevant confounding bias. The current use of observational research is often not clearly focused on such evidence gaps38. It is very likely that many health care decisions would be made differently if trials were available. Therefore, confounding bias has probably a huge impact on current health care, in particular in areas where no randomized trial evidence exi sts. Even in areas where trials support healthcare decisions, it is not always clear which result of the trial should be used to inform the decision. When multiple analyses (with or without addressing a specific type of confounding) are available for one o utcome in an RCT, the spread between the smallest and largest effect estimate can be substantial (doctoral project III) . Unclear reporting of multiple effect estimates on one clinical question makes it difficult for clinical decision makers to assess their role for the interpretation of results and to decide which estimate to base their decision on . In addition, due to the complexity of the underlying models, much more details are required to allow for replication of the studies. After all, d epending on th e clinical case at hand, even relatively small risk differences may be deciding over life and death. Hence, confounding should always be considered and minimized, if possible on design level2 39, and reporting needs to be as transparent as possible. Limitations and future research Despite applying various rigorous methods , the doctoral projects possess some limita tions. First, in doctoral projects II and III, the analyzed sample was rather small. Our searches indicated that there are no trial s for numerous clinical questions explored in observational MSM -studies but not in RCTs, which could be an explanation of th e small sample of doctoral project II (as it depended on dyads of observational studies using MSM and RCTs on the same clinical question). The use of MSM in RCTs is relatively new and mostly used for explorative post -hoc analyses, which explains the small sample in doctoral project III. As the merits of this approach for RCTs may become clearer , so may the possible sample increase to allow for future replications or re -analyses. Second, we conducted the database searches only on PubMed40. However, there is no specific recommendation how many and which databases would be necessary to identify a represent ative sample for meta -epidemiological studies informing on research methodology. We applied a number of methods to improve the validity of our searches: we peer -review ed the database searches on PubMed, we applied several measures to increase the retrieval rate of relevant studies , and conduct ed extensive prospective and retrospective citation searches (i.e. studies that have been cited by key literature or are citing key literature)41. Third , the research question of doctoral project s II and III was restricted to the application of MSM, and the implications do not necessarily generalize to other models for causal inference. While m arginal structural models is one of the most frequently used method s for causal infere nce and to assess the 83 impact of time -varying confounding26, there are o ther methods to estimate treatment effects i n the presence of time -varying confounders including g-computation formula and the g-estimation of structural nested models26. Acknowledging a steep increase in the use of these alternative methods, future research could address the agreement of different analysis methods correcting for time -varying confounding and compare it with standard methods. Fourth , we did not explore mechanistic reasons underlying our findings nor how to tackle some of the discovered issues , i.e. we cannot clearly answer the question why confounding was underestimated in the conclusions of observational research , why the application of MSM to non -randomized data does not always answer research questions as RCTs would, and why many RCTs report several different analysis methods for one and the same result without explanation . These could be addressed in f uture research , for example by investigat ing how well authors, editors, and teachers understand the meaning and impact of confou nding. An international survey could help to identify the extent of the problem. Second, the results could provide the rationale for a world -wide campaign with the long - term aim of improving research by promoting control for confounding as one of the basic principle s of causal inference . Fifth, two of the three doctoral projects have not been published as journal article yet . However, we plan to (re -) submit in April 2018 , also in light of the peer -review comments from the BMJ . However, some of the prelimin ary results were widely discussed on national and international meetings, including poster presentations and talks on the largest intern ational conference in this area, the Global Evidence Summit of the Cochrane Collaboration, Campbell Collaboration, Guide lines -International Network, International Society for Evidence -based Health Care, and Joanna Briggs Institute in Cape Town, South Africa (September 2017), where I was awarded with the Thomas C . Chalmers award for the work on doctoral project II . In collab oration with my network of researchers from Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Brazil, USA, Canada, and Australia, I plan to further pursue the evaluation of confounding bias in health care and help to better address its implications for healthcare decision - making. What we can do now There is plenty of things that can be done right now by users and producers of research evidence. Clinical decision makers should critically appraise the validity of research results and their applicability to the healthcare quest ion at hand. They need to remain cautious when using non -randomized evidence, even when the most modern and complex models are applied. Researchers should acknowledge confounding more carefully in non -randomized and randomized research and when trying to a nswer questions that go beyond the pragmatic nature of the intention to treat. As we could show, acknowledgement of confounding is not associ ated with a lower citation impact and researchers do not need to fear to \"perish\" when publishing their results wit h adequate calls for caution. Before launching a trial, researchers should think critically about what they want to measure (including confounding variables), how they want to measure it and to ensure high quality data collection, and how bias, non -adheren ce, and loss -to-follow -up can be avoided. Adherence to a reporting guideline helps avoiding basic errors of reporting . Useful tools already exist , e.g. over 200 guidelines listed on the EQUATOR Network website (www.equator -network.org ). With regard to curr ent results, researchers should clearly state which analyses were pre -specified and which were explorative. Journals should make their policies clear and adhere to them. 84 Closing Remarks \"Knowledge is merely brilliance in organization of ideas and not wis dom. The truly wise person goes beyond knowledge.\" - Confucius42 One issue with knowledge is the things we do not know. Semmelweis was laughed at, ignored at best, for his idea that organic particles from the autopsy room could cause the de ath of subsequently treated patients, especially wom en giving birth15. Without knowing the causal pathways, his hygienic measure s had such a strong effect that eventually he convinced his peers of properly disinfecting their hands with chlorine solution before attending a delivery - with great life -saving effects . Yet, his explanation seemed too fantastic for the medical community and he received strong opposition15. Today, we know that these \"particles\" were bacteria and we found the means to see and measu re them. Yet , the history of confounding is quickly forgotten when researchers succumb to the pressure of the current publication -based reward system rather than trying to evoke a n overdue paradigm shift . This dissertation is a reminder to look beyond, to be realistic about the things we do not know, and to be open for the possibility that we got it all wrong: Do not make science an alternative fact. 85 References 1.

Dell-Kuster S, Schandelmaier S, Hemkens LG, Bucher HC, Young J, Rosenthal R Background : Multiple surgical procedures in a single patient are relatively common and lead to depen - dent (clustered) data. This dependency needs to be accounted for in study design and d ata analysis. A systematic review was performed to assess how clustered data were handled in inguinal hernia trials. The impact of ignoring clustered data was estimated using simulations. Methods : PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library were reviewed syst ematically for RCTs published between 2004 and 2013, including patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia repair. Study characteristics determining the appropriateness of handling clustered data were extracted. Using simulations, various s tatistical methods accounting for clustered data were compared with an analysis ignoring clustering by assuming 100 hernias, with a varying percentage of patients having bilateral hernias. Results : Of the 50 eligible trials including patients with bilater al hernias, 20 (40 per cent) did not provide information on how they dealt with clustered data and 18 (36 per cent) avoided clustering by assessing the outcome by patient and not by hernia. None of the remaining 12 trials (24 per cent) considered clusterin g in the design or analysis. In the simulations, ignoring clustering led to an increased type I error rate of up to 12 per cent and to a loss in power of up to 15 per cent, depending on whether the patient or the hernia was the randomization unit. Conclus ion: Clustering was rarely considered in inguinal hernia trials. The simulations underline the importance of considering clustering as part of the statistical analysis to avoid false -positive and false - negative results, and hence inappropriate study conclu sions. 88 Off-label treatments were not consistently better or worse than approved drug treatments in randomized trials Objectives : Off -label drug use is highly prevalent but controversial and often discouraged assuming generally inferior medical effects associated with off -label use. Study Design and Setting : We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, PubMed Health, and the Cochrane Library up to May 2015 for systematic revie ws including meta -analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing off -label and approved drugs head -to-head in any population and on any medical outcome. We combined the comparative effects in meta -analyses providing summary odds ratios (sOR) for e ach treatment comparison and outcome, and then calculated an overall summary of the sOR across all comparisons (ssOR). Results : We included 25 treatment comparisons with 153 RCTs and 24,592 patients. In six of 25 comparisons (24%), off -label drugs were sig nificantly superior (five of 25) or inferior (one of 25) to approved treatments. There was substantial statistical heterogeneity across comparisons (I2 = 43%). Overall, off -label drugs were more favorable than approved treatments (ssOR 0.72; 95% CI = 0.54 - 0.95). Analyses of patient -relevant outcomes were similar (statistical significant differences in 24% (six of 25); ssOR 0.74; 95% CI = 0.56 -0.98; I2 = 60%). Analyses of primary outcomes of the systematic reviews (n = 22 comparisons) indicated less heteroge neity and no statistically significant difference overall CI = 0.67 -1.06; I2 = 0%). Conclusion : Approval status does not reliably indicate which drugs are more favorable in situations with clinical trial evidence comparing off -label with ap proved use. Drug effectiveness assessments without considering off -label use may provide incomplete information. To ensure that patients receive the best available care, funding, policy, reimbursement, and treatment decisions should be evidence based consi dering the entire spectrum of available therapeutic choices. 89 Comparative effectiveness of tenofovir in HIV -infected treatment - experienced patients: Briel M, Bucher HC, Hemkens LG Background : Antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for HIV infection are frequently changed. We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials (RCTs) on the benefits and harms of swit ching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) -based regimens in ART -experienced patients. Methods : We included RCTs in HIV -infected adults comparing switching to a TDF -containing regimen with maintaining or switching to another regimen. We searched MEDLINE , EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, SCI, and the WHO Global Health Library. We assessed bias with the Cochrane tool and synthesized data using random -effects meta -analyses and Peto's approach. For further analyses, we added data from a previous systematic review in treatment -na\u00efve patients. Results : 17 RCTs with 2210 patients were included. All but one study had a high risk of bias. There was no significant association of switching to TDF -based regimens with mortality, fractures, CD4 -cell count, body fat, virologica l failu re, LDL -, and HDL -cholesterol. TDF -based regimens decreased total cholesterol (mean to 3.34), trigylcerides 2.46%; 3.9 to 1.03; lumbar s pine to 0.34). Effects on estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) were inconsistent and depended on the measurement. Adding 22 RCTs from 8297 treatment -na\u00efve patients gave consistent results with then significant reductions of LDL (7.57 mg/dL; 10.37 to 4.78), HDL (2.38 mg/dL; 3.83 to 0.93), and eGFR (3.49 ml/min; 5.56 to 1.43). Conclusions : Switching to TDF -based regimens is associated with reductions of BMD and lipid levels and possibly lowered kidney function. The evidence is l imited by the high risk of bias. 90 Colchicine and prevention of cardiovas Evidence Synopsis , no abstract available. 91 The clinical effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines - a systematic review and meta Background: Streptococcus pneumo niae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million yearly deaths worldwide. An up -to-date evidence base on the effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) on infectious diseases and mortality in any population or setting regardless of age or health s tatus is currently lacking. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently screened 9498 titles/abstracts and 430 full -text papers for eligible trials. The outcomes of our meta -analysis were pooled using relative risks (RRs) with a random effects model or Peto's odds ratios (ORs) if event rates were <1%. Results: 21 RCTs comprising 361 612 individuals were included. PCVs reduced the risk for invasive pneumococcal diseas e (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43, large risk reductions for pneumococcal infectious diseases, smaller risk reductions for infectious diseases from any cause, and no significant effect on all -cause mortality.

Colchicine is an old anti -inflammatory drug that has shown substantial cardiovascular benets in recent trials. We systematically reviewed cardiovascular benets and harms of colchicine in any population and specically in patients with high cardiovascular risk. We evaluated randomised controlled trials comparing colchicine over at least 6 months versus any control in any adult population. Primary outcomes were all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction and adverse events. Cardiovascular mortality was a seco ndary outcome. We included 39 trials with 4992 patients. The quality of evidence for mortality outcomes and myocardial infarction was moderate but lower for adverse events. Colchicine had no effect on all -cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.09; I2=27%; 0 trials). Cardiovascular mortality was reduced in some but not all meta -analytical models (random -effects 7 trials). The risk for myocardial infarction was reduced (RR 0.20, 0.07 to 0.57; 2 trials). There was no effect on total adverse events (RR 1.52, 0.93 to 2.46, I2=45%; 11 trials) but gastroin testinal intolerance was increased (RR 1.83, 1.03 to 3.26, I2=74%; 11 trials). Reporting of serious adverse events was inconsistent; no event occurred over 824 patient -years (4 trials). Effects in high cardiovascular risk populations were similar (4 trials ; 1230 patients). We found no evidence supporting colchicine doses above 1 mg/day. Colchicine may have substantial cardiovascular benets; however, there is sufcient uncertainty about its benet and harm to indicate the need for large -scale trials to furt her evaluate this inexpensive, promising treatment in cardiovascular disease. 94 Colchicine for prev ention of cardiovascular events Background: Colchicine is an anti -inflammatory drug that is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Cardiovascular disease also has an inflammatory component but the effects of colchicine on cardiovascular outcomes remain unclear. Previous safety analyses were restricted to specic patient populations. Objectives: To evaluate potential cardiovascular benets and harms of a continuous long -term treatment with colchicine in any population, and specically in people with high cardiovascular ri sk. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, citations of key papers, and study references in January 2015. We also contacted investigators to gain unpublished data. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (parallel -group or cluster design or rst phases of cross -over studies) comparing colchicine over at least six months versus any control in any adult population. Data collection and analysis: Primary outcomes were all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, stroke, heart failure, non - scheduled hospitalisations, and non -scheduled cardiovascular interve ntions. We conducted predened subgroup analyses, in particular for participants with high cardiovascular risk. Main results: We included 39 randomised parallel -group trials with 4992 participants. Colchicine had no effect on all -cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.09; participants = 4174; studies = 30; I\u00b2 = 27%; moderate quality of evidence). There is uncertainty surrounding the effect of colchicine in reducing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.21, I\u00b2 = 9%; participants = 1132; stu dies = 7; moderate quality of evidence). Colchicine reduced the risk for total myocardial infarction (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.57; participants = 652; studies = 2; moderate quality of evidence). There was no effect on total adverse events (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.46; participants = 1313; studies = 11; I\u00b2 = 45%; very low quality of evidence) but gastrointestinal intolerance was increased (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.26; participants = 1258; studies = 11; I\u00b2 = 74%; low quality of evidence). Colchicine showed no effect on heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.88; participants = 462; studies = 3; I\u00b2 = 45%; low quality of evidence) and no effect on stroke (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.70; participants = 874; studies 3; I\u00b2 = 45%; low quality of evidence). Repor ting of serious adverse events was inconsistent; no event occurred over 824 patient -years (4 trials). Effects on other outcomes were very uncertain. Summary effects of RCTs specically focusing on participants with high cardiovascular risk were similar (4 trials; 1230 participants). Authors' conclusions: There is much uncertainty surrounding the benets and harms of colchicine treatment. Colchicine may have substantial benets in reducing myocardial infarction in selected high - risk populations but uncertain ty about the size of the effect on survival and other cardiovascular outcomes is high, especially in the general population from which most of the studies in our review were drawn. Colchicine is associated with gastrointestinal side effects based on low -quality evidence. More evidence from large -scale randomized trials is needed. 95 Comparative effectiveness of Tenofovir in treatment -na\u00efve HIV (TDF) in HIV -infected, antiretroviral treatment (ART) -na\u00efve patients of any age have not been syste matically reviewed since recent milestone trials were published. Methods : We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SCI, LILACS, WHO GHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TDF -based treatments with any other ART -regimen ( last search 01/2015). Trial characteristics and results were extracted, risks of bias systematically assessed, and treatment effects synthesized in meta -analyses using random -effects models. Results : We included 22 RCTs (8297 patients). We found no differe nces between groups for mortality, AIDS, fractures, CD4 cell count, and virological failure; and inconclusive information due to inadequate reporting for cardiovascular events, renal failure, proteinuria, rash, and quality of life. Tenofovir disoproxil fum arate -based regimens ( { mg/dl; ( { mg/dl; 29.77 mg/dl; 38.61 20.92), bone mineral density (BMD) (hip: { 1.41%; { 1.87 to { rate (eGFR) ( { 3.47 ml/minute; { 5.89 to { 1.06) over 48 weeks of follow -up. Effects were similar in trials comparing xed - dose TDF/FTC -based regimens with ABC/3TC -based regimens. We found no influence of baseline viral load on virological failure. Discussion : Moderate -quality evidence suggests similar effects o f TDF -based treatment regimens and other ART on virological failure. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate -based regimens are associated with a more favorable lipid prole, but with increased risk of reduced BMD and eGFR. Improved reporting quality is vital to all ow assessment of clinical outcomes in future trials. 96 Adjunctive corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in patients with HIV infection Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2015, Issue 4. pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients infected with the human immunodeciency virus (HIV). Among patients with HIV infection and PCP the mortality rate is 10% to 20% during the initial infection and this increases substantially with the need for mechanical ventilation. It has been suggested that corticosteroids adjunctive to standard treatment for PCP could prevent the nee d for mechanical ventilation and decrease mortality in these patients. Objectives: To assess the effects of adjunctive corticosteroids on overall mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in HIV -infected patients with PCP and substantial hypoxaemi a (arterial oxygen partial pressure < 70 mmHg or alveolar -arterial gradient > 35 mmHg on room air). Search methods: For the original review we searched The Cochrane Library (2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1980 to December 2004) and EMBASE (January 1985 t o December 2004) without language restrictions. We further reviewed the reference lists from previously published overviews, searched UptoDate version 2005 and Clinical Evidence Concise (Issue 12, 2004), contacted experts in the eld and searched the refer ence lists of identied publications for citations of additional relevant articles. In this update of our review, we searched the above -mentioned databases in September 2010 and April 2014 for trials published since our original review. We also searched fo r ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP). We searched for conference abstracts via AEGIS. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials that compared corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in HIV -infected patients with PCP in addition to baseline treatment with trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine or dapsone -trimethoprim, and reported mortality data. We excluded trials in patients with no or mild hypoxaemia (ar terial oxygen partial pressure > 70 mmHg or an alveolar -arterial gradient <35 mmHg on room air) and trials with a follow -up of less than 30 days. Data collection and analysis: Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracte d data from each primary study. We pooled treatment effects across studies and calculated a weighted average risk ratio of overall mortality in the treatment and control groups using a random -effects model. In this update of our review, we used the GRADE m ethodology to assess evidence quality. Main results: Of 2029 screened records, we included seven studies in the review and six in the meta - analysis. Risk of bias varied: the randomization and allocation process was often not clearly described, ve of seven studies were double -blind and there was almost no missing data. The quality of the evidence for mortality was high. Risk ratios for overall mortality for adjunctive corticosteroids were 0.56 (95% condence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.98) at one month and 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) at three to four months of follow -up. In adults, to prevent one death, numbers needed to treat are nine patients in a setting without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) available, and 23 patients with HAART 97 available. The t hree largest trials provided moderate quality data on the need for mechanical ventilation, with a risk ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.73) in favour of adjunctive corticosteroids. One study was conducted in infants, suggesting a risk ratio for death in hos pital of 0.81 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.29; moderate quality evidence). Authors' The number and size of trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV - infected patients with PCP is small, but the evidence from this review suggests a benecial effect for adult patients with substantial hypoxaemia. There is insufcient evidence on the effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on survival in infants. 98 Appendix I I - Short curriculum vitae : Hannah Ewald Education 2015 - present PhD in Epidemiology at U niversity of Basel and Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute 2011 - 2012 Master in Public Health at University of Warwick (Department of Medicine), UK 2008 - 2009 Bachelor of Health in Physiotherapy at Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen, Netherlands 2005 - 2008 Qualification physiotherapist at Helmut R\u00f6dler Schule f\u00fcr -Mendel -Gymnasium, Amberg, Germany Professional Experience 2017 - present Information Specialist at Un iversity Library Basel, Switzerland 2013 - present Researcher at Basel Institute for Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland 2008 - 2011 Physio - and Sports -therapist in Amberg and Erlangen, Germany Scientific Awards 2017 Thomas C.
