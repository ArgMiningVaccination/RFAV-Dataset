Written By Edited By Reviewed By Rhodiola rosea, often called \"rhodiola\" for short, is a plant in the genus Rhodiola that's used as an herbal supplement with adaptogenic properties that help to provide general resistance to stress. Although its mechanisms of action are not completely understood, it is clear that rhodiola increases resilience to stress at both the cellular and systemic levels. Rhodiola Rosea is most often used for Rhodiola rosea is a medicinal plant in the Rhodiola genus (Crassulaceae family), which has traditionally been used as an [anti-fatigue agent](/outcomes/fatigue-symptoms/) and [adaptogenic](/outcomes/stress-signs-and-symptoms/) compound. [[1]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-1) The root contains a number of bioactive compounds, but the main two that are thought to mediate its effects are rosavin and salidroside. Rhodiola supplements are generally taken in the form of root powder or standardized extracts with 1-5% salidrosides. Although rhodiola supplements are usually taken for their stress-and fatigue-reducing effects, they may also [[4]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-4) [[5]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-5) and antioxidant [[6]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-6) properties. Although it is known for its ability to alleviate psychological stress and anxiety, rhodiola has also been shown to interact with cellular stress-response signaling in in vitro studies, indicating that it may have benefits at the cellular level as well as the systemic level. The mechanisms behind rhodiola's ability to mitigate stress in humans are complex and not well understood. The anti-stress effects of rhodiola may occur in part due to it being able to blunt cortisol release under stressful conditions. [[7]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-7) The main benefits of rhodiola are associated with its adaptogenic properties and include reduced stress and fatigue, as well as increased mental performance, particularly under stressful conditions. Rhodiola has an extensive track record for efficacy, with medicinal use dating back centuries, when it was used to promote healing, stress relief, and increased sense of wellbeing. [[1]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-1) In preclinical studies involving model organisms such as fruit flies, [[8]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-8) worms, [[9]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-9) and yeast, [[10]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-10) rhodiola has been shown to have anti-aging and longevity-promoting properties, as well as anti-cancer effects. [[11]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-11) [[5]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-5) More research is needed to determine whether there are similar effects in humans. Finally, Rhodiola may be beneficial in improving the symptoms of [ischemic heart disease](/conditions/ischemic-heart-disease/) and [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/) when used in conjunction with routine medical treatments. [[12]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-12) [[13]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-13) In short-to-moderate intake durations (months to a year) and in moderate doses, rhodiola is safe, with little to no side effects. Although reports of adverse effects are rare, dizziness, dry mouth, and headache were noted in a small number of participants in some trials. [[14]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-14) [[15]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-15) Rhodiola has been shown to interact with liver enzymes in vitro, indicating a possibility for drug interactions. It increased the concentration and decreased clearance of a particular antihypertensive drug in rabbits, [[16]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-16) confirming interaction with at least one class of drugs in vivo. Rhodiola seems to have [ergogenic](/glossary/ergogenic/) properties in addition to its adaptogen properties. In studies looking at strength training, rhodiola increased strength and power when taken just before training. [[17]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-17) Supplementing with rhodiola also decreased the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) in several studies. [[18]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-18) [[19]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-19) [[20]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-20) In endurance training, some studies have shown that rhodiola can lower fatigue and improve speed. [[21]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-21) [[20]](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/#ref-20) While these results are promising, more studies need to be done before rhodiola can be recommended at specific dosages for exercise performance. Supplementation of Rhodiola rosea tends to refer to either the SHR-5 extract (standardized to 4 mg of salidroside (rhodioloside) per 144 mg tablet) or an equivalent extract. Usage of rhodiola as a daily preventative against fatigue has been reported to be effective in doses as low as 50 mg. Acute usage of rhodiola for fatigue and anti-stress has been noted to be taken in the 288-680 mg range. As rhodiola has been shown to have a bell-curve response before, it is recommended to not exceed the aforementioned 680 mg dosage, as higher doses may be ineffective.
