In addition to an overall score, we measure subscores for support, edge support, cooling, motion transfer, durability, trial period, and warranty. When it comes to organic mattresses, most sleepers are looking for higher-quality materials than usual. That's why all of these beds scored at least a 4 out of 5 for both support and durability, both of which indicate a sturdy construction. Additionally, all beds scored at least a 3.7 out of 5 for cooling, which means that they should do well at promoting breathability.

Our Expert's Take With quality materials and excellent construction, the PlushBeds Botanical Bliss is sure to make you feel like royalty, which is why it's our top pick for the best organic mattress. Organic cotton and New Zealand wool cover the top of the mattress, followed by naturally cooling Talalay latex, and durable Dunlop latex. This all-latex bed comes in two firmnesses, Medium and Medium-Firm, so you can choose what works best for your sleeping needs and preferences. We personally reviewed the Medium model, and it felt great in multiple sleeping positions. That being said, if you just sleep on your stomach, even the Medium-Firm model won't be firm enough. Take a look at the Awara mattress further down this list if you are primarily a stomach sleeper. What We Love About the PlushBeds Botanical Bliss - The PlushBeds features eco-friendly, green materials. \"Green-washing\" is a major issue with many mattress companies, but the PlushBeds was third-party tested to ensure it adheres to organic mattress standards. Based on our research, this is a true organic mattress. - You get firmness options with the PlushBeds mattress. Whenever you're shopping for a new mattress, you always want to think about what firmness will be right for your sleeping position. Side sleepers and lightweight people will prefer the Medium model, while average weight combo and back sleepers will like the Medium-Firm model. - The PlushBeds will help you sleep nice and cool. Cotton, wool, and latex are naturally breathable, cooling materials. If you sleep like an oven, you can cool things down with this mattress. What to Keep in Mind About the PlushBeds Botanical Bliss - Like most latex mattresses, the PlushBeds doesn't have the slow-moving feel that so many people love. If you like to slowly sink into your mattress, you'll want to find a memory foam mattress. Just keep in mind that memory foam mattresses sleep hot and aren't as responsive as latex mattresses. - And, like many all-natural latex mattresses, the PlushBeds Botanical Bliss isn't exactly cheap. The PlushBeds will be a durable, long-lasting mattress, but you're going to pay more upfront. Other User Reviews On the [PlushBeds website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/shop/plushbeds-mattress/), users gave the Botanical Bliss an average score of 4.9/5. Many happy customers praised the bed's cooling qualities. Back sleepers and side sleepers were especially pleased with their purchase, but some complained it was heavy and didn't have the best edge support.

Back SleepingIdeal for average weight and heavyweight back sleepers. Side SleepingIdeal for heavyweight side sleepers. Stomach SleepingIdeal for lightweight and average weight stomach sleepers. Financing Options Financing options are available for this mattress. Our Expert's Take The Awara is another latex [hybrid mattress](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-hybrid-mattress/) with durable materials, boasting 4 of Dunlop latex and over 9 of pocketed coils. This design makes the Awara ideal for stomach sleepers. It is firmer than average and will provide excellent under your hips. When we tested the Awara mattress, we experience great overall support and did not feel our hips sinking in whatsoever. However, being a firmer mattress, we were not fans of the Awara for side sleeping. Read about the Nolah Natural above if you prefer to sleep on your side. What We Love About the Awara - The Awara will also be a [good fit for heavier people](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-mattress-heavy-people/). Larger people require more support than lightweight and average weight sleepers, but the coils and latex will be able to handle the extra weight. - When you buy the Awara mattress, you won't need to buy a mattress for many years. This mattress is durable, and if you take care of it, it will serve you well for over ten years. - If you like a firm mattress, look no further. The Awara scored a 7.5/10, which is a whole point firmer than average. You won't be lacking support on the Awara. What to Keep in Mind About the Awara - Lightweight people won't find what they are looking for. If you weigh less than 130 lb, and you don't want a super firm mattress, the Awara will not be right for you. You won't compress the mattress much, so it could feel firmer to you than it did to us. - Side sleepers will need a softer mattress. If you're a [side sleeper,](https://www.mattressclarity.com/sleep-resources/how-to-sleep-on-your-side/)you need something to relieve pressure on your joints. The Awara won't be able to provide that. - Of course, we need to chat about memory foam again. This and the other latex hybrid mattresses aren't going to give you the slow-moving feel you'll get with memory foam. Other User Reviews Customers on the [Awara website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/shop/awara-mattress/) gave it a 4.4/5. While many Awara customers loved its cooling and comfort, others said the mattress was either too firm or too soft for their situation.

Best Mattress for Combination Sleepers - WinkBeds EcoCloud WinkBeds EcoCloud Mattress Material Latex Trial Period 120 nights Shipping Method Free shipping Firmness Medium-firm: 6.5/10 Warranty Lifetime warranty Price Range $$$$$ WinkBeds EcoCloud Mattress The WinkBeds EcoCloud is a supportive latex hybrid mattress that makes it easy for you to switch positions while sleeping. Material Latex Warranty Lifetime warranty Firmness Medium-firm: 6.5/10 Shipping Method Free shipping Trial Period 120 nights Price Range $$$$$ WinkBeds EcoCloud Mattress The WinkBeds EcoCloud is a supportive latex hybrid mattress that makes it easy for you to switch positions while sleeping. Material Latex Firmness Medium-firm: 6.5/10 Trial Period 120 nights Warranty Lifetime warranty Shipping Method Free shipping Price Range $$$$$ Our Expert's Take We've offered up a great option for side sleepers with the Nolah Natural, but what if you switch positions at night? Well, if you're a tosser and turner, the WinkBeds EcoCloud will be the organic mattress for you. The star of the WinkBeds EcoCloud is a 4 layer of Talalay latex. In addition to being naturally cooling, this material is extremely responsive, which makes it easy to switch positions while you sleep. The mattress also boasts a medium firmness, which is just what combo sleepers should be looking for. When we tested the mattress, we thought it was an especially good fit for back and side sleeping. Some stomach sleepers will be okay on the EcoCloud, but if you need extra support, take a look at the firmer Awara mattress. What We Love About the WinkBeds EcoCloud - Hot sleepers rejoice. We've got another great mattress for you. The WinkBeds is extremely breathable, so it won't trap your body heat and make you feel all hot and sweaty during the night. - Get ready to get in the zone. Yep, the WinkBeds EcoCloud features zoned coils that give you comfort and support right where you need it. Specifically, it is firmer toward the center of the mattress, so you should feel more support under your lumbar area. - We hope you like long-term relationships. The EcoCloud boasts some high-end, durable materials, so you won't be saying goodbye to this mattress anytime soon. What to Keep in Mind About the WinkBeds EcoCloud - Sorry stomach sleepers, you miss out again. Some of you will get enough support on the WinkBeds EcoCloud, but if you just sleep on your stomach, keep hunting for that firmer mattress. - Apologies for the broken record but, again, you're not going to get a memory foam feel with this mattress. If contouring is important to you, memory foam is the name of the game. - While it will be a long-lasting mattress, don't be surprised if you get sticker shock. The WinkBeds EcoCloud, like other organic mattresses, is on the pricier side. Other User Reviews The WinkBeds EcoCloud didn't score quite as high with customers when compared to the PlushBeds and Nolah mattresses. Still, 4.8/5 isn't bad. On the [WinkBeds website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/a/wink-beds-ecocloud-hybrid-mattress/), customers said the EcoCloud was great for back and side sleeping, and even after a few years, it was still comfortable. However, some complained that the edge support was not up to snuff.

[proper spinal alignmnet](\"https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-orthopedic-mattress/\") Our Expert's Take If you're a side sleeper, your mattress should be all about pressure relief. If you want something organic that will also relieve pressure on your shoulders and hips, the Nolah Natural is going to be a smart buy. It is softer than the PlushBeds Botanical Bliss and features organic wool and Talalay latex foam that will contour to your pressure points. But, thanks to Nolah's proprietary HDMax TriZone support coil system, you will still get plenty of support. If your mattress is too soft, you could get out of alignment and deal with some pain issues down the line. The Nolah Natural will relieve pressure where you need it while still keeping you nice and supported. What We Love About the Nolah Natural - It offers excellent pressure relief for side sleepers. It scored a 6/10 on our firmness scale, which is softer than the industry average. You should feel little to no pressure on your shoulders and hips. - If you deal with back pain, the Nolah Natural should be a big help. While it is softer than average, it will still keep you in good alignment while you sleep. This can prevent and ease back pain. - Like the other mattresses on this list, it is eco-friendly and green. It was third-party tested to ensure its materials are technically organic. What to Keep in Mind About the Nolah Natural - Stomach sleepers won't feel supported on the Nolah Natural. If you're a stomach sleeper, you are going to want to find a firmer mattress. If your mattress is too soft, you'll feel your hips sink down into the mattress, and this can cause back pain and other issues. - It doesn't have a memory foam feel. Memory foam is an incredibly popular mattress material and, if you're used to that quicksand feel, you're not going to get it with the Nolah Natural. - It is a bouncy mattress and doesn't cut down on motion transfer. If you sleep with a partner, you will feel every move they make during the night. If they like to toss and turn, get ready for some long nights. Other User Reviews On the [Nolah website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/a/nolah-natural-11/), the Natural tied with the PlushBeds with a score of 4.9/10. Unsurprisingly, side sleeping customers were big fans, but some back sleepers and stomach sleepers said it was too soft for them.

[best pillow-top mattresses](\"https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-pillow-top-mattress/\") Our Expert's Take Helix is a company known for its flexibility and mattress customization. Now, they're in the latex game with the Birch, a hybrid mattress with high-end components. It contains Talalay latex, organic cotton, and individually wrapped coils. These materials make it an [excellent mattress for back sleepers](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-mattress-for-back-sleepers/), providing a balanced feel. During our tests, the mattress let our hips sink in just the right amount, while we also got the proper amount of support. The mattress is also very bouncy, so if you do switch positions, it shouldn't be a problem. What We Love About the Birch - It is a firmer mattress that will work well for both back and stomach sleepers. But, if you're a side sleeper, you can add a Birch pillow-top to soften things up a bit. - If you're a bigger person, you should still get enough support on the Birch. It is on the firmer end and features some durable, supportive materials. - Hot sleepers are going to do well on the majority of the mattresses on this list, and the Birch is no exception. It features breathable materials that will keep you cool all night. What to Keep in Mind About the Birch - If you like something super soft, you're not going to get it with the standard Birch mattress. Again, if you like something softer, you can add the pillow-top. That will make things softer, but it still might feel too firm for some. - When you lie on the Birch, it's going to feel like you're sleeping on top of the mattress. If you prefer to sink into your mattress, you should find a softer mattress with some slow-moving foam in it. - Do you like to bounce on your bed? We hope so. If you don't, the responsive Birch won't be for you. It is very bouncy, and this feel isn't for everyone. Other User Reviews The Birch scored a 4.7/5 with customers on the [Birch website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/shop/birch-mattress/). Many were pleased with the organic materials, but some said the mattress was too firm for them.

Our Expert's Take The Brooklyn Bedding EcoSleep mattress is our favorite organic [mattress for hot sleepers](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-cooling-mattress-hot-sleepers/) because of its latex hybrid design. Organic and latex mattresses, in general, don't trap much heat, but the addition of coils in the EcoSleep construction makes it extra breathable. This mattress also features Joma wool and organic cotton, which make the top of the mattress feel very cool. When we tested the EcoSleep, none of our testers overheated. The also flippable, so you can choose between two firmness levels. In our experience, the medium-firm side is fantastic for back sleeping, and the firm side [ suits stomach sleepers](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-mattress-stomach-sleepers/) quite well. Neither side will be soft enough for side sleepers, however. If you sleep in this position, you will need a softer mattress. What We Love About the EcoSleep - Its materials and flippable design make it a very durable mattress. If you need to soften or firm up your mattress after a few years, you can simply flip the mattress over. - While the other mattresses on this list are cooling, this should be one of the most cooling. Multiple layers of latex and the addition of Joma wool will prevent the mattress from holding onto your body heat. - The Zenhaven's flippable design also makes it a good fit for multiple sleeping positions. Back sleepers and stomach sleepers wiill find what they need on at least one side of the mattress. What to Keep in Mind About the EcoSleep - Neither side will offer good [pressure relief](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-mattress-for-pressure-points/)for side sleepers. Even the Medium-Firm side scored an 8/10, which is too firm for side sleeping. - If you are simply a fan of soft mattresses, you'll want to keep looking. Both sides of this mattress are firmer than average and won't let you sink in too far. - Like the other latex mattresses on this list, the EcoSleep is nice and bouncy. Again, this is a preference thing, but if you like to sink into your mattress, the EcoSleep won't be for you. Other User Reviews On the [Brooklyn Bedding website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/shop/ecosleep-hybrid-mattress-brooklyn-bedding/), the EcoSleep got an average score of 4.7/5 with users. Many EcoSleep owners praised it for being a good bargain, but some complained it was not as firm as advertised.

Stomach SleepingIdeal for lightweight, average weight, and heavyweight stomach sleepers. Financing Options Financing options are available for this mattress. Our Expert's Take If you're in the market for something more luxurious, the Saatva Latex Hybrid is a great choice. It uses high-quality materials such as supportive coils, Talalay latex, wool, and organic cotton, giving it a high-end look and feel. If you've ever slept in a nice hotel, the Saatva offers a similar feel to that. In addition, it scored a 7.5/10 on during our firmness tests, which is firmer than average. This made it a great fit for back sleeping and stomach sleeping. However, the firmer Saatva Latex Hybrid felt too firm for side sleeping. Side sleepers who want something will prefer the Nolan Natural, mentioned above. Why We Love the Saatva Latex Hybrid - Its latex and wool are both certified organic, and it was third-party tested to make sure it features no toxic chemicals. You can rest easy and cleanly on the Saatva Latex Hybrid. - If you're looking for firmness, you've found it with this mattress. It is a whole point firmer than average and offers great overall support. You stomach and back sleepers should take note. - And, we've got another cooling mattress here. The organic cotton and organic wool make the top of the mattress breathable, while Talalay latex prevents the mattress from trapping your body heat. What to Keep in Mind About the Saatva Latex Hybrid - Side sleepers will want to keep rolling. This firm mattress just won't cut it when it comes to pressure relief. You'll feel a buildup of pressure around your shoulders and hips, and this could have you waking up with aches and pains. - Like many other latex hybrid mattresses, the Saatva is not cheap. If your budget is tighter, you can opt for a different mattress or sign up for a payment plan with Saatva. - Surprise, surprise, this latex hybrid doesn't have a slow-moving feel. Again, memory foam is your friend if you like something with contouring. Other User Reviews On the [Saatva website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/deal/saatva-latex-mattress/), the latex hybrid scored a 4.8/5. Many were happy with the buying process and overall customer service experience. However, some said the white glove delivery process wasn't what they expected, and others said the mattress was too firm.

Financing Options Financing options are available for this mattress. Our Expert's Take We've mentioned many latex mattresses on this list, but let's talk about one of our favorite organic latex mattresses, the Avocado. The Avocado features Dunlop latex and pocketed coils, and like the Birch, it comes with an optional pillow-top. We reviewed the model with the pillow-top and found its pressure relief to be a good option for both back sleepers and side sleepers. We got all the support we needed, and the pillow-top relieved pressure on our shoulders and hips. However, if you sleep just on your stomach, we would recommend you opt for the model without the pillow-top. What We Love About the Avocado - The Avocado is a durable, long-lasting mattress. You're going to spend more upfront for the organic materials, but you will save money in the long run. If you buy a cheap foam mattress, you may have to replace it in just a few years, but that won't happen with the Avocado. - Hot sleepers, are your ears burning again? The Avocado is a latex hybrid and, yes, it is also a great cooling mattress. You won't be overheating whatsoever on the Avocado. - Support, thy name is Avocado. The mattress boasts individually-wrapped coils that are also zoned. That means you'll get support just where you need it. What to Keep in Mind About the Avocado - If you want a cheap mattress, keep looking. The Avocado isn't the most expensive mattress on the market, but it isn't the cheapest either. The Avocado might be too much for some budgets. - Do you like to feel like you are sleeping inside your mattress rather than on top of it? You won't get this sensation on the Avocado. It is bouncy and will make you feel like you are sleeping on top of the mattress, and this feel is not for everyone. - Heavy side sleepers might not get enough pressure relief on the Avocado. If you're in this group, you might \"bottom out\" on the mattress and feel some serious pressure on your shoulders and hips. Other User Reviews The Avocado is also a hit with other reviewers. Users gave the mattress a 4.7.5 on the [Avocado website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/shop/avocado-home/). Many said the pillow-top was just right for side sleeping and that the extra delivery service was worth it. Some who opted for the free shipping said their mattress was heavy and difficult to set up.

It has three different firmness levels to choose from, so it's easy to find a bed that suits your needs. If you're a back sleeper, we recommend the Medium model, as it offers nice support while still letting your hips sink in. We personally tested this model and also thought it worked for side sleeping. If you sleep on your stomach, however, we recommend the Firm model. What We Love About the Owl Natural Latex Hybrid - You can't beat the firmness options. Whatever position you sleep in, you'll be able to find the right firmness with one of the Owl models. - You'll bounce for this mattress. The Owl Natural Latex Hybrid features responsive coils and latex, so you'll never feel stuck or have trouble changing positions. - Let's do this one more time. It's another eco-friendly mattress and it got two thumbs up from third-party organic testers such as CertiPUR-US\u00ae and GOTS. What to Keep in Mind About the Owl Natural Latex Hybrid - You aren't going to get a memory foam feel with this mattress. At this point, you shouldn't be surprised, as most of these mattresses are bouncy and responsive. - And, budget is going to be an issue with the Nest Bedding too. If you don't have much money to spend right now, the Nest Bedding might be out of your price range. Other User Reviews Nest Bedding owners gave the Owl Hybrid an average score of 4.7/5 and, according to the [Nest Bedding website](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/shop/nest-bedding-natural-hybrid-latex/), 95% of Owl Hybrid owners keep their bed. Some said the mattress cured their back pain, and others said it is so comfortable, they hate to travel. However, some had trouble finding the right firmness for their situation.

This means the mattress is firmer toward the center and offers extra lumbar support. This is especially important if you struggle with back pain. The Oceano will help keep your spine in neutral alignment, and this can prevent and ease future back pain. In addition, this makes the Oceano a particularly good fit for back sleepers. When we tested the mattress, the zoning pressed up into our lumbar area while the mattress offered the perfect balance of comfort and support. However, if you sleep on your side, the Brentwood Home Oceano might not give you the pressure relief you require. What We Love About the Brentwood Home Oceano - Hot sleepers, we've got another one for you. The Brentwood Home Oceano contains wool, cotton, and gel-infused foam. These are all breathable materials that will keep you cool all night. - Stomach and back sleepers will get all the support they need on the Oceano. The mattress came in at a 7.5/10 during our tests, and this is a great fit for stomach sleepers and back sleepers who like something firmer. - While the mattress features memory foam, it is partly plant-based, making it more eco-friendly than many other memory foams. The mattress also contains organic materials like natural silk and wool. What to Keep in Mind About the Brentwood Home Oceano - If you're a lighter person, this might just be too much mattress for you. It is thick and firm and could be uncomfortable for you. - While it features memory foam, you are not going to sink in too far. If you like to feel a soft hug from your mattress, you'll want to look elsewhere. - Being a firmer mattress, the Brentwood Home Oceano is not a good match for side sleepers. If you sleep on your side, opt for a softer mattress with plush foam right on top. Other User Reviews Customers who bought the Brentwood Home Oceano scored it 4.6/5, which is a bit lower than some of the other customer scores on this list. However, on the [Brentwood Home site](https://www.mattressclarity.com/go/shop/brentwood-home-oceano-mattress-3/), many customers said the mattress helped with pain issues and was comfortable overall. Other customers complained that the mattress off-gassed for an extended period of time and that it was too firm.

So, what exactly are we talking about when we say \"organic mattress\"? Simply put, an organic mattress excludes harmful chemicals and is made of all-natural materials. Few mattresses are 100% all-natural, but many are made of natural, sustainably sourced materials like latex, cotton, and wool. Latex First off, we have [natural latex](https://www.mattressclarity.com/blog/natural-latex-made/) foam. When searching online for latex mattresses, you will come across two major types: Dunlop and Talalay. This refers to the process used to create the latex foam. Here's the difference between Dunlop vs. Talalay latex: - Dunlop - With Dunlop latex, the process is simple and straightforward. The liquid rubber is poured into a mold and fills it. It's placed in a vulcanization oven and then washed and dried. - Talalay - The liquid rubber is poured into a mold, but it doesn't fill it completely. The mold is then covered and vacuum pressure is applied until the liquid rubber fills the space. The mold is frozen and CO2 is pushed into the latex. The rest of the treatment is the same as Dunlop latex. Dunlop is typically denser than Talalay. This means a mattress made with Dunlop latex may feel firmer than a mattress made with Talalay latex. Organic Cotton Organic cotton is a major material found in organic mattresses, mostly in the cover. It differs from \"regular\" cotton because it doesn't come from genetically modified seeds, and when it's growing it's [not sprayed with chemical pesticides](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-66981-6_8). When organic cotton is treated and processed, manufacturers avoid harmful chemicals and dyes. Wool Wool is a natural material that is often found in the top layers of an organic mattress to add some plushness. It also acts as a natural fire retardant. Organic mattresses do not contain synthetic fire retardants we see in non-organic mattresses, but bwool meets federal fire retardant standards. What's Not in an Organic Mattress? With organic mattresses, it's more about what's not in them rather than what is. Many standard, non-organic mattresses often contain polyurethane foams, vinyl, and other synthetic materials. These are often treated with adhesives, dyes, and other harmful chemicals. That's why [memory foam mattress](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-memory-foam-mattress/) lovers may complain of \" [off-gassing](https://www.mattressclarity.com/blog/new-mattress-smell-mattress-off-gassing/)\" during the unboxing process. Unwrapping a bed can let loose VOCs ( [volatile organic compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8700805/)). These often smell unpleasant and can [cause nausea and headaches](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9373925/). Non-organic foam mattresses can contain other chemicals such as flame retardants that might have other adverse health effects. Keep reading to find out what types of materials are in organic mattresses, their benefits, and how to choose the best organic mattress. Organic vs Natural vs Sustainable \"Organic,\" \"natural,\" and \"sustainable\" are words with such a similar connotation that we often overlook their true meanings. It's important to understand the differences between these terms so you know what you're looking for and whether or not the product will satisfy. - Organic products are [certified organic by the USDA](https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-standards), and in order to be certified, they must be at least 95% organic. Truly organic products are placed under a number of strict standards that \"clean\" or \"non-toxic\" products are not required to undergo. - Natural products come from raw materials or other biological resources that are derived from nature. - Sustainable products are not only environmentally friendly, but remain so in the long-term. 3 Benefits of Organic Mattresses So, why should you consider buying an organic mattress? Organic and non-toxic mattresses come with a higher price point, but they are also a wise investment for several reasons. Organic Mattresses are Durable and Long-Lasting First off, organic mattresses are durable. Memory foam and polyfoam mattresses can sag after a short amount of time. Most organic mattresses contain latex, a very durable material that will not sag quickly. For some long-lasting options, check out our roundup for the [best mattresses that won't sag](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-mattresses-wont-sag/). Natural Materials Come with Natural Benefits Organic and non-toxic mattresses usually sleep cooler than other types of mattresses. Memory foam mattresses can contain chemicals that trap heat and cause sleepers to overheat. Latex is free of these chemicals and is a more breathable material. In addition, latex and other organic materials are antimicrobial and hypoallergenic, making them a good option for allergy sufferers. Check out [our guide on dust allergies](https://www.mattressclarity.com/sleep-resources/all-about-dust-allergies/) for more information. Organic Mattresses are More Sustainable Organic mattresses are better for the environment. Their materials and their production have less of a negative impact than standard non-organic mattresses. How to Choose an Organic Mattress So, you've decided a non-toxic, organic mattress is right for you. How can you make sure you're finding the perfect natural mattress for your specific situation? We'll go over all the factors you should keep in mind. Size This is something to consider when buying any type of mattress. We want to make sure our bed is big enough! At the same time, we don't want something so big that we're spending money on space we don't need. Shoppers who are trying to find the right size mattress for them should read our in-depth [mattress size guide](https://www.mattressclarity.com/resources/mattress-sizes/). Firmness and Sleeping Position Firmness is one of the main things to keep in mind when buying any mattress. People have different firmness preferences, but it also comes into play when we think about sleeping positions. If someone is a back sleeper, they should opt for a medium-firm mattress. Side sleepers should find something softer that offers better pressure relief, and stomach sleepers need a [firm mattress](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-firm-mattress/). Mattress Construction and Materials We discussed how the major materials found in organic mattresses are cotton, wool, and latex. However, there are numerous types of producers of these materials, so research to see how they're made and how they'll affect the mattress's performance. Some organic mattresses contain coils. These can add more support and breathability, so larger people and hot sleepers should keep them in mind. Durability Organic mattresses can be an investment and they're usually made to last. Do your research to see how durable their ideal mattress is. You can also check out our list of the [best mattresses for the money](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-mattress-for-the-money/) to see what organic mattresses are the best long-term investments. Budget Think about how the price corresponds to your budget. If the mattress costs more, ensure you're getting something that will last. For some of the best budget options on the market, take a look at our roundup for the [best mattresses under $1,000](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-mattress-under-1000/). Certifications Some companies falsely use the words \"organic\" and \"natural\" to describe their mattresses. To find out how organic a mattress is and if it's truly free of harmful chemicals, [make sure that it has been certified](https://www.mattressclarity.com/sleep-resources/mattress-certifications/) by these third-party organizations: [CertiPUR-US](https://certipur.us/) This isn't an organic certification, but it does measure what chemicals are in a mattress. A mattress that is CertiPur-US certified doesn't contain chemicals such as formaldehyde, heavy metals, PBDEs, and ozone depleters. In addition, this certification measures off-gassing to ensure that emissions are less than 0.5 parts per million. [OEKO-TEX Standard 100](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/our-standards/standard-100-by-oeko-tex) During this testing, they measure textiles for nickel, formaldehyde, and harmful dyes. There are [four classes of certifications](https://www.mattressclarity.com/sleep-resources/mattress-certifications/) categorizing who a mattress is made for and how close the textiles are to the sleeper's skin. With Class I certification, the textiles are fit for babies and infants younger than 36 months old. Class II applies to children and adults over 36 months. Class III means the textile is approved as pillow fill, and Class IV means the textile is approved but will not make contact with the sleeper's skin. [GOTS](https://global-standard.org/) and [ GOLS](https://www.naturepedic.com/gols?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=dynamic&utm_line=&utm_adgroup=&utm_content=c_&utm_term=&utm_location=9032866&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmPSSBhCNARIsAH3cYgaBC5CujqCx_QacHCHgsBj5J-GTsbw_y4cUTE-VtQFPTeQQr9G0fz4aAvVSEALw_wcB) These stand for Global Organic Textile Standard and Global Organic Latex Standard, respectively. GOTS certifies that material is at least 70% organic (this usually applies to cotton and wool). GOLS certifies mattresses as \"organic\" if the latex in a mattress is at least 95% organic. [Eco-Insitut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/) This German company tests mattress emissions to ensure they're safe for the environment and shoppers alike. They test for strong odors, heavy metals, and whether it's a [flame retardant mattress](https://www.mattressclarity.com/blog/flame-retardant/) or not. [USDA Organic](https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-standards) The good old USDA also gets involved with testing materials found in mattresses. These include cotton, wool, and latex. Some materials are certified 100% organic. If it's certified \"Organic,\" it's 95% organic, and if it's \"Made with Organic...\" that means it's at least 70% organic. [GREENGUARD Gold](https://www.ul.com/resources/ul-greenguard-certification-program) This is a very difficult certification to obtain. Their testing is more exacting and ensures that a product is safe for at-risk individuals such as the elderly or infants. [Cradle to Cradle](https://www.c2ccertified.org/get-certified/product-certification) They test products based on material health, material reuse, renewable and carbon management, water stewardship, and social fairness. They will then award five different achievement levels \u2014 Basic, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Organic Bedding and Pillows When it comes to organic products for the bedroom, it doesn't end with mattresses! [Organic cotton sheets](https://www.mattressclarity.com/bedding/sheets/best-organic-sheets/), mattress toppers, and an [organic pillow](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/best-organic-pillows/) can be a great addition to any eco-friendly sleeping space.
