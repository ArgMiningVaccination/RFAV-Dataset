Research suggests that integrated primary care provides a valuable service for patients, is rewarding for psychologists, and that healthcare providers are appreciative of quality behavioral health interventions. While integrated care offers numerous benefits to all involved, key challenges exist for mental health professionals who wish to work in the primary care arena. Chief among these challenges are learning to provide brief, short term interventions and working on timely, effective collaboration with medical providers. Key words : Primary Care, Integrated Primary Care Objectives: 1. Participants will lear n the origins of integrated care, the present state of practice, and the future trends that will impact the healthcare industry and psychology's role within the big picture. 2. Participants will increase their understanding of the types of interventions in integrated primary care settings. From various theoretical models, to the standard intake evaluation, all the way to the more time sensitive, problem - focused 20 minute intervention, and participants will learn brief strategies shown to help patients in a busy primary care setting. 3. Participants will learn about the value of consultation with the medical team in a primary care setting. From lunchtime rounds to curbside consultation with healthcare providers, the value of working side by side with medic al providers (e.g., doctors, nurses) will be explored.

From increased medical comorbidities to increased hospital utilization, prior studies have found that tobacco smoking puts patients at greater risk for problems and those patients who smoke are more likely to have to go to a hospital for their medical maladies. Psychologis ts can play a key role in helping patients cut back and eventually quit using tobacco helping them lead physically and mentally healthier lives. Key words : Tobacco Use, Smoking Cessation, Nicotine Dependence Objectives: 1. Participants will learn about the comorbidities of tobacco use and how one year of tracking comorbidities can demonstrate significant differences for smokers as compared to never smokers. 2. Participants will learn about the one year differences in hospital utilization rates for tobacco smo kers as compared to never smokers. 3. Participants will learn more about the relationship between tobacco smoking and propensity toward other addictions and behavioral health issues. 4.

Rates of child and adolescent obesity continue to climb across the United States with some government estimates indicating that 15% of our nation's youth are obese. Effective interventions exist for young patients, but many clinicians are hesitant to intervene for various reasons, including fear, personal discomfort, and issues regarding how to approach the topic delicately.

In addition, behavioral health professionals will learn how they can be part of the \"total package\" of treatment delivered by health care and mental health professionals for youth with obesity. Key words : Obesity, Overweight, Adolescence, Youth Objectives: 1. Participants will learn about child and adolescent obesity including the diagnostic criteria for overweight and obesity, a review of the problem's prevalence in youth, and markers that commonly differentiate youth with obesity from those with less ser ious weight issues. 2. Participants will increase their understanding about the treatment of child and adolescent obesity through discussion of the research on treating youth and families with serious weight problems. This includes the cognitive, behavioral, and medical interventions that have been found to be effective in helping youth with obesity. 3.

WVU PSYCHOLOGY INTER NSHIP LECTURES 2017 -2018 May ADHD -Dr. Fields Diagnosis, Treatment, Adult Course: Psychology Interns Topic: Adult ADHD in Primary Care Faculty: Scott Fields, Ph.D. Method : Didactic Presentation, Case Examples Emphasis: ADHD is a common childhood disorder affecting around 3 -7% of youth in the United States. Evidence indicates that about half of all children with ADHD continue to meet criteria for diagnosis into adulthood. In recent years, primary care clinics have seen an increase in adults presenting with ADHD symptoms. DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD are somewhat confusing as they are based primarily on child but not adult behavior. Physicians and behavioral health scientists have to adjust the criteria to accommodate adult occupational and educational roles. Assessment of ADHD in primary care consists of taking a thorough history, examining current behavioral markers, and administering brief screenings such as the Adult ADHD Checklist. Other screenings may be necessary to rule out anxiety or mood issues. Further examination by a neuropsychologist or psychiatrist may also be warranted. Physicians are often advised to use caution in prescribing psychostimulant medication to adult patients due a growing body of research indicating that diversion is an issue. Treatment t ypically consists of cognitive behavioral strategies, family involvement, medication, or a combination of the aforementioned. The role that physicians and behavioral health scientists play in the process of diagnosing and treating this disorder is integral in primary care. Key words : ADHD, Adult, Psychostimulants, Diversion Objectives: 1) Participants will learn about adult ADHD including the diagnostic criteria, a review of the problem's prevalence and markers that commonly differentiate this DSM -5 disorder from others. 2) Participants will increase their understanding about the treatment o f adult ADHD in a primary care setting through discussion of the research. Treatment options will include the cognitive, behavioral, family -based and medical interventions that have been found to be effective in helping treat adult ADHD. 3) Participants will learn how to collaborate as behavioral scientists in a primary care clinic to optimally treat adult ADHD.
