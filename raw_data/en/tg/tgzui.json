I priced all the items I would need to make the food myself and found Honest Kitchen's food was cheaper. Now they really had my attention. I began with a few samples from their direct website. My dogs ate it like it was a treat; a reaction I'd only previously received when feeding them salmon or peanut butter. So I shopped around for the best price and landed here on Amazon with the subscribe and save delivery.\" - Anna, Amazon Reviewer Shop [The Honest Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/20640572011) AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT 3 of 8 Nom Nom Now Best for: Fresh food subscription Type: Weekly meal subscription consisting of fresh (meaning gently cooked) whole-food and human-grade ingredients that are formulated for your pet by a veterinary nutritionist, made to order in the U.S., and delivered to your doorstep (not frozen).

After that, I set up my deliveries every two weeks (you can do any delivery time frame you want) and we will be sure not to run out again! Not only does my dog love it, but he is also in the best health of his life. After struggling with allergies, anxiety, ear infections, and kidney stones I was willing to try anything. I came across Darwin's while I was doing hours and hours of research and reading online and I will never go back to anything else now. We had a small window of a few days before I got the schedule figured out where I had to buy some other brands of raw food at a local pet store, no shade but they just weren't Darwin's that's for sure. Happy customer and even happier pupper over here.\" - Bailee Lene Lawson, Darwin's Natural Pet Products Reviewer Shop [Darwin's](https://www.darwinspet.com/) 5 of 8 Nature's Logic Best for: Frozen raw food Type: Frozen patties made from an all-natural blend of 90% raw protein plus fruit and vegetable concentrate that, while gluten- and legume-free, contain whole grains \u2014 [a dietary choice in line with DCM](https://www.natureslogic.com/dcm/)(canine dilated cardiomyopathy).

And he absolutely LOVES both the chicken and the beef!\" - RTVGal2, Chewy Reviewer Shop [Nature's Logic](https://www.chewy.com/brands/natures-logic-7091) for: Wet-canned food Amazon's affordable in-house pet brand offering grain-free and protein-first with nutrient-rich vegetables and no added corn or soy ingredients, all crafted in the U.S. Budget: $19.99 for a 12-pack of 13.2 oz (that's around $1.67 per can). Owner Praise: \"I'm so pleased Amazon came out with Wag canned food. I'm a huge fan of the puppy dry food for my growing Mastiffs. I have been using a canned 95 percent chicken to add to the food but it is VERY expensive. I was hoping Amazon would expand the Wag line and they did. We have the chicken stew and lamb stew now and my boys eat it right up. Each can is filled to the top with meat there are veggies and sauce but they are not the star. This is not a can of sauce and veggies with a couple of bits of meat it is the opposite. Great deal easy-open cans no opener needed. It meets AAFCO and has no fillers. I am a fan as are my dogs.\" - Kia Fennell, Amazon Reviewer Shop [Wag](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/20698118011) 7 of 8 Instinct Best for: Dry + freeze-dried raw food Type: Top-rated food brand on Chewy that elevates grain-free dry food with a combination of protein-first and cage-free, freeze-dried raw ingredients made in the U.S. Budget: Ranging from $16.99 for 4 lbs to $46.96 for 21 lbs.

Owner Praise: \"Our dog LOVES this food! She can't wait for mealtime and dances until we can get the bowl down. She empties her dish in about a minute! She never ate any of the other dog food like that. We like that its freeze-dried rather than dehydrated, so the nutrients and flavors aren't affected. Healthy ingredients and farm-to-food processing make this the perfect dog food for our fur baby! It is a little on the pricey side, but we don't mind paying a bit more for the quality.\" - Michael, Amazon "}
