Aunt Julia wanted her story to be shared. How did this optimistic, clean living, spiritual woman develop stage four cancer in her early 70's? Although no one can tru- ly define and know the physical, mental and emotional path of another, there were significant physical clues. Aunt Julia was the first to agree that emotions play a part in health and being so very human, she shared hurts and disappointments like the rest of us on her amazing journey. All of these she handled with grace and without unnecessary blaming of self and others. In other words, she was balanced and graceful. She did live for many years with a loving and wonderful husband who preceded her in death and didn't maintain the same natural health principles as her. He did smoke outdoors, and even still, this probably played a role in her health. Far more interesting, however, was the fact that their home in Beal City, Michigan, was literally on top of farm fields that were heavily treated with fertiliz- ers and more. When Aunt Julia's water was tested, it was found to contain items it shouldn't. For example, the US government suggests that drinking water have a nitrate level of 2.3 or less and hers was 12.0. Addition- ally, the arsenic level was extremely high. When we read the description of a person affected by arsenic, she was astonished to discover her late husband had every one of the symptoms before his death, and she had several. She immediately took action and had her water cleaned and purified by Owens Soft Water of Clare. The state of her water was so poor, it took 3 additional cleaning tanks to get the numbers down into what the Owner of Owens Soft Water would drink himself. For several years prior to this, she had been buying her drinking water and bringing it home in plastic jugs. That, itself, can be a problem due to lacking standards in bottled water and the fact that most plastic jugs con- tain antimony, another toxic contributor to cancers. Although she was not 'drinking' this high nitrate and arsenic water, she was still bathing in it, and your skin is like a sponge to toxins in your water. Aunt Julia was One would love to write about the coming summer and what we will be planting in the garden along with some tasty recipes to try, and yet, that doesn't seem as prudent as the topic of cancer. For several years, this topic of interest has grown through care and concern for loved ones, neighbors and friends. Now, these concerns seem to be everywhere and all the time. What's happening? Is it truly on the rise? What can and should we be doing about it, no matter what our age or belief or how healthy we think we are? This January, my beautiful Aunt Julia passed away to farther shores and will be greatly missed. This issue of NITE Light is dedicated to her and her in- credible life of joy, optimism, spirituality and hope for a bright future. Aunt Julia was the first 'employee' of herbs etc back in 1995. Wow, twenty years ago! She was a delight to work with and well loved and appreciated by our growing customer and client base. Aunt Julia worked at the counter an- swering questions, looking up remedies and encour- aging the public to come to our free classes. She was great with color, sound and healing touch work. When my oldest son Christian was born, she helped us to raise him in the store and keep all aspects of what was to become herbs etc , NITE and NCC growing and becoming. Last year, despite a healthy and positive life -style that would put the average health awareness person striving to be more like her, she discovered she had cancer and was given a short and limited list of op- tions. She believed in her body as a temple and be- gan an incredible journey into healing using natural remedies. We completely supported her decision to remove the initial cancer by surgery; this was a wise step in her plan. From there, her and my beautiful mother, her sister, would spend the next year im- proving an already incredible diet, intensifying a great herbal and supplement program, including body work, essential oils, homeopathy, light therapy, enzymes, metabolic and blood type focused foods, P A G E 3 for Aunt Julia by Bessheen Baker, ND Naturopathic Views on Preventing Cancer 1. Choose the emotions and attitudes that heal. 2. Forgiveness dissolves lumps and growths. 3. Love yourself; it gives your immune system a reason to protect you. 4. Be grateful; it changes your cellular vitality in a way that prevents all illness. 5. Choose the foods that you inherently know are good for you. 6. Make certain that your primary source of drinking and bathing water is purified. 7. Get rid of commercial personal care prod- ucts and switch to organic right away. 8.

Learn and develop a deep breathing routine for 10 minutes per day. 11. Read new materials that please and uplift you even if they are by audio. 12. Eat organic and/or local foods whenever possible. 13. Reduce time in front of computers, TV's, cell phones; use protective devices to re - duce electromagnetic frequency exposure. 14.

Laugh much and often. so motivated to share this information that she wrote letters and sent them to her neighbors. She knew that even 5, 10 and 15 miles from farm fields and other factors were a good reason to have your water checked. The sad news is that in the past few seasons, 6 of her neighbors have died from cancers. As I am saddened for my grandmother, mother and all of my Aunt Julia's family in her premature death, it is important to follow through on her desire to make people aware of two important things. Even a person with a healthy lifestyle has to consider all avenues that affect their health: not just food, but water, personal care products, our jobs and what they expose us to. Also, the need to do regular cleanses and essentially all the principles that natural health has encouraged us to look at. Most especially, Aunt Julia wanted us to remember the importance of nourishing our spiritual life. Releasing and forgiving the hurts of the past, not just being spiritual but studying it, grow- ing, and learning the layers of our beautiful creations from the inside out. She believed that spirituality is a continuous path of discovery. It was her stories of miracles and angels that encouraged me to seek a deeper and more meaningful understanding of spiritu- ality when I first began my pursuit of knowledge in health and wellness. When natural health was thought of as \"new age\" as opposed to the forgotten wisdom of the past, Aunt Julia stood by my side and hoped for a more aware future. Now, look how many people benefit from using God intended remedies. It is my hope that Aunt Julia has fully realized what an incredibly important role she played in the develop- ment of the Naturopathic Institute from which she graduated, inspired and spiritually influenced what it has become today: a beacon of hope. Thank You, Aunt Julia. What about you and your family? Where are the de- generative diseases within your inner circle? What can you do to make a significant difference now? Here are our top ideas for preventing, reversing and healing the challenges that are certainly occurring around you. Essential Oils Explode in Popularity Coconut Oil Dissolves Age Spots Now, more than ever before, it seems that friends, family and co -workers are familiar with, if not pretty darn good at, the use and application of essential oils. This is great news for everyone! More people are empowered to help them- selves by preventing illness and solving simple ailments. If we had two simple wishes as natural health consultants, it would be that all the new folks would learn less is more and trust that there are many uses to each essential oil. It seems with so many people now using oils compared to the past, that the market is having a hard time keeping up. The ever popular Young Living Oils is experiencing major growing pains and is having trouble meeting all the orders. We actually anticipate the same problems for other companies that branched off this company. Our advice: use your oils sparingly, be patient as all suppliers are working hard to meet demand, and finally, be willing to use different oils that are not as trendy and may be just as effective or even more effective if well chosen. Learn to use more oils by attending the seminar on February 28th taught by Dr. Baker. This class features Uttati single oils and blends. The blends are divided into those for personal care, medicine, perfumery, beautification, meditation and seduction! The owner of Uttati Oils taught the founder of Young Living the art of es- sential oils. Dr. Baker attended multiple classes with this Egyptian Instructor, and now, for the first time ever, she is bring- ing the training directly to you.

This replenished their brains with the good fat that they used dur- ing the school day. The more we have taken the good fats away, the more fat we have become. But it doesn't stop there. Our brains are dri- er and our nerves, too. Our skin is so dry, it cracks and bleeds, our bowels lack lubrication, and we have trouble with our hormones and joints which are made from good fats. Look for a class this fall on the Saturday Semi- nar schedule called the Big Fat Lie by Kathryn Doran -Fisher ND. Maybe, we should reconsider where fear mongering has led us astray and get a good lube job by having good fats and oils in our diet and even on our skin! It's time to smother the butter and coconut our cracks! Ray and Liz Yanok showed me their disappearing age spots from rubbing coconut oil into their skin. I was so delighted, we decided to share the idea with all of you! Over the past five years, we received one good story after another about coconut oil and its many benefits. It delights us to hear all your crea- tive uses for this very necessary item. We need to return to using saturated fats as our friend rather than an enemy. We became so fearful of fat due to our rising troubles with heart disease that we threw the baby out with the bath water. Now, people of every age suffer from good fat deficiencies. Years ago, a Sunday supper included a fresh chicken or other good meats, and the gravy and fats/ lard were then used in cooking throughout the week. Pie crust was N I T E L I G H T P A G E 4 Herbs for Tumors and Growths All Cell Detox - This is by far one of my favorite choices for getting rid of potential growth and tumor problems. This formula contains 17 herbs that are synergistically combined to clean the body at the cellular lev- el! The key areas to be cleaned include the liver, kidneys, blood and lymph. Our observations over the past several years have also led us to consider it for psoriasis, female growths, endometriosis, headaches, migraines, parasite problems and much more. The great thing about All Cell Detox is that it is a gentle cleanser, allowing new and experi- enced herbalists and clients to benefit with its unique combination of herbs without being concerned about extreme healing or cleansing responses. You do not have to be concerned about having a tumor or growth to use it. It's simply a great gentle and thorough cleanser. It could also be used as a spring cleanse to help the liver after a long winter. It's great for teens with acne and husbands that need a cleanse but want a very simple approach. You can take it for months at a time. For example, 2 capsules 2 times a day for 3 to 6 months. Super ORAC - This super antioxidant blend is some- thing that I consume daily! An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure! The ingredients in this blend are especially effective for keeping the brain young, capable and vibrant. Resveratrol is one of its key in- gredients and is backed by plenty of research on its ability to keep cells from being damaged by pollution, internal toxins, aging, weakened DNA and much more. With the increase in neurological disorders, including diseases like Parkinson's, ALS, MS, Alzheimer's and more, I am starting the prevention now! We are all exposed to increased toxicity from electron- ic devices, cell phones, computers, I -pads/pods, GPS and other equipment. Because of this formula's ability to get through the blood/brain barrier, we consider it essential to brain concerns. Even one per day is a great start on prevention and up to 4 per day if a significant concern already exists. Since taking it Consistently, I have experienced, better clarity, being less tongue -tied, and improved memory and creativity! E Tea - This blend has a unique history. It is also called Essiac formula: a \"cancer\" remedy given to a nurse named Cassie (Essiac is Cassie spelled backward) by a Native American culture. This formulation was very successful at helping with growths, tumors and other degenerative con- ditions. Four well chosen herbs were brewed and taken between meals 2x per day or more. People still make use of this great formula, often collecting the bulk herbs and cooking it down themselves. Nature's Sunshine gets the highest quality herbs, pre -prepares them and puts them in a capsule form. This greatly reduced the work of the client who may be in a weakened state or have a daily task list of juicing and other preparations that are very time consum- ing. Therefore, having this well respected remedy ready in capsule form guarantees high quality and ease of work to consume it. We like it for all abnormal cells but especially find it good for blood abnormalities, lymph concerns, bladder, bladder, brain and bone issues. SC Formula - This is a capsule of powdered shark cartilage! That's right, it has been discovered that Sharks Don't Get Cancer, and there is even a book with that exact title explaining the research and success of this unique remedy. When you first open this bottle of capsules, you are pretty sure there is a fish inside; it smells a bit pungent. But what would you be willing to do to cut off the blood and oxy- gen supply to a growth or tumor? That is just one of the ways in which shark cartilage works. There are far more detailed explana- tions available in the book or articles on line. It provides ingredients that allow our own chemistry to stop the growth of the ab- normal cells. We have had good success using the SC Formula on solid tumors, especially those of the lungs and brain. Understand that using more than one of the remedies listed on these two pages may be necessary to make a significant impact. See- ing a good consultant will help you to deter- mine which ones are beneficial to your spe- cific concerns. It is not uncommon to make use of 3 or 4. Four other remedies to consid- er are Whole Leaf Aloe Vera, Pau D Arco, Paw Paw Cell Regulator and Protease Plus.

This is an adaptation of Joyce's 10 page story. After I lost some weight using the Eat to Live food program, and ate a lot of organic vegetables, I didn't want to use chemicals to color my hair anymore! I started dying my hair in 2007. At that time, my hair started to show a little white. I didn't want to col- or it but was embarrassed to give seminars on health products when I felt I should look younger. I didn't know that the more I colored my hair, the more it would turn white and even faster than before. In the beginning, I only needed to color it once in two months. Later, it became once a month, and then, twice a month. At first, one bottle of dye could be used for 3 or 4 times, and then, 2 or 3 times, until only 1 time. My hair roots were snow white on top of my head! I stopped putting dye on my hair at the end of April 2014 and started combing my hair using a wooden comb. I talk to my mom by computer with a picture once a week. She is 85 years old now. She is in China, and I don't see her very often. One time when I was visiting with my mom, my 3rd elder sister came to visit my mom, she talked with me, and I saw her hair was all black. I asked her if she colored her hair. She said no, she has never col- ored her hair, because she doesn't like chemicals. But when I had visited China in 2012, her hair was white; in less than 2 years, her hair was almost all black again. She told me she combs her hair 50 times every day. She demonstrated how she combed her hair 50 times in front and 50 times in back. She also used fresh ginger slices to rub on the hair roots, maybe once a month. She did it for a year; she learned this from a Chinese health TV program. She was so happy that she got a full head with natural black hair at age 60! I follow her ways, and maybe, my hair can turn to black also. Restore Your Natural Hair Color with a Comb! P A G E 9 Actually, this wasn't the first time to see someone have a full head of thick and black hair just by combing the hair. About 5 years ago, while attending a wedding, I saw a lady in front of me had thick and black hair wrapped as a bun on the back of her head. I thought, they are colored or fake hairs. After the wedding ceremo- ny, I went to talk to her and commented on her beautiful hair. She was so happy to hear comments, and she untied her hair, I was so shocked, because her hair was so long, it reached her knee! I asked her if the hair was all her own hair or not, and she said yes. I asked what kind of products she used to grow such abundant and natural hair. She told me she was 60 years old. She said she did- n't used any \"special\" products, she just combed her hair more. She reached to her purse and took a wooden comb out and then, showed me how to comb her hair. She bent her head forward first, and then, let the hair hang in the air, and then, she started to comb her hair. She combed it about 30 to 40 times, and then, she raised up her head and pulled the hair back to her head, and combed her hair for another 30 - 40 times. I was so surprised to see that she dared to comb her hair so many times without being afraid of losing her hair. I asked if she was afraid to lose her hair by combing it so many times, and she said no. As a matter of fact, she didn't lose hair, but her hair grew more and more, thicker and thicker, darker and darker. She was living in New York at the time. She said the pho- tographers in N.Y. took many of photos of her hair, because not many people at age 60 could still own such luscious thick and long natural black hair. She encouraged me to comb my hair, not color it. I came home and tried to comb my hair as she did for a week and then, gave it up, because I saw my hair falling out more when- ever I combed my hair that many times. I would rather have my colored hair than less hair or no hair at all. I have two witnesses in my life, and after I lost some weight, I had the confidence and curiosity to take the adventure and go with this hair experiment on my hair. So, on the day I was supposed to col- or my hair, I didn't do it, and let the white roots show. On the 3rd day without touching up my roots, a friend came to visit me. After seeing my hair, she was so shocked. Her eyes were wide open, her mouth dropped, and her face was frozen. I thought she would have a heart attack. After a while, I heard her say: \"I have known you for almost 15 years, and I didn't know you have so much white hair!\" In order to save her and other friends who haven't noticed my white hair from possible shock, I found a square of silk scarf and wrapped my hair. However, this caused another prob- lem: some friends get curious about my wrapped hair; they were wondering what was wrong with my hair. I guess we are used to seeing people who have chemo and lost their hair, so they wrap their heads with scarves or wear hats. I remembered on 5/16/14, I had class at NITE school, and we had Evaluation and Assessment class with Dr. Baker. She asked me why I wore a scarf on my head, she was so concerned about me. I just laughed and ex- plained to her the reasons, and she was curious about it and insist- ed to see my white hair. I took off my scarf and she saw it. By that time, there was some black hair growing among the white hair, and I was so happy about it. I showed her the wooden comb and explained and gave a demo as how to comb my hair. She was very interested in it. After that, every time I went to school, she had me remove my scarf and see the progress on my hair. She was very impressed with the progress she saw. In September, she asked Darryl at herbs etc to order some wooden combs, and on 9/21/14 for my last class, I checked the store: the wooden combs were sold out! Dr. Baker asked me to write something about combing the hair, why to use wooden combs, and how to comb the hair. Days I Put Ginger Root Juice On My Hair : 5/13/14 - 3rd time 6/20/14 - 4th time 6/30/14 - 5th time 7/29/14 - 6th time 10/19/14 - 7th time 10/30/14 - 8th time My hair went from all white at the beginning, and then, turned gray, now, mostly black. Even the few white ones are not snow white any more, but more grayish. Why should we comb the hair for more than 20 times a day? When we comb the hair, we stimulate the blood circulation, and blood will flow to the hair root, feed the root, and get rid of the waste, make the hair grow with the natural color and reduce the chance of losing hair. Usually, when we comb our hair, we do it in a hurry, and comb only a few times, maybe less than 10 times for a woman. I know some men will not even comb their hair eve- ry day; maybe, this is one of the reasons some men lose their hair! When we comb our hair more, we make the meridians flow freely, let the chi and blood go through very well, make our head relaxed, our eyes clear, and our ears can hear better. It calms the mind and liver, it can help with the faintness, headache, ear ringing, insom- nia, migraine, and depression, etc. Comb the hair more times; it can stimulate the acupuncture pres- sure points and the meridians, working similar to acupuncture on the head. It can help relieve the fatigue and tiredness, keep the mind calm or relaxed. What kind of combs are the good ones? The quality of the wooden combs can have significant effects on the health of our hair. Choose the combs that have even and com- plete \"teeth,\" have the right width between each tooth, the space is not too narrow, and not too wide, just right. The end of the teeth will not be too sharp; otherwise, it will scratch the skin and may cause injury. For long curly hair, choose combs that have wider teeth, so the comb can go through the hair smoothly without tan- gling the hair. You want to comb the head, not just the hair! Method 1: From the back to front. Bend your head forward, let the hair to fall to the front, and start from the back of the head, from the base of the skull. Comb about 50 times on the right side, and then, the left side 50 times, include the middle (the governing meridian). If there is any soreness or pain blockage on the head, comb more and a little bit harder, but not so it hurts. Comb the hair, use even pressure, not hurtful, but feels warm, comfortable. Method 2: Sideways: part the hair in the middle of the head, comb to each side, left and right, until it feels warm and comforta- ble on the head . Method 3: From front to back: pull all of the hair to the back of the head, comb from the front to the back of the head. Start from the middle, the governing meridian, which will help with dizziness headaches, and provide more energy. A great picture of Joyce at an herb class; she is chopping Joan Prentice graduated from Delta College with an Associate's Degree in Nursing and went on to earn her Bachelor's Degree in Nursing. She says that her life dream was to help others live a healthy lifestyle. However, she found that nursing was not the way for her to live her dream. As a nurse, she saw the focus of healthcare change from prevention to concern for the bottom dollar. Her opportunities at the bedside of patients for teaching steadily declined, and she spent the last 20 years of her nursing career in management on Med- ical/Surgical, Surgical and Infection Pre- vention. (She shares that this was her train- ing for having her own business.) \"He got my attention!\" Joan's interest in natural health began in the early 1990's when her family began seeing a chiropractor who used muscle response testing and nutritional supple- ments to address health concerns. As a result of visiting this chiropractor, her youngest daughter's recurrent ear infections completely resolved. Then, Joan, herself, had success when she experienced relief from severe PMS. While visiting the chiropractor, they would watch natural health videos that were playing in his office. Joan says, \"He got my attention!\" Having since passed, Joan relays that she truly misses him. However, from that point on, Joan read and watched as much material as she could relating to natural health and became a Light Healing Touch Practitioner and a Reiki Master/Teacher. One day, while waiting to see her new chiropractor, she was reading the Natural Awakenings mag- azine and found the advertisement for the Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Ed-ucation. On her way home from a nursing conference, she stopped, on a whim, to visit the school. Joan says she felt welcomed even though she had stopped in without an appointment. Her search was over. After reviewing the program and considering her learning style, she felt like she was where she should be. Joan graduated from NITE as a Certified Naturopath and Board Certified Naturopathic Doctor in 2010. By then, she had already started her own business seeing clients, and her goal was to reach Manager level with Nature's Sunshine by the time of graduation so that she could move the business out of her home. Successfully reaching her goal, Joan opened an office in Alpena. She says that in the beginning, she saw a need to carry certain items that she liked to recommend that weren't available in the area. Look Here Every Issue for NITE Graduates Spotlight on Alumni ... ...Joan Prentice, ND of Northern Michigan Slowly, her store grew from carrying Black Cherry Juice Concentrate and Organic Pineap- ple Juice to full shelves of Nature's Sunshine products, Bach and North American Flower Essences, Homeopathics, Cell Salts, Young Living Essential Oils, Organic Maple Syrup, and her own Raw Honey, Sprouting Seeds, and more. Joan currently sees clients three days a week and works her retail store during her lunches and all day on Friday. She feels blessed to have six clients that have been with her from the beginning of her natural health training that started in 2006. Following graduation, Joan asked herself, \"Okay, now what area am I to focus on?\" In her practice, she works with diet changes, essential oils, flower essences, herbs, multiple forms of energy work, and looks at the emotional side of health. Her client's issues have included the loss of a significant other or spouse from death or divorce, addictions, stress and anxiety, panic attacks, post - traumatic stress, and depression. Joan finds it ironic that most dis -ease is based on unresolved or suppressed emotions and the food we consume, because it takes her back to her original goal when she became a nurse: prevention. When asked how her life had changed by becoming a naturopath, Joan's response was \"how had it not changed?\" She feels her life has forever changed emotionally, physically, and spiritually. She says that she came into the first year program carry- ing the weight of world, emotionally bro- ken, and afraid of her ability to succeed. She has \"learned it's okay to have duality in feelings, to speak up for myself and ac- cept myself and others for who and where they are. I have a wealth of knowledge from my life experiences to share with those ready to learn.\" Joan welcomes cur- rent and future students to the world of nat- ural health: \"Your life will be forever changed, maybe not in the same ways as mine, but changed nonetheless. God bless and keep each of you.\" ~Joan L. Prentice, RN, ND, CMT, Reiki Master/Teacher 200 E. Chisholm St. Alpena, MI 49744 NITE's 20 Year Anniversary/ Homecoming June of 2016 brings our first annual Natural Health Conference! The theme will be \"Raising Healthy Children and Keeping Them Healthy.\" The conference was originally planned for June 5th thru 7th of 2015. However, the speakers we wanted are in such high demand that they need to be scheduled at least 18 months in advance! Therefore, to make this the best conference ever, we decided to wait until next year and build up the momentum. Here's a sneak peak preview. A trade show of numerous vendors including opportunities for our students and alumni throughout the state to promote their businesses will be open. Additionally, various companies with natural remedies, EMF devic- es, foods, spices, CSA's, organic products galore, clothing and more will be demonstrating and selling their goods. Nationally renowned speakers will cover pertinent topics within their field of expertise, while incredible instructors will offer breakouts ses- sions on numerous topics including: Homeopathy, Herbology, Aroma Therapy, Bodywork, Midwifery, Child Rearing, and so much more. We will feature a timely documen- tary over the lunch break in the main auditorium on both Saturday and Sunday. Both features are in- cluded in your conference pass. Throughout the conference, great food will be available and local ac- commodations will be available at a discounted group rate. Mark your calendar and be ready to participate. The Natural Health Event of the Year! June 3rd - June 5th, 2016 It's been an amazing twenty years of non stop adventure. To celebrate, we are having a Homecoming Out- ing! Every alumni of every pro- gram is welcome, all students, in- structors past and present are also invited to attend. The celebration will take place at the Ranch on Friday and Saturday, June 5th and 6th, 2015. Campers by tent or trailer are welcome to stay, rooms will be available at the insti-tute and space is available in the cabin at the ranch as well. Our first goal is to get together for quality time, great food and stories. There will be opportunities for group discussions, updates on fields of study lead by instructors and alumni and just plain fun. Prizes will be given and games will be played, a hayride, good music and a great fire will occur on both evenings. Campers are welcome to stay through Sunday and enjoy the woods, gardens, nearby river, river rafting and plenty more. If there is a student or alumni that has moved or is not currently in contact with the Institute, would you be so kind as to pass the invita- tion on to them! RSVP's will be helpful so that we can pass on more details. The ranch will be providing organic eggs and meat for meals as well as service wear and some beverages. There will be a large potluck on Saturday for lunch. We sincerely Huge Natural Health Conference 2016 NITE Herbal Revisions & Faculty Departments After twenty years of constant changes and improvements to the Institute's core program, there is always room to grow and expand. So, this past October, during the annual instructor conference, we revamped, rewrote, organized and improved every aspect of the 6 programs taught at the Institute. The first improvement was to unite all 19 instructors by creating departments and deciding which faculty members would serve on each department. This may sound simple at first, but when one con- siders that all the instructors teach on independent weekends away from each other you can see the challenge of making certain the materials flow from one class to another. And, that was the very challenge that Dr. Baker, our Director of Education, and Amy Jo Howard, our Asst. Director of Edu- cation, presented to the instructing staff. We are creating not only a smooth transition from level one courses to level two courses but al- so a bridge from topic to topic. It is very important to create a strong foundation in our curricu- lum: a foundation that allows a student to take further classes at the Institute and other higher learning facilities without fear of not know- ing and understanding key concepts to build from. What has always and will continue to be great about the Institute is our ability to present multiple fields of study with great cohesiveness while still allowing for various theories, views and experiences through our materials and instructing staff. Now, with the faculty members closely comparing teaching materi-als and attending each others' clas- ses, we are able to repeat core mate- rials in a way that brings confidence and not be redundant in areas that are easy to understand. It is also agreed amongst the in- structing staff that the students are arriving with more and more of a foundation in natural health than in the early years when it was not common knowledge. This is excit- ing and challenges us to continually evolve the program. We have learned so much about teaching and pioneering a school of natural health in the 21st century that now, with twenty years under our belt, we know the next twenty will be even more amazing! The first area for improvement was a complete revamping of the herbal program with additional classes, research portions, hands on, multi- ple instructors per session in the advanced classes and more time outside! The classes have been re- named to better suit their topics and course descriptions will quickly be available on the web site. Current students will have no scheduling or course material conflicts. Every- thing is ready to roll for 2015 and beyond. The nutrition and food classes changed and increased to meet the challenge of our modern food crisis. Sounds hopeful and yummy! So, thank you to our amazing stu- dents, alumni, past and current in- structors for seeing this incredible challenge through and to our Direc- tor of Administration, Julie Wagester, for giving us the guid- ance and format to see it through! The departments and faculty mem-bers are listed to the right. Biology Department Faculty: Bessheen Baker, Dara Clark, Heather Dexter, Kathryn Doran -Fisher, Amy Jo Howard Body Work Department Faculty: Michelle Barber, Bonnie Engels, Amy Jo Howard, Laura Johnson, Christina Roy Doula Department Faculty: Bessheen Baker, Beth Barbeau, Heather Baker, Michelle Dara Clark, Heather Dexter, Amy Jo Howard, Beth Barbeau, Diane Sack Herbology and Plant Essences Department Faculty: Nia Aguirre, Bessheen Baker, Jan Doerr, Amy Jo Howard, Suzy Sikora History, Law & Current Events Department Faculty: Bessheen Baker, Amy Jo Howard, Nicole Paquin Homeopathy Department Faculty: Jackie Featherly, Amy Jo Howard Nutrition Department Faculty: Bessheen Baker, Kathryn Doran -Fisher, Nancy Fodor, Barb Nurenberg The governing, both bladder and both gall bladder meridians, all five run through the head. When we comb the hair, we help all five of these meridians which improves digestion, prevents colds and flu, helps with urinary concerns and restlessness. Clearing these will also help with more energy in the day time and better sound sleep in the night. Warning: Don't comb your hair right after a big meal; it will affect your digestion. Because when you comb your hair, the blood will rush to the head, and there will be less blood for diges- tion. Do not use too much pressure or comb for too long a time, this can all damage your hair. Moderation is key. If you have long or curly hair, when combing the hair, do not forcefully pull or tear the hair, it can break or damage the hair. Dandruff Treatments If you have the itchy condition of the scalp, the top layer of the skin sheds the dead cells at a faster rate than normal. The old skin is like white flakes in the hair or on the clothes. Some skin problems are a sign of the body out of balance, not in the best health condition. Too much junk food and vitamin and good fat deficiencies may cause this problem. Staying up too late, insomnia, too much hot or spicy foods, using the wrong kind of shampoo or conditioner will also make dandruff. At fall and winter, when the weather is getting cold, we will have higher chance of dandruff. When we use the electric hair dryer to dry out hair, the water evaporates faster, we lose too much water, and this may cause the inflammation of the scalp and cause more dandruff on the head. We may dry our hair naturally or use the electric dryer to blow it half dry and then, massage some hair oil or lotion into the scalp. This will prevent the dandruff. We can also use bitter herbs internally, such as dandelion or gen- tian to help the detox process. Nettle and burdock can be used as well. All of these can be found in a blend called Liver Cleanse. For immediate get -rid-of dandruff, here are three ideas: This method is good for dry hair: 30 drops of sandalwood essential oil 30 drops of rosemary essential oil 1/4 cup of herbs etc house base oil blend Mix them together, shake well and massage the mixture into the scalp. Leave it for half an hour, and then, shampoo. Repeat this routine every time you wash your hair, and make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly after using the oils to remove any loosened skin cells. This method is good for oily hair: 2 T of pure water 1 T of white vinegar Mix them together. After wash and dry the hair, massage this mix- ture into scalp, and let hair dry naturally. This method is good for yeast based dandruff: 1 fresh onion, use its juice. Massage into the scalp, wait for a few minutes and then, wash it off with clean water. Yeast imbalances can also be helped with the herb Pau D Arco internally and consider some probiotics (friendly bacteria). Hair Loss We lose a small amount of hair every day, it's normal; but if we lose a lot of hair, it is abnormal. It may be due to poor general health, stress, hormones or genetic factors. The best treatments are hair lotions that stimulate blood flow to the scalp and the roots of the hair. Increased circulation provides the hair with nutrients and helps it to grow. A traditional recipe for hair loss treatment: 20 drops of rosemary oil 20 drops of lavender oil 2 T of nettle tincture 1/3 c. of pure water Mix them together, massage well into the scalp at night, and use for long term. herbs etc has also had great success with the Nature's Fresh en- zyme spray on the head morning and night!

Now in Stock Natural Combs and Brushes Get 10% off When You Say \"Thanks, Joyce\" Just a few generations ago, most people used home remedies when their children were sick. The allopa- thic doctor was called upon only when the problem was serious or failed to respond to these home remedies. Today, few parents know how to use home remedies. Most take their children to the doctor for relatively be- nign ailments like colds, flu and tummy aches. 8 Great Liquid Herbal Remedies Here are a few herbal products that are safe to use with children when you follow the dosage guidelines in the next column. ALJ Liquid: Expectorant and decongestant for sinus congestion, coughs, colds and flu. It also helps to reduce reactions when children have food sensitivities. Catnip and Fennel: A traditional blend for colic and indigestion in infants and children. CC-A with Yerba Santa: A top choice for cold and respiratory infections whether viral or bacterial. Echinacea/Goldenseal: Antibacterial blend helpful for digestive infections and sinus or respiratory infections with yellow or greenish colored mucus. Lobelia Essence: Antispasmodic to ease pain from muscle tension, helpful for croupy cough and opening respiratory passages in asthma. Small doses of 3 to 5 drops are best. Stress J: A relaxing nervine formula suitable for chil- dren. Also helps soothe any kind of inflammation, es- pecially of the digestive tract. Ultimate Echinacea: Great for boosting the immune system during the cold and flu season. Also helpful for bacterial infections and treatment of wounds. Distress Remedy: A top seller! Helps with emotional upset, anger, fear or sadness. Eases shock and stress in traumatic situations. Can also be applied topically. Generally, a squirt for the parent is a good idea too. Can stabilize anxiety and depression as well. Remedies for Specific Conditions Allergies: Understanding that all allergies whether food, plant or animal related start in the gut is the first step to full recovery. When the gut gets tiny perforations or leaks, the material within the small intestine leaks out and these \"super large undigested foreign proteins\" cause our immune system to attack them! Hence, the allergic reaction. The first step is to heal the small holes in the intestines. These can be brought on by vaccines that over stimulate a gut reaction early in life, to many processed foods, foods the body does not recognize like Genetically Modified Organisms or GMO's, as well as parasite problems. The solution is fairly easy, but most modern families lack the discipline and know how to heal the gut. Bone broth and a very healthy diet and good fats for 6 to 12 months clears allergies up for most children and adults. See a Certified Naturopath at herbs et c if you need assistance getting started. There are also great herbs to speed the process and free classes available all year round to help you gain knowledge and confidence. Earaches: Our favorite remedy for this is Garlic and Mul- lein ear drops. This reduces the pain and fights the root cause. Parents love how fast acting it is on a crying little one. We also use an oral remedy called CBG; it is a liquid herbal blend designed specifically for ear aches. Anxiety: It can be very hard to watch our child suffer from anxiety and simply saying, \"try not to worry\" is not nearly enough. This is a major nutrition problem and can see quick results with 4 key areas being addressed. First, we need to figure out a little brain chemistry which can be done non - invasively, and the remedy is a well chosen amino acid sup- plement. Next, we can choose a flower essence that is made specifically for their individual concerns and apprehensions. Third, a large and daily dose of good fats, even 2 to 4 table- spoons is not uncommon and solves the dry brain of being in schools or homes that have stress. Finally, let's not forget how important B vitamins are and how under supplied they are in the American diet. We also like to make a special roller bottle blend of oils that the child can use themselves as needed. It's a great secure feeling to know you can help yourself by smelling something made especially for you! Extra, Extra: Herbs for Children!
