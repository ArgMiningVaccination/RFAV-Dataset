Are you ready to order?\" \"Everything looks delicious, but I think I'll go with the chef's tasting menu.\" \"Can I interest you in the can- nabis pairing to heighten your meal experience?\" On 17 October 2018 marijuana will become legal and will join al-cohol as a recreational drug avail-able to adult Canadians. Through an extensive and exhausting search (I Googled it) I discovered that the legislative framework for nonme-dicinal cannabis use is outlined in the Cannabis Control and Licensing Act. The Liquor Distribution Branch will be the wholesale distributor of non-medicinal cannabis in BC and will run the provincial cannabis retail stores. The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch will also be responsible for licensing and monitoring private non-medicinal cannabis stores. I gleaned the following facts from the Cannabis Control and Licensing Act and can't help but make some parallels to alcohol consumption in our province. Adults may possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in a public place. If we assume half a gram per joint, that is the equivalent of carry - ing around five cases of beer or 10 bottles of wine. The Act prohibits cannabis use where smoking is pro-hibited, plus other places where chil - dren commonly gather. It doesn't say anything about walking down the street or toking up outside office buildings, stadiums, theatres, etc. In contrast, I'm pretty sure I'm not al-lowed to start chugging my wine in these locations. According to the Act, adults may grow up to four marijuana plants per household, but not if they have a day care. Notably, there isn't a law that prohibits \"Toddler Care R Us\" from getting their children to make homemade wine. I discovered that the Motor Vehicle Act has also been amended and a driver can be suspended by a DRE for suspected marijuana use (your prostate is a little big, so give me your keys). DRE in this case stands for \"drug recognition expert.\" The police bring in Cheech or Chong to look you in the eye and exclaim, \"Dude, you are so stoned!\" I am confident that the rules will evolve as there will definitely be an adjustment period for this new legis-lation. I'm curious if in coming years cannabis will be woven into our social fabric as much as alcohol is. \"Honey, remember we are going to the Smiths' for dinner tonight. Should we pick up some of that Indica Bob likes?\" Will people go to cannabis tastings or on cannabis or after-dinner treats? Will marijuana become part of attending sporting events? I have already heard about alcohol producers rolling out beverages laced with cannabis. One of the government's stated reasons for cannabis legalization is an attempt to remove the criminal ele-ment from its production. To achieve this end, cannabis will have to be priced reasonably to discourage devel-opment of a for-profit black market. This brings up the question of quality. Will the commercial product eventu-ally outdo individual growers, as it has in the alcohol industry? Most would editorials \" 1/3 horizontal 6.625 2.75 Specializing in: Infertility IVF and r elated technologies and Ash St., Vancouv er FERTILITYWITHGRA CE.COM Continued on page 387386 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgeditorials Ihave been involved in litigation on the constitutionality of Can-ada's health system since well before the Chaoulli decision of 2005. The current action\u2014in which the majority of plaintiffs are patients\u2014was launched almost 10 years ago. Government lawyers continue to block evidence while simultaneously making multiple illogical arguments. For example, a patient-witness taking large quantities of pain medications said they made her sick. Government argued that she was able to state how many pills she took, but the cause of the nausea required expert medical opinion. Objections were made to an ophthalmologist defining glaucoma and a colon surgeon explaining colo-noscopy because they were not quali - fied as \"experts.\" Government documents confirm that BC fails to meet its own maxi-mum wait benchmarks\u2014beyond which patients are harmed. Their law-yers argue pain and suffering while waiting are irrelevant. They are dis-missive of patients lacking access to a GP, mental health services, cancer treatment, or those languishing on ER stretchers for days. The 2018 Vancouver Coastal Health Authority report card reveals only 49% of surgical patients meet maximum medically accepted wait times. Government documents con-firm that only 12% of patients with hip arthritis in \"severe pain, unable to self-care, and at risk of serious harm\" are treated within the maximum ac - ceptable period. For lung cancer it's 31% and for bladder cancer \"with high risk of progression\" only 13%. There are thousands of similar shame-ful examples. Government lawyers have stat- ed, \"So the plaintiffs' argument that evidence of . relevant . . \"Not all relevant evidence is admissible;\" \"Statements made by the premier Private health insurance: The conversation continues or health minister cannot constitute admissions that can be relied on;\" \"Harms caused by current legislation are not relevant.\" They falsely accused BC clinics of \"extra billing,\" which the Canada Health Act specifies as billing in ad-dition to payments from public health care insurance. Private clinics in BC don't extra bill; public hospitals do. Even tax-funded government ex- perts have reported: \"Parallel private insurance funding does add to the net resources available . . . and does pro-vide some care that would otherwise be a charge on the public system.\" Another discarded \"expert\" left the country after a judge ruled he caused an unnecessary enquiry costing over $10 million, and another wrote, \"Medicare is being put on trial, and will likely be found wanting.\" Suspicious of the BC website data, I followed up with a surgeon whose profile showed very few pa-tients waiting a very short time. In truth there were over 1200 waiting. A physician witness at trial described being ordered to stop seeing patients since it made surgical wait lists lon-ger. The ministry ordered patients who were categorized as being in \"moderate pain\" to be reclassified as being in \"mild pain\" in order to (false-ly) improve their statistics. We've heard important evidence described as hearsay, irrelevant, opin-ion, and argument in order to have it excluded. To state one's place and date of birth is inadmissible hearsay unless one personally remembers be-ing born! Our BC government volunteered to have $16 million deducted from their federal transfer payments. Oth-er provinces that allow private MRIs and clinics suffer no penalties. Our current health minister stated, \"The consequences of the failure of the pre-vious [Liberal] government to enforce the law has cost patients millions of dollars.\" He forgets that private clin - ics operated freely under the last NDP government and ignores the fact that private clinics save BC's public sys-tem about $300 million a year. Government recently announced fines up to $20 000 per patient under - going private MRIs or surgery start-ing in October. Unless blocked by an injunction, wait lists will worsen dramatically. An underperforming monopoly cannot succeed unless com-petition and choice are eliminated. A March 2018 Ipsos poll revealed 81% of BC residents support us. Gov-ernment's failure to consider public opinion is undemocratic. I recently addressed a group of 25 visiting health executives from countries as diverse as New Zealand, Netherlands, UK, Switzerland, Ger - many, Zimbabwe, and Russia. They were shocked that private health in-surance was illegal. The Russian del-egate remarked, \"This could not even happen in the former Soviet Union, where I was raised.\" \u2014BD\"This could not even happen in the former Soviet Union, where I was raised.\" Call at 1-800-663-6729 or visit www.physicianhealth.com.

As a result, will people be willing to pay a premium for quality, like they do for high-end Scotch, vodka, tequila, etc.? More relevant to physicians is the effect that legalization of nonmedici - nal cannabis will have on medicinal marijuana use. I mused about this is-sue in my June 2017 BCMJ editori-al. Unless the price of the medicinal product is significantly less than the nonmedicinal one, I think this indus-try is in trouble. If a consumer can se-lect from a wide range of reasonably priced quality products in a govern-ment store, why would they bother getting a prescription from their phy-sician? The only reason I can think of is if some drug plans start listing marijuana as a covered benefit. The physician-staffed medicinal marijua-na specialty clinics also seem to be in jeopardy. Why would an individual attend such a clinic when they can pop into their local cannabis store and purchase whatever they need? I'm not aware of any specialty medicinal al - cohol clinics. \"You were right Doc, that whiskey you recommended really does help my arthritis.\" Perhaps there will be some business in advising in-dividuals about cannabis that is high in cannabidiol (CBD)\u2014the proposed therapeutic ingredient\u2014and low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\u2014the psychoactive ingredient. I am skepti - cal that CBD oil will be a big seller in the non medicinal stores, but I could be wrong. I remain concerned about the long-term health impacts of nonme-dicinal cannabis legalization, particu - larly among young people. The Act limits cannabis use to individuals 19 and over in most provinces, but simi-lar legislation hasn't restricted alco - hol use in minors, and with the new law the amount of accessible mari - juana in our communities will likely increase. Like many of you, I will be an in- terested spectator as this new direc-tion of recreational drug use unfolds in British Columbia. \u2014DRR Continued from page 385 Mr Allan Seckel Chief Executive Officer604 638-2888; aseckel@doctorsofbc.ca Ms Marisa Adair of Public Affairs 604 638-2809; madair@doctorsofbc.ca Mr Jim Aikman Executive Director of Economics and Policy Analysis 604 638-2893;jaikman@doctorsofbc.ca Dr Sam Bugis Executive Director of Physician and External Affairs604 638-8750; sbugis@doctorsofbc.ca Dr Andrew Clarke Executive Director, Physician Health Program 604 398-4301; andrew@physicianhealth.com Ms Amanda Corcoran Chief People & acorcoran@doctorsofbc.ca Ms Cathy Cordell General Godin 218-3924; agodin@doctorsofbc.ca Dr Brenda Hefford Executive Director, Community Practice, Quality, and Integration604 638-7855; bhefford@doctorsofbc.ca Mr Rob Hulyk Director of Physician Advocacy604 Mr Adrian Specialist Services aleung@doctorsofbc.ca Ms Sinden cmyles@doctorsofbc.ca Ms Carol Rimmer Director, Technology and Operations, Doctors Technology Office604 638-5775; crimmer@doctorsofbc.ca Mr Paul Straszak Executive Director of Negotiations and Chief Negotiator 604 638-2869; pstraszak@doctorsofbc.ca Ms Sarah Vergis Chief Financial CONTACTS: Directory of senior staff388 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgletters to the editor Happy 60th birthday to the writ- ers, editors, designers, and all others who create the BC Medical Journal! This journal forms a common bond for the doctors of our province. In addition to presenting valued med-ical articles, the journal offers hu-manistic messages through the often lighthearted editorials and by way of submissions from my fellow physi-cians to the Letters, Premise, Good Doctor, and Special Feature sections. These sections offer readers medical history, biographies, comments about medical practice, and even humor. In contrast to the more pointed mes-sages from the elected officials of our medical establishments, the stories on these special pages deliver their mes-sages subliminally, so that they go di-rectly to the readers' hearts. About 2 years ago I asked the edi- tors if a collection of some of these special pages could be published in the form of an anthology. I was point-ed to obvious reasons why this was not feasible. So, for my own education and pleasure, I thumbed through close to 300 back issues on the shelves of the College Library, searching for my targets. As a prize, I got a feel not only of the important repeated messages for care and humanism in the practice of medicine, but also a feel of the writ-ers' love of medicine as a profession. Consider the article about early Ca- nadian ships' surgeons [1959;1:103-116]. The lengthy story was written by one of the founders of what is now the College Library, Dr W.D. Keith. \"One fine summer morning in 1903 when I was walking north on the west side of Granville Street,\" is how this narrative starts about Dr A.T. Stanton, ship's doctor on the Empress of China. Dr Stanton and associates proved that beriberi was intimately associated with a diet of polished rice. Or read and become riveted to the diaries of Dr Charles Gould, well-known Vancouver neurologist in the past, and his wife on their 5-year-long round-the-world sailing adventure on Astrocite III, faithfully recorded in the June 1968 issue.

Prescriptions and laboratory requisitions are writ - ten on pieces of paper, resulting in unnecessary repeat patient visits or nonclinical physician work to replace or clarify lost, destroyed, or duplicat - ed forms. How did we get here and what can we do? 1. Recognize that the health care system and the people it cares for are complex. Complex systems evolve over time, and changing one part affects others. But we have health care silos rather than system coherence\u2014like co- pilots not talking, each of them try-ing hard to steer while the destination becomes more difficult to reach. And who is steering? We have advocated for doctors to be in the cockpit, but it's crowded with government, adminis-trators, health care professionals, and patients all rightfully present with their own values and experiences. As doctors, we experience com - plexity daily. An antibiotic may work for one person but not another, or it may cause side effects. How people react to the same infection, treatment, or trauma is variable and necessitates personalized care. Similarly, one com-munity may do well with pooled re-ferrals, hospital-based IT, and service contracts. Other communities may not. 2. Identify privacy as paternalism. While we argue about the highest stan- dard of privacy, people willingly give up some of this right daily to interact on social media. I take a chance that my banking or personal data will be hacked, but that is a risk I choose in return for the benefits of convenient virtual services. In the same way, let's create robust information systems and Sitting at my grandfather's typewriter years ago, I heard the click of my finger on the faded black keys and the clack of letters branding the page. Mistakes happened, but there was white-out. Weeks later I submit - ted the manuscript in triplicate after visiting the print shop and post office. Thankfully it was accepted\u2014it would have taken months more to resend elsewhere. Today, I can dictate in any lan- guage and my phone transcribes what I say. That same phone books flights, orders pizzas, pays for parking and coffee, takes pictures and videos and shares them, calculates CrCl, con-nects me to consultant doctors in my area, pushes news, sets the tempera - ture of my home, and plays almost every song ever recorded. Innovation affects every aspect of our lives: GPS devices replaced maps, we stream shows whenever we want on screens of all sizes instead of watching television as it's scheduled, airlines send real-time flight updates, and banks are rarely used for banking. And yet, there's health care. While we celebrate innovative successes such as vaccines, laparosco-py, advanced imaging, and safe-injec-tion sites, we lag behind other fields. I use an electronic medical record, but it doesn't connect to the hospital or other clinics\u2014even if they use the same platform. Handwritten emer - gency room notes arrive by mail. Re-quests for health care services must be faxed on specified forms. When away from the office I cannot complete or even download a death certificate on-Innovation is everywhere. Why isn't it here? let people assess risks and benefits for themselves. And let's also remember that fax numbers get misdialed, pa - pers are stolen or dropped, and con-versations are overheard. We can aim for perfection, but what we really need is progress. 3. Encourage long horizons and fast failure. For major health care reform to occur, we need to look many years into the future, where it will grow with expected population needs and technological advances. But politic-al timelines mean that those wishing to stay in office have an incentive to choose safe projects with a high like - lihood of short-term success. Innovation does not behave this way. We learn in many ways, but the nonlinear journey of controlled fail - ure is one of the best. If smoothly working hinges were political, would the inventor of WD-40 have been al-lowed to fail 39 times? Likewise, how many people have the time, resourc-es, and job security to fail quickly and iterate? 4. It's about people, always. Care is better when we empower pa- tients and engage doctors. IT projects rarely fail due to the technology itself, but rather due to poor change man-agement. Change cannot be done to people: we have to be part of it, work-ing alongside others who it will affect. So let's promote successes, en- courage and learn from failures, focus on stepwise improvement over time, embrace the uncertainty of change, collaborate, and put people and com-munities first. Maybe then we will see true change in health care, an innova-tion we all deserve. \u2014Eric Cadesky, MDCM, CCFP, FCFP, Doctors of BC President 390 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgOr just let yourself go with \"The man who stopped the rain,\" a story that stays with you about an old man who believed he was God, by Con-rad Moralis, MD (pseudonym of the retired psychiatrist) in the May 2008 issue.

Building a culture of information sharing I recently read an interesting article on the business culture at Netflix in WIRED (www.wired.com/story/reed -hastings-at-ted). In the article, Net-flix CEO Reed Hastings spoke about a talk he had given at the TED con-ference in Vancouver in April 2018, where he had said that \"he purposely built Netflix to have a culture of open information sharing after his first company, Pure Software, struggled because it was too obsessed with cre-ating processes to prevent mistakes from happening. 'We were trying to dummy-proof the system, and even-tually only dummies wanted to work there.'\" He went on to say that \"The Net- flix culture of information sharing builds a sense of responsibility. . . . We're like the anti-Apple. They com-partmentalize, we do the opposite. Everyone gets all the information.\" \"That's why Hastings promotes courage as a fundamental value at the company. We want people to speak the truth, and we say, 'To disagree silently is disloyal.'. . . It's not ok to let a decision go through without say-ing your piece. We're very focused on trying to get to good decisions with a good debate.\" Is such a cultural change needed at Doctors of BC? Is the failure to make the cultural change contributing to why Doctors of BC is having difficulty engag - ing members and other nonmember doctors?

No, not that kind of dom, but the domiciliary visit. A spe-cialist consultant and the family doc-tor would meet at a patient's house. The fields covered included internal medicine and especially psychiatry. These visits were very popular with all concerned, especially with the spe-cialist, who was extremely well paid for this service. Some of the lessons from these visits have stuck with me all my long professional life. An illus-trative case follows. A late-middle-aged accountant suddenly changes his behavior. Previ-ously his routine was immutable. He took the same train in from his small village to his firm in the city of Bir - mingham every day for years. Sud-denly, changes occurred. He began stealing women's underwear from washing lines and planning grandiose holidays and world tours. Naturally, his wife was worried and, as was the fashion then, called the village con-stable, who, instead of locking him up, called the doctor. As a junior in the practice I was delegated to meet the psychiatrist on a domiciliary visit. We found a gre-garious, garrulous, excitable but very happy chap. A short history disclosed the sudden and dramatic change in behavior in a man who had never been mentally ill in his life and had no family history of mental illness. \"What was your impression?\" the psychiatrist asked me. \"Hypomania,\" I replied. \"True,\" he said, \"but look at his fingers.\" They were heavily nico-tine stained and gave the suggestion of clubbing. Several months later he died from lung cancer. The possibility of paraneoplastic syndromes present-ing as mental illness has been a life-long lesson. \"Look at and learn from the patient\" was promoted by Osler and remains as true today as it was over 100 years ago. Having a specialist and the fam- ily doctor meet the patient had obvi-ous advantages. Perhaps as our health system evolves we could revive some of these ancient practices? \u2014Ralph Jones, MD Chilliwack Partner publications Divisions Dispatch.

ABSTRACT: British Columbia is in the midst of an opioid crisis. Treat-ment with buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) is one way to mitigate the many harms resulting from opioid use, yet studies show that few phy-sicians are prescribing this medi-cation. A quick-reference guide for physicians that supports Suboxone induction in the outpatient setting was proposed as part of a Resident Scholar Project required for comple-ting a residency in family medicine at the University of British Colum-bia. The project involved the crea-tion and evaluation of a teaching tool for physicians based on recent guidelines from the British Columbia Centre on Substance Use as well as peer-reviewed articles grounded in evidence-based medicine. While the project was undertaken at the Na-naimo site of the UBC Island Medical Program, key stakeholders consid-ered during development included primary care physicians, trainees, and people with opioid use disorder throughout BC. Feedback was obtai-ned from physicians with an interest in addiction medicine. The clinical tool that resulted from the project is intended to be a supplementary resource, not a stand-alone one. Fur - ther improvement of the tool is ex-pected in future as physicians using the resource participate in a self-test survey and feedback process. British Columbia is experienc - ing one of the greatest pub- lic health emergencies in its history. Opioid-related deaths con-tinue to climb because opioid use is increasing and illicit drugs are be-ing contaminated with devastatingly potent opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil. In 2017 the province had 1210 illicit drug overdose deaths as-sociated with fentanyl compared with 667 the year before. 1 In April 2016 the sharply rising number of deaths related to fentanyl led BC's provincial health officer to declare an \"opioid overdose emer - gency.\" Shortly after, the special li - censure requirement was removed for prescribing Suboxone, a formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone com-bined at a ratio of 4:1 and adminis-tered sublingually. This made it legal Dr Caddy is currently completing her resi- dency in family medicine at the Nanaimo site of the University of British Columbia Family Medicine Residency Program.

This article has been peer reviewed.393 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgA quick-reference guide for prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone (suboxone) in the outpatient setting for any physician with prescribing privileges to use Suboxone to treat opioid use disorder, a complex neu-robehavioral illness recognized in the DSM-5. Opioid use disorder is char - acterized not only by negative chang-es in a person's ability to function at home, at work, and in society, but by the development of physical toler - ance and withdrawal symptoms. Sub-oxone can be used to manage these symptoms because the buprenorphine it contains is a partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor with a very high binding affinity. Once bound, bu-prenorphine activates the receptor less than a full agonist such as morphine, fentanyl, heroin, or methadone. The naloxone content of Suboxone deters tampering and misuse as it is active only when administered parenterally, often precipitating withdrawal symp-toms in the opioid-tolerant user. When prescribed skillfully, Sub- oxone results in the reduction or elimination of withdrawal symptoms without providing the reinforcing \"high\" or potenially deadly sedative effects of a full agonist, and is now recommended as first-line therapy for the management of opioid use disor - der in BC. 2 Suboxone prescribing resource A resource designed to reduce bar - riers to treating opioid use disorder with Suboxone in the family prac-tice setting was proposed as part of the Resident Scholar Project required for the University of British Colum - bia family medicine residency pro-gram. A quick-reference guide was seen as a way to fill the knowledge gap felt by many would-be prescrib-ers considering starting a patient on Suboxone and to support clinicians in need of a refresher who fear \"de-skilling\" after taking a course on how to prescribe this medication. The tool proposed was intended to serve as a supplement to published guidelines and online courses, and to provide contact information for specialists in addiction medicine should further support be needed. By empowering physicians to treat opioid use disor - der in their own clinics, the resource could reduce referrals to more spe - cialized clinics, which is preferable according to a meta-analysis pub- lished by Srivastava and colleagues, who state that \"opioid addiction is best managed in a primary care set-ting.\" 3 A resource supporting Subox- one use could have important impacts on both individual and public health. Greater access to and acceptance of Suboxone as an opioid substitution therapy initiated by family physicians could increase the number of patients treated for addiction, thus reducing overdose deaths and bloodborne ill-nesses stemming from use of IV drug paraphernalia. This could also im-prove treatment retention, a factor associated with higher rates of ab-stinence. 4 Finally, greater physician willingness to prescribe Suboxone could lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment for opioid use disorder, creating opportunities for a stronger therapeutic relationship be-tween patients with this disorder and their physicians. Literature review Studies have shown that treatment with opioid substitution therapy leads to sustained abstinence from opioid use, reduced risk of morbidity and mortality, and better rates of treat-ment retention when compared with abstinence or withdrawal-only ther - apies. 2 Suboxone and methadone are considered equally efficacious for opioid substitution therapy and are the two medications recommended in the latest British Columbia guideline. The College of Physicians and Sur - geons of BC recommends completing an online Suboxone training program, although this is not required in order to prescribe Suboxone. Still, relative - ly few family physicians in BC pre-scribe the medication. Although no studies have been conducted in BC specifically, several qualitative stud-ies elsewhere have examined the bar - riers that prevent family doctors from prescribing Suboxone to their patients. One of the most commonly cited bar - riers is a perceived lack of know-ledge and confidence in the induction phases of treatment. 4-11 Respondents in a 2012 Australian study identified When prescribed skillfully, Suboxone results in the reduction or elimination of withdrawal symptoms.394 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgA quick-reference guide for prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone (suboxone) in the outpatient \"de-skilling\" after undertaking Sub- oxone training as another barrier.5 Other barriers frequently identified were a lack of local mental health sup-port services/institutional support, 7,9-11 a lack of time (and space) in a busy practice, 5,7-9,11 fear of misuse and di- version of the medication,7,8 a lack of interest in prescribing,8 and practice partners unwilling to allow Subox-one prescribing in a shared clinic. 5,7,9 A lack of addiction specialist support was a further barrier highlighted in a number of studies. 7-10 These stud - ies are from countries comparable to Canada, and we believe the results are generalizable to British Columbia. Therefore, any intervention aimed at encouraging family physicians to become Suboxone prescribers must reduce some of these barriers. While it is not currently known how best to do this, or which barriers should be the focus, there is clearly a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed to help more family physicians prescribe Suboxone. What little literature could be found regarding physician education for Suboxone prescribing practices tended to focus on chronic pain rath-er than opioid use disorder, 12 other teaching modalities (e.g., web-based or telehealth-based courses), 12-15 or standard guidelines and their effec-tiveness.16 There was nothing in the literature about using information-at-a-glance guides designed to support physician prescribing of Suboxone for opioid use disorder, making it likely that the resource produced for this Resident Scholar Project is the first of its kind. Development of resource We obtained the information includ-ed in our resource from provincial guidelines, as well as peer-reviewed articles grounded in evidence-based medicine. In addition, we asked phys-icians already practising addiction medicine to review our tool to ensure that we were providing only high-quality information. While the pro - ject was undertaken at the Nanaimo site of the UBC Family Medicine Residency Program, key stakehold-ers considered during development included primary care physicians, trainees, and people with opioid use disorder throughout BC. Based on the information col- lected and analyzed, we developed a document to assist physicians with in-office assessment, Suboxone in-duction, and maintenance ( Figure ). The resource includes induction al - gorithms for Day 1 and Day 2, ad-vice on gauging withdrawal severity using the clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS), suggestions for miti-gating precipitated withdrawal, and considerations such as urine drug testing (UDT) and take-home doses or \"carries\" versus daily witnessed ingestions. The information in our clinical tool is based on A Guideline for the Clinical Management of Opioid Use Disorder 2 published by the Brit- ish Columbia Centre on Substance Use and the BC Ministry of Health, as well as online Suboxone training. 17 The recommendations within the BC guideline that were used to inform our resource are of moderate to strong quality according to the GRADE cri-teria for evidence appraisal. 2 In order to give clinicians the op- portunity to test their knowledge after using our guide, we provided a link to a self-test on Suboxone induction, as well as an email address where they can send feedback they may have for us about the tool itself. Strengths and limitations of resource The novel resource that we developed for the project is portable, easy to reproduce, easy to use, and has the potential to influence clinician pre-scribing practices. Creating the tool provided us with the opportunity to further refine our skills as phys-ician-teachers and physician-leaders. The time-limited nature of the pro - ject restricted uptake of the resource throughout the community despite our best efforts, and also meant we were unable to quantitatively assess the impact of our tool on physician prescribing. Further improvement of resource We plan to collect feedback from users of the quick-reference guide and hope to implement suggested improvements in future iterations of What little literature could be found regarding physician education for Suboxone prescribing practices tended to focus on chronic pain rather than opioid use disorder.395 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgA quick-reference guide for prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone (suboxone) suboxone atient setting a quick-reference guide to in-office induction By Patricia Caddy, MD, and Kesh Smith, MD Adapted from A Guideline for the Clinical Management of Opioid Use Disorder published by the British Columbia Centre on Substance Abuse and the BC Ministry of Health, June 2017 assessment Confirm opioid use disorder using DSM-5 Check PharmaNet Obtain substance use history All drugs used, including ethanol (EtOH), nicotine, benzodiazapines Age and amount of first use, current use Any periods of abstinence Treatment history GoalsRule out contraindications Allergy to Suboxone Pregnancy (relative contra- indication to induction but not to continuation) Severe liver dysfunction Severe respiratory distress Acute EtOH intoxication+ CBC Electrolytes Renal panel Liver panel Hep A/B/C serologies STI panel (including HIV) Urine drug testSuboxone Combination of buprenorphine and naloxone at ratio of 4:1 Available in 2.0 mg/0.5 mg and 8 mg/2 mg sublingual (SL) tablets Tablets may be split if necessary May take up to 10 min to dissolve completely (no talking, smoking, or swallowing at this time) Absorption better with moistened mouth Naloxone prevents IM/IV diversion of drug and is not active when taken SL, so does not protect patient from overdose Max dose approved in Canada 24 mg/6 mg daily+ Precipitated withdrawal Can occur due to replacement of full opioid receptor agonist (e.g., heroin, fentanyl, morphine) with partial agonist that binds with a higher affinity (e.g., Suboxone, methadone) Symptoms Similar to opiate withdrawal (i.e., increased heart rate, sweating, agitation, diarrhea, tremor, unease, restlessness, tearing, runny nose, vomiting, goose flesh) Can range from mild to severe Can be very distressing and discouraging for patients Largely reversible with higher doses of Suboxone or other opioid Avoid by ensuring adequate withdrawal before induction (COWS > 12), starting Suboxone at a lower dose (2.0 mg/0.5 mg), and reassessing more frequently Treatment Explain what has happened Provide empathetic/compassionate/apologetic support Manage symptoms with clonidine, loperamide.

Summary A quick-reference guide for physi - cians that supports Suboxone induc - tion in the outpatient setting was proposed to encourage prescribing of this medication to mitigate the many harms resulting from opioid use di-sorder. Data for the resource were obtained from A Guideline for the Clinical Management of Opioid Use Disorder, as well as other provincial guidelines and peer-reviewed articles. The needs of primary care physicians, trainees, and people with opioid use disorder were considered during de-velopment, and feedback was obtai - ned from physicians with an interest in addiction medicine. The clinical tool that resulted from the project is intended to be a supplementary re-source, not a stand-alone one. Further improvement of the tool is expected as physicians using the resource par - ticipate in a self-test survey and feed-back process . Acknowledgments We would like to thank Dr Marcus Barron, a family medicine and addiction medicine physician who acted as our research proj-ect advisor, for providing guidance and input as the resource was created and helping to solicit feedback from other physicians who routinely treat opioid use disorder in the community. We would also like to thank the physicians who generous-ly provided comments and feedback on the quick-reference guide during develop-ment: Dr Elizabeth Plant, Dr Mark Mclean, Dr Patricia Mark, and Dr Marcus Barron.

ABSTRACT Background: A shift from surgeries followed by protracted postopera-tive hospital stays to more ambu-latory surgeries has increased the likelihood of patients experiencing complications and concerns after they have been discharged. De-spite this, we were unable to find a hospital or health region in Brit-ish Columbia with a formal notifica-tion system to ensure continuity of care by informing surgeons when patients present to the emergency department postoperatively or are readmitted to hospital. A study was proposed to determine the magni-tude of this problem and consider possible solutions. Methods: The study was conducted at a mid-sized community hospital. Charts of patients presenting to the emergency department at Chilliwack General Hospital within 6 weeks of surgery were marked with a red dot sticker by the registration clerk to prompt nursing staff to ask ques-tions and record information about the surgery. The charts marked and annotated during this red dot initia-tive from 7 July to 30 September 2015 were copied after the patient was discharged, with the originals going to health records and a copy being placed, if appropriate, in the operating surgeon's hospital mail-box. Data collected on all red dot cases were analyzed and descriptive statistics were obtained. Results: A total of 248 patients who presented to the Chilliwack Gener - al Hospital emergency department during the study period met inclu-sion criteria. Of these patients, 138 (56%) were found to have had their surgeries performed at the study site and 110 (44%) had their surgeries performed elsewhere. A total of 915 patients had surgery at Chilliwack General Hospital during the study period, allowing us to estimate that 15.1% (138/915) of patients made postoperative emergency depart - ment visits. Presenting complaints included pain (23.0%), infection (17.7%), and bleeding (12.5%). In terms of the disposition of patients upon discharge from the emergency department, less than half (40.3%) were advised to arrange follow-up with their surgeon, more than a quarter (28.6%) required no follow-up, and a small number (11.7%) were instructed to contact their GP for fol-low-up. Only 2 patients (0.8%) were admitted to hospital. Conclusions: Postoperative visits to the emergency department were common among surgical patients, suggesting a reliable notification system is needed to alert surgeons when this occurs. Furthermore, the majority of these emergency depart-ment visits were for minor compli-cations or concerns, suggesting that an improvement in periopera-tive education could reduce un-necessary emergency department visits. In an extension of the study described here, more detailed infor - mation about presenting complaints and disposition of patients has been gathered for analysis and a survey was recently completed to assess the type of perioperative education patients received, their satisfaction with the information provided, and what delivery methods they would find most useful.

Dr McDonald is a staff general surgeon at Chilliwack General Hospital.Improvements in both surgical and anesthetic practices have shifted care away from surgeries followed by protracted postoperative hospital stays to a significant proportion of day and short-stay procedures. In 1986 ap-proximately 40% of all surgical proce-dures in North America involved day surgery compared with approximately 65% in 2001. 1,2 Previously, when pa- tients had longer hospital stays, sur - geons were intimately involved in the identification and treatment of postop-erative complications and continuity of care was maintained. A change in practice to more ambulatory surgery has increased the likelihood of patients experiencing complications and con-cerns after they have been discharged and has led to more patients present-ing postoperatively to physicians' of-fices or the emergency department. Currently, a formal notification system does not exist to inform sur -geons when their patients present to the emergency department with post-operative concerns, meaning surgeons may not be aware of or involved in the identification and care of surgical com-plications. They may even be unaware when patients are readmitted to hospi-tal. The magnitude of this problem has not been determined and we have been unable to find a hospital or health re-gion in British Columbia with a formal notification system. Previous attempts were made to address this problem at our site, Chilliwack General Hospital (CGH), by encouraging emergency department physicians to contact sur - geons directly. When this did not re-sult in reliable notification of surgeons, we proposed a study to consider this problem in more detail and determine if implementing an interdepartmen-tal communication system might im-prove postoperative patient care. Our site is a mid-sized commu- nity hospital that provides services in general surgery, urology, obstetrics, gynecology, otolaryngology, ortho-paedics, ophthalmology, and oral sur - gery, and sees approximately 60 000 emergency department visits annual-ly. During 2017, 8772 surgeries were performed at CGH, including 4647 ophthalmology cases and 4125 cases from all other surgical subspecialties combined. Methods A study was conducted using data col-lected at Chilliwack General Hospi-tal in 2015. The study was approved for commencement by the local de-partments of Emergency Medicine and General Surgery as well as the executive director of health services in the Chilliwack area. Patients were included in the study if they presented to the emergency department within 6 weeks of surgery, regardless of their chief complaint and whether the sur - gery was conducted at the study site. Patients were excluded from the study if they had undergone dental or oph-thalmologic surgeries. Dental cases were excluded because the majority of these procedures are performed in private office settings rather than in hospital, and ophthalmologic cases were excluded because ophthalmol-ogy is a regionalized service and is not specific to Chilliwack General Hospital. A preliminary round of data col- lection took place from 15 May to 6 July 2015 to obtain a tally of post - operative emergency department visits, identify the hospitals where pa-tients underwent their surgeries, and to develop a patient tracking process called the red dot initiative ( Figure 1 ). A second round of more detailed data collection using this process took Nursing staff asks patient about type of surgery and where performed; information recorded next to red dot stickeremergency department (eD) registration clerk asks patient \"have you had surgery in the past 6 weeks?\" Yes: Red dot sticker placed on patient's chart Unit clerk identifies red dot charts of patients discharged from ED and separates them from other charts no: No further action requiredUnit clerk photocopies red dot charts and places them in envelope for pick-up; originals go to health recordsRed dot charts from ED placed in operating surgeon's mailbox if surgeon has mailbox at CGH Figure 1.

Only the data that was collect - ed between 7 July and 30 September was used for analysis. The charts of patients presenting to the emergency department during this period were marked with a red dot sticker by the registration clerk to prompt nursing staff to ask questions about the sur - gery and record the answers. Infor - mation obtained included the surgeon who performed the original surgery, the presenting complaint, and the pa-tient's disposition at discharge. Charts marked and annotated during this red dot initiative were copied after the pa-tient was discharged, with the original going to health records and a copy be-ing placed, if appropriate, in the oper - ating surgeon's hospital mailbox. The study protocol included a dis- cretionary pathway for direct com - munication between the emergency room physician and the surgeon to address serious postoperative compli-cations such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis. Past experience with a high rate of false-positives for wound infection led to placing particular emphasis on accurate diagnosis, appropriate treat - ment, and continued follow-up. Data collected on all red dot cases were analyzed and descriptive statis - tics were obtained. Results During the study period, 248 patients who presented to the Chilliwack Gen-eral Hospital emergency department met study inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 138 (56%) had their surger - ies performed at the study site, and 110 (44%) had their surgeries performed at other hospitals. A total of 915 pa - tients underwent surgery at CGH during the study period, allowing us to estimate that 15.1% (138/915) of patients receiving surgery at the site made postoperative emergency de-partment visits. Presenting complaints ( Figure 2 ) for all 248 patients presenting to the CGH emergency department varied: 57 (23.0%) presented with pain, 44 (17.7%) presented with postoperative infection, 31 (12.5 %) presented with postoperative bleeding, 27 (10.9%) presented for concerns about wound appearance, and 13 (5.2%) presented with symptoms of deep vein throm-bosis or pulmonary embolism. In ad-dition, 53 patients (21.4%) presented with other surgery-related complaints categorized as \"Various.\" Only 23 patients (9.3%) presented with com-plaints unrelated to their surgery. The disposition ( Figure 3 ) of the 248 patients discharged from the CGH emergency department also var - ied: 100 (40.3%) were advised to ar - range follow-up with their surgeon, 71 (28.6%) required no follow-up, and 29 (11.7%) were instructed to contact their GP for follow-up. Of the remainder, 23 (9.3%) had presented with complaints unrelated to surgery and their follow-up arrangements were not considered pertinent, and another 23 (9.3%) were categorized as \"Other\" because they had alterna-tive follow-up arrangements. Only 2 patients (0.8%) required admission to hospital. Conclusions The goal of this study was to iden - tify patients presenting to the emer - gency department with postoperative complaints within 6 weeks of their surgery. The number of patients iden-tified (15.1%) falls within a range found in other studies of postopera-tive complications presenting to the emergency department, 3-5 and in our study the vast majority of these (90.7%) presented with concerns dir - ectly related to the surgery performed. Continuity of care Only 40.3% of patients were dis-charged with advice to contact their surgeon, leaving almost 60% of pa-tients unlikely to communicate with their surgeon regarding the post - operative concern that resulted in the emergency department visit. This lack of communication can result in fragmentation of postoperative care and is an issue for several reasons. Figure 2. Presenting complaints of 248 patients visiting emergency department within 6 weeks of surgery.0510152025 Symptoms of DVT/PEUnrelated to surgeryWound checkBleeding Infection Various = deep thrombosis/pulmonary embolismThe red dot initiative: An analysis of postoperative visits to the emergency department401 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgFirst, patients who require readmis - sion postoperatively have been found to have higher survival rates at 1 year when cared for by the operating sur - geon while in hospital, 6 suggesting that not having the surgeon involved can lead to less than optimal manage-ment of some postoperative compli - cations. The study by Justiniano and colleagues also suggests that con-tinuity of patient care at the hospital level is not in itself adequate and that continuity of care at the level of the surgeon improves patient outcomes. 6 Second, patients generally assume that their surgeon has been informed of their emergency department vis-its, new prescriptions, and changes in care. When they realize this is not the case, they may lose faith in both the surgeon and the health care system in general. Third, the lack of communi-cation with the operating surgeon when a patient has a postoperative complication prevents surgeons from accurately tracking their postopera - tive complication rates and facilitat-ing positive improvements in their practice and perioperative education of patients. Our study findings suggest that a reliable, automatic, electronic notifi-cation system is needed to facilitate communication between the emer - gency department and surgeons. There is currently no formal notifica-tion system used in the Fraser Health Authority, where 71 442 surgeries (excluding ophthalmological proce-dures) were performed in 2017. Ex-trapolating from our findings that 15.1% of patients made postoperative emergency department visits, we sug-gest that over 10 000 patients a year could benefit from improved commu-nication between the emergency de-partment and surgeons. Perioperative education The most common presenting com-plaints in this study were pain (23.0%), infection (17.7%), and bleeding (12.5%). A significant proportion of patients presented for wound checks (10.9%), but very few patients pre - senting to the emergency department required admission (0.8%). These findings are similar to those of other studies. When Mahnert and colleagues retrospectively assessed for return visits to the emergency department after hysterectomy for benign dis-ease they found a low admission rate (1.0%) and that pain was by far the most common complaint (29.5%). 3 A 2010 study by Aiello and col- leagues looking at appendectomy patients reported a slightly higher postoperative admission rate (2.2%) and also found pain to be the most common complaint (48.0%), fol - lowed by wound concerns (13.0%) and fever (13.0%). 4 A 2001 study by Imasogie and Chung found a 1.0% rate of readmis-sion within 30 days of ambulatory surgery. 7 Similarly, a 1992 study by Biswas and Leary described a 1.2% rate of readmission after day surgery, 1 and a 1998 study by Mezei and Chung described a 1.1% rate of readmission rate after ambulatory surgery across numerous specialties. 2 In addition to finding a very low admission rate in line with the studies described above, our study found that 28.6% of pa-tients discharged from the emergen-cy department required no follow-up whatsoever. These results indicate that significant postoperative compli-cations are rare and suggest that ini-tiatives to reduce excessive hospital visits would be beneficial. A 2009 systematic review per - formed by Fredricks and colleagues found that intensive and individu-alized perioperative education is associated with a decline in postop-erative symptoms experienced by the patient. 8 Improved counseling about what to expect during the post-operative period, delivered during preoperative patient preparation via the Preoperative Assessment Clinic, hospital-based teaching sessions, on-line resources, or other modalities, could reduce visits to the emergency department for minor complaints that are more appropriate for outpatient assessment. The expansion of periop-erative education to reduce unneces-sary emergency department visits is well supported in the literature. 3,4,9,10 Figure 3.

Further data analysis In an extension of the study described here, we have gathered more informa-tion from a larger population to iden-tify patient needs and deficiencies in current care. These data on presenting complaints and disposition of patients are currently being analyzed. As well, a postoperative survey was recently completed to assess the periopera-tive information patients received, their satisfaction with the information provided, and what delivery meth-ods they would find most useful (e.g., preoperative teaching sessions at the hospital, online videos, preadmission clinic appointments). The data are also currently being reviewed and ana-lyzed. Findings from this survey will be used to assist the working group that has been established to review preadmission processes and modify perioperative patient education. Study limitations The main limitation to this study is a data collection process that relied on patients remembering they had under - gone a surgical procedure and regis-tration clerks remembering to ask an initial question about surgery. Signifi-cant numbers of patients could have been missed because of this reliance on memory. Other limitations include a small sample size consisting of pa-tients at a single community hospital and a study design focused on a lim - ited amount of data, specifically the number of postoperative visits made by patients to the emergency depart-ment and where their surgery took place. These limitations mean the findings may not apply to other sites. Furthermore, we acknowledge that organizational culture varies from site to site and can affect communication between emergency physicians and surgeons. For example, surgeons at the study site agreed to be contacted directly by phone during working hours and additional evening hours regarding their patients presenting to the emergency department with post operative complications regard- less of whether they were on call, something that may not be acceptable to surgeons at other sites. Similarly, we acknowledge that perioperative education varies from site to site and across surgical specialties. Summary An analysis of data collected during the red dot initiative at Chilliwack General Hospital found postopera - tive visits to the emergency depart-ment were common among surgical patients but that the majority of visits were for minor complications or con-cerns. This and other findings support development of a notification system that improves communication be-tween the emergency department and surgeons. Further study is underway to improve perioperative education, with preliminary data suggesting that teaching patients what to expect dur - ing the postoperative period could reduce unnecessary emergency de-partment visits .

Occasional - ly, workers with catastrophic or mul-tiple traumas may also sustain dental traumas that can be overlooked and not acutely dealt with, as the more serious injury treatment may take precedence. However, oral facial in-juries can result in disfigurement and dysfunction that can have significant negative effects on an individual's quality of life. A worker with frac-tured, displaced, or lost teeth can have improved outcomes with appropriate first aid measures and early dental treatment. Crown fractures and luxations (teeth pushed sideways or out of or into their socket) are the most com-mon of all dental injuries. Prompt, correct emergency management is vital to the prognosis of an injured tooth. Treatment strategy after injury to a permanent tooth is dictated by the concern for vitality of the pulp tissue. All traumatized teeth require contin-ued periodic monitoring, as long-term sequelae can include necrosis (pulp tissue death) and subsequent need for urgent treatment. A fractured tooth can usually be restored or the fractured fragment re-attached. If cold air or liquids cause Management of acute dental trauma This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.worksafebc pain in a fractured tooth, biting on a clean, moist piece of gauze or cloth may help reduce symptoms until the tooth is examined and treated by a dentist. When pulp tissue in the tooth is exposed or damaged because of a fracture, root canal therapy may be necessary. A vertical fracture extend- ing into the root of a tooth usually re-quires extraction, while in a horizontal root fracture, the closer the fracture is to the root tip, the better the chances for long-term health of the tooth. If a tooth is avulsed (knocked out completely) due to an injury or acci - dent, it does not necessarily mean the tooth has been lost for good. Proper emergency action can result in a tooth being replanted successfully and last-ing for many years. Treatment within 30 minutes offers a greater chance to save a tooth. If an avulsed tooth can be located immediately, handle it carefully and pick it up by the crown, without touching the root surface. If the root is dirty, gently rinse with wa-ter, do not use soap or chemicals, and do not scrub or dry the tooth. Avoid wrapping the tooth in tissue or a cloth and instead, if possible, immediately replace the tooth in the socket and gently push it into position and hold it in place with fingers or by closing the teeth together. Keeping the tooth moist is very important. If the tooth cannot be replaced in the socket, place the tooth in the mouth next to the cheek or in milk or tooth preserva-tion solution. A dentist should be seen within 30 minutes, if possible, for evaluation and treatment. Even if the tooth cannot be reattached, the exam may pick up other injuries: sometimes neighboring teeth suffer an injury that can only be detected by a thorough dental examination. A luxated tooth must be reposi - tioned and stabilized by a dentist. Root canal treatment is often required and usually not initiated for at least a few days following injury. Health care professionals should be prepared to give appropriate ad-vice to patients on first aid for injured teeth.

What is harm reduction? Broadly speaking, harm reduction aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with activities that may cause harm. Harm reduc-tion applied to substance use is a comprehensive, nonjudgmental ap-proach that focuses on preventing harm rather than preventing drug use. Harm reduction includes abstinence-based programs; it is one pillar in a four-pillar strategy, working together with prevention, treatment, and en-forcement. Evidence shows harm reduction is a pragmatic, safe, 1 cost- effective,2 and lifesaving3 response to address adverse health and social outcomes associated with substance use. The Canadian Medical Associa-tion fully supports harm reduction strategies to address the adverse out-comes associated with the use of both legal and illegal psychoactive drugs, and recognizes that it is a clinically mandated and ethical method of care. 4 While harm reduction is often thought of as the provision of ster - ile injection supplies to people who use drugs or supervised consumption sites, harm reduction approaches are broad-reaching and inform the design and delivery of policy, programs, and services to benefit people who use substances, their families, and the community at large. bc centre for disease control The physician's role in harm reduction Needle distribution and exchange Policies that restrict the distribution of needles, such as one-for-one needle exchange, increase the likelihood that supplies will be shared, and thus limit the effectiveness of harm-reduction programs in preventing hepatitis C virus and HIV transmission. 5 There- fore, in 2003, consistent with best practice, needle distribution and safe disposal replaced the policy of needle exchange in BC. From 2007 to 2016, HIV diagnoses in people who inject drugs declined from 118 to 16 cases, representing 30% and 6.6% of total cases of HIV identified, respectively. 6 To enable safe disposal of used injec - tion supplies, the BC harm reduction program provides personal sharps containers and safe-disposal educa-tion, while health authorities collab-orate with municipalities to provide locally appropriate disposal options, including facilitating peer needle- recovery programs (needle sweeps), and needle-disposal containers in public spaces, health centres, and agencies. 7 Client (or patient)-centred care and addressing stigma Successful harm reduction programs focus on the needs of clients and em-brace client-centred care. Harm re-duction best practices in programing involves ongoing, meaningful en-gagement with organizations led by people who use drugs, and individ - uals with past or present experience who can provide expert and valuable perspectives. 8 Stigma experienced by people who use drugs creates a barrier to disclosing substance use and a re-luctance to seek help. This is particu - larly salient given the context of the current overdose public health emer - gency and people dying while using substances alone. 9 What can physicians do? Physicians can respect people's rights to access care by treating the immedi-ate health needs of people who use drugs while acknowledging patients' experiences\u2014meeting people where they are at. The careful use of nonstig-matizing language by physicians and their staff can signal respect to cli-ents. Guidelines on the use of respect-ful language have been developed ( Figure ), with key recommendations encouraging the use of people-first language, language reflecting the medical nature of substance-use dis-orders, language promoting recovery, and avoiding slang. 10 Addressing the needs of people who use drugs with compassion can build trust between them and health providers. This trust enables physicians to advocate for their patients and to connect them with treatment and harm-reduction services. Physicians can help address the issue of marginalization by examin - ing their own assumptions and val-ues, and recognizing the role of social determinants of health and health in-equities that predispose people to use substances. Physicians can also ad-vocate for harm-reduction services This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.Harm reduction includes abstinence- based programs; it is one pillar in a four-pillar strategy, working together with prevention, treatment, and enforcement.405 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgin their communities and respond to public concerns with evidence. \u2014Brandon Yau, BSc UBC Faculty of Medicine BCCDC BN, RNc, \u2014Sara Young, MA, MHA(C) Manager, Harm Reduction BCCDC \u2014Jane A.

BC Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) launched the free app in January throughout the province. The app pro-vides vital information in the case of cardiac arrest, where minutes count in reducing suffering and preventing death. The goal of the PulsePoint Res pond app is to engage additional bystanders in the lifesaving acts of cardiopulmo-nary resuscitation (CPR) and automat-ed external defibrillator (AED) use. Currently, only one-third of sudden cardiac arrest victims receive bystand-er CPR, and, where available, publicly accessible AEDs are used less than 3% of the time. The app provides support to the internationally, clinically rec-ognized chain of survival ( Figure 1 ), increasing the chances of immediate CPR and rapid defibrillation. In less than 6 months from the province-wide launch, almost 7000 users have downloaded the app and 604 \"CPR Needed\" alerts have been sent on 154 potential out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. This means that any-one who may suffer a sudden cardiac arrest in BC now has an increased chance of survival. BC is the first to have a province-wide program for this public notification service; however, other Canadian provinces are keen to follow if it proves to be successful. PulsePoint Respond cov - ers all communities and municipali-ties in BC, and while it does rely on mobile phone coverage, it processes calls automatically, meaning there are no delays or changes in how paramed-ics are dispatched after 9-1-1 calls are received ( Figure 2 ). This article is the opinion of the Emergen- cy and Public Safety Committee, a sub-committee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board. How the app works Smart phone users who have down- loaded the app are automatically connected to the BCEHS emergency dispatch system. When a sudden car - diac arrest is reported through 9-1-1, BCEHS dispatchers automatically send a notification of its location to all app users. Next, a \"CPR Need-ed\" alert flashes on the smart phone screen of each user who is within 400 metres, accompanied by a distinctive alert tone. Opening the alert loads the app with the following information: The app user's current location. The general reported location of the cardiac arrest victim. The location of any nearby AEDs. To receive the ''CPR Needed'' alert, an app user must have the \"CPR Needed\" alert option turned on in the settings menu of their device, and they must be within walking distance of the reported sudden cardiac arrest ( Figure 3 ). The \"CPR Needed\" alert shows users a map pinpointing the location of nearby AEDs, which are an impor - tant tool that the general public can use safely before paramedics arrive. We recognize that it may not al- ways be possible for those receiving an alert to respond, and neither Pulse-Point nor BCEHS keeps records of who receives or responds to alerts. No identifiable health information (e.g., the name, birth date, or personal health number of the patient, or de-tails about the app user) is known or stored by the app or BCEHS. The safety of our staff, patients, and bystanders is of utmost concern to everyone at BCEHS. While there have not been any reports of adverse incidents in the 3000-plus communi-ties using PulsePoint Respond, we do not ask anyone to go anywhere where they may feel unsafe. Also, it is im- Figure 1. The chain of survival.BCEHS paramedics and dispatchers will ensure a rapid response; however, without bystander CPR and AED use the chances of survival are low.407 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.org portant to remember that the response process begins because someone has called for an emergency ambulance, is speaking to a BCEHS call-taker, and is most likely still on scene. As the re-cohp sponse process unfolds, the BCEHS call-taker will remain on the line and provide support until crews are pres-ent. If there is cause for concern, the police and other appropriate agencies will be alerted as well. How you can help The greatest advocates for PulsePoint Respond are health care providers who see the impact of sudden cardiac arrest and understand the benefits of early CPR and AED use. Survival from sudden cardiac arrest is led by bystanders. BCEHS paramedics and dispatchers will ensure a rapid re-sponse; however, without bystander CPR and AED use the chances of sur - vival are low. Please spread the word among your family, friends, patients, and fel-low health care professionals about the PulsePoint Respond app and its benefits. Put up posters where the public can see them and educate them to understand the benefits of early CPR and AED use. The app can be downloaded from www.pulsepoint.org for iOS and An-droid.

One that does was given by the remarkable man who is the subject of this article. Dr Angus Rae was born in 1929 in London, UK, the first child of his ra-diologist father and nurse mother. He had an unremarkable childhood un-til life was disrupted by the onset of war. When bombing began in London he and his younger brother were sent to schools deep in the English coun-tryside, safely tucked away from the usual bombing corridors. Still, every time the sirens sounded students had to take shelter\u2014a highly exciting ac-tivity for a young teen Angus. One of his standout memories from the time is being sent back to London by ambu-lance due to onset of acute glomerulo-nephritis, though he insists this did not trigger his interest in kidneys. Dr Rae entered the London Hospi- tal Medical School (now the Royal) in 1947 at age 18. Of approximately 80 students, only five or six were wom-en. Meanwhile 80% were ex-service - men who were much older, wiser, and more battle-worn than he. After completing his studies, Angus carried on with the usual licensing require-ments (6 months' medicine/6 months' surgery), and then came compulsory military service. While waiting for a posting, Angus and a few young class-mates completed parachute training with the Airborne Brigade but never had to jump in conflict. When the posting finally came, he spent 2 years in Malaya (Malaysia) caring for British Gurkha troops and their families, happily supervising 250 births along with three excellent midwives and limited antibiotics\u2014penicillin, sulpha, and tetracycline. He had many interesting medical en-counters, a 6-week hike in the moun-tains of Nepal, and a trip with Fijian troops (also serving in Malaya) across the border to play and win a few rug-by football matches in Thailand. Finally in 1956 he was promoted to major in medical charge of retir -ing soldiers and sent home on a troop ship via Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Bombay (Mumbai), and Aden (Yemen). How the world has changed! Once back home, Angus had to de- cide what to do with the rest of his life, but before he had made up his mind he was called up from the reserves to the Suez Canal conflict. Fortunately that ill-fated fight was short-lived and he returned home again, convinced that he wanted to study internal medi-cine. After a number of interviews he was offered a position in cardiology at the Royal Free Hospital, having been interviewed by Professor Sheila Sherlock and others. Until this day he is not sure if the deciding factor was that he played rugby, as there was in-tense sporting competition between the eight medical schools in London! During his training, interest in the new field of hemodialysis was increasing, despite many \"experts\" considering it to be a waste of time, money, and resources. Detractors aside, Professor Sherlock (a liver specialist) encouraged one of her re-search fellows, Dr Stanley Shaldon, to start a renal unit. Angus became involved and joined the unit in 1962, Dr Angus Rae A pioneer in the care of patients with kidney disease in British Columbia\u2014establishing the renal Unit at St. Paul's Hospital, initiating the home hemodialysis program, and traveling the province (and beyond) to treat patients\u2014Dr Angus rae has spent his long and storied career doggedly fighting his gentlemanly fight for recognition of the importance of the clinician's role in the teaching medicine. Lindsay M. Lawson, MDCM, FRCPC Dr Lawson is a retired member of the BCMJ Editorial Board. She practised re-spiratory medicine at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver from 1982 to 2010. Like Dr Rae, she is happily retired in Victoria. 409 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgthe good doctor thus beginning his lifelong interest in the kidney and its diseases. In the mid-60s, at a meeting of American nephrologists organized by his professor in London, Angus was offered a job in San Francisco. Always looking for adventure, he ac-cepted and took his right-hand-drive car with him on the boat, planning to drive across the continent. He adver - tised for someone to drive with him to share the cost, and chose Prudence, a muscular, over six-foot-tall Austra-lian sheep farmer who was not intim - idated by the unusual car. Sitting in what would be considered the driv-er's seat, reclined, with her feet on the dash, she more than once caused the pair to be pulled over by police, who collapsed with mirth when they saw Prudence sleeping in the sun. After a year at the University of California in San Francisco, the Uni-versity of Washington in Seattle beck-oned, and from there Professor Belding Scribner, a world leader in dialysis, sent Angus to Spokane to supervise one of the world's first home hemo-dialysis training programs, which the professor had recently set up. While Angus was learning about this relatively new field of medicine, over the border Dr Bill Hurlburt was looking for someone to start a similar program at St. Paul's Hospital in Van-couver. Angus's name was suggested by a medical school classmate, Dr John Kerridge. Angus accepted, came to Vancouver in 1968, and went right to work. He didn't even ask what he would be paid. He was later told that until he could make $1000 per month in the fee-for-service system he would be paid up to that amount by St. Paul's. It took Angus 8 months to reach that threshold, and thereafter he survived on his own. He and his later appoin-tees made their living on fee-for-ser - vice payments, pooled their income, and were never on the payroll of the hospital or the Faculty of Medicine except for responsibilities outside of patient care, such as lectures.Soon after arriving in Vancouver Angus arranged for nurses from St. Paul's to visit Seattle and learn how best to train patients to do their own hemodialysis at home. The training was immediately implemented when the nurses returned to St. Paul's, and within 3 months two patients were trained and sent home to do their own hemodialysis, the first in BC. By the end of the 1970s, the divi- sion had expanded to include Drs Clif-ford Chan Yan and Ronald Werb, then Paul Taylor, and later Tony Chiu, each of whom brought new ideas. The first, Dr Chan Yan introduced internal jugu-lar catheterization, not only of value for blood access in acute renal failure, but also for total parenteral nutrition, so the unit took charge of those who needed this in hospital and at home. In the late 70s there was pressure to start renal transplantations at St. Paul's, but this took them until 1986. The success was in large measure due to the appointment in 1984 of Dr Da-vid Landsberg, a transplant physician trained in eastern Canada. They were also fortunate to have a urologist, Dr David Manson, ready to take this on with enthusiasm. In another of life's coincidences, a member of the Min-istry of Health was a diabetic with early renal failure unknown to his col-leagues. He suspected he would be more likely to get a transplant if St. Paul's was given permission to start renal transplantations, which they were, and he did. In 1986 their first transplant was performed on a 34-year-old male who is still alive with normal kidney func-tion, having required a second trans-plant some years later. The program proved very successful, doubling the transplantation rate in BC in 3 months and tripling it in the first year. St. Paul's continues to have one of the leading programs, now listed among the top in numbers across the country. The seed that Angus planted in 1968 has grown into a leading centre for the treatment of kidney disease across the land, with the vision to ini-tiate new programs such as the Travel - lers' Dialysis Clinic (TDC)\u2014inspired by Expo 86 for dialysis-dependent but otherwise healthy visitors from other provinces and overseas (local units were too full to take them as pa-tients). As for advances in transplants, a paired exchange program and a liv-ing anonymous donor program have been initiated just to name two. Nephrology was a small field when Angus came so he offered to consult on patients in several towns across BC and in Whitehorse, Yukon, where there was no general internist L-R: Dr Angus Rae in Malaya Llama (Tibet), Sabitri Devi Tamang (Nepal), Matilda Mamon (India), and Dr Vincent Sweeney (Scotland).Continued on page 410410 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgthe good doctor in residence, thus saving the towns money and increasing the number of renal patients for the unit at St. Paul's. Many of these communities even- tually obtained their own internists, except Whitehorse, where Angus did his last clinic in 2007, 12 years after he had retired. In the 35 years of ser - vice to Whitehorse alone he did over 2000 consultations, in many cases sav-ing patients and the medical system the expenses involved in having to be seen in major cities. This service to rural BC and Yukon was invaluable and set the standard for these clinics to this day. Over the years, Angus gave many lectures, but none were as important, well received, and widely acclaimed as his 1990 Osler Lecture, which was subtitled the Rise and Fall of Bedside Medicine. The importance of a clini - cian's role in teaching medicine re-mains Angus's passion to this day and was instrumental in the part he played in the formation in 1998 of the Uni-versity Clinical Faculty Association (now the Doctors of BC Section of Clinical Faculty). Angus has written widely on di - verse topics, from how to give bad news to patients to a report from the 1998 World Transplant Games in Sydney, Australia. Building the Renal Unit at St. Paul's is Angus's major accomplish-ment, starting from virtually nothing in 1968, when he was alone but for excellent nurses and technicians. Pa-tients were gathered from across BC and new physicians were appointed who together pooled their largely fee-for-service income, each taking a percentage according to seniority, paying for secretarial services, and buying their offices\u2014initially just a hole in the ground and now elite stu-dios from where they supervise the ever-expanding hemodialysis, perito-neal dialysis, and transplant services in the Renal Unit at St. Paul's. The group's last appointee before Dr Rae left was Dr Adeera Levin in 1990. She is now head of the UBC Di-vision of Nephrology working from St. Paul's and in 2015 was appointed to the Order of Canada for \"her tire-less work on behalf of people with kidney disease, both nationally and internationally.\" From 1971 to 1981 Angus was in charge of the rotating internship pro-gram at St. Paul's, reputed to be one of the best of its kind, gathering stu-dents from many countries, including a woman from Chile escaping Pino-chet's dictatorship. Angus thinks it is unfortunate that this system of training students by giving them a broad view of medicine from which to choose their future has been abandoned. From 2006 to 2015, Angus con- tinued to be involved in his work. He supervised students in the an-nual problem-based learning course on kidney matters (the last session of which took place on his 86th birth-day). With the cash he received for this he established the Angus Rae Ab-original MD Bursary to help increase the number of Indigenous students enrolling in our medical school. Angus is especially proud of re- ceiving the Kidney Foundation of Canada's Annual Award, being made a senior member of the CMA, being honored as clinical professor emeri-tus of medicine and given honorary alumnus status at UBC, his time as the American College of Physicians' gov-ernor for the BC chapter, and perhaps above all, having taught and mentored students from the day he arrived. He seems especially proud of the many letters of thanks they have sent him. Angus is now happily retired in Victoria but is not idle. He continues to visit Yukon, having been granted honorary privileges at Whitehorse General Hospital for his many years of service. He is a vocal advocate for an equal partnership between the academic cul-ture of UBC's Faculty of Medicine and the clinical culture of those dedicating their lives to the care of patients. Such a union he believes is the only way to help our ailing medical system. Most recently Angus encouraged me to vote for his favorite candidate in the election of the next president of Doctors of BC! He has been happily married to his wife, Ann, for many years and they have been blessed with children and grandchildren. As for the title of Dr Rae's grand rounds that fascinated me? It was \"Evolution: How the Mammal got its Nephron.\" Dr Angus Rae with his wife, Dr Ann Skidmore, receiving the BCMA Silver Medal of Service at the Victoria Conference Centre (1998).Continued from page 409 411 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 8, october 2018 bcmj.orgnews BC researchers date \"hibernating\" HIV strains Researchers at the BC Centre for Ex- cellence in HIV/AIDS (BC-CfE) and Simon Fraser University, in partner - ship with the University of British Columbia and Western University, have developed a novel way for dat-ing \"hibernating\" HIV strains, in an advancement for HIV cure research in the province. Published in Pro - ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research confirms that dormant HIV strains, which have in-tegrated their DNA into that of the body's cells, can persist in the body for decades and can reactivate many years later, which is why HIV treat-ment needs to be maintained for life. The study confirms that the latent HIV reservoir is genetically diverse and can contain viral strains dating back to transmission. In order to date dormant HIV strains within the viral reservoir, re-searchers needed to compare these strains with those that evolved within an individual living with HIV over the entire history of their infection. The research provides further clues in the pursuit of an HIV cure, which will ultimately require the complete eradication of dormant HIV strains, which are unreachable by antiretroviral treatments and the im-mune system. Through advances in antiretroviral therapy, an individual living with HIV can now live a lon-ger, healthier life on treatment, which works by stopping HIV from infect - ing new cells. On sustained treatment, individuals can achieve a level of vi-rus that is undetectable by standard blood tests, and an undetectable viral load means improved health and that the virus is not transmittable to others. This research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Re-search in partnership with the Cana-dian Foundation for AIDS Research and the International AIDS Society, as well as the US National Institutes of Health. Dr Zabrina Brumme, Di-rector, Laboratory with BC-CfE is lead author on the study. Concussions loosen myelin around brain cells Athletes may be returning to play sooner than they should. Detailed scans of concussed University of Brit-ish Columbia hockey players found that the protective fatty tissue sur - rounding brain cell fibres was loos-ened 2 weeks after an injury, even though athletes felt fine and were deemed ready to return to the ice. The loosening of myelin slows the trans-mission of electrical signals between brain cells. Researchers previously showed in animals that this loosened myelin can completely deteriorate with subsequent blows\u2014a condition that resembles multiple sclerosis. This is the third study arising from the before-and-after study of 45 UBC hockey players. The athletes had their brains scanned with MRI before the season began; if they were concussed, they were rescanned 3 days afterward, 2 weeks afterward, and 2 months af-terward. Eleven athletes were con-cussed during the season, and most of them underwent the additional MRI scans. Conventional MRI imaging done in hospitals to assess brain injury does not reveal myelin loosening. Alex Rauscher, an associate profes - sor in the Department of Pediatrics and the Canada Research Chair in Developmental Neuroimaging, and postdoctoral research fellow Alex Weber, used advanced digital analysis of the scans, using a UBC-developed, pixel-based statistical analysis to find changes that visual inspection could not reveal. Previous analysis of the con- cussed athletes' scans, published by Rauscher in 2016, showed changes to the myelin in the corpus callosum, most susceptible to damage from sud-den collisions against the interior of the skull, but researchers didn't know whether the myelin was diminished, akin to multiple sclerosis, or altered in another way. In this recent study it was revealed that the loosening around the nerve fibres that connect brain cells was temporary, and the myelin had returned to normal when the concussed players were rescanned 2 months after their concussions. The findings provide a convinc- ing reason to keep concussed athletes on the bench even if they no longer exhibit any symptoms, as measured by a standard test of cognitive abili-ties, balance, coordination, and mood. Passing a concussion test may not be a reliable indicator of whether the brain has truly healed, and more wait-ing time may be advisable to prevent long-term damage. The study \"Pathological insights from quantitative susceptibility map-ping and diffusion tensor imaging in ice hockey players pre and post-con-cussion,\" is published in Frontiers in Neurology. Gut enzymes key to producing universal blood UBC researchers have identified a new group of enzymes that can turn any blood type into the universally usable type O. Blood type is determined by the presence of antigens on the surface of red blood cells, and antigens can trig-ger an immune response if they are foreign to the body; therefore, trans-fusion patients should receive either their own blood type or type O to avoid a reaction. Removing antigens from blood effectively transforms it into type O.

The researchers sampled DNA from millions of microorganisms found in environmental samples\u2014a technique known as metagenom-ics\u2014to find an environment in which the desired enzymes might be found. They eventually focused on the mucosal lining of the human gut, which contains sugars that are simi-lar in structure to blood antigens. By homing in on the bacteria feeding on those sugars, they iso-lated the enzymes the bacteria use to pluck off the sugar molecules. They then produced quantities of those enzymes through cloning and found that they were capable of performing a similar action on blood antigens. Withers and his colleagues\u2014 UBC microbiologist Steven Hallam and pathologist Jay Kizhakkedathu of the Centre for Blood Research at UBC\u2014are applying for a patent on the new enzymes and are hoping to test them on a larger scale in the fu-ture, in preparation for clinical testing.

Canadian Charter of Rights for People with Dementia The Alzheimer Society of Canada's Advisory Group of people with dementia has created a Canadian Charter of Rights for People with Dementia. Although people with de-mentia hold the same rights as every Canadian citizen, they face cultur - al, social, and economic barriers to claiming these rights, leaving many facing discrimination, isolation, and treatment that contravenes their basic rights as human beings. The Advisory Group set out to define seven explicit rights to give a great - er voice and authority to those with dementia and to ensure the people and organizations that support them know and protect their rights. These include the right to: Be free from discrimination of any kind. Benefit from all of Canada's civic and legal rights. Participate in developing and implementing policies that affect their life. Access support and opportunities to live as independent and engaged citizens in their community. Be informed and supported so they can fully participate in decisions affecting their care and life from the point of diagnosis to palliative and end-of-life care. Expect that professionals involved in all aspects of their care are trained in dementia and human rights and are accountable to up-hold these rights. Access effective complaint and ap-peal procedures when their rights are not protected or respected. The Charter will also serve to guide the federal government as it develops and implements a national dementia strategy for Canada.

The participants included a range of ath-letes\u2014runners, cyclists, triathletes, rowers, and hockey players. Participants were asked ques- tions about their health, family his-tory, and physical activity levels. They also had their blood pressure checked and waist circumference measured. Some participants also took part in an exercise stress test. Those with abnormal results under - went further testing, such as a CT coronary angiogram, to determine if they had cardiovascular disease. Of the 798 athletes, 94 (12%) were found to have significant car - diovascular disease. Ten participants were found to have severe coronary artery disease (blockage in their ar - tery of 70% or greater) despite not having any symptoms. This study's findings build on previous research that found mas-ters athletes have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than non-athletes of the same age with similar risk factors. However, previous re-search has also found that, compared to non-athletes, masters athletes typ-ically have more calcified plaque, which is known to be more stable and less likely to cause a heart attack. While the findings may seem alarm ing, Barbara Morrison, the study's lead author and a PhD stu-dent in experimental medicine at UBC, emphasized that it doesn't mean masters athletes should stop exercising. She recommends people see their doctor for regular check-ups, including blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring, especially if they have a family history of heart attack or stroke, and exercise in moderation. When taken to the ex-treme, exercise may have the poten-tial to do harm. Coauthored by researchers at SportsCardiologyBC, BC Children's views. New kitchen and bathrooms. Walk to lovely market town.

I was really keen on marine biology in undergrad and would have pur - sued that if I hadn't gotten into med-ical school. Thankfully I did get into med school because I later found out I get really seasick, which would have made marine biology a poor career choice! Which talent would you most like to have? I would love to be able to sing but am constantly reminded that it is not my strength. Which living physician do you most admire? I have been so fortunate to have worked with a number of wonderful physician mentors and leaders includ-ing my predecessor, Dr Perry Ken-dall, whom I admire tremendously.Proust questionnaire: Dr Bonnie Henry What do you consider your greatest achievement? Mentoring and supporting many bril- liant young women and hopefully be-ing a positive role model. What is your idea of perfect happiness? A glass of wine, a good book, and jazz in the background. That and those ex-ceedingly rare moments during a long run when the pain disappears and I feel the flow; unfortunately those mo-ments are fleeting! What is your greatest fear? Personally, developing Alzheimer disease. Professionally, I fear anti - microbial resistance and that we will never find a way to stem the tragedy of overdose deaths we are currently experiencing. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? Procrastination! What is your favorite activity? Running, for my mental and emotion- al health along with the physical. And more recently, yoga. Which words or phrases do you most overuse? This too shall pass. Where would you most like to practise? I have the best job in the country and am happy right where I am, based in Submit a Proust Questionnaire Online: www.bcmj.org/submit-proust-questionnaire Email: journal@doctorsofbc.ca.

A cure for Alzheimer disease or, bet- ter yet, effective prevention. What is your most marked characteristic? I am not very tall! People most often tell me I am always calm (even in a crisis) and talk softly. What do you most value in your colleagues? Patience and kindness. Who are your favorite writers? Milan Kundera, Ian McEwan, and Madeleine Thien. What is your greatest regret? Not being a better communicator to my patients, colleagues, family, and friends. How would you like to die? I once worked with the search and rescue team in Comox and we were called to attend someone on the gla - cier. It was a beautiful, sunny Satur - day and an older woman had been out on the mountain hiking with friends. They had just finished a nice lunch and she collapsed and died just as they started down. I have often thought that was a lovely way to go. What is your motto? In patience lies wisdom.
