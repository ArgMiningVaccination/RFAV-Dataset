We offer a range of traditional chiropractic services to treat conditions including compressed nerves, back pain, neck pain, sciatica, and more. Traditional Chiropractic Techniques Baton Rouge To help our patients on their road to optimum health, we offer the following traditional treatments. Chiropractic Adjustments Many health issues are caused by misalignments of various parts of the body. [Chiropractor Baton Rouge](https://sonnchiro.com) are highly trained doctors who are fully aware of how all the parts of the body link together, which areas support other areas, and how pain can be caused by spasming muscles, trapped nerves, and bulging discs. Chiropractic adjustments help to restore misaligned joints to their correct and healthy position, increasing range of motion and strength while reducing pain that may be felt in that area or other areas. We offer both standard adjustments and [non force adjustments](https://drveronicacollings.com/chiropractic/faq-non-force-chiropractic/), both equally effective in restoring your body to its optimal operation. Chiropractic adjustments can also help with relief from headaches; the causes of such pains may not be directly related to the head, and adjustments can permanently reduce the incidence of certain types of headache. Massage Massage therapy involves the manipulation of the soft tissues of the body. This can relieve tension and pressure, reduce or stop spasming, promote healing and repair, and generally relax the patient. This kind of procedure can reduce pain (or help with pain management) and help with recovery and rehabilitation after an injury. Our treatments are always tailored to the individual patient and so different massage techniques may be used to treat different conditions. Exercise and Stretches A healthy and well balanced body will be the most resistant to injury, and so ensure your body is flexible and strong is important.
