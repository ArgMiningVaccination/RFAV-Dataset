Yoga mats, bolsters and blankets will be provided, but feel free to bring mat, pillow and blanket or whatever helps you get comfortable so you can relax into the experience.** Exchange: $49.50 Immerse in the Experience: This Sound Journey is designed to bring you back into a blissful, relaxed and balanced state of mind and being so that you can approach life from a place of harmony and equilibrium. The journey will start with a pranayama, focusing on the breath to draw us into the present moment. Followed by a chant to quiet the mind, and a guided meditation to melt us deeper into the experience. From there we'll immerse in the vibrations of a sound bath, creating inner space for deep relaxation, which will aid in the release of tension, stress, and stagnant or trapped energy. From within this state of being the mind, body, and spirit are able to soothe, re-calibrate, and restore, while allowing the central nervous system to begin its process of repairing. Reiki Offering: Participants will be offered the gentle loving energy of Reiki in our Sound Experience. Reiki is the energy of unconditional love, and when tuned into and directed by a practitioner it can support with health, harmony and healing on a mental, emotional, physical and energetic level. About the instruments: We will immerse in the soothing sounds of Tibetan Singing Bowls that have been hand crafted and blessed by Monks. These bowls are made of the seven metals that represent the seven visible planets, and were created with the intent of bringing us back into harmony with the rhythm of life. We'll tune into the sounds of droning instruments, and enter a light trance as the monotones calm the mind and bring it to quiet. We'll bath in the vibrations of the symphonic gong, which holds the sounds of the solar system, as recorded by NASA, allowing us to transcend the physical. We'll chant to tune our own instruments, our voices and bodies, so we may calibrate our being to sound codes that support mental, spiritual, emotional and physical health All this will happen within a soundscape of natural percussion instruments, infused with vibrational medicine. As we entrain to these sounds we come into harmony with the vibrations inherent in nature, in the planets, and in the cosmos.
