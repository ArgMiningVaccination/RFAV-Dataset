Q: what's first, now that you're cEo of Ahs?A: My first job is learning the landscape. i need to connect with the front line. When i think about what a CEo should be doing, my primary job should be to eliminate any barriers front-line staff may have or feel. i also need to have a relationship with the community at large; to say to albertans: 'if you have issues or concerns, let us know. Tell us and we're going to do our best to meet your needs and expectations.' Q: what type of changes are you envisioning?A: i'll be looking at how we maintain quality of care and maintain appropriate wait times. how do we make sure we're serving the right person, at the right time, doing the right thing? What kinds of structures do staff need to help them move through that? Q: Many would say there have been incidences of political interference in the past when it comes to your position. how do you plan to handle the politics of Alberta? A: politics and health care go together. We elect our political leaders, give them tax dollars and tell them they need to spend it in the areas important to us. health care has always been, and will always be, one of the most important areas to Canadians. as long as we're funded by tax dollars, you as a taxpayer will have your say through the politician. When we see an increase in the politicization of decisions, it's because there is a loss of confidence. My job is to bring confidence to the position and to the organization, and to earn the confidence of albertans. if we have that kind of a relationship with the people of alberta and with the staff of ahs and with the physicians, i think we'll be on the right path. n KAMINSKIl o C a l l e a d e r s PAGE 2 aWaRD iN sToRE foR gRoUp The Beaverlodge hospital auxiliary recently received an award from the Town of Beaverlodge recognizing the support it provides to the community and hospital. The Mayor's award of Distinction was presented to auxiliary members at a formal awards dinner on april 9. The award was given the same week as National v olunteer Week, april 6-12. \"This award recognizes an individual or a group who has made a significant contribution to our community,\" says Mayor leona hanson, who selects the recipient of the award each year. \"it's definitely a pleasure to be able to present the award to this group. They are truly amazing.\" The Beaverlodge hospital auxiliary has been a part of the community for over 30 years. it currently has about 40 members, all of whom help manage and operate the local Thrift store in efforts to raise money to purchase equipment and items for the Beaverlodge Municipal hospital. alberta health services (ahs) also recognized local volunteers for their dedication at an appreciation event on Tuesday, april 15. \"it is an honour to work with this auxiliary, that works so diligently to operate the Thrift shop and generate funds for their hospital and health care community,\" says sylvia advent, co-ordinator with ahs v olunteer Resources. \"They have contributed over 5,000 recorded volunteer hours in this past fiscal year, with 59 registered volunteers.\" Running the Thrift shop is how the auxiliary raises most of its funds. auxiliary members volunteer to staff the store three days a week in groups of three or four. secondhand clothing, kitchenware, books, toys and a variety of other household items are sold at the shop. and the hospital has benefited. funds raised by the auxiliary have helped purchase televisions for patient rooms, chairs for the waiting room, blood pressure monitors, a stretcher, and a bariatric bed. Dorothy lieverse, president of the auxiliary, says that it's a pleasure to raise funds to purchase things that make the lives of staff and patients more comfortable. \"We've raised thousands of dollars to buy different things over the years, and we always have an enjoyable time doing it,\" says lieverse. \"all of the women - young and old - are dedicated and fun to work with. We have a meeting once a month to bring everyone together, and host fun events such as a Christmas party and spring picnic. There's always a lot of talking and visiting.\" lieverse adds the auxiliary is always looking to add new members to the team. \"Most people volunteer once every two weeks or sometimes once a week,\" she says. \"We are flexible with a person's availability.\" The auxiliary also accepts cash donations. located off Main street in downtown Beaverlodge, the Thrift store is open Wednesdays, Thursdays and fridays, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. for more information about volunteering with ahs, visit www.albertahealthservices.ca. nStory by Lisa Peters | Photo by Sylvia AdventDR. KEVIN WORRY North Zone executive leadership team member summer is nearly here and taking advantage of the short season is a must in northern alberta. sunshine can provide a number of different health benefits, including improved mood and mental outlook, which in turn can help ease some forms of physical pain. But the warm, sunny weather also comes with a variety of hidden dangers. after a long, cold winter, many of us could use a reminder of how to stay safe while enjoying ourselves under the sun this summer. applying sunblock with a sun protection factor (spf) of at least 15 is recommended if you're going to be in the sun for any length of time to help limit exposure to harmful Uv (ultraviolet) rays. for babies younger than six months, it's best to make sure they're covered with large, brimmed hats, or keep them out of the sun altogether. you're more likely to get a sunburn when the sun's rays are strongest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. More than just a summer annoyance, repeated sunburns can increase your risk of skin cancer dramatically. Repeated blistering burns are thought to be linked to an increased risk of melanoma - the least common, but most deadly form of skin cancer. learn more about sun safety and proper use of sunscreen at myhealth.alberta.ca . hazards related to Uv exposure aren't limited to the sun's natural rays. artificial tanning is actually more dangerous than the sun. some tanning beds can emit up to 15 times more harmful radiation than the midday sun. and the younger you are, the higher the risk. Using tanning beds before the age of 35 can increase your chances of developing some form of skin cancer by up to 75 per cent. for more information about the risks associated with artificial tanning, go to www.thebigburn.ca. n There are plenty of health care options available.

Developed by the Trillium health Centre in Mississauga, ont., the North Zone's allied health department purchased a number of the CommuniKits after seeing them at a health fair. The CommuniKit is designed to help patients who have speech and hearing difficulties find creative ways to converse. it contains multilingual boards, a yes/no board, an alphabet chart, time and calendar boards, a body parts chart, a rating scale, a dry erase board, and communication strategies for various speech disorders such as dementia and aphasia. \"We use all parts of the CommuniKit,\" says Cynthia pruden, clinical lead for speech language pathology in the North Zone. \"We've even added things to it. for example, if we need a communication board in a particular language, we'll make one. \"We've aimed to put a Communikit in every long-term care centre where there is a recreational therapy department, but we would like to see it in every hospital in the North Zone - especially on our acute-care units.\" Residents use the kit to help communicate health concerns. for example, if they are experiencing pain, they can point to a number on the pain-rating scale. or, if they are finding it hard to say something in words, they can write it out or draw pictures on the dry erase board. The goals are: 1) staff will use it to communicate with patients and residents and, 2) residents will use it to initiate conversations with staff, other patients and family members. \"When patients have difficulty speaking, we can still have a very rich conversation if we adjust how we're communicating with them,\" pruden says. \"The CommuniKit supports us in using all modes of communication: gestures, facial expressions, intonation, pausing and waiting, listening, pointing, drawing, and speaking.\" Using the kit allows residents to be more independent and to voice their thoughts, needs and concerns. as recreation therapist Jennifer felitsyn explains, it also allows them to get involved with activities. \"it's another avenue to get our message across while minimizing their frustration in trying to share something with us,\" she says. \"it allows residents to actively participate in programs that they may not have been able to do otherwise, or may have been too uncomfortable to participate in.\" some examples of how the kit is changing the lives of residents range from allowing a spouse to reconnect with their husband or wife in long- term care, to reaching patients to discern their comfort levels and moods, or enabling a resident to participate in a game of Bingo. \"The great thing about this kit is that if it's housed somewhere that is accessible, everyone can use it: patients/residents, staff, volunteers, friends and families. it's portable, too, so it can be used on day trips, during group activities, during home visits and at appointments with specialists,\" felitsyn says. The CommuniKit is available for free. for more information or to get a CommuniKit for your site, contact your local recreational therapist or email cynthia.pruden@albertahealthservices.ca. ni n Y o u r z o n e PAGE 3 Story by Kirsten Goruk | Photos by Christine BergetKit helps long-term care residents communicate in spite of speech difficulties lET's givE ThEM soMEThiNg To T alK aBoUT \" ThE goal is ...

Kirkpatrick was able to do just that, thanks to the stroke action plan - a provincewide initiative designed to improve the quality of inpatient and community care for stroke patients in rural and small urban areas. The stroke action plan uses provincial standards to ensure inpatient stroke care in small urban and rural settings is equivalent to the care delivered in larger centres, and that patients have early access to rehabilitation services following admission for stroke, including in-home rehabilitation known as Early supported Discharge. \"after i returned home from the hospital, they were at my house the following day to start my rehab,\" says the 77-year-old Red Deer man. \"Every day, i was visited at home by a qualified team that would do all the necessary treatments to get me back to my normal lifestyle. i usually had two visits a day, five days a week.\" The in-home rehabilitation team includes physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, therapy assistants, nurses, recreational therapists and social workers. This program, available in Red Deer, has reduced by half the average length of hospital stays for stroke patients in Calgary and Edmonton. Red Deer is the first centre in alberta to implement the initiative, which will be rolled out to communities across the province. \"Early supported Discharge not only allows patients to return home sooner and regain their independence, but allows them to receive one-on-one rehabilitation,\" says Jeff Wright, an alberta health services (ahs) occupational therapist and the project leader. so far, 20 stroke survivors in the Red Deer area have been helped by the stroke action plan since it launched last august. as part of the stroke action plan, grande prairie, Camrose, lethbridge and Medicine hat will receive enhancements to both inpatient and outpatient services, including the addition of Early supported Discharge teams. for patients who have had mild, moderate and severe strokes, this means improved care both during and after their stay in hospital. smaller centres - peace River, Westlock, fort McMurray, Cold lake, Wainwright, lloydminster and Brooks - will receive enhancements of inpatient services for stroke patients, as well as improved stroke training and education. The stroke action plan was developed by the Cardiovascular health and stroke strategic Clinical Network (sCN) of ahs. \"one of our goals is to improve the prevention, treatment and management of heart disease and stroke across the province,\" say Dr. Blair o'Neill, senior Medical Director of the Cardiovascular health and stroke sCN. \"The stroke action plan will ensure stroke patients receive the same level of care everywhere - rural and urban.\" for Kirkpatrick, it translated into a faster recovery after his stroke. \"i'm so excited by my progress. i can now walk on my own up and down the steps, my speech is returning to normal and i feel good about myself.\" nStory and photo by Colin Zak |sTRoKE aCTioN plaN sTaNDaRDiZEs CaRERural and smaller sites receiving same care as in large urban centres Stroke survivor Elwood Kirkpatrick performs a motor skills test as therapy assistant Jolene Boutin observes.

Then i was in the ambulance on the way to Westlock,\" hebein recalls. The 76-year-old credits staff and doctors at the Westlock healthcare Centre for saving her life earlier this year. \"i had a Ca T scan, then they gave me a clot- buster and it seemed to do the trick. i had another scan after that, but the doctor said it didn't find any blockage.\" a new state-of-the-art CT scanner is expected to improve stroke diagnosis for Westlock area residents even further. also known as a computed axial tomography scan or Ca T scan, the machine takes cross- sectional images of the body to create a 3-D picture of what's happening inside, thereby helping doctors diagnose conditions such as stroke. The previous scanner was installed in 2004 and completed up to 35,000 scans during its 10 years in operation - about 3,500 exams a year. Evelyn Koshurba, diagnostic imaging site supervisor at the Westlock healthcare Centre, says the new unit has the potential to reach more patients. \"Down the road, if staff are accredited to do other types of scans, we'll be able to use the new machine even more. it has the capability to do a lot of different types of scans - CT colonography and cardiac scoring - that the old unit couldn't, so we're looking forward to that.\" scans can differentiate between soft tissues, including lungs, heart, abdominal and pelvic structures, and spinal tissues, as well as skeletal structures. Cancer patients, or those suspected of having cancer can also undergo scans to help diagnose or find out more about the disease. Westlock has been a primary stroke Centre since 2010. The old CT unit was a four-slice scanner that produced images that were immediately shared with stroke neurologists in Edmonton. patients were then interviewed by the neurologist via Telehealth video-conferencing to help give a complete picture of their condition - as was the case with hebein. The new equipment can accomplish thinner slices, giving an even better look at what is happening in fine structures like blood vessels in the brain. in the case of a stroke, a scan can find if there is a clot or uncontrolled bleeding, and where in the brain it's located. \"We'll be able to do a little bit more for the stroke neurologists now because we can get those finer cuts and get the images that they want,\" says Koshurba, Travis stroh, diagnostic imaging manager for the central portion of the North Zone, says the new equipment in Westlock will help improve patient care. \"Technologists and radiologists can expect better resolution of exams. This helps improve the ability to diagnose patients.\" as for hebein, she says she's grateful for the speedy diagnosis and the care she received. \"They say it was a miracle the way i came through it and so quickly. and all the thanks goes to the doctors who worked very diligently on me and all the staff around there. \"i feel very, very fortunate.\" nStory by Sara Warr | Photo by Sara DanielHealth centre's new CT scanner provides higher resolution images, meaning docs get an even clearer picture of their patients' conditionsUpgRaDE BENEfiTs WEsTloCK Evelyn Koshurba, diagnostic imaging supervisor at the Westlock Healthcare Centre, stands outside the room housing the centre's new computed axial tomography (CT) scanner.visiT Us oNliNE hEAlth ADvisoriEs get the latest, up-to-date health advisories for your area on the alberta health services website. find out about water quality issues, illness outbreaks, and matters of public health. v isit www.albertahealthservices.ca under \"News and Events.\" thE BiG Burn Take a virtual trip to the tanning salon, not to tan, but to learn about the dangers of artificial tanning, including skin cancer, eye damage, skin aging and addiction. visit www.thebigburn.ca. sEx GErMs sexually transmitted infections can have lasting effects on your health and fertility. get the facts, talk to your partner, and spread the word about protecting yourself and getting tested. v isit www.sexgerms.com. whA t's on your MED list? if you take medications, you play a role in your health care when it comes to medication safety.

Robotics on the brain Calgary neurosurgeon Dr. garnette sutherland has spent his career breaking new ground in neurosurgery. his first \"world first\" was a magnetic resonance imaging (MRi) system for operating rooms. it provides surgeons with 3-D images during an operation. he followed that with another milestone: the neuroarm, the world's first MRi-compatible surgical robot for both microsurgery and image-guided biopsy. surgeons control the neuroarm from a workstation, guiding its movements via images on a screen. Because it can move in smaller increments than the human hand, neuroarm is the ideal tool for performing delicate surgery inside the brain. 4. 10. 5.from heart attacks to colds, genetics to food science, researchers in Alberta are discovering new treatments and developing new technologies to improve the health of Albertans and people around the world. Take a look at 10 groundbreaking innovations developed in our province. Story by Connie Bryson | For more innovations, visit applemag.ca Groundbreaking drug for hep B The first oral medicine to treat chronic hepatitis B infection was developed by Dr. lorne Tyrrell at the University of alberta. lamivudine is a groundbreaking drug for patients with this chronic viral infection - about 300 to 350 million people worldwide. These people cannot clear the virus from their body; they are at high risk of serious liver damage, as well as death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. lamivudine stops the virus from replicating, which minimizes liver damage. alBERT a: hoTBED of iNNova TioNs Keeping a steady beat Cardiologist Dr. anne gillis is an international leader in the use of devices like pacemakers to treat heart rhythm disorders. Under her leadership, Calgary's Cardiac arrhythmia service became the first centre outside the U.s. to evaluate remote monitoring of patients with implantable defibrillators. her research has led to refinements in pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, improving the quality of life for countless heart patients. 2.Food safety first in 2008, deli meats contaminated with the listeria bacteria led to 22 deaths in Canada. Thanks to research by three University of alberta scientists - Drs. lynn McMullen, Michael stiles and John vederas - there's a life-saving food additive that kills this deadly bacteria without any chemicals. Their Micocin technology is now used by food- packaging companies to ensure the safety of food products.6. 8.Getting a good night's sleep sleep apnea is a life-threatening condition that interrupts breathing during sleep. The University of Calgary's Dr. John Remmers was the first to demonstrate that the condition is due to a narrowing of part of the throat. he developed a device to keep the airway open during sleep: the Cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) device. The Cpap essentially eliminates sleep apnea and dramatically improves sleep quality. 9.Dressing for success With his invention of the acticoat technology, Dr. Robert Burrell revolutionized wound care and helped save the lives and limbs of thousands of patients around the world. Working as a biomedical engineer at alberta's Westaim Technologies inc., Burrell developed tiny silver nanocrystals that kill microbes and stop inflammation. acticoat dressings are used worldwide to prevent life-threatening infections and promote healing in burns, ulcers and other wounds. Rules change for heart transplants heart transplants in babies are different from those in adults, thanks to research by cardiologist Dr. lori West. she discovered that infants can receive a heart from a donor with an incompatible blood type; in adults, donor and recipient blood types must match. Because infant immune systems can adapt to a mismatched donor, this widens the pool of potential organs and decreases wait times. Creating a lab in a box an alberta company is turning the notion of a lab test on its head. instead of a lab that requires floor space and equipment, aquila Diagnostics systems inc. has developed a device the size of a toaster that can do all kinds of molecular tests - determine whether a patient is resistant to cancer drugs, identify a strain of malaria, pinpoint infectious disease in a herd of cattle, and more. The science behind the technology comes from the work of University of alberta cancer researcher Dr. linda pilarski. The device has the potential to replace millions of dollars of equipment in a conventional lab with something that is much less expensive and can be used anywhere.Gene-mapping workhorse a tool developed at the University of alberta in the 1990s became the workhorse of the human genome project - an international research effort to map all of our genes, which paves the way for new understanding of genetic factors in disease. Developed by analytical chemists Drs. Norman Dovichi and Jianzhong Zhang, the instrument analyzed DNa 10 times faster than earlier technology. Nothing to sneeze at one of Canada's most popular over-the-counter cold and flu medicines was developed in alberta. Cold-fX came out of research at the University of alberta on the active ingredients in traditional herbal medicine. it's derived from the roots of the ginseng plant, one of the most valued medicinal plants in the world.peter Bauer, a 79-year-old diabetic already dealing with pneumonia, needed intravenous (iv) fluids to help combat dehydration. so the last thing he wanted was a difficult iv start. But thanks to a new vein viewer used at the valleyview health Centre, his nurse was able to locate the sturgeon lake resident's veins quickly and non-invasively. \"My veins are deep in my skin and very hard, so it was a relief when my No. 1 nurse, Candace, was able to find my vein without having to poke around a lot,\" says a grateful Bauer. The vein viewer helps health care staff locate patients' veins when starting ivs to treat dehydration, collect blood samples, or administer medications. \"it's a non-invasive, simple procedure and we can use it on all patients - from pediatrics to geriatrics,\" says Janelle v etsch, lab supervisor at the health centre in v alleyview, 110 km east of grande prairie. The vein viewer uses a wand that shines harmless near-infrared light on the patient's skin to detect a vein and/or particular vein pattern. The vein shows up as a green or grey line under the skin. funded through the v alleyview health Centre foundation, the equipment was purchased in January 2014 and cost $17,000. like Bauer, genetics play a role where some patients' veins are harder to find, while others veins are difficult to locate due to medical conditions that may cause veins to collapse. \"We usually 'feel' for the vein when collecting blood samples, but some patients' veins are tougher to find, for example, someone who has been through chemotherapy,\" explains v etsch. \"it's much nicer locating the vein with the viewer than having to guess where to insert the needle.\" Bauer is happy with a painless iv start.\"it doesn't hurt at all and it makes it so much faster getting my iv in,\" says Bauer. and Candace Thorpe, registered nurse at the health centre, agrees. \"it's nice to be able to use the viewer to help start intravenous drips and not have to cause any unnecessary pain for our patients, and it's easy to clean - which is great for infection- control standards,\" says Thorpe. Used in emergency, acute care and laboratory services at the health centre, nursing staff can adjust the viewer's height depending on their needs - making it very comfortable to use. The vein viewer is mobile and the hand-held wand is connected to a stand on wheels that is just over one-metre tall. Rita Cauchie, Chair of the v alleyview health Centre foundation, is proud of the community and the support shown toward the health centre. \"We have a great community that really steps up to the plate to help raise money for our health centre,\" Cauchie says. \"Citizens and businesses alike contribute in many ways, especially their time and effort on various fundraising events.

We want to spread the 'i am a person first' message.\" The campaign is one component of the fort McMurray innercity homeless health promotion project, a public health initiative funded by the Northern lights health foundation through a donation by athabasca oil sands project joint-venture owners: shell Canada, Chevron Canada limited and Marathon oil Corporation. 'i am a person first' targets people or organizations that regularly encounter the homeless and provide them services. They can include health care and social services as well as employment agencies and shelters. \"We hope this campaign inspires behaviour change among local individuals and at different businesses and organizations, so that everyone can see those struggling with homelessness, addictions and mental health issues as a person, first,\" says Evancio.
