Immune re- sponses decline with age (immunosenescence), and older adults have an increased likelihood of having chronic medical conditions [2]. In Europe, 24% of the total disease burden caused by infectious diseases occurs among older adults aged 65 years, with influenza acknowl- edged as the most important contributor [3]. Moreover, infections among older adults cause a considerable economic burden to the health care sector and society. In the Netherlands, for instance, the health care costs of pneumonia and influenza in 2011 among older adults aged 65 years was \u20ac388 million, which was 55% of the total health care costs of these diseases in the population [4]. Given that developed countries currently deal with aging populations, it is expected that infections among older adults will put an increasing burden on health care facilities and the health care budget in the next decades. Prevention of infectious diseases among the elderly through vaccination is becoming an in- creasingly important strategy to ensure healthy aging and to alleviate the pressure on the health care system. Nonetheless, despite the availability of vaccines, various vaccine-pre - ventable diseases among older adults still pose a substantial burden; these include influ- enza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis [5]. Vaccination recommendations for older adults differ between countries. In the Netherlands, for instance, only vaccination against influenza is currently offered free of charge to older adults, while in the UK, next to the flu shot, vaccination programmes against pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster have been implemented already for at least several years [6]. Next to direct protection by vaccination of older adults themselves, it is also relevant to consider the indirect protection of older adults as a result of routine childhood vaccination programmes due to herd immuni - ty. Most developed countries have implemented childhood vaccination programmes against pneumococcal disease and pertussis (including the Netherlands), and several countries also recommend vaccination of children against influenza (e.g. US, UK, Finland) and varicella (e.g. US, Germany, Finland) [7], with potential herd immunity effects in some of these cases. As the number of available vaccines on the market increases, governments have to make decisions on which vaccinations to include in public programmes in the context of scarce resources [8]. To make evidence-based decisions, ministries of health are usually advised by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs). These NITAGs assess vaccina - tion policies according to frameworks that include criteria on the disease burden as well as the effectiveness, safety, acceptability, efficiency and priority of vaccination. In the context of efficiency and priority of vaccination programmes, cost-effectiveness analyses play an increasingly prominent role. These analyses provide insight into the balance between the costs of vaccination and the associated benefits as compared to other strategies to reduce or 11 General introductiontreat the relevant disease burden. Nowadays, most European countries routinely consider economic evidence as part of their recommendations [9]. Aim of the study presented in this thesis This thesis provides evidence on the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies to protect older adults against two diseases that cause a significant disease burden in this specific age- group: herpes zoster (HZ) and influenza. HZ is commonly seen in older adults, and has low risk of mortality but significant impact on the quality of life. When vaccines against HZ be- came available in the Netherlands, the following research questions became relevant for pol- icy makers: \"What is the cost-effectiveness of introducing HZ vaccination for older adults in the Netherlands?\", \"How do the available HZ vaccines compare to each other?\", and \"What would be the optimal age to vaccinate?\". Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality among older adults each winter season, despite existing vaccination programmes for this age group. Potential vaccination strategies to improve the protection of older adults against influenza include the use of an improved vaccine for older adults themselves and to reduce the transmission of the influenza virus through vaccination of children. The following questions became relevant for policy makers: \"What is the cost-effectiveness of a new quadrivalent influenza vaccine that contains anti - gens of one additional virus as compared to the traditionally used trivalent influenza vaccine cost-effective for the current target groups?\", \"What would be the cost-effectiveness of pae- diatric influenza vaccination when taking into account indirect protection?\" and \"Is paedi - atric influenza vaccination a better strategy to protect older adults against influenza than a switch from the trivalent to the quadrivalent influenza vaccine for older adults themselves?\". The following sections of this chapter provide background on cost-effectiveness analysis in general, infectious disease modelling, reaching a decision on implementation of a specific vaccination, and the diseases herpes zoster and influenza and their vaccination modalities.12 Chapter 1Cost-effectiveness analysis Cost-effectiveness analyses help policy makers to decide how to optimally allocate a limited health care budget in order to maximize health [10]. The main outcome of such analyses is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which expresses the extra costs paid to gain a single unit of benefit. The most often used measure of benefit is the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) that combines both quantity gains (averted mortality) and quality gains (averted morbidity) from health care interventions and thus allows the comparison of health care in- terventions across different diseases. Cost components included in the analysis depend on the adopted perspective of the analysis. The health care payer's perspective includes only costs that are incurred by the payer, such as costs of general practitioner consultations, prescribed drugs and hospital admissions. The societal perspective includes all costs borne by society, including also costs incurred by the patient or productivity losses due to missed work days. Infectious disease modelling The highest grade of economic evidence is obtained when cost-effectiveness analyses are conducted alongside clinical trials [11]. However, evidence from clinical trials can be mis- leading if the endpoints are not translated into measures that are valued by patients, health care providers, and the general public [12]. Clinical trials do not usually include all available comparator interventions, often exclude certain patient groups of interest, may be too small to monitor rare disease outcomes, define immunological rather than clinical endpoints, of- ten have a limited follow-up period, and may lack ability to analyse herd immunity effects. To overcome these limitations, mathematical modelling is used widely in health-economic evaluations. Models use evidence on health effects and costs from many different sources, including data from clinical trials, observational studies, insurance claim databases, case reg- istries, public-health statistics and preference surveys [12]. Different types of mathematic models can be used to model the burden of an infectious disease and the impact of vaccination. Generally, these models can be divided in two cate - gories: 'static' models and 'dynamic' models. Static models, such as decision trees or Mar - kov-models, are relatively simple models with a fixed force of infection irrespective of the proportion of the population that is infected and can transmit the infection [13]. Accordingly, static models are appropriate for infectious diseases that are non-transmissible between hu- mans (e.g. tetanus, or rabies), and may therefore be used for interventions that do not impact significantly on the transmission of infection (e.g. hepatitis A vaccination for travellers from low- to high-endemic countries), or interventions of which the effects are expected to be almost entirely direct (e.g. vaccination programmes against herpes zoster or influenza among older adults). However, static models are not appropriate when an intervention significantly 13 General introductionlimits the transmission of infection between humans (e.g. childhood vaccination programmes against varicella or influenza). If the transmission of the pathogen involved is reduced by a vaccination programme and coverage is sufficiently high, unvaccinated individuals are also indirectly protected against the disease. This indirect protection is referred to as herd immu - nity. However, reduced transmission can also result in negative indirect effects, such as an increased average age of infection that may be associated with more severe disease (vari- cella) [14], and an increased risk of congenital infections, for example, when the mother is ill during pregnancy (rubella) [15]. Only dynamic models are able to capture these indirect effects by assuming that the force of infection is dependent on the part of the population that is infected. As a consequence, dynamic models allow studying the transmission of infectious disease within and between different age-groups. Model calibration and validation In infectious disease models, specific parameter values may be uncertain because the param - eters are unobservable or have not been properly studied yet. Model calibration is a process of determining input parameter values so that model outputs best recapitulate the observed values of the same output parameters [16]. The calibration process can be used to estimate such unobserved parameters, or to identify the best fitting set (or most plausible sets) of input values, including observed and unobserved parameters. Next to model calibration, validation of the model is important since it provides policy makers with information on how accurately the model predicts the outcome of interest. Model validation is a process of subjecting the model to tests, such as comparing model results with events observed in reality [16]. The model can be validated internally by comparing its results with data used to develop the mod- el (is the model performing well mathematically?) or externally by comparing its results to other data sets. Model validation efforts also encompass other components such as the overall quality of the model (model structure, assumptions and input parameters), cross-validation to results of other models, and a subjective assessment or face validity [17]. Reaching a decision on implementation of a specific vac- cination As mentioned before, cost-effectiveness is one of the aspects considered in decision making on implementation of a certain vaccination strategy. Table 1 shows the decision framework that is used by the Health Council of the Netherlands to assess vaccine candidates for the national immunization programme (or \"Rijksvaccinatieprogramma\") [18]. Considerations include the seriousness and extent of the disease burden, effectiveness and safety of vacci - nation, its acceptability, its cost-effectiveness and the urgency of the urgent public-health issue. When vaccination does not serve a population-level benefit but prevents serious dis-14 Chapter 1ease in specific sub-groups, the Health Council of the Netherlands could also recommend offering vaccination within a public programme to promote equal access to 'essential health care' [19]. Then, vaccination should meet criteria on the seriousness of the individual disease burden involved, the effectiveness and safety of vaccination, and its cost-effectiveness. For instance, vaccination of older adults against HZ and influenza, the two diseases studied in this thesis, would qualify for essential health care rather than a population-level benefit, because these interventions aim to prevent individual disease among vaccinated individuals and not transmission of the infection. Table 1: Criteria for inclusion of vaccination in the national immunization programme (or \"Rijksvacci - natieprogramma\") of the Netherlands [8]. Seriousness and extent of the disease burden 1. The infectious disease causes considerable disease burden within the population. The infectious disease is serious for individuals. The infectious disease affects or has the potential to affect a large number of people. Effectiveness and safety of the vaccination 2. Vaccination may be expected to considerably reduce the disease burden within the population. The vaccine is effective for the prevention of disease or the reduction of symptoms. The necessary vaccination rate is attainable (if eradication/elimination or the creation of herd immunity is sought). 3. Any adverse effects associated with vaccination are not sufficient to substantially diminish the public health benefit. Acceptability of the vaccination 4. The inconvenience or discomfort that an individual may be expected to experience in connection with his/her personal vaccination is not disproportionate in relation to the health benefit for the individual concerned and the population as a whole. 5. The inconvenience or discomfort that an individual may be expected to experience in connection with the vaccination programme as a whole is not disproportionate in relation to the health benefit for the individual con- cerned and the population as a whole. Efficiency of the vaccination 6. The balance between the cost of vaccination and the associated health benefit compares favourably to that associated with other means of reducing the relevant disease burden. Priority of the vaccination 7. Relative to other vaccinations that might also be selected for inclusion, provision of this vaccination serves an urgent public health need at reasonable individual and societal costs. When used as a decision rule, the ICER of a cost-effectiveness analysis is often compared with an established willingness-to-pay threshold for the outcome of interest. For instance, the willingness-to-pay threshold adopted by the National Institute for Health and Care Ex- cellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom is \u00a315,000 to \u00a330,000 per QALY gained [20]. When the ICER lies above this threshold, the intervention is deemed too expensive and may not be funded. The Netherlands has no clear decision rule for the cost-effectiveness of public-health interventions, but for preventive measures such as vaccination the Health Council of the Netherlands considers an ICER below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained as cost-effective [21]. For introducing therapeutic measures in the basic health care insurance package, the National 15 General introductionHealth Care Institute uses cost-effectiveness thresholds of \u20ac20,000, \u20ac50,000 and \u20ac80,000 per QALY gained for diseases with low, moderate and high severity, respectively [21]. In view of the severity of some infectious diseases, the consistent use of the threshold at \u20ac20,000 per QALY in the Netherlands can be considered conservative for vaccines, and a threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained has been suggested for pneumococcal vaccination of children [22]. Vaccination against herpes zoster Clinical overview HZ is characterized by a painful, unilateral dermatomal rash. The life-time risk of HZ has been estimated at 20-30%, and its most important risk factors are older age and a compro- mised immune system [25, 26]. The is post-herpetic neu- ralgia (PHN), a potentially long-lasting pain syndrome with significant impact on the quality of life. PHN occurs in 3-19% of HZ patients, and its risk and severity increase with age [26- 28]. HZ-related mortality is rare [29]. caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which is a double-stranded DNA virus be- longing to the family of alpha-herpesviruses. Its primary infection causes varicella, a disease that occurs mostly in childhood and is characterized by fever and rash [23]. After primary infection, the virus remains latently present in the dorsal root ganglia. Natural immunity to VZV can be maintained through either endogenous or exogenous boosting; the former in response to subclinical reactivation of VZV and the latter from exposure to VZV in the community [24]. Herpes zoster occurs when VZV-specific immunity fails to contain viral reactivation. Live attenuated varicella vaccine The first vaccine developed against VZV is a live attenuated varicella vaccine that was li- censed in 1995. The varicella vaccine contains the live attenuated OKA VZV strain and is administered subcutaneously. Vaccination boosts both humoral immunity (production of VZV-specific antibodies) as well as cell-mediated immunity (VZV-specific T-cells), of which the latter is believed to cause the protective effect against VZV reactivation [23]. Some coun- tries have implemented VZV vaccination in their childhood immunization programmes. A meta-analysis from studies worldwide showed a vaccine effectiveness of 81% (95% confi- dence doses. Live-attenuated VZV can reactivate to cause HZ, but the incidence of HZ in vaccinated 16 Chapter 1children has shown to be significantly lower as compared to naturally infected children [30, 31]. Some countries have been hesitant to introduce varicella vaccination in the national immunization programme, as the reduction of wild-type VZV circulation reduces exogenous boosting, which may potentially increase the incidence of HZ in adults [32]. The Netherlands currently has no paediatric vaccination programme against varicella. Live attenuated HZ vaccine Since the increased risk of HZ with older age is due to waning of immunity against VZV , vac- cination with live attenuated VZV could also protect adults against HZ. In 2006, a live attenu - ated vaccine against HZ (Zoster vaccine live [ZVL]) was licensed. This ZVL vaccine in prin- ciple is the same as the varicella vaccine, but it contains a higher dose of the live attenuated vaccine against varicella [33]. ZVL is administered subcutaneously, and is only available for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older [34]; hence, the vaccine is contraindicated to immunocompromised patients. A large-scale clinical trial among immunocompetent older adults aged 60 years demonstrated that the overall efficacy against HZ was 51% (95%CI: 44-58%), and that the severity of disease among those affected was reduced [35]. However, the efficacy against HZ declined with increasing age, and the protection appeared to wane completely within 10 years [36]. ZVL causes no serious adverse events, although mild ad- verse events such as headache and local injection-site reactions have been reported [35]. Subunit HZ vaccine In 2018, a new HZ vaccine was registered that is a non-live recombinant subunit vaccine con- taining an immunoadjuvant (HZ/su) [37]. The vaccine is administered intramuscularly and contains the recombinant VZV glycoprotein E combined with the AS01B adjuvant system to enhance the immunological response [38]. HZ/su is licensed for all individuals aged 50 years and older; hence, the vaccine can also be given to immunocompromised patients [37]. The vaccine induces strong glycoprotein E-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity sufficient to elicit protection against reactivation of VZV [24]. A second dose given after two months improves cell-mediated immunity substantially [39]. Therefore, the vaccine is devel- oped for administration in two doses, given 2-6 months apart. Two large-scale clinical trials among immunocompetent older adults demonstrated that the efficacy of two doses was 97% (95%CI: 94-99%) in patients aged 50 years and 91% (95%CI: 80-97%) in patients aged 70 years [40, 41]. The duration of protection is currently unknown, but trial data showed a relatively stable efficacy over the 4 years of follow-up. HZ/su did not cause serious adverse events, although most vaccinated people reported pain, redness and swelling at the injection site [41]. About 1 out of 6 people experienced adverse events that prevented them from con- ducting their daily activities, although these symptoms resolved within 2-3 days. 17 General introductionVaccination against influenza Clinical overview Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. It is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms, including fever, cough, muscle pain, joint pain and sore throat. Globally, 5-10% of the adults and 20-30% of the children are annually infected with influen- za [42]. Possible complications due to influenza are a secondary bacterial infection including pneumonia and otitis media. Influenza infections may result in hospitalization or even death [43]. People at highest risk of severe complications are older adults, those with chronic un- derlying disease, pregnant women, and children below two years of age [44]. The annual number of influenza deaths worldwide has been estimated at 290,000-650,000, with most deaths in older adults aged 65 years [42]. In countries with temperate climates, influenza usually circulates in the winter season, while in countries with subtropical or tropical cli - mates year-round influenza activity is observed [45]. Influenza virus The influenza virus is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family of Orthomyxoviruses. In humans, three types of influenza viruses are circulating, influenza A, B and C, of which only influenza type A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics [46]. Influenza A is further subdivided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neur - aminidase (NA) surface proteins. Over the last few decades, influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes have been commonly circulating in humans. Influenza B viruses are broken down into two lineages. Current antigenically distinguishable influenza B lineages are B/Victoria and B/Yamagata. Influenza A subtypes and B lineages can be further broken down into dif- ferent strains. These strains exist due to continuous antigenic changes to escape the immune response of the host due to small changes during replication (antigenic drift), resulting in annual epidemics of seasonal influenza. When a new influenza A subtype emerges due to a major change in HA and/or NA proteins subtype (antigenic shift), a pandemic or severe glob- al epidemics of influenza occur, because most people do not have immunity [47]. Four major influenza pandemics have happened over the past century: the 1918 pandemic caused by the A/H1N1 virus (\"Spanish flu\"), the 1957-58 pandemic cause by the the 1967-68 pandemic cause by A/H3N2 (\"Hong Kong flu\") and the 2009 pandemic caused flu\" or \"Mexican flu\" ). rus, which was very different from A/H1N1 viruses circulating at that time, has now become one of the seasonal influenza viruses circulating each winter. Viruses that have caused past pandemics typically originated from animal viruses, especially from those circulating among birds.18 Chapter 1Influenza vaccination Most western countries have long-standing vaccination programmes against influenza. Tra- ditionally, these vaccination programmes focus on those at highest risk of complications, i.e. older adults and patients with certain chronic medical conditions. The Netherlands currently offers influenza vaccination free of charge to all adults aged 60 years and patients below 60 years with certain chronic medical conditions. Some other countries, most notably UK and Finland, also have introduced influenza vaccination for children. Next to direct protection, vaccination of children is also thought to reduce influenza spread in the population, indirectly protecting those at highest risk of complications. In the United States, influenza vaccination is recommended for all age-groups. Available influenza vaccines include inactivated influenza vaccines (IVs) and live attenuat - ed influenza vaccines (LAIVs) which will be discussed in more detail below. Traditionally, these vaccines were trivalent (TIVs), containing strains against two influenza A subtypes (A/ H1N1 and A/H3N2) and one B lineage (either B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage). Due to the antigenic drift of influenza viruses, the vaccine composition is updated annually according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, people need to be revaccinated every year before the start of the influenza season. Since 2012, the WHO also provides recommendations on the composition of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs). Quadrivalent vaccines contain one extra B-virus strain (one of each B/Victoria and B/Ya- magata) as compared to TIVs and are available in the US since the 2013/2014 season and in Europe since the 2014/2015 season. Inactivated vaccine Intramuscularly administered IVs are the most commonly used influenza vaccines and are licensed in Europe for individuals aged 6 months [48]. Its influenza antigen preparation varies between manufacturers containing either whole virus, split virus or subunit influen- za virus products. The main protective effect of IVs is based on the boosting of humoral immunity that is specific to the virus-strains included in the vaccine, but there is possibly also a cell-mediated immune response [49]. However, IVs do not generally induce cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, which are important in limiting disease severity and are cross-reactive to antigenically distinct influenza viruses. Therefore, repeated use of IVs in young children that that are immunologically na\u00efve to influenza viruses should be considered with caution, as it could inhibit the build-up of a broad long-lasting immune response, leaving them more susceptible to pandemic strains. 19 General introductionThe efficacy of influenza vaccines varies per season, country, virus and age-group. A me- ta-analysis of clinical trials estimated the efficacy of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) against [RR] 0.42; 0.27- 0.66) in older adults aged 65 years [50]. However, as most clinical trials were conducted more than a decade ago, recent evidence on vaccine effectiveness derives from observational data of implemented influenza vaccination programmes. A recent meta-analysis of test-neg - ative design studies estimated the vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influ- enza in older adults aged 60 years at 44% (95%CI: 23-60%) when the vaccine matched the circulating viruses and 20% (95%CI: 3-34%) when the vaccine did not match the circulating viruses [51]. Vaccine efficacy is higher in children as compared to older adults. A meta-anal - ysis of clinical trial data estimated the vaccine efficacy of TIV against laboratory-confirmed influenza at 64% attenuated influenza vaccine Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is an intranasally administered influenza vaccine. In Europe, LAIV is registered for children aged 2-17 years and since 2014/2015 only the quadrivalent available [53]. LAIV contains a temperature-sensitive vari- ant of the influenza virus that replicates well in the nasopharynx but poorly in the lower respi- ratory tract [54]. LAIV induces a humoral response as well as a cellular response including cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and also induces a local antibody response in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract [49]. Given that LAIVs induce a broader immune response that more closely resembles a natural infection, LAIV is the preferred vaccine candidate for children that are immunologically na\u00efve to influenza viruses. However, LAIVs are less effective in adults, presumably because pre-existing humoral immunity against influenza blocks replica - tion of the attenuated vaccine virus. In clinical trials, LAIV showed higher efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in children as compared to IV . A meta-analysis of trial data estimated the efficacy of LAIV at 78% (RR 0.22; 95%CI: 0.11-0.41) in children aged 2-16 years [52]. However, recent observational data do not confirm the superior efficacy of LAIV , as studies reported lower, similar or higher vaccine effectiveness estimates of LAIV as com- pared to IV [55].20 Chapter 1Thesis outline The thesis is structured in two parts. Part I focuses on the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies against HZ and part II on the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies against influenza. Part I: Herpes zoster After the results of a large clinical trial of ZVL were published in 2005, a variety of cost-ef- fectiveness analyses have been performed in different countries using different models and assumptions. In Chapter 2, we reviewed the international literature on the cos-effectiveness of vaccination against HZ for older adults with ZVL. In Chapter 3, we present results of a cost-effectiveness analysis of ZVL in older adults in the Netherlands. As the burden of HZ increases with age but the efficacy of ZVL decreases with age, we performed an age-strati - fied analysis to determine the optimum age of vaccination. When HZ/su became available in 2018, decision makers needed health-economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of vacci - nation with HZ/su and how the vaccine compared with ZVL. The efficacy of HZ/su is higher, but vaccination is presumably also more expensive as double dosing is required. In Chapter 4, we compared the cost-effectiveness of HZ/su and ZVL for older adults in the Netherlands. We determined for each vaccine, dosing strategy and age of vaccination, the maximum costs per vaccination course to equal the conventional Dutch willingness-to-pay thresholds. In Chapter 5, we briefly discuss results of a cost-effectiveness analysis of varicella vaccination in the Netherlands in order to illustrate that HZ vaccination may also have value to counter a potential increase in HZ incidence in older adults following the introduction of a varicella vaccination programme among children. Such an increase in HZ incidence in older adults may occur when the varicella vaccination programme eliminates exogenous immune boost- ing against VZV [32, 56]. Part II: Influenza When QIVs came available in the period 2013-2015, decision makers were in need of evi- dence regarding whether a switch from traditionally used TIVs to QIVs would provide good value for money. In Chapter 6, we reviewed the international literature on cost-effectiveness analyses comparing QIV with TIV . Chapter 7 presents a cost-effectiveness analysis com- paring QIV with TIV for the current programme in the United States. As the United States recommends influenza vaccination for all ages and has high coverage in children, we used a dynamic model for this analysis. Besides high-income countries, low- and middle-income countries are also dealing with the question as to whether influenza vaccination should be introduced, and if so, whether QIV or TIV provides best value for money. Chapter 8 shows a cost-effectiveness analysis of influenza vaccination of older adults and HIV patients in 21 General introductioncommunities in South Africa and Vietnam using an individual-based dynamic model, and these findings were contrasted to results from a high-income community in Australia. The Annex to Chapter 8 contains additional results on what would happen if the additional money spent on QIV was used to stimulate the uptake of TIV . Chapter 9 describes the epi- demiological impact and cost-effectiveness of a paediatric influenza vaccination programme in the Netherlands using a dynamic transmission model. As children are acknowledged to be the driver of influenza transmission, such a programme is expected to not only protect the children themselves but to also reduce the disease burden among older adults via herd im- munity. In addition, the study contains results of modelling a switch from TIV to QIV for the current target groups. As model validation and transparency of cost-effectiveness analysis are deemed important for sound decision making, Chapter 10 describes a systematic review of modelling studies on seasonal influenza (and one other selected oncological disease area for comparison) to investigate and evaluate which model validation efforts had been performed.

Lancet 2002, Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zosterChapter 2 Cost-effectiveness of vaccination herpes zoster De zoster (HZ) is a common disease among elderly, which may develop into a severe pain syndrome labeled postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). A live-attenuated varicella zoster virus vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence and burden of illness of HZ and PHN, providing the opportunity to prevent significant health-related and financial conse- quences of HZ. In this review, we summarize the available literature on the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination and discuss critical parameters for cost-effectiveness results. A search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed to identify full cost-effectiveness studies published before April 2013. Fourteen cost-effectiveness studies were included, all performed in west- ern countries. All studies evaluated cost-effectiveness among elderly above 50 years and used costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained as primary outcome. The vast major - ity of studies showed that vaccination of 60- to 75-year-old individuals would be cost-effec- tive, when the duration of vaccine efficacy was longer than 10 years. The duration of vaccine efficacy, vaccine price, HZ incidence, HZ incidence and discount rates were influential to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). HZ vaccination may be a worthwhile interven - tion from a cost-effectiveness point of view. More extensive reporting on methodology and more detailed results of sensitivity analyses would be desirable to address uncertainty and to guarantee optimal comparability between studies, for example regarding model structure, discounting, vaccine characteristics and loss of quality of life due to HZ and PHN.29 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination [HZ]). Varicella commonly occurs during childhood and is regarded as a mild self-limiting disease [1]. After remission, however, the virus remains latent, residing in the sensory nerve ganglia of the dorsal root, and can be reactivated decades later in life [2]. This reactivation episode is labeled HZ and is characterized by a painful dermatomal skin rash [1]. The lifetime risk to encounter HZ has been estimated at 20-30% [3], and the probability to develop HZ as well as the severity of pain increase with age [4,5]. Besides age, other risk-factors to HZ are a com- promised or suppressed immune system and the female gender [6,7]. Although the rash heals within a month [8], complications might occur. The most serious complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined as a neuropathic pain persisting longer than three months [9]. It has been estimated that approximately 8-33% of HZ patients develop PHN, and the risk increases with age [4,10-12]. Pain due to PHN may remain for months or even years [13,14], and available therapeutic options are only partially effective [15]. PHN has been shown to have a substantial impact on the patient's quality of life and functional status. Often reported sequelae of PHN comprise sleeping problems, chronic fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and depression, resulting in substantial interference with social life and self-care [4,14,16,17]. In 2006, a VZV vaccine with the tradename Zostavax\u00ae (Sanofi-Pasteur/MSD) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [18,19]. Zostavax\u00ae contains a live attenuated strain of VZV and is thought to induce primarily T-cell-mediated immunity against VZV . A large double-blind placebo-con - trolled clinical trial including 38,546 immunocompetent adults 60 y of age (Shingles Pre- vention Study [SPS]) has demonstrated that the vaccine reduces the incidence of HZ by 51%, the pain burden by 61%, and the incidence of PHN by 67% [20,21]. However, the vaccine-induced protection seems to decline with age, with an efficacy against HZ of 64% among individuals of 60 to 69 y of age and 38% in individuals aged 70 y or older [20,21]. A more recent trial additionally showed that efficacy against HZ was 70% among of 50 to 59 y of age [22]. Regarding safety of the vaccine, multiple studies have shown that Zostavax\u00ae is well-tolerated and that side reactions are generally mild [20,23-26]. However, as the mean follow-up time of the SPS was limited to 3.1 y [20,21], the duration of the vaccine protection is still unknown. A short-term persistence substudy (STPS) of the SPS recently showed that vaccine efficacy persists for at least 7 y, but also demonstrated that protection is waning in time [27]. The vaccine is contraindicated for immunocompromised patients, as it comprises a live attenuated virus [19]. Given all this evidence, vaccination against HZ might be an interesting option for introduc - tion into national immunization programs. Besides reducing the disease burden itself, pre-30 Chapter 2vention of HZ and PHN may yield a significant benefit in limiting the economic burden to the healthcare. For instance, in the US, healthcare costs per acute episode of HZ were estimated at $431 and in the UK, healthcare costs of HZ and PHN were estimated at \u00a3103 and \u00a3397 per episode, respectively [28,29]. After the results of the SPS were published, multiple cost-effectiveness analyses for different countries have been performed. The aim of this review is to summarize and synthesize the literature on cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination against HZ and to identify those input parameters that are crucial in determining cost-effectiveness outcomes. 2. Methods 2.1 Search strategy A bibliographic search was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE for relevant papers as- sessing the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination (April 10, 2013). The search was restricted to the English language and the search algorithm was as follows: 'economic evaluation' OR 'pharmacoeconomics'). The search was limited to articles with an abstract. Only cost-effectiveness studies of HZ vaccination were assessed and original full papers were considered; reviews, editorials and letters were excluded. We screened titles, abstracts and finally the full content of the articles identified and selected. Studies on varicella vacci - nation only were excluded. Studies combining varicella and HZ vaccination were excluded in the main analysis, but briefly discussed in a separated section. A manual examination of reference sections of included papers was performed in order to identify further material of interest (snowballing). 2.2 Synthesis of results We focused in particular on those variables exhibiting a large impact on the cost-effective - ness and we assessed these parameters critically. Obviously, our analysis plan comprised a review of the main characteristics of the studies, including type of analysis, perspective, targeted population, time horizon, discount rates and a short description of main results. Furthermore, results were stratified by vaccination age, as incidence of HZ, risk to PHN and vaccine efficacies are highly dependent on age. Finally, we analyzed per study which parameters influenced cost-effectiveness results significantly. To improve the comparability of the selected studies, costs were standardized to 2006 euros according to country-specific harmonized consumer price indices. If the costing year was not provided in the study, we assumed a costing year of 'publication year - 3 y'. Studies were evaluated with regards to 31 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zostervarious aspects, including model type, perspective taken and quality according to previously defined criteria. 3. Results 3.1 Study selection A total of 369 studies were found in MEDLINE and EMBASE. After evaluation of titles, abstracts or full contents, 18 studies were identified that assessed the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination. Two studies were excluded, because full texts were not available [30,31]. However, their main results will be briefly mentioned when cost-effectiveness results are discussed. Two studies were excluded from the main analysis, but described in a separated section, because they assessed the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination combined with var - icella vaccination [32,33]. Finally 14 cost-effectiveness studies of HZ vaccination remained and were systematically reviewed [34-47]. 3.2 Main study characteristics Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the included studies ordered by publication date. Several studies did not mention all the main features reported in Table 1, such as time horizon, costing year, sensitivity analysis and funding. In these cases, we estimated most plausible values and options and explicitly marked this in the table. 3.2.1. Country and funding Of the 14 studies included, 9 were conducted in European countries (UK, Belgium, The Neth- erlands, Switzerland and France) [34, 40-47] and 5 in non-European countries (US and Can- ada) [35-39]. Six studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry [36,38,41,42,44,46], five studies by public resources [34,37,39,40,43,45], and two studies were performed without external funding [35,47]. 3.2.2. Type of analysis All 104 studies used the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as primary outcome, in which costs are expressed as monetary units and effects as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. Several studies also performed a cost-effectiveness analysis, presenting re- sults as costs per averted HZ case [36,41,42,44,46], per averted PHN case [36,41,42,44,46] or per life year gained [34].32 Chapter 2 Table 1: Main characteristics and results of the included studies Reference; countryType of analysisModel analysisCost-effectiveness results, ICER (cost (Short description of the studies in Appendix B)Funding Edmunds et al. year old assuming 10 year protection and \u00a33560 assuming lifelong protection (\u00a380 per vaccine course).Public Hornberger et al.

Model design and alternatives A total of 13 studies used a \"traditional\" decision analytic model to calculate the cost-ef- fectiveness of vaccination against HZ [34-47]. Decision models which were predominantly used concern cohort models and Markov models. One study used discrete event simula - tion (DES) modeling [39]. DES models are able to track the process of individual patients through particular states instead of cohorts. This provides the model with a 'memory func- tion' because specific attributes can be assigned to individuals and might in specific situa- tions provide a superior alternative over adding \"tunnel states\" into the Markov model to artificially create memory. Within the context of the 14 studies analyzed, a total of 9 different models were used [34,35,37-40,42,45,47], as some authors adapted already available models [36,41,43,44,46]. As no country already implemented HZ vaccination in its national immu - nization program when the analysis was performed, all studies compared routine vaccination against HZ with no such vaccination. 3.2.4. Perspective The perspective that was most often used is that of the health-care payer, which only includes medical costs [34,36,38,40- 43,45-47]. A total of 8 studies used the societal perspective, tak- ing into account medical costs as well as costs due to productivity losses [35-37,41-44,47]. The third-party payer's (TPP) perspective, only including reimbursed medical costs, was used by four studies [39,41,44,46]. Notably, one study can provide results from multiple perspectives. 3.2.5. Target group and time horizon All studies targeted on population groups of 60 y of age or higher, however, some studies also assessed vaccination ages below this age [34,38,41,42]. Vaccination age was explicitly varied in sensitivity analyses by all studies. Most studies indicated that vaccination was re- stricted to the immunocompetent population [35-37,39-44,46,47], as the manufacturer of the VZV vaccine states that immunocompromised patients are contraindicated for the vaccine [19]. Only one study considered a scenario in which also immunocompromised patients would be vaccinated [45]. All studies used the life-time horizon [34-47]. 3.2.6. Discounting Discounting adjusts benefits and costs for the so-called 'time preference', since it is generally advantageous to receive a benefit earlier or to pay costs later (see Appendix A in Supplemen - tal material). The discount rates applied are highly dependent on national guidelines of the country for which the analysis is performed. A total of 9 studies applied an equal discount rate for costs and health effects [34-40,42,46], and 5 studies discounted costs at an higher rate than QALYs (differential discounting) [41,43-45,47].35 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster3.2.7. Sensitivity analysis To deal with uncertainty, studies generally perform sensitivity analyses investigating the im- pact of varying parameters on the study results (see Appendix A in Supplemental material for detailed information on different types of sensitivity analyses). All reviewed studies per - formed a one-way sensitivity analysis [34-47]. In addition, two studies performed a multi - way sensitivity analysis [37,45], and nine studies a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) [35,37-43,46]. 3.2.8. Quality assessment A review of Szucs et al. [49] evaluated the quality of 11 of the included studies using the Brit- ish Medical Journal (BMJ)'s checklist by Drummond and Jefferson [50], and the \"Quality of Health Economic Studies\" evaluation tool by Ofman et al. [51]. Szucs et al. [49] concluded that the quality of these studies varied from 'Moderate' [37, 38, 4337, 38, 43] to 'Moder - ate-Good' [35,36,39-42,44]. We assessed the three other included studies using the same criteria as Szucs et al. [49] used. The study of Bilcke et al. [45] was judged as 'Good' and the study of Bresse et al. [46] and de Boer et al. [47] were evaluated as 'Moderate-Good'. 3.3 Main input parameters An overview of input parameters used for the four important domains, i.e., epidemiological, QALY losses, vaccine characteristics and costs are shown in Table 2. 3.3.1. Epidemiological input HZ incidence is an important parameter in economic evaluations of HZ vaccination given the direct relation with HZ and PHN cases potentially to be prevented. Table 2 shows that the ranges of HZ incidence used in the various studies vary little between different countries. Studies performed in the US seem to use on average somewhat higher incidence rates as compared with the rates used in European studies, especially in the age range of 60-70 y [35- 37,39]. Logically, the HZ incidence increases with age in all studies. Multiple studies used HZ incidence rates adjusted to a immunocompetent population to be in line with the included population of the vaccine efficacy data [35, 36,39,40,42,43,45]. Concerning PHN incidence, most studies quantified the number of PHN cases directly from the number of HZ cases by using proportions [34-47]. One study used a different method by quantifying HZ on the basis of a severity of illness score, in which the burdens of HZ and PHN are combined [45]. The proportion of HZ cases developing PHN varied extensively between the studies. For exam - ple, in a Dutch study the proportion PHN cases out of HZ ranged between 4.7-11.7% among the different age groups [47], whereas a British study used a range of 9-52% [40]. 36 Chapter 2 Table 2: Input data of main parameters of the included studies Reference; countryHZ incidence per 10,000 person years (range)aProportion of PHN cases (range)aAverage PHN durationProportion of cases in each pain stateUtilities Vaccine efficacy [base or (range)a]Duration of protection (years) [base (range)]Vaccination costs in \u20ac2006 (range) Edmunds et herpes zosterReference; countryHZ incidence per years (range)aProportion of PHN cases (range)aAverage PHN durationProportion of cases in each pain stateUtilities Vaccine efficacy [base or (range)a]Duration of protection (years) [base (range)]Vaccination costs in lands(50.9-116.9) As Van Hoek et al. 40As Van Hoek et al. 40As Van Hoek et al. 40As Van year, SOI: Severity of illness. a Depending on age and (minimum and maximum values are given), b PHN proportions after 1 month, c PHN proportion after 6 months, d Calculated by the authors. e PHN proportions after 3 months, f If duration PHN longer than 12 months, g Total QALY loss per HZ episodeTable 2: Input data of main parameters of the included studies ( continued )38 Chapter 2A compromising factor in comparing the studies was the way PHN was defined in the mod- els. In most studies, PHN was defined as pain persisting longer than 3 mo [36-40,43,46,47], but other studies used PHN proportions after 1 mo [34,41,42,44], or after 6 mo [35]. Conse- quently, also the duration of PHN differed among the various studies - 8.3 mo to 4.2 - y, as this is directly related to the definition of PHN used. 3.3.2. QALY losses The calculation of the QALYs gained depends on two parameters, i.e., the weight of the health-related quality of life attributed to a health state of disease (utility) and the time spent in this health state (general information on utilities can be found in Appendix A in Supple- mental material). For a detailed look into the health effects of HZ and PHN, we refer to a recently published paper of Drolet et al. [15]. Table 2 shows that most studies split up HZ and PHN in mild, moderate and severe pain states, according to the validated pain inventory measurement Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) [525], which was also used in the SPS. The assignment of HZ and PHN cases between the different pain states differs among the selected studies. Some studies assigned around 20% of HZ/PHN cases as moderate/severe [34,40], while in other studies this proportion varied between 58-83% of PHN, depending on the age of diagnosis [41,42,44,46,47]. Consequently, also the PHN duration varied between these studies, with studies reporting lower proportions of moderate/severe cases applying longer PHN durations (Table 2). Pain severity and pain duration were influential for the cost-effectiveness results. For example, the study of Moore et al. [42] showed that using data on pain severity/pain duration from a general practitioner's database instead of the SPS study increased the ICER from \u20ac19,003 per QALY gained to \u20ac36,908 per QALY gained. In the selected studies, some differences were present in assigning utilities to HZ and PHN. Most studies assigned equal utilities to pain caused by HZ or PHN, while two studies dis- tinguished between these two diseases [35,37]. One study combined QALY loss of HZ and PHN in a severity of illness measurement [45]. In the study of Van Hoek et al. [40], a model was used to determine weights of health related quality of life from several pain severity states of HZ in time, using 6 studies of EQ-5D. EQ-5D is an generic instrument quantifying quality of life taking into account five dimensions of health status [53]. Regarding utilities, the weight of mild pain ranged between 0.69-0.77 and of severe pain between 0.25-0.55. Because the vaccine was regarded as safe and side effects were generally mild and restricted to local reactions at the vaccination side, only two studies included a QALY penalty for side effects [35,37].39 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster3.3.3. Vaccine characteristics Concerning vaccine efficacy, 13 studies used data from the SPS [20,21], the only clinical trial supplying data on this aspect. One study was forced to assume a vaccine efficacy rate, because it was performed before the SPS was conducted [34]. Yet, when vaccine efficacy against HZ incidence between selected studies was compared, differences were observed (Table 2). These differences can be assigned to two main causes. First, the SPS has shown that HZ vaccine efficacy depends on the age of vaccination, being lower in the higher age groups. This trend was applied or modeled differently among the analyzed studies, result- ing in differences in vaccine efficacy. Second, the duration of vaccine-induced protection is still unknown. Several studies have imposed waning function in their base-case analysis and among them two studies have combined this parameter within the vaccine efficacy function itself [40,43]. The used duration of protection in the base-case analysis ranged from 7.5 y [40,43] to a lifetime protection [36,38,41,42,44]. All industry-funded studies except one as- sumed lifelong vaccine-induced protection in their base-case analyses, while publicly funded studies were more conservative by assuming limited durations of protection. Notably, all studies explicitly varied the duration of vaccine-induced protection in the sensitivity anal - yses. The study of Bilcke et al. [45] also assessed the influence of the type of function used to model vaccine efficacy on cost-effectiveness results. This was based on previous work of the same authors [54], in which was evaluated what function of time since vaccination and age at vaccination fitted the data of the SPS and STPS best. Although the results showed that models with different functions (e.g., linear, logarithmic, exponential etc.) fitted the data comparably, they differ substantially in how they estimate vaccine efficacy as a function of time and age of vaccination. Notably, the study of Bilcke et al. [45] demonstrated that func- tion type influences cost-effectiveness substantially in age-cohorts >75 y in the scenario most in favor of vaccination (includes waning of vaccine efficacy in time). Besides efficacy against HZ incidence, most studies included additional efficacy of vacci - nation toward PHN [35,36,38,39,41,42,46,47,49], or toward the burden of disease (BOI) [35,37,40-46] in the base-case scenario. Two studies imposed additional efficacy against PHN in a scenario analysis [40,43]. A general note regarding this additional efficacy is that the SPS publications reported efficacy against BOI and incidence of PHN for the entire pop- ulation, and not just for those who developed HZ [20,21]. Thus, these measures incorporated the decreasing HZ incidence, which implies that vaccine efficacy rates against PHN and BOI should be corrected before it can be directly applied on the BOI or the risk on PHN per HZ case itself. Studies demonstrated that after this correction, additional vaccine efficacy against PHN or BOI might only be present above the age of 70 [37,55].40 Chapter 23.3.4. Costs In general, a distinction can be made between medical costs and societal costs. All studies included the three major direct cost burdens, i.e., GP costs, hospitalization costs and drug costs. Four studies used cost data specified for the immunocompetent population, as this is the targeted population [36,40,42,47]. Societal costs due to productivity losses were included in 8 of the 14 studies [35-37,41-44,47]. Cost parameters were not regarded as influential parameters in many studies. Just one study reported that PHN costs had a large impact on the ICER [36]. Since the targeted population consisted of the elderly in all studies, indirect costs did not influence the ICER to a considerable extent, as the labor participation among the vaccinated population is generally low. However, since the age of retirement will probably rise in most countries due to healthy aging, this might change in the future. As the vaccine price was still unknown at the moment of analysis of the studies, authors had to assume the vaccine price. Although the vaccine price for the private sector is nowadays known in some countries, it is not clear which reduction can be expected when the vaccine is bought in bulk quantities. Figure 1 shows the vaccination costs used among the selected studies (expressed in 2006 euros). These vaccination costs include the vaccine price as well as the costs of vaccine administration. When only a range of vaccine prices was presented, vaccination costs as used in the sensitivity analysis were taken. Not all studies differentiated vaccination costs between vaccine price and administration costs. Among studies stating the separated vaccine price, the price varied between \u20ac65 and \u20ac154. The total vaccination costs ranged from \u20ac 83 to \u20ac223. Highest vaccination costs were used by Hornberger et al. [35], ranging from $50 to $500 and using a value of $200 in the one-way sensitivity analysis. Notably, industry-funded studies used on average higher vaccine prices in the base-case as compared with studies funded from other sources. Among the six studies with the highest vaccine price, five studies were funded by industry [35,36,41,42,44,46]. The vaccine pricelist of the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) of 2013 presents a price per dose of $166 and $114 for the private sector and CDC itself, respectively [56]. This would imply a 30% reduction for buying the vaccine in bulk quantities. As authors were forced to assume the vaccine price, this parameter was explicitly altered in the sensitivity analysis by all studies.41 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster Fig. 1: Cost of vaccination per single dose as used in base-case scenario. 3.5 Cost-effectiveness results 3.5.1. Overall Effects of HZ vaccination on health outcomes and related QALY gains, incremental costs and cost-effectiveness results are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. Generally, cost-effective - ness studies assuming a life-long duration of vaccine-induced protection showed the lowest ICERs, in the range of \u20ac5000 - \u20ac25,000 per QALY gained [36,38,41,42,44]. Studies assum- ing a shorter duration of protection (range 7.5 and 15 y) in their base-case analysis found higher ICERs, varying between \u20ac25,000 - \u20ac40,000 per QALY gained [39,40,43,47]. Two studies reported ICERs in the range of \u20ac10,000-15,000, despite a duration of protection that was limited to 10 y [34,46]. For Edmunds et al. [34] this could be explained by the fact this study was performed before the SPS results came out and therefore assumed a relatively high vaccine efficacy of 70% for all age groups. In the study of Bresse et al. [46], a relatively high amount of medical costs were prevented as compared with other studies. Two studies for the US showed ICERs exceeding \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained [35,37]. This might be explained by that both studies assigned lower QALY losses to HZ and PHN cases as compared with other studies. Moreover, the study of Hornberger et al. [35] assumed a relatively high vaccine price and a low risk to develop PHN. One study was difficult to compare with other studies, because only best-case and worst-case scenarios were presented in the results, representing an extremely broad range of for instance \u20ac2294 to \u20ac73,513 per QALY gained for vaccinating a cohort of 70 y olds. 42 Chapter 2 Table 3: Modelled health and economic impact of vaccinating 1 million elderly against HZ and least fa - vorable per QALY gained])Influential parameters Edmunds vaccine efficacy, quality-of-life adjustment, risk for HZ baseline QALY (duration, cost, efficacy, and side effects), PHN variables (incidence, du - ration, and utility, HZ variables (incidence and severity), dis - count rate Brisson et al.

Only the Dutch study of Van Lier et al. [43] concluded that vaccination was marginally cost-effective from the societal perspective as well as from the health care payer's perspective [43]. However, in this study a cost-effec- tiveness threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained was applied, which is low compared with that of other countries or compared with the GDP per capita of the Netherlands. When a threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained would be used, a value which also has been suggested for the Netherlands, the results of Van Lier et al. [43] would be regarded as cost-effective. Two German studies on cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination were identified, but not includ - ed because full content was not available for evaluation [30,31]. The study of Wasem et al. [30] found that vaccination of people above 60 y of age was cost-effective with an ICER of \u20ac20,139 per QALY gained from the TPP's perspective. The study of Ultsch et al. [31] pre- sented no cost-utility results, but found that vaccination of a cohort aged 50-54 y would cost \u20ac280 per HZ case prevented from the societal perspective.

[45] the mean between the best case and worst case scenario was taken. 45 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster3.5.2. Optimal vaccination age Table 3 shows that cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination varies significantly over a range of vaccination ages. Different optimal vaccination ages were found and this was also de- pendent on the duration of vaccine efficacy which was assumed. Studies with limited du- rations of vaccine protection found an optimum vaccination age in the range of 70 y to 75 y [37,39,43,46,47], while studies assuming life-long protection reported ages between 60 y and 69 y as most beneficial [35,36,41,42,44]. Also inclusion of additional efficacy against PHN and BOI or not was an important factor to determine the optimal vaccination age. For instance, the study of Van Hoek et al. [40], considering no additional efficacy against PHN in the base-case scenario, found an optimum age of 65 y. However, when additional protection against PHN was taken into account, the optimum vaccination age increased to 75 y . 3.5.3. Gender Two studies also stratified results by gender [37,47]. Both studies concluded that vaccination of women is more cost-effective than vaccination of men, because HZ incidence is higher among women (Table 3). 3.5.4. Influential parameters for cost-effectiveness Sensitivity analyses provide information on which parameters can be regarded as most in- fluential to the cost-effectiveness ratio. Parameters most often considered as influential are the duration of vaccine efficacy and the vaccine price (Table 3). All studies except one [46] showed that duration of vaccine-induced protection or waning rate affected the ICER consid- erably. Only two studies came to the conclusion that vaccine price does not have a high im- pact on cost-effectiveness [41,42]. Other often mentioned parameters influencing the ICER largely were vaccine efficacy [34,37,40,47], HZ incidence [40,44,47], and discount rates [37,39,41-44,46]. Also utilities, pain severity split and duration of HZ and especially PHN, all involved in the calculation of the QALY losses, was reported to influence cost-effective - ness outcomes largely [34,35,39,42,44,46,47]. 3.6 Combined varicella and zoster vaccination strategies An interesting target of HZ vaccination might be the use in combination with varicella vac- cination. As mentioned in the introduction, VZV is responsible for varicella as well as HZ. However, it has been hypothesized decades ago that re-exposure to circulating VZV could inhibit the reactivation of VZV [2]. This theory is also known as the 'exogenous boosting' theory and would imply that if adults come into contact with varicella infected children, their immunity against VZV is boosted and consequently the risk of developing HZ reduc- es. Consequently, in case universal varicella vaccination among children is implemented, a 46 Chapter 2temporary increase of HZ incidence might arise due to an absence of exogenous boosting. Although the exact consequences of this theory are still under debate [57- 63], a recently published systematic review concluded that exogenous boosting exists, however it seems not to account for all populations and all situations [64]. As mentioned above, two studies were found analyzing the cost-effectiveness of a combined varicella and HZ vaccination program [32,33]. Both studies used an dynamic transmission model which accounted for passive immunity (herd immunity), age structures, gradual loss of vaccine or disease-acquired immunity and social contact mixing patterns [65]. The two studies also included the effect of exogenous boosting in their base-case analysis. The re- sults showed that both models predicted an increase of HZ incidence in at least the first five decades following varicella vaccination, depending on the duration of protection of natural boosting. As HZ has a much higher disease burden than varicella, varicella vaccination was not expected to be cost-effective within a time frame of 50 y, but might be cost-effective when an infinite time-horizon is used. Both studies demonstrated that combining varicella vaccination for children with HZ vaccination for elderly is more cost-effective than varicella vaccination alone. In the study of Van Hoek et al. [32], the probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 70% of the simulations were cost-effective for the combined vaccina - tion strategy and 50% of the simulations for varicella vaccination alone (willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 per QALY gained, infinite time horizon). In the study of Bilcke et al. [33], the time horizon in which more than 50% of the simulations was cost-effective (thresh- old \u20ac35,000 per QALY gained) decreased from 99 y to 90 y, when HZ vaccination was added to varicella vaccination. The time horizon could decline further to 56 y, when the duration of protection of the HZ vaccine is extended to lifelong. 4. Discussion This review assesses the available literature on health-economic evaluations of HZ vacci - nation. To assure that no studies examining the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination were missed, the search was performed within two distinct databases using an extensive range of related search-terms. Moreover, reference lists of potential articles were additionally screened. A total of 14 studies were included for extensive review. All studies concluded that HZ zoster might be cost-effective; however, this was not the case in all scenarios and at all vaccination ages. Generally, all studies showed that vaccination against HZ is cost-effective when vaccination is administered between the age of 60 y and 75 y and the duration of vac- cine-induced protection is longer than 10 y. These findings are consistent with other reviews summarizing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination [15,49]. However, com- pared with the review of Szucz et al. [49], three more studies were included. Moreover, this review contains more specific data on the clinical results found in the studies, the influence 47 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zosterof the modeling of vaccine efficacy on cost-effectiveness results and the optimum age of vac- cination. Finally, results from studies combining HZ vaccination with varicella vaccination were also summarized. Differences in modeling approaches and input parameters hampered a straightforward comparison of the cost-effectiveness studies. It should however be noted that the heterogeneity between studies supports the credibility and robustness of HZ vaccina - tion as a cost-effective intervention. The major key drivers for cost-effectiveness turn out to be duration of vaccine-induced protection, vaccine price and vaccination age. Most studies targeted elderly above the age of 60 y, because this age-group was included in the SPS study providing evidence on vaccine efficacy [20,21]. Later studies also included vaccination ages between 50 and 60 y, when efficacy data specifically for this age-group came available [22]. The optimal vaccination age from cost-effectiveness point of view rang- es between 60 and 75, depending on duration of vaccine-induced protection and additional efficacy against BOI and PHN above the age of 70. To provide insight in the optimal vacci - nation age, modeling is needed, as several input parameters vary over age. On one hand, the SPS has shown that vaccine efficacy decreases during aging, which would imply that vacci - nating at younger age would be more cost-effective. On the other hand, the incidence of HZ and the risk to develop PHN after HZ reactivation increases with age. A crucial role in this specific research question is reserved for the duration of vaccine protection. As mentioned, some studies assumed that the duration of vaccine-induced protection is lifelong, while oth- ers assumed durations varying from 7.5 to 15 y. It seems plausible that, assuming life-long protection, the scenario with the youngest vaccination age would be most cost-effective, be- cause in that case the vaccines are protected earlier. However, this is not necessarily the case. Among the six studies using lifelong protection in the base-case analysis [36,38,41,42,44], or almost lifelong (30 y) [35], five studies indeed showed that the optimum vaccination age was in the younger age-groups (range 60-69 y). However, among three of these five studies also a scenario of vaccination between 50-59 y was applied, which means that the youngest vaccination age was not necessarily the most cost-effective vaccination age. The study of Brisson et al. [38] even found an optimum vaccination age of 70 y, unless a lifelong protec- tion was assumed. Responsible for this potentially counterintuitive phenomenon is the dis- counting factor. HZ and PHN incidence is highest beyond the age of 70. Assuming life-long protection, these cases are prevented independent of vaccination age. However, the counting of discountable years starts at the time-point of vaccination and as costs and QALYs are generally saved beyond the age of 70, outcomes are much more affected by discounting if the vaccination age is 50 y than if the age of 70 y. This explains why the youngest age is not necessarily the most optimal vaccination age even if a lifelong protection is assumed, but ages in the range of 60 to 70 y.48 Chapter 2The major limitation within assessing the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination is the un- known duration of vaccine-induced protection. Up to now, protection has been shown to persist for at least 7 y [27]. Assumptions concerning duration of vaccine-induced protection vary from 7.5 y to lifelong. Follow-up of vaccine efficacy has to be maintained to provide more certainty about the duration of protection. To address uncertainty of duration of vaccine protection toward cost-effectiveness results, studies should vary this duration for specific age-groups as this duration might be age-dependent [54]. Another limitation is the unknown vaccine price when the vaccine is bought in bulk quantities. As this is generally kept confi- dential by pharmaceutical companies, such information unfortunately will not be available for cost-effectiveness analyses. Studies funded by pharmaceutical companies assumed in general a lifelong vaccine induced protection, which provides the opportunity to generate cost-effective results in the base-case analysis while using significant higher vaccine prices. Concerning HZ incidence, data was mainly obtained from general practitioners (GP) data - bases. Using such a source implies a risk for underestimation if not all HZ patients visit a GP. Incidence rates were similar between different studies, although in the United States it seemed somewhat higher. However, this might also be caused by differences in the surveil- lance systems. A recently published study showed that HZ incidences were similar between European countries [66]. Studies performed in countries which include varicella vaccination in their immunization programs should use updated data on HZ incidence, because circula - tion of varicella might have an impact on the occurrence of HZ in elderly. With our analy - sis applied to the Netherlands without a universal varicella vaccination [47], one should be aware that for countries with a universal varicella vaccination, this policy might influence the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination. Parameters as severity of pain and duration of pain due to HZ/PHN are influential for the amount of QALYs gained and different sources estimating utilities should be used to address uncertainty into QALY losses. Moreover, studies using validated instruments to estimate quality of life should be preferred. Factors which were ignored in most studies but should be incorporated to achieve a complete view of the consequences of HZ vaccination are compli - cations from ophthalmic manifestations of HZ and vaccine adverse events vaccination. Also productivity losses might become more important as a consequence of healthy aging and the evidence of vaccine efficacy in the younger age group between 50-59 y . Further research will better inform on the duration of protection of the vaccine and reduce un- certainty in this area. With various initiatives to synthesize health-economic methods between countries, it might be expected that future cost-effectiveness analyses in the area will be even better comparable, enhancing this type of evidence synthesis as done here and allowing even conclusions to be drawn. With price being an important determinant of cost-effectiveness of 49 Review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zosterHZ -vaccination, outcomes of price negotiations, potential tendering and price-volume deals might crucially influence the outcomes of future cost-effectiveness analyses being embarked upon. 5. Conclusions In the light of current published studies, HZ vaccination of the elderly seems to be cost-ef- fective, with the exact cost-effectiveness profile being dependent on the vaccination age, du- ration of vaccine efficacy and vaccine price. In general, HZ vaccination was cost-effective in all studies, when the duration of vaccine protection was at least 10 y. Because of aging of the population, the burden of HZ and PHN might have a growing impact on the health-care bud- get and the population's health-related quality of life. Therefore, universal HZ vaccination might present an interesting opportunity to reduce this burden. When updated information on the duration of vaccine-induced protection, HZ incidence or vaccine price becomes avail - able, cost-effectiveness results should be updated in order to reassess vaccination recom- mendations and optimum vaccination age. To improve possibilities for a direct comparison of different cost-effectiveness studies, more extensive reporting on methodology and more detailed results of sensitivity analyses would be desirable.

A large randomized clinical trial, labelled the Shingles Prevention study (SPS), demonstrated that a live attenuated VZV vaccine can reduce the incidence of HZ and PHN. We aimed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccination of the elderly against HZ versus no such vaccination in The Netherlands. Methods: A cohort model was developed to compare the costs and effects in a vaccinated and a non-vaccinated age- and gender-stratified cohort of immunocompetent elderly. Vaccination age was varied from 60 to 75 years. Data from published literature such as the SPS were used for transition probabilities. The study was performed from the societal as well as the health care payer's perspective and results were expressed as euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: In the base case, we estimated that the vaccination of a cohort of 100,000 60-year- olds would prevent 4136 cases of HZ and 305 cases of PHN, resulting in a QALY-gain of 209. From the societal perspective, a total of \u20ac1.9 million was saved and the ICER was \u20ac35,555 per QALY gained when a vaccine price of \u20ac87 was used. Vaccination of women re- sulted in a lower ICER than vaccination of men (\u20ac33,258 vs. \u20ac40,984 per QALY gained). The vaccination age with the most favourable ICER was 70 years (\u20ac29,664 per QALY gained). Parameters with a major impact on the ICER were the vaccine price and HZ incidence rates. In addition, the model was sensitive to the utility of mild pain, the vaccine efficacy at the moment of uptake and the duration of protection induced by the vaccine. Conclusion: Vaccination against HZ might be cost-effective for ages ranging from 60 to 75 when a threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained would be used, at \u20ac20,000 per QALY this might not be the case. Additional information on the duration of vaccine-protection is needed to further optimize cost-effectiveness estimations.57 Cost-effectiveness Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is a painful disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV). Virtually all the Dutch adults have been infected by VZV during their childhood [1]. After this primary infection, the virus stays clinically dormant in the dorsal root of the sensory nerve ganglia and when it reactivates the infection is labelled HZ. HZ af- fects up to 25% of the individuals during lifetime, predominantly in old age due to a decline of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against the VZV during aging [2-4]. The annual incidence of HZ in The Netherlands is estimated to be 3.2 cases per 1000 persons, but among elderly individuals older than 75 years it exceeds 7 cases per 1000 persons [1,5]. Other risk factors of HZ are a deficient or suppressed immune system and female gender [5-7]. Most HZ cases start with a prodromal phase, which presents with flu-like symptoms, pain and itching [8]. Then, a unilateral vesicular rash appears which is accompanied by neuritis, pain, aching and heavy itching. Although the rash heals within 3 to 4 weeks, in about 10-25% of the patients neuropathic pain can persist for months or even years [5,9,10]. This pain is referred to as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is defined as pain persisting longer than 3 months after the onset of rash [11]. PHN can have a severe impact on the quality of life due to a worsening of the physical condition and an increase in emotional distress [10,12-14]. The occurrence and severity of PHN increases with age [9,15]. CMI against VZV can im- munocompetent adults >60 years of age (Shingles Prevention study, SPS), demonstrated that the vaccine reduced the incidence of HZ by 51.3%, the pain burden by 61.1% and the - dence of PHN by 66.5% The vaccine-efficacy was lower in the higher age-group (70+ years) than in the younger age-group (60-69 years). In addition, the vaccine was well-toler - ated and side reactions were generally mild [15]. Immunocompromised patients are contra - indicated for Zostavax, since it comprises a live attenuated virus [18]. Below, we assess the cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination of Dutch elderly against HZ and PHN. As age and female gender are risk factors for developing HZ, we explicitly strati - fied the cost-effectiveness ratio by age and by gender. 2. Methods 2.1. Model design and methodological assumptions A cohort model (Fig. 1) was constructed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 to compare the cost-effectiveness of a vaccinated cohort and a non-vaccinated cohort. The cohorts were 58 Chapter 3hypothetical and started both with 100,000 60-, 65-, 70- or 75-year-old immune-competent individuals, who were free of HZ prior to the start of the vaccination and who were assumed to be free from HZ symptoms. These hypothetical cohort sizes approximately reflect the populations to be vaccinated in The Netherlands. The cohorts were followed in annual cycles till the 101st birthday and clinical and economic effects were subsequently compared. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The study was conducted both from the societal perspective and the health care payer's per - spective. Following the Dutch guideline on pharmacoeconomic evaluations in health care, costs (expressed in \u20ac) were discounted at 4% annually and QALYs at 1.5% [19]. Fig. 1 illustrates that all individuals of the unvaccinated cohort start as eligible to reactivation of VZV and development of HZ. In line with the clinical study [15], vaccinated subjects were assumed to receive a single-dose vaccination and start mostly in the state 'immune to HZ', the exact proportion being determined by the vaccine's efficacy. It is possible for the subjects to move back from the 'immune state' to the 'eligible state', due to waning of vac- cine-induced immunity. Each year persons can move from 'eligible' to 'HZ' and a proportion of these move further to the 'PHN' state. We neglected recurrence of HZ in our model, since recurrent HZ in immune-competent persons is extremely rare [20]. Therefore, persons who have passed HZ or PHN end in the 'lifetime immunity' state. Finally, individuals can die in all states of the model. 2.2. Demographic and epidemiological parameters Various parameters are presented in Table 1. Age-specific Dutch incidence rates of GP con- sultations due to HZ were used as population HZ incidence rates for The Netherlands (count- ing only first GP-visits) [1]. We defined PHN as pain 90 days after onset of HZ symptoms. The age-specific proportions of patients who developed PHN after HZ were obtained from Opstelten et al. [5]. However, these PHN incidence estimates were somewhat lower than found in other studies potentially due to the absence of mild PHN cases without consultation Fig. 1: Cohort model used in the analysis. Netherlandsof a GP [5]. Therefore, we assumed that these data [5] represented only moderate and severe cases of PHN and we corrected these percentages upwards to also include mild PHN cases. The correction was done according to the pain severity split of the SPS [21]. Age and gender split was made for HZ cases according to specific HZ incidence rates from The Netherlands [22]. Also PHN cases were split by gender using the three-month definition of PHN [5]. Mortality due to HZ was not taken into account in our model. Data from the Dutch Bureau of Statistics (CBS; Rijswijk, The Netherlands) show that in The Netherlands around 20 persons annually die because of HZ [23], but it is not known whether these patients are immune-compromised or not. Exclusion of mortality represents a conservative approach in our analysis. 2.3. QALY losses QALY losses due to HZ and PHN were calculated by multiplying utility decrements and the duration in the health state (Table 1). Utilities reflect the quality of life in an interval between zero (death) and one (perfect health). Utility values [10,13,14] and the duration of QALY losses [9,15,21] were derived from the literature. The utilities varied between the different pain states, i.e. mild, moderate, severe and no pain (see Appendix A for more detail [24,25]). In particular, Appendix A also provides some illustrative examples on how we calculated the QALYs. Equal utilities were assigned to pain caused by HZ and pain caused by PHN, because it was expected that pain severity does not vary between the various neuropathic pain conditions. 2.4. Vaccine characteristics Vaccine parameters are shown in Table 1. Since the mean follow up time of the patients in the SPS was 3.11 years maximum, long-term vaccine efficacy against HZ is unknown. However, it has been demonstrated that after vaccination CMI against VZV declines over time and therefore we assumed that vaccine-mediated immunity against HZ also decreases over time [16]. Calculation of vaccine efficacy against HZ was derived from Pellissier et al. [14], the SPS trial and age-specific data on burden of illness (BoI) [26,27]. In particular, the initial efficacy of the vaccine (take) was derived from a formula published by Pellissier et al. [14] - presenting the only source for this parameter - and vaccine takes at various ages are listed in Table 1 (see also Appendix B). Appendix B also details how waning vaccine-induced immunity was exactly modelled. The SPS trial also demonstrated an additional vaccine efficacy against the BoI, representing the total HZ-associated pain and discomfort according to the validated Zoster Brief Pain 60 Chapter 3Inventory (ZBPI) [17]. Following the adjustments on the original data as described by Roth- berg et al., we estimated that the vaccine decreased the BoI score from 225 to 160 in the age-group 70 years, but no significant effect was seen in the age group <70 years (134-128) [26]. We incorporated this additional efficacy in our model by correcting the utilities of the 'HZ' and 'PHN' states of the vaccinated group upwards with 28.9% for ages 70. Additional efficacy against PHN was applied in our model by reducing the PHN rates with 44% for ages 70 years, but not for the age-group below 70 years [27]. The same waning rate as specified for the initial outcome was applied to this additional vaccine efficacy (see Appendix B). Table 1: Demographic parameters, utilities and vaccine characteristics.

All costs are presented in 2010 \u20ac and unit costs from previous years were corrected using the inflation rates of the CBS. The analysis included direct medical costs and indirect costs of production losses. Direct medical costs consisted of costs due to GP visits, hospitalisation costs, drug costs and pharmacy dispensing fees [19]. In the absence of specific Dutch data, we assumed that HZ leads to 1.4 GP-visits per case and PHN to 1.2 GP-visits per month according to UK data [9]. Given the above assumption that in cases of mild PHN the GP is not consulted, GP visits were only counted for moderate and severe cases of PHN. Age-specific data of hospital admissions due to HZ and the mean duration of hospitalisation were extracted from De Melker et al. [1]. Given the discussion on hospitalisation due to PHN [28], we did not implement hospitalisa - tion costs due to PHN in the model.62 Chapter 3Table 2: Overview of costs (2010 \u20ac).

In The Netherlands, approximately 34% patients with HZ older than 55 years receive antivi - ral medication [29]. UK prescription data were used for analgesics [9,30]. Rates were mul- tiplied by Dutch drug prices, resulting in total costs of \u20ac39.90 per HZ case [30]. Drug costs due to PHN were estimated at \u20ac27.09 per month following UK prescription rates multiplied by the Dutch drug prices [30]. According to the Dutch guidelines, production losses were calculated according to the friction cost method using published data [31,32] (Appendix C). The Zostavax price in the private sector is listed at \u20ac137.33 (single dose, 2010) [30], but a price reduction may occur when bulk quantities are bought within the context of a vaccina - tion programme. In the absence of Dutch data, we used the American CDC contract price of $113.28 for this purpose (approximately \u20ac87) [33] as the base-case vaccine price and assumed \u20ac6.45 administration costs as estimated by Van Lier et al. [34]. 2.6. Sensitivity and scenario analyses To explore the impact of several parameters, including cost, utility and vaccine parameters, a univariate sensitivity analysis was performed. For that purpose, the value of one parameter was varied by \u00b125%, while keeping the other variables constant at base-case values. Several additional scenarios were considered to assess the influence of different model assumptions [35] (Appendix D). 3. Results 3.1. Cost-effectiveness The results of vaccinating a cohort of 100,000 persons stratified by vaccination age are shown in Table 3. The cost-effectiveness of vaccinating at the age of 60 years was estimated at \u20ac35,555 per QALY gained, preventing 4136 HZ cases and 305 PHN cases in the cohort analyzed. This results in a reduction of 6562 GP visits, 40 hospitalisations and a total (dis- counted) QALY gain of 209. In addition to the health gains, a cost reduction of about \u20ac0.55 million direct costs and \u20ac1.35 million indirect costs was estimated. Varying the vaccination age showed that vaccinating at an age of 70 years was most favourable (ICER: \u20ac29,664 per QALY gained). Most HZ cases were prevented at the lowest vaccination age of 60 years in contrast to PHN cases which are optimally prevented at an age of 75. Indirect costs counted for approximately 70% of total costs saved at an age of 60 years, but rapidly decreased above an age of 65 years. 64 Chapter 3Table 3: Results of vaccinating a cohort of 100,000 persons against HZ at different vaccination ages.

Sensitivity and scenario analyses Table 4 shows how the ICER varies when different scenarios were explored. Stratifying the results by gender showed that vaccinating women was more cost-effective at all vaccination ages compared to vaccination of men (Table 4). When UK HZ incidence rates from Gauthier et al. [9] were used, the ICER increased compared to base-case. Exploration of PHN propor - tions from Gauthier et al. [9] resulted in an almost 50% reduction of the ICER.65 Cost-effectiveness of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in The NetherlandsTable 4: Results of the scenario analyses.

In contrast, a lifelong duration of protection halved the base-case ICER resulting in an optimal scenario, particularly for vaccination of 60-year-olds, since this age group potentially benefits longest. Leaving out the additional protection of vaccination against PHN or BoI resulted in an increase of the ICER, especial - ly when the vaccination age was 70 years. When utilities of Pellissier et al. [14] or Bala et al. [13] were used, the ICERs increased due to the higher estimated quality of lives for the different pain states. Exclusion of indirect costs led to an increase of the ICER, especially at a vaccination age of 60, since most Dutch people retire at the age of 65. Fig. 2 shows the univariate sensitivity analysis at a vaccination age of 60 years. The most influential parameters were vaccine price and the incidence ratios of HZ, but also vaccine efficacy at the vaccine uptake, the duration of protection and the QALY weight of mild pain changed the ICER more than 15% when varied \u00b125%.

The stated parameters were varied 25% upwards (dark grey) and downwards (light grey) while keeping the rest of the parameters constant at base-case values. 4. Discussion This analysis indicates that HZ vaccination could be cost-effective for Dutch elderly. In The Netherlands a cut-off point for favourable cost-effectiveness of vaccination interventions has been suggested at \u20ac50,000 per QALY [36]. Our model estimated that the ICER of HZ vaccination in the base-case scenario ranged from \u20ac29,664 to \u20ac35,555 per QALY gained at 67 Cost-effectiveness of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in The Netherlandsvaccination ages ranging from 60 to 75 years. At a more conservative threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY - that has also been suggested for vaccination programmes in The Netherlands [34] - HZ vaccination might just not be considered cost-effective. Regarding the optimum age of vaccination, the lowest ICER is achieved when people are vaccinated at the age of 70 years. Stratification by gender shows that vaccination is more cost-effective for women as compared with men, due to higher HZ incidence rates among women. We combined data from a large, randomized controlled trial with Dutch epidemiologic data and costs. When Dutch parameters were lacking, we applied data from foreign studies in our model. Notably, our model was consistently age- and sex-specific to enhance its validity. Conservatively, we excluded possible HZ complications other than PHN, e.g. HZ in the eye (zoster ophthalmicus) and ear regions (zoster oticus), potentially leading to visual and hear - ing problems, respectively. In addition, we have not modelled the possibilities of recurrence of HZ or dying through HZ, since these events are rare, again illustrating the conservative approach that we generally followed [20,23]. Univariate sensitivity analyses showed which parameters have a major impact on the ICER. Among these parameters there are some to which the model is very sensitive and which are also associated with uncertainty, because their values had to be based on assumptions in the literature. Given the various uncertainties in the model and the lack of information to base distributions upon, we decided not to perform a formal probabilistic sensitivity analysis, but rather conduct an extensive scenario analysis. Also, the complexity of a probabilistic analysis is well known and we feel in this case it might hamper adequate interpretation of its results by the readers. Since the vaccine long-term duration of vaccine-induced protection was unknown due to the short mean follow-up time of 3.11 years of the SPS, we had to estimate the duration of protection. Because recurrence of HZ is very rare, a boost of CMI by HZ reactivation might result in subsequent lifelong protection against HZ. Therefore, a boost by vaccination might also result in a lifelong protection. However, a study of Levin et al. [16] demonstrated that 6 years after receiving HZ vaccination still a significant increase of VZV specific CMI was observed in patients as compared with before vaccination, but the CMI diminished with an estimated half-life of 56 months. Therefore, we considered a waning effect of vaccine-in - duced immunity in our model. Pellissier et al. [14] estimated a waning rate between 0% and 8.3% per year from the SPS-data. We used a waning rate of 8.3% for the base-case. The SPS reported efficacy against BoI and PHN incidences for the entire population [15]. Since we determined the number of PHN cases as a proportion of the number of HZ cas-68 Chapter 3es, using the efficacy rates of PHN directly from the SPS would lead to double counting. Therefore, we used only an additional vaccine efficacy against PHN or a reduction of BoI in patients aged 70 years as presented in previous studies [26,27]. This explains that our sce- nario analyses, without additional efficacy for PHN or BoI, showed that the ICERs increase especially for a vaccination age of 70 or 75 years. The results were also sensitive to the utility of mild pain, because the patients diagnosed with mild pain stayed the whole PHN period in this pain state and also patients with moderate or severe pain stayed partly in this state. We used utility weights from Oster et al. [10] in the base-case. Comparable utilities for different pain states were found in patients suffering neu- ropathic pain by McDermott et al. [37] and by Van Hoek et al. [38]. In contrast, Bala et al. [13] and Pellissier et al. [14] estimated utility weights which differed from those of Oster et al. [10]. When these utility weights were explored in scenario analyses, the ICER increased, because especially the utility weight for severe pain was higher as compared with Oster et al. [10]. Also, various methods were used to measure utilities, including EQ-5D and standard gamble, theoretically hampering straightforward comparison of those utilities. However, we felt that some level of comparison would still be valid. Finally, we note that certain defini- tions of PHN only consider severe and moderate pain, whereas we assumed that some pa- tients may continue to experience mild pain with corresponding utility decrements. The latter can be substantiated with data from Oster et al. [10]. The pain-split was derived from the SPS, in which the ZPBI was used to diagnose the pain state. The SPS showed that more than half of the PHN patients experience severe pain. How- ever, other studies suggested that a much lower proportion of patients experience severe pain [9,25]. We decided to use the SPS-data, since it used the validated Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire. When the pain severity split of Gauthier et al. was used, the ICERs increased [9]. Possibly, a relation exists between the severity of pain in the HZ- and PHN-stages on the patient-level. However, as linked data on this phenomenon are lacking, we had no basis to include this in our model. Recently, Van Lier et al. published a health-economic evaluation of vaccination against HZ of the elderly in The Netherlands [34]. Compared with our evaluation, Van Lier et al. used a different QALY assessment by distinguishing four states of pain, i.e. no pain, mild pain and 'clinically relevant pain' which includes moderate and severe pain [34]. Although results are difficult to compare due to a different QALY-loss assessment, we explored a scenario as equal as possible to that of Van Lier et al. at a vaccination age of 60 years. In this scenario we found an ICER of \u20ac38,709 per QALY gained, which was comparable with the ICER determined by Van Lier et al. (\u20ac38,519 per QALY gained) [34]. This confirmed the validity 69 Cost-effectiveness of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in The Netherlandsof our model. Improvements of our analysis as compared with that of Van Lier et al. are that we used costs of GP consultations, hospitalisation days and production losses from a recently published Dutch guidance of costing research [19]. Moreover, we used updated labour partic - ipation rates from the CBS and included production losses of patients aged 65. Finally, we added a gender-specific analysis as the female gender is a risk-factor of HZ. Previous studies also found an optimal HZ vaccination age of [26,34,37]. However, there are other studies demonstrating an optimum vaccination age of 60 years, but this difference could be easily explained since these studies assumed no waning of vaccine-induced immu - nity in the base-case scenario [14,21]. 5. Conclusions Our analysis shows that vaccination of Dutch elderly against HZ might be cost-effective for all vaccination ages 60 years, when a vaccine price of \u20ac93.45 including administration fees, a duration of protection of 12 years and a threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY were used. At a threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained, vaccination against HZ is likely to be not cost-effec- tive. Vaccination of women is more cost-effective than vaccination of men and the optimal vaccination age is 70 years from a pure cost-effectiveness point of view. More informa - tion about the duration of vaccine-induced protection is needed to accurately determine the cost-effectiveness of zoster vaccination in older adults.

National decision-makers soon need to decide whether to introduce HZ/su or to prefer HZ/su above ZVL. Methods: Using a Markov model with a decision tree, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination with HZ/su (two doses within 2 months) or zoster vaccine live (ZVL) (single dose, or single dose with a booster after 10 years) for cohorts of 50-, 60-, 70- or 80-year-olds in the Netherlands. The model was parameterized using vaccine efficacy data from randomized clinical trials and up-to-date incidence, costs and health-related quality of life data from national datasets. We used a time horizon of 15 years, and the analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. Results: At a coverage of 50%, vaccination with two doses of HZ/su was estimated to pre- vent 4335 to 10,896 HZ cases, depending on the cohort age. In comparison, this reduction was estimated at 400-4877 for ZVL and 427- 6466 for ZVL with a booster. The maximum vaccine cost per series of HZ/su to remain cost-effective to a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained ranged from \u20ac109.09 for 70-year- olds to \u20ac63.68 for 50-year-olds. The cost-effectiveness of ZVL changed considerably by age, with corresponding maximum vaccine cost per dose ranging from \u20ac51.37 for 60-year-olds to \u20ac0.73 for 80-year-olds. Adding a ZVL booster after 10 years would require a substantial reduction of the maximum cost per dose to remain cost-effective as compared to ZVL sin- gle dose. Sensitivity analyses on the vaccine cost demonstrated that there were scenarios in which vaccination with either HZ/su (two doses), ZVL single dose or ZVL + booster could be the most cost-effective strategy. Conclusions: A strategy with two doses of HZ/su was superior in reducing the burden of HZ as compared to a single dose or single dose + booster of ZVL. Both vaccines could poten- tially be cost-effective to a conventional Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold for preventive interventions. However, whether HZ/su or ZVL would be the most cost-effective alternative depends largely on the vaccine rash with a characteristic dermatomal dis- tribution. It is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV), previously introduced during primary infection (varicella) [1]. In the Netherlands, where varicella vac- cination has not been implemented, over 95% of the population is infected with VZV before the age of 6 years [2]. The average incidence of HZ in the Netherlands was 520 per 100,000 person-years in the period 2012-2015, and older age and a compromised immune system are the most important risk factors [1, 3, 4]. However, given the ageing population, it is expected that the incidence of HZ will increase in the near future [5]. Persistent pain, labelled post-her - petic neuralgia (PHN), is the most common complication of HZ occurring in 3-19% of the patients [1, 6, 7]. PHN might persist for years and is associated with significant interference with daily life activities [8, 9]. Besides the prevention by vaccination, therapeutic options for HZ and PHN are scarce. Therefore, several countries, including the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), have introduced HZ vaccination for older adults using the existing live-attenuated vaccine (zoster vaccine live [ZVL] or Zostavax\u00ae), which has been registered in 2006 and was the only available vaccine at the time of introduction of vaccination in the UK/US. ZVL contains the live-attenuated OKA VZV strain and is registered for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years [10]. A large randomized clinical trial among older adults aged 60 years showed that a single dose of ZVL was 51% (95% confidence PHN [11]. However, efficacy against HZ was limited in the eldest age groups (38% [95% CI 25-48%] among 70-year-olds), and a long-term follow-up study demonstrated that protection had completely waned within 10 years [12]. Therefore, several countries, including the Netherlands, decided against the use of ZVL in a public programme [13]. Nowadays, several post-licensure studies have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of ZVL. However, the decline of effectiveness with increasing age was less evident in post-licensure studies as compared to the clinical trial [14-17]. A new adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine (HZ/su or Shingrix\u00ae) might potentially overcome the shortcomings of ZVL. In Europe, HZ/su has been registered for all adults aged 50 years in 2018 and is a recombinant vaccine containing the VZV glycoprotein E adjuvanted with the AS01B system [18]. The vaccine has been developed to be given in a two-dose schedule administered 2-6 months apart. Two large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the protective efficacy of two doses HZ/su against HZ incidence was [19, 20]. The duration of protection is currently unknown, but the trial confirmed a relative stable efficacy over 4 years of follow-up [20].76 Chapter 4Due to the registration of HZ/su, governments have the option to reassess their vaccination policy for HZ in the near future, but cost-effectiveness analyses for HZ/su are yet scarce. Previous cost-effectiveness studies for the US, Hong Kong and Germany exist [21-24]; however, results from other countries are not directly transferable to the Dutch context due to potential differences in epidemiological conditions, existing vaccination policies against HZ and varicella, healthcare resource use and relative prices. Moreover, no comparison of HZ/su with ZVL booster strategies has been performed, and a lack of studies incorporating real-world effectiveness data for ZVL is noticed. Therefore, we conducted a cost-effective - ness analysis of HZ vaccination for the Dutch setting. First, we compared the impact of HZ/su and ZVL in immunocompetent older adults using efficacy data from the original vac- cine trials, and we included a booster alternative for ZVL as well. Next, we analyzed the threshold cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination by seeking the maximum vaccine cost al- lowed to remain below \u20ac20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, which is the conventional cost-effectiveness threshold for vaccination in the Netherlands [25]. As the bur - den of HZ and vaccine efficacy against HZ depends on age, we studied HZ vaccination for different vaccination ages and explicitly addressed the use of ZVL post-licensure real-world effectiveness data in a sensitivity analysis. 2. Methods 2.1. Overview A static Markov model connected with a decision tree (Additional file 1: Figure S1) was de- veloped in Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) to quantify the costs and health effects (in QALYs) of vaccination of Dutch older adults against HZ from a societal perspective. We used a static model, as HZ is a reactivation of an existing VZV infection, and no impact on transmission dynamics like herd effects is expected. Studied al- ternatives were (i) no vaccination (current situation), (ii) vaccination with HZ/su (two doses within 2 months) and (iii) ZVL (single dose) and (iv) ZVL (single dose with a booster after 10 years). We used a 10-year period for the booster, as an immunogenicity study showed that a booster after this period is safe and provokes a similar immunological response as a first dose [26]. In the Markov model, cohorts were followed in annual cycles with an age maximum of 110 years. In each cycle, participants had the probability to stay alive or die due to another cause. Individuals who remained alive entered the decision tree, having the possibility to de- velop HZ, which subsequently could lead to hospitalization and/or death. We studied cohorts of 50, 60, 70 and 80 years of age. Due to the high uncertainty around the long-term efficacy of HZ/su, we limited the time horizon to 15 years in the base case analysis (for instance from 70 to 85 years of age). We chose this conservative time horizon to do justice to the low level of decline of HZ/su efficacy within the trial period but also to avoid overvaluation of the 77 Cost-effectiveness of adjuvanted subunit and live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccinesimpact of vaccination among this older cohort by using a lifetime time horizon. According to the Dutch cost-effectiveness guidelines, future costs and QALYs were annually discounted by 4% and 1.5%, respectively [27]. 2.2. Epidemiology Epidemiological inputs are shown in Table 1. Actual cohort sizes per January 1, 2017, and background mortality rates were obtained from Statistics Netherlands [28, 29]. The average incidence of HZ by age over the period 2012-2015 came from the NIVEL primary care data - base, a GP surveillance system covering approximately 0.7% of the Dutch population [3, 30]. We adjusted these rates for possible misdiagnoses by setting the proportion of false-positive diagnoses at 10.0% (95% CI 7.9-12.4%) [31]. Average incidence rates of HZ hospitalizations and 1-day hospital admissions by age over the period 2012- 2014 were retrieved from the Dutch Hospital Data database, covering 80% of the population in 2012-2013 and 90% of the population in 2014 [32, 33]. Only admissions with a main diagnosis of HZ (International Sta- tistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD] code B02) were used. The incidence of HZ-related mortality by age was based on the number of HZ death registries (ICD-code B02) over the period 2009-2015, obtained from Dutch national death registries that contain the cause of death of 98.5% of the deaths [34]. We adjusted the mortality rates according to a validation study on HZ coding of death registries in the US, indicating that HZ was not the true underlying cause of death in 47.5% (95% CI 32.0-63.0%) of the deaths assigned to HZ [35]. 2.3. QALY loss The QALY loss per HZ case was calculated by multiplying the time spent in a certain health state by the reduction of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), i.e. disutility, associated with that health state and is shown in Table 1. For this calculation, we distinguished four health states of HZ, i.e. no pain, mild pain, moderate pain and severe pain. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was estimated using a Dutch prospective cohort study that followed HZ patients aged 50 years over a maximum period of 12 months [6]. Disutilities by health state over time were obtained from the same study and were based on the validated three-level version of the Euroqol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) instrument. As severity and duration of pain showed to increase by age, separate analyses were done for the age groups 50-59 years and 60 years. Patients with moderate or severe pain after 3 months were defined as PHN patients. We found that the risk of PHN was estimated at 2.2% for 50- to 59-year-olds and 7.3% for 60-year-olds. More details can be found in Additional file 1. Life years (LY) lost due to HZ-related premature mortality were estimated using life tables and were converted to QALYs lost using age-specific EQ-5D-3 L population norms from the 78 Chapter 4Netherlands [36]. We ignored QALY losses due to vaccine-related adverse events in our base case analysis, as both HZ/su and ZVL only caused short-term symptoms, and the impact on HR-QoL was not investigated [11, 19]. 2.4. Costs HZ-related costs per case are shown in Table 1. All costs were adjusted to the 2017 price year using the Dutch national consumer price index [37]. Costs per HZ case were estimated using the same prospective cohort study that was used to estimate HZ-related QALY losses [6]. In this study, the number of GP visits, specialist referrals, medication use and productivity loss was asked at different time points and were then converted to costs per case using standard- ized cost per item. Costs per hospital admission were based on the length of stay of admis- sions having HZ as main a diagnosis (ICD-code B02) over the period 2012-2014, and cost of a 1-day visit was obtained from the literature [32, 38]. According to the most recent Dutch guideline on cost-effectiveness research, unrelated healthcare costs in gained life years (i.e. indirect medical costs) should be included in the base case analysis [39]. These costs were estimated using the life expectancy at the age of death multiplied with yearly age-specific healthcare costs obtained from specifically developed costing tool [40]. More details on the estimated costs per HZ episode are shown in Additional file 1. For vaccine administration costs, we used the current Dutch influenza tariff of \u20ac11.36 per dose, assuming that HZ vacci - nation would be provided in a GP-based programme [41]. This tariff covers, next to vaccine administration costs, costs due to patient selection and invitation, record keeping, vaccine storage and waste destruction. 2.5. Vaccine characteristics Vaccine-related inputs are shown in Table 1. Given that ZVL is contraindicated to immuno - compromised individuals, we restricted vaccination in our analysis to the immunocompetent part of the population. A recent questionnaire among a random sample of Dutch older adults aged 50 years indicated that the acceptance rate of vaccination against HZ was 58% [42]. Considering that the proportion of the Dutch population that is immunocompromised ranges from 1.9% in 50- to 64-year-olds to 11.5% in 85-year-olds [43], we conservatively set the vaccination coverage at 50% of the total cohort. However, as we used a static model, the coverage has no impact on the cost-effectiveness outcomes of vaccination and was only used to estimate the absolute impact of vaccination such as the number of HZ cases prevented. We assumed that all HZ/su recipients received two doses of the vaccine within 2 months and that the coverage of the ZVL booster after 10 years was 50% of the cohort that was still alive at that age.79 Cost-effectiveness of adjuvanted subunit and live-attenuated herpes zoster Model inputs of the analysis.

After 4 years, the slope of 70-year-olds was used cThe efficacy was rounded to 1 during the period that the efficacy function was above 1, dThe efficacy of ZVL over time (in years) was modelled using a one-mi - nus-exponential function 1 exp(1 + 2 \u00d7 years), in which 1 is the intercept and 2 the slope. Risk ratios by age were used to modify the intercept. For instance, the efficacy of 60-64 years at time point zero was 1 exp(1.274 \u00d7 0.893 + 0 \u00d7 0.0807) = 67.9%. In our model, we used the VE of the age group 60-64 for vaccination of 60-year- olds, 70-74 for 70-year-olds, 80-84 for 80-year-olds and 85 years for the booster for 90-year-oldsTable 1: Model inputs of the analysis ( continued )82 Chapter 4Vaccine efficacy of HZ/su and ZVL against HZ over time was modelled using data from published clinical trials (see also Additional file 1: Figure S7) [11, 19, 20, 44-46]. For both vaccines, a function of vaccine efficacy over the years was fitted to the annual efficacy data using the standard error as a weighting factor. We fitted multiple types of functions and used the functions that provided the best fit. For 70-year-olds, a linear function for two doses of HZ/su was fitted to the 4 years of trial data, resulting in a waning of 4.1% per year. We assumed that this waning rate would continue after 4 years and varied this assumption exten - sively in the sensitivity analysis. For 50- to 69-year-olds, a recent study estimated the waning rate at 0.9% per year using unpublished annual vaccine efficacy estimates [47]. However, no confidence intervals of these estimates were reported, and the fit of a linear function through the annual vaccine efficacy estimates was poor. Therefore, we conservatively assumed that this waning rate was only valid for the first 4 years covered by the trial and would be equal to the 70 years age group after 4 years. For ZVL, a one-minus-exponential function was fitted using follow-up data of 60-year-olds up to 11 years after vaccination [12]. To include the effect of age, we adjusted the vaccine efficacy at take using age-specific risk ratios of the clinical trial. For the ZVL booster, we assumed that the efficacy would be equal to the effi- cacy that an initial dose would have had at that age [26]. More details on the model fits are provided in Additional file 1. 2.6. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness The effectiveness of the different HZ vaccination strategies was expressed as the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent a HZ case. The cost-effectiveness was estimated by finding the threshold vaccine cost that equals an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained [25]. However, as this cost-effectiveness threshold does not have an official status in the Netherlands, we also show results for a threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained. The latter threshold has been used earlier for pneumococcal vaccination and is also considered by the Dutch National Health Care Institute for therapeutic interventions of diseases with a moderate disease burden that could well be comparable to PHN [25, 48]. 2.7. Sensitivity analysis We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) using 10,000 Monte Carlo simula - tions in which model inputs were simultaneously varied within their lower and upper ranges using specified distributions as shown in Table 1. Lower and upper ranges were estimated using the 95% CIs of the original sources. The PSA allowed us to estimate 95% credibility intervals (95% CrI) of the burden of HZ using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the simulations. Additionally, the simulations of the PSA served as an input for a two-way sensitivity anal - ysis, in which the vaccine cost per series of HZ/su and per dose of ZVL were varied at the Cost-effectiveness of adjuvanted subunit and live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccinessame time. For each individual simulation, the total costs and QALYs per alternative were converted to net monetary benefits (NMBs) using a cost-effectiveness threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained. Subsequently, for each combination of cost per series or dose, we analyzed which alternative had the most simulations with the highest NMB and whether this propor - tion of simulations for the preferred alternative was above 90% or not. Additionally, multiple deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. The annual waning rate of HZ/su after 4 years was varied between 0 and 10% using a time horizon of 15 years and a lifetime time horizon. We also did a one-way sensitivity analysis in which the input values were varied one-by-one between their lower and upper ranges while keeping other values at their base case levels. Finally, several scenario analyses were performed to explore the impact of differ - ent methodological assumptions or inputs from other plausible sources (see scenario column in Table 1 and Additional file 1 for more details). These analyses included the use of epide - miological input estimates from an immunocompetent population; a lower adherence to the second dose of HZ/su of 90%, 70% and 50% relative to the initial dose; and the attribution of a QALY penalty for vaccine-related grade 3 adverse events [4, 11, 19, 20, 49]. For ZVL, we additionally explored the impact of including additional efficacy against PHN as shown in the trial and the use of vaccine effectiveness data from various post-licensure studies [11, 14, 16, 50]. For the latter, we selected three retrospective cohort studies based on the data from the US Kaiser Permanente Northern California database for the period 2007-2015, the US Medicare database for 2007-2014 and UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink database for 2013-2016, and for each study, we fitted a linear model (see Additional file 1 for details). 2.8. Reporting quality and model validation The reporting of the study adheres to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Report- ing Standards (CHEERS) checklist, and the model validation efforts are reported using the Assessment of the ValIdation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdVISHE) ques- tionnaire [51, 52]. Both checklists are added in Additional files 2 and 3. 3. Results 3.1. Current burden of disease The estimated burden of HZ among the 2017 Dutch population aged 50 years is presented in Table 2. The total number of HZ cases is estimated at 54,169 (95% CrI 52,130-56,174) per year, resulting in 434 hospital admissions, 805 1-day hospitalizations, 15 deaths and 3298 PHN cases. This generated a QALY loss of 2992 (95% CrI 2418-3771). The major part of the health burden occurred among 60- to 79-year-olds, while most deaths were among 80-year-olds. The total annual cost burden of HZ was estimated at \u20ac19.6 million (95% CrI 16.3-22.6), including \u20ac11.3 million healthcare costs and \u20ac7.7 million non-healthcare costs. 84 Chapter 4Most healthcare costs were due to GP visits, while non-healthcare costs predominantly con- sisted of productivity losses among 50-to 69-year-olds.

Impact of vaccination The impact of HZ vaccination is presented in Table 3. For each vaccination age, two doses of HZ/su were estimated to prevent considerably more HZ cases as compared to or ZVL with a booster after 10 years. Depending on age, vaccination with HZ/su at a coverage of 50% would avert 4335-10,896 HZ cases (34.6-37.9% reduction) over the next 15 years, preventing 318-799 PHN cases, 257-600 lost QALYs and \u20ac0.93-2.40 million on costs to the society. Vaccination with ZVL would avert 400-4877 HZ cases (3.5-18.0% reduction) and ZVL with a booster 427-6446 HZ cases (3.7-27.5% reduction). In absolute terms, the highest number of cases would be prevented by vaccination of 70-year-olds for HZ/su, while this was 60-year-olds for ZVL and 50-year-olds for ZVL with a booster. As the model is static, the number of prevented HZ cases increases linearly with the coverage rate (Additional file 1: Figure S12). This figure shows that, for instance, for 60-year-olds, vacci - nation with a series of HZ/su at a coverage of 24% would avert an equal amount of HZ cases as vaccination with ZVL at a coverage of 50%. 3.3. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination Two doses of HZ/su was the most effective strategy for vaccination of 70-year-olds (NNV to prevent a HZ case of 10.0); however, there was little difference as compared to 60- and 80-year-old cohorts (NNVs of 10.9 and 10.8) (Table 3). For ZVL, vaccination age had a con- siderable impact on the effectiveness against HZ. The most effective age of vaccination was 60 years (NNV of 22.8), but the effectiveness decreased in the older cohorts (NNV of 34.9 for 70 years and 117.0 for 80 years). The effectiveness of ZVL would improve by adding a booster after 10 years, decreasing the NNV to 17.2 for vaccination of 60-year-olds, 28.3 for 70-year-olds and 109.5 for 80-year-olds. The cost-effectiveness showed a similar pattern as compared to the effectiveness outcomes. For HZ/su, the maximum vaccine cost per series to remain cost-effective to a threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained was highest for vaccination of 70-year-olds, indicating that this would be the optimum age of vaccination from a cost-effectiveness point of view. The thresh- old vaccine cost per series at this age was estimated at \u20ac109.09. For ZVL, the highest thresh- old vaccine cost per dose was \u20ac51.37 for vaccination of 60-year-olds, while adding a booster dose after 10 years resulted in a decrease of the threshold cost per dose to \u20ac37.79. Our finding that a ZVL plus a booster had a lower threshold cost per dose as compared to a ZVL single dose was also valid for shorter periods between the booster and the first dose, like 5 years. For the vaccination of 80-year-olds, the threshold vaccine cost per dose of ZVL reached slightly above \u20ac0. The use of a higher cost-effectiveness threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained in- creased the maximum vaccine cost allowed considerably. Under this condition, the threshold cost per series of HZ/su for vaccination of 70-year-olds increased to \u20ac274.91.86 Chapter 4Table 3 Impact, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination of Dutch immunocompetent older adults against HZ at a coverage of 50% over a period of 15 years. Vaccination strategies include the herpes zoster subunit vaccine (two doses) or zoster vaccine live (single dose, or single dose + booster after 10 years). Future costs and quality-adjusted life years (QAL Ys) include an annual discount rate of 4% and 1.5%, Vaccination lions)NNV to prevent a vaccine cost to equal \u20ac20,000 per QALY vaccine cost to equal \u20ac50,000 0.092 per series (two doses) of HZ/su or cost per dose of ZVL. Administration costs of \u20ac11.36 per dose and travel costs of \u20ac0.43 per dose are not included 3.4. Sensitivity analyses A probabilistic two-way sensitivity analysis of the vaccine cost per dose of ZVL versus cost per series of HZ/su is shown in Fig. 1. For each vaccination age, there were combinations of vaccine cost in which either HZ/su, ZVL or ZVL with a booster was the most cost-effective alternative. The competition between HZ/su and ZVL was the highest for 60-year-olds. For instance, if the cost per series of HZ/su was assumed at \u20ac100, the maximum cost per dose of ZVL to be the most cost-effective alternative was estimated \u20ac46.75. A ZVL booster after 10 years had a higher probability of being cost-effective among 50-year-olds than ZVL vaccinesdose cost per dose of ZVL was below \u20ac21.25. With regard to uncertainty, HZ/su had a more than 90% probability of being the most cost-effective alternative as compared to no vaccination when the vaccine cost per series would fall below \u20ac49.74, \u20ac85.80, \u20ac83.64 and \u20ac87.56 for 50-, 60-, 70- and 80-year-olds, respectively. Fig. 1 Two-way sensitivity analysis of the vaccine cost per series of HZ/su and vaccine cost per dose of ZVL for vaccination of (a) 50-year-olds, (b) 60-year-olds, (c) 70-year-olds and (d) 80-year-olds. After performing a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the alter - native with the highest probability of being cost-effective to a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained is presented over a range of vaccine cost. Dark coloured areas indicate that the probability of being the most cost-effective alternative is higher than 90%. 4Figure 2 shows the impact of the annual waning rate of HZ/su starting 4 years following vaccination, both when using a time horizon of 15 years (Fig. 2a, base case) and when using a lifetime time horizon (Fig. 2b, sensitivity analysis). Over a period of 15 years, the threshold vaccine cost per series for vaccination of 70-year-olds with HZ/su would change to \u20ac140.44 in the absence of waning and to \u20ac69.18 when a waning rate of 10% per year was assumed. With regard to the optimum vaccination age, 80 years would become the most cost-effective alternative when the waning rate was higher than 5.0% per year. Using a lifetime time horizon, the threshold cost per series of HZ/su increased to \u20ac120.94 for vaccination of 70-year-olds at a waning rate of 4.1% per year as used in the base case analysis. Furthermore, vaccination of 50- and 60-year-olds would become more cost-effective as compared to 70- and 80-year-olds when the waning rate would be lower than 2.3% per year. A sensitivity analysis on the time horizon shows that after 5 years, the threshold vaccine cost was \u20ac40.39 per series of HZ/su and \u20ac18.88 per dose of ZVL for vaccination of 70-year-olds (Additional file 1: Figure S13). Figure 3 shows a deterministic sensitivity analysis and a scenario analysis for HZ/su at vac- cination age of 70 years. The deterministic sensitivity analysis shows that the uncertainty around the waning rate and parameters involved in the estimation of the QALY loss per HZ episode (probability of HZ pain, waning of long-term HZ pain and HZ utilities) had the high- est impact on the cost-effectiveness (Fig. 3a). The scenario analysis demonstrates that the threshold vaccine cost per series of HZ/su decreased to \u20ac80.54 when HZ incidence estimates from an immunocompetent population were used (Fig. 3b). Reduction of the adherence to the second dose of HZ/su to 90%, 70% and 50% resulted in lower threshold vaccine cost per se- ries of \u20ac106.24, \u20ac99.54 and \u20ac91.05, respectively. The inclusion of a QALY loss due to grade 3 adverse events decreased the threshold vaccine cost per series to \u20ac95.93. The highest impact on the cost-effectiveness was found for using QALY loss estimates per HZ case as previously estimated by Van Hoek et al. [31]. In this scenario, the threshold vaccine cost per series of HZ/su increased to \u20ac248.38. Other scenarios that altered the threshold vaccine cost by more than 10% included the use of equal discount rates of 4% for costs and effects, no discounting and the exclusion of HZ false positives. Deterministic sensitivity analyses from other age cohorts showed similar results, except that the exclusion of non-healthcare costs resulted in a more than 10% decrease of the threshold vaccine cost per series among Impact of the annual HZ/su waning rate starting 4 years following vaccination on the threshold vaccine cost per series when using (a) a time horizon of 15 years or (b) a lifetime time horizon.

GP, ZVL included the consideration of additional efficacy against PHN and the use of post-licensure effectiveness data (Fig. 4). The inclusion of additional efficacy against PHN increased the threshold vaccine cost for 70- and 80-year-olds to \u20ac34.56 and \u20ac6.52, respectively. The use of ZVL effectiveness data resulted in a decrease of the threshold vaccine cost per dose for 60-year-olds but in a substantial increase for 80-year-olds. For in- stance, on the basis of 8 years of data from the US Kaiser Permanente Southern California da- tabase, the threshold vaccine cost per dose of ZVL for 80-year-olds was estimated at \u20ac23.64. Fig. 4 Impact of the inclusion of additional efficacy against PHN using trial data and the use of ef - fectiveness data against HZ on the threshold vaccine cost per dose of ZVL. The cost-effectiveness threshold was set at \u20ac20,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Ef fectiveness data from three data sources, i.e. the US Kaiser Permanente Southern California database [14], the US Medicare database [16] and the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink database [50], were explored. For the Medicare and Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, no effectiveness data of 60-year-olds live 4. Discussion Our analysis demonstrates that vaccination with two doses of HZ/su would result in a sub- stantially higher number of HZ cases prevented and number of QALYs gained as compared to ZVL (single dose or single dose + booster). This was explained by the relatively higher efficacy of HZ/su. However, whether vaccination with Hz/su would be cost-effective as com- pared to no vaccination or to ZVL depends largely on the vaccine cost per series. We found that especially for the 60-year-old cohort, there are pricing scenarios in which ZVL could 92 Chapter 4potentially be the most cost-effective alternative. Adding a ZVL booster after 10 years was expected to reduce the effectiveness gap between ZVL and HZ/su but required a significant decrease of the vaccine cost per dose to be the most cost-effective alternative. The inclusion of additional efficacy against PHN or the use of recent post-licensure effectiveness data of ZVL was found to improve the cost-effectiveness of ZVL among 70-year-olds, increasing the competition between the two vaccines in these age cohorts. 4.1. Implications and possible explanations for findings A threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained is the general Dutch cost-effectiveness threshold for healthcare interventions such as vaccination. At optimum vaccination age, i.e. 70 years for HZ/su and 60 years for ZVL, the maximum vaccine costs to remain cost-effective were estimated at \u20ac109 per series and \u20ac51 per dose, respectively. These estimates are considerably lower than the currently available vaccine costs of ZVL and HZ/su in the private sector. For instance, the private sector cost of two doses of HZ/su would be \u20ac226 (US$280) according to the price list of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the private sector cost per dose of ZVL in the Netherlands is currently \u20ac145 [53, 54]. Our model shows that HZ vaccination would not be cost-effective with either HZ/su or ZVL when the above-mentioned vaccine costs are used. The optimum age of vaccination with HZ/su would be in the range of 60 to 80 years, as the efficacy is relatively constant with vaccination age. However, the cost-effectiveness and the optimum age of vaccination with HZ/su were highly sensitive to the duration of protection. Currently, the waning rate had to be estimated using 4 years of follow-up data from the trial, showing a decrease in efficacy over time. However, a closer look to the trial data by arm shows that the waning of efficacy within the first 4 years may be caused by a decrease of HZ incidence in the placebo group rather than an increase of HZ incidence in the vaccinated group [20]. Such a decrease in HZ incidence over time in the placebo group is unexpected because the risk of HZ usually increases with age. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that a lower waning rate would have a substantial impact on decision-making, as the optimum age of vaccination changed from 60 to 80 years to 50-60 years when a life-time time horizon was used. Based on the trial data, the optimum vaccination age of ZVL was 60 years and decreased rapidly with increasing age. However, sensitivity analyses of ZVL demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of ZVL improves substantially for 70-year-olds when an additional ef- ficacy against PHN was taken into account. Post-licensure studies also confirmed that ZVL was likely to provide additional protection against PHN as well as to other severe outcomes 93 50, 55]. Moreover, effectiveness studies in the US and UK found a relatively stable effectiveness of ZVL with increasing age, explaining why in our sensitivity analysis the cost-effectiveness decreases for 60-year-olds but improves considerably for 80-year-olds when this data was explored in our model. This implies that based on trial data only, the impact of ZVL might be underestimated for the el- dest and that ZVL could be a competitor for HZ/su across all age groups. However, it should be noted that although effectiveness studies are more representative for real-life conditions and have more statistical power due to larger sample sizes, they can be affected by uncon- trolled confounders. For instance, observational studies rely on the healthcare registries and are therefore more likely to include severe cases as compared to clinical trials that use active surveillance. Next to cost-effectiveness, budget impact is often considered to be important to decision-mak - ers. As most of the gains are due to the reduction of the burden of illness, vaccination would increase the total healthcare expenditure on HZ considerably. In budget impact analyses, usually a relative short time horizon of maximum 5 years is used and future costs and health effects are not discounted. Under these conditions, the average annual budget impact of vaccination of 50% of the 60-year-olds would be \u20ac6.0 million per year for ZVL (one-dose schedule) and \u20ac12.7 million per year for Hz/su (two-dose schedule), when corresponding maximum vaccine costs per series of \u20ac51 per dose for ZVL and \u20ac104 for HZ/su were used. This implies that the implementation of HZ/su would result in a twofold increase of the total healthcare expenditure on HZ as compared to ZVL and a more than fourfold increase as compared to no vaccination. As HZ/su needs to be administered twice within 2-6 months, vaccination will result in higher healthcare utilization as compared to ZVL that is given as a single dose. Moreover, the pros- pect of a two-dose regimen might also result in a lower uptake as compared to a one-dose regimen. But we do also note that HZ/su is registered for immunocompromised populations as well, which might be beneficial to the overall vaccination coverage. Both vaccines can be safely combined with influenza vaccination [56, 57], which might facilitate the implementa - tion and save administration costs. However, influenza vaccination is only given once a year, and immunogenicity data indicates that revaccination with HZ/su after 12 months is less immunogenic as compared to 2-6 months after the first dose [58]. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the adherence to the second dose of HZ/su impacts the cost-effectiveness consid- erably, as a single dose of HZ/su is expected to have a substantially lower efficacy, especially among 70-year-olds, and a higher waning rate as compared to two doses [47]. Safety studies showed that both HZ/su and ZVL were not associated with serious adverse 94 Chapter 4events among immunocompetent older adults but that HZ/su gives a substantially higher risk of grade 3 adverse events and local adverse events as compared to ZVL [59]. On the other hand, vaccination with HZ/su can also reduce the risk of serious adverse events because post-licensure studies of ZVL indicate that immunocompromised individuals were, although its contraindication, occasionally vaccinated [15, 17]. ZVL can cause serious adverse events in immunocompromised patients, as it may result in a symptomatic, progressive infection of the vaccine virus, causing severe rashes [60]. During the evaluation of ZVL by the Dutch Health Council in 2016, it was concluded that vaccination against HZ did not meet the criteria to be included in the national immunization programme because it does not control VZV transmission nor does it prevent significant mortality [13]. Vaccination against HZ might however be indicated for a public programme when the vaccine would be regarded as essential healthcare due to a substantial reduction of the individual disease burden [61]. The Dutch Health Council considered ZVL not as essen- tial healthcare because of its relatively low efficacy in the eldest, short duration of protection and the contraindication for immunocompromised individuals [13]. Our results demonstrate that HZ/su is expected to have a significantly higher impact on the health economic burden of HZ as compared to ZVL (without or with a booster after 10 years), especially among 70-year-olds. In our opinion, these results are also of interest to other countries that are reconsidering HZ vaccination. Recently, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) decided to (i) give HZ/su a preferential status above the ZVL vaccine, (ii) extend the target group from all immunocompetent 60-year-olds to all immunocompetent 50-year-olds and (iii) revaccinate individuals that had previously been vaccinated with ZVL [59]. The UK launched a publicly funded vaccination programme using ZVL for 70-year-olds with a catch-up for 78-year-olds in 2013 [62] but now needs to decide whether vaccination with HZ/ su should be preferred above ZVL, and if so, whether ZVL-vaccinated individuals should be revaccinated with HZ/su. Since the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recently suggested a similar cost-effectiveness threshold for vaccines as compared with the Netherlands of \u00a315,000 (\u20ac17,400) per QALY gained [63] and the incidence of HZ tends to be similar across European countries [64], the HZ/su threshold vaccine cost per series might be in the same range as we estimated for the Dutch setting. However, the cost-effectiveness of HZ/su in a cohort that is vaccinated with ZVL will presumably be decreased due to a remain - ing protection offered by ZVL. For instance, with the use of our model, the threshold vaccine cost per series of HZ/su among 70-year-olds decreased from \u20ac109.2 per dose to \u20ac80.4, \u20ac97.6 and \u20ac107.2 per series at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively, after vaccination with ZVL, when using published vaccine effectiveness data from the UK Cost-effectiveness of adjuvanted subunit and live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccines4.2. Comparison with other studies A recent study from the US found that the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of 60-year-olds against HZ would remain below a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$50,000 (\u20ac40,400) per QALY gained when the vaccine cost per series was below US$360 (\u20ac290) for HZ/su and US$350 (\u20ac282) for ZVL [21]. These costs were, after adjusting for the higher cost-effective - ness threshold, relatively higher as compared to our findings, which can be explained by the use of a lifetime time horizon, a threefold higher healthcare costs per HZ episode and the inclusion of additional protection against PHN and burden of illness. With the same model, it was demonstrated that a HZ/su booster in individuals previously vaccinated with ZVL would only be cost-effective within 5 years after vaccination if the adherence to the second dose of HZ/su approached 100% [65]. A public health impact study for Germany estimated a similar NNV to prevent a HZ case among 70-year-olds of 10 for HZ/su and somewhat higher NNV of 50 for ZVL [47]. A cost-effectiveness analysis with the same model found that the ICER of vaccination with HZ/su ranged between \u20ac37,000 and \u20ac44,000 per QALY gained when the cost per series was \u20ac220 [22]. A recent study from Italy estimated the cost-effectiveness of ZVL while taking into account the effect of demographic changes over time and an accompa - nying varicella vaccination programme [5]. They found that the incidence of HZ is expected to increase over the next decades due to the ageing of the population, that varicella vaccina - tion might cause a further increase of the incidence of HZ because of the reduction of exog- enous boosting and that HZ vaccination would cost-effectively reduce this increasing burden of HZ. Finally, two earlier Dutch studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of ZVL estimated ICERs of \u20ac22,000 per QALY gained and \u20ac30,000 per QALY gained for 70-year-olds using vaccine cost per dose of \u20ac77 and \u20ac87, respectively [66, 67]. The most important explanation for finding a relatively lower threshold cost per dose in our current study was a substantially lower QALY loss per HZ case. Some other differences were the use of updated HZ incidence rates and long-term efficacy data of ZVL. 4.3. Strengths and limitations The main strength of our study is that we were able to combine high-quality vaccine effica- cy data from large clinical trials with HZ burden estimates from national data sources. HZ incidence was obtained from a GP network that has been validated as a good representation of the general Dutch population. Cost and QALY loss estimates were obtained from a large Dutch prospective cohort study with a long-term follow-up period of 12 months after onset and using the validated EQ-5D instrument to estimate HR-QoL. Moreover, we included a vaccination alternative of ZVL with a booster in our analysis, which has not been compared with HZ/su so far and we are the first exploring post-licensure effectiveness data of ZVL in a cost-effectiveness model.96 Chapter 4Our analysis also has its limitations. The duration of protection of HZ/su is currently un- known, which appeared to be an important parameter in the sensitivity analysis. Next, data on adherence to the second dose of HZ/su and the efficacy and waning of one dose of Hz/su is scarce, which also was shown to have an impact on the cost-effectiveness. Also, applying data from the total Dutch population on immunocompetent cohorts might have led to an overestimation of the impact of vaccination. However, we performed a sensitivity analy - sis by adjusting the epidemiological parameters for this aspect. The patient recruitment and data acquisition of the prospective cohort study that was mainly used for the estimation of HZ-related costs and QALY losses were partly web-based, which might have introduced a selection bias due to the inclusion of healthier subjects able to understand and fill out a web- based questionnaire. However, the target group in our model consisted of immunocompetent individuals, which might also represent a healthier cohort than the general population. Final- ly, rare HZ-related complications like monaural deafness and monocular blindness were not included in our model. 4.4. Future recommendations For the future, we recommend an update of our analysis when long-term efficacy data of HZ/ su become available. Currently, the long-term duration of protection of Hz/su is investigated in a subpopulation of the trial, while also the impact of revaccination with one or two doses of HZ/su will be assessed [68]. Next, we would recommend cost-effectiveness studies spe- cifically for populations. Recent non-peer-reviewed results of HZ/su for autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients showed that HZ/su was 68.2% (95% CI 55.6-77.5) efficacious against HZ, while no safety issues occurred [69]. As the risk of HZ among autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients has been estimated at 16-31% within the first year after transplantation [70], vaccination of such a target group might potentially result in improved cost-effective outcomes as compared to vaccination of immunocompetent individuals only. 5. Conclusions Two doses of HZ/su was found to be superior in reducing the burden of HZ among Dutch immunocompetent older adults as compared to ZVL single dose or ZVL single dose with a booster after 10 years. Vaccination could potentially be cost-effective for both HZ/su and ZVL in the context of the conventional Dutch cost-effectiveness threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained, but this depends largely on the vaccine cost. It is anticipated that these results will be useful for policy-makers in the Netherlands and in all other countries considering be found here: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-018-1213-5 Acknowledgements No external funding has been received for this study.

As opposed to static modelling, dynamic model - ling explicitly takes transmission of infectious agents into account, providing the opportunity to, for example, incorporate the indirect protective effect of vaccination on non-vaccinated individuals, i.e. herd immunity, in the analysis [1]. Often, application of a dynamic model im- proves cost-effectiveness outcomes of infectious diseases control interventions, but in scarce cases detrimental effects on health, costs and cost-effectiveness might emerge. For example, vaccination may shift the age of infection upwards, which may be associated with increased severity of disease or associations with other diseases may exist [2]; reflecting additional effects that can be covered within a dynamic approach, next to herd protection. In this issue, Van Lier et al. [3] add to such insights in the context of varicella vaccination, using dynamic modelling. In the context of modelling herd protection and age shifts, the authors illustrate the potentially crucial impact of varicella vaccination on herpes zoster (HZ) disease. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox during initial infection at childhood age. After resolution of the disease, however, the virus remains latently present in dorsal root ganglion cells. In later life, it can reactivate causing HZ. Potential relationship between var - icella vaccination and HZ disease draws on the hypothesis raised by Hope-Simpson in the 1960s, that contacts between varicella-infected children and adults cause exogenous boosting of immunity against VZV in the latter, thus reducing the risk of HZ later in life [4]. In other words, childhood varicella vaccination, by eliminating exogenous boosting, might ultimately promote the risk of development of HZ in the adult population. This hypothesis is not un- disputed, nor directly proven so far, but has received considerable attention. For instance, a recently published study from Ogunjimi et al. [5] modelled that childhood varicella vac- cination might almost double HZ incidence 30 years later (for example, among parents of vaccinated children). Accordingly, it has been remarked - also by Van Lier et al.[1] - that a few generations have to pay with an increased burden of HZ for the ultimate elimination of VZV on the long run. In this issue, Van Lier et al. [3] analyzed the cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination in the Netherlands using dynamic modelling with the Hope-Simpson hypothesis included and excluded . Considering a lifetime time horizon and discounting according to the Dutch guide- lines for pharmacoeconomic research, the authors come to a clear and consistent conclusion. Without the Hope-Simpson hypothesis, varicella vaccination is highly cost-effective or even cost-saving with major gains of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Inclusion of the boost- ing hypothesis, however, results in dominance for the no varicella vaccination policy, be-105 Commentary on the cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccinationcause varicella vaccination would result in higher costs and QALY losses due to an increase of HZ in the adult population. Prior to the current study of Van Lier et al., four studies have analyzed the impact of varicella vaccination on HZ using dynamic modelling [6]. These studies include investigations of the issue for surrounding countries of the Netherlands, such as the UK [7] and Belgium [8]. Van Lier et al. support the overall findings from these earlier studies. Notably, similar to Van Lier et al. [3], these studies generally found that varicella vaccination is not cost-effective or even results in net QALY losses when the Hope-Simpson hypothesis was included in the mod- elling. Generally, in these dynamic models cost-effectiveness of infant vaccination against varicella is driven by herd protection, related to the possible association with HZ and age shifts (upwards shift for varicella and potentially downwards for HZ). Potential improvement of the health-economic profile of varicella vaccination, suggested by the authors, includes targeting of vaccination to 11-year-old children after anamnesis [6]. Obviously, one solution to overcome the increase of HZ incidence among adults could be HZ vaccination [6-8], with highly effective vaccines being available and further developed. Van Lier et al. argue that HZ vaccination cannot be motivated from the perspective of its pushing varicella vaccination towards favourable cost-effectiveness. However, we would argue that HZ vaccination can be cost-effective on its own right and, on this basis, some countries, including the UK, have already implemented HZ vaccination. For the Netherlands, De Boer et al. [9] estimated the cost-effectiveness of HZ-vaccination at \u20ac29,000-36,000 per QALY gained, depending on the vaccination age. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY , these numbers may well be considered cost-effective, in particular in view of the fact that even higher thresholds of \u20ac80,000 per QALY or beyond apply to oncological and orphan drugs [10]. Notably, the abovementioned studies for the UK [7] and Belgium [8] also found that combining paediatric varicella vaccination with HZ vaccination of the elderly would be cost-effective on the long run. In conclusion, uncertainty on the cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination remains, cov- ering the full spectrum from being cost-saving to generating QALY losses. A change in this unsatisfactory situation through novel convincing epidemiological data cannot be expected on the short term. In the meanwhile, as suggested by Van Lier et al. [3], decision-making on implementation of infant varicella vaccination in national immunization programmes should weigh the various scenarios within this 'dynamic' marriage between varicella and zoster, re- garding costs, benefits and likelihoods of these scenarios. Notably, combination of childhood varicella vaccination with HZ vaccination of the adult population may reduce the uncertainty and represents a cost-effective option already per se.106 Chapter 5Acknowledgements MJP and JCW received grants and honoraria from various pharmaceutical companies, in- clusive those developing, producing and marketing (HZ and varicella) vaccines.

This should overcome a potential reduced vaccine protection due to mismatches be- tween TIV and circulating B viruses. In this study, we systematically reviewed the available literature on health economic evaluations of switching from TIV to QIV . Areas covered: The databases of Medline and Embase were searched systematically to iden- tify health economic evaluations of QIV versus TIV published before September 2016. A to- tal of sixteen studies were included, thirteen cost-effectiveness analyses and three cost-com - parisons. Expert commentary: Published evidence on the cost-effectiveness of QIV suggests that switching from TIV to QIV would be a valuable intervention from both the public health and economic viewpoint. However, more research seems mandatory. Our main recommendations for future research include: 1) more extensive use of dynamic models in order to estimate the full impact of QIV on influenza transmission including indirect effects, 2) improved avail - ability of data on disease outcomes and costs related to influenza type B viruses, and 3) more research on immunogenicity of natural influenza infection and vaccination, with emphasis on cross-reactivity between different influenza B viruses and duration of protection.111 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine1. Introduction Seasonal influenza is a contagious acute respiratory infection, causing every year up to five million cases of severe illness and half a million deaths globally [1]. In addition, the eco- nomic burden of seasonal influenza is considerable. In the United States (US), for instance, annual costs of US $10.4 billion in health-care utilization and US $16.3 billion in work ab- senteeism are caused by influenza [2]. Seasonal influenza can be caused by influenza type A viruses and influenza type B viruses. Although the majority of influenza cases are caused by influenza type A viruses (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), the burden of influenza type B viruses has been shown to be substantial. Since 2001, two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses, B/Victoria (B/Vic) and B/Yamagata (B/Yam), circulate worldwide on an irregular basis, being responsible for 20-25% of all influenza cases [3-5]. To reduce seasonal influenza epidemics, most industrialized countries implemented influenza immunization strategies. Trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) contain antigens derived from two influenza A virus subtypes (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and one influenza type B virus (either B/Vic or B/Yam). Each year it is decided which influenza B lineage should be included, based on predictions of the World Health Organization (WHO) about the anticipated dominant in- fluenza type B virus [1]. However, in the seasons 2001-2002 until 2010-2011, mismatches between the vaccine and the circulating B viruses have occurred in half of the seasons, while in some seasons co-circulation of both lineages was noticed [3]. Therefore, quadrivalent in- fluenza vaccines (QIVs) have been developed and were first licensed in 2012 [6], containing strains of both influenza B lineages (B/Vic as well as B/Yam). Currently, some countries already include QIV next to TIV in their vaccination recommen - dations, like the US, Canada, and Australia [7-9]. The United Kingdom (UK) extended the influenza vaccination program to children using the quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (Q-LAIV) [10]. However, in many other countries, including most European coun- tries, TIV is still used because either QIV is not yet available, QIV procurement agreements with health-care providers might still be ongoing [11], or potential added benefits of QIV are not or not yet recognized by national immunization technical advisory groups (NIT AGs). A decision about switching from TIV to QIV is based on various criteria, of which a beneficial cost-effectiveness profile is often one of the principal aspects being considered by NITAGs in Europe [12]. Such cost-effectiveness assessments usually rely on mathematical models aiming to predict the impact of vaccination strategies on mortality, health-related quality of life, and costs to the health-care sector and society. In 2014, key issues and challenges relating to the determination of the impact and cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccination have already been described by Quinn et al. [13]. The authors recommended the 112 Chapter 6use of subtype- and age-specific estimates of influenza disease burden and costs, because these estimates can differ between influenza A and B viruses across age-groups. Moreover, the existence of cross-protection from TIV against the unmatched B-lineage was discussed, potentially diminishing the relative impact of quadrivalent influenza vaccination. Finally, it was stated that the use of dynamic models would be important, as this modeling approach includes by definition indirect effects to the unvaccinated part of the population, which is of crucial relevance to the impact of vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, two studies summarized the literature on the comparison of QIV versus TIV [13,14]. However, the corresponding searches seem not to be systematic. Moreover, a variety of economic evaluations of QIV versus TIV have subsequently been published. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the literature on the economic value of QIV in order to analyze a potential switching from TIV to QIV , including the most recent publications. In addition, we aimed to identify gaps in the current knowledge and needs for future research. 2. Methods 2.1. Search strategy and study selection process A literature search was performed in the Medline and Embase databases to identify relevant articles on the comparison of the health economic impact of QIV versus TIV that were pub- lished before 30 September 2016. Key words of the search included terms like influenza, quadrivalent, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, economic evaluation, and model. The full search strings can be found in the supplemental material and contained free text searching terms as well as controlled terms. We screened on titles and abstracts and eventual - ly reviewed the full content of each eligible article. Also reference lists of eligible studies and review papers discussing the value of QIV were searched (snowballing). Our selection criteria were that studies should contain original full economic evaluations of QIV versus TIV using a health-economic decision model. We considered studies of all age-groups and vaccine types. In order to be selected, studies had to include an economic comparison between QIV and TIV , or separately report outcomes for QIV and TIV that al- lowed calculation of this comparison by us. We limited our review to the English language. Abstracts of congress meetings, editorials, letters, and reviews were excluded. 2.2. Synthesis of results The included papers were screened independently by two reviewers (PTdB and BMvM). First, the reporting quality of the studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Eco-113 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccinenomic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist [15]. Then, the following in- formation was systematically extracted if possible/reported: (1) country of study, funding source, general characteristics of the analysis (type of analysis, model type, perspective, time horizon, currency and price year, discount rate, type of sensitivity analyses, and model vali - dation performances); (2) target group and main features of the vaccination program (cover - age and vaccine price) and vaccine characteristics (vaccine efficacy, level of cross-protection of TIV against the opposite type B virus, and duration of protection); (3) influenza-relat - ed characteristics (attack rate, details on outcomes, duration of immunity, influenza-related health effects, details on health-care costs, and work days lost); and (4) main study outcomes (reduction of influenza cases, reduction of influenza-related deaths, incremental cost-effec- tiveness/cost-utility ratios, and key drivers of cost-effectiveness outcomes). It is important to note that the terms cost-effectiveness and cost-utility are interchangeably used in this review. Reported model validation techniques were assessed using the AdVISHE, a tool containing a structured list of relevant items for validation [16]. This checklist includes five validation cat - egories, that is, validation of the conceptual model, input data, computerized model, model outcomes, and 'other' validation techniques. Any model validation effort that was described in the economic evaluation was then extracted. To enhance comparability between studies, cost-outcomes were transferred to the 2015 price year using national consumer price indexes [17] and then converted to US $ using purchasing power parities [18]. If the costing year was not provided in the study, we assumed a costing year of 'publication year minus 3 years.' The reporting of our review was performed according to the PRISMA statement [19]. However, not all items of the PRISMA statement are applicable to economic evaluations. 3. Results 3.1. Study selection The initial search in the databases of Medline and Embase resulted in a total of 49 studies, of which 35 remained after removing duplicates. Of these 35 studies, 2 studies were excluded after screening titles and abstracts, and from 18 studies no full-text was available as these referred to conference abstracts only. As one additional study that met our inclusion criteria was identified outside the initial search, we ended up with 16 eligible studies [20-35]. The flowchart of the study identification process is displayed in Figure 1. One study comprised a main paper and a corrigendum [27,36]. Of these 16 studies, 2 did not primarily focus on the cost-effectiveness of QIV as compared with TIV compared with TIV and QIV . However, as both studies reported detailed results of TIV and QIV , we included these studies in our review. Outcomes on QIV versus high-dose TIV or versus adjuvanted TIV were not included in this review, but are briefly described in the discussion section. Overall, the reporting quality of the studies was found to be ac-114 Chapter 6ceptable (see Table S1 for detailed scores per checklist item). A total of 13 out of 16 studies were ranked as good, adhering to more than 17 out of 24 items on the CHEERs checklist [20-26,28-31,33,35], while 3 studies were assessed as moderate, adhering to less than 17 out of 24 points [27,32,34]. Arguments for the choice of time-horizon and model-type were most often not reported. Also details on instruments used and populations involved to estimate the impact of influenza on quality-of-life were not presented in the majority of studies. Fig. 1: Flowchart of the study selection process. 3.2. Study characteristics A summary of the general study characteristics is given in Table 1. All studies were con- ducted in industrialized countries, including the US [21-23,27,29], UK [28,31,33], Canada [20,31], Spain [25], Finland [30], Australia [26], Germany [24], and Hong Kong [34,35]. One 115 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccinestudy analyzed the economic impact of QIV in 5 countries of the European Union (EU) and extrapolated this to all 27 EU countries [32]. Out of the 16 studies, 13 were funded by manu- facturers [20-26,28-33], 1 was funded by public sources [27], and 2 studies were conducted without reporting any specific funding [34,35]. A total of 13 studies performed a cost-utility analysis [20-25,28-31,33-35], expressing results as costs per QALY gained. The remaining three studies conducted cost-comparisons [26,27,32]. Five studies used a dynamic modeling approach [23,24,29-31]. For three of these five stud- ies, a more detailed description of the dynamic model was previously published [37-39]. Dynamic models simulate the transmission dynamics of influenza within the population and take into account age-stratified mixing patterns between different population groups, sum- marized in a 'contact matrix.' These models were compartmental SIR models (or extensions of such models), dividing the population between susceptible (S), infected (I), and recov- ered/immune (R), while adding a vaccinated compartment to account for those individuals protected by vaccination. By definition, dynamic models are able to account for both direct effects of vaccination and indirect effects on the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated popula- tion, for example, herd protection or potential age shifts regarding incidence peaks [40,41]. The other 11 studies used static models [20-22,25-28,32-35]. Three of these 11 studies used the same Markov model [25,28,33] developed by van Bellinghen et al. [33], while 6 studies [20,21,26,27,32,34] followed and extended the approach that was explained in the online available spreadsheet-based model by Reed et al. [42]. All of the static modeling studies neglected indirect effects. The societal perspective was the most considered perspective [20-30,32,34,35], including direct medical costs and indirect costs due to productivity losses. Other perspectives that were used concerned the payers perspective, comprising medical costs only [20,23,24,26- 28,30-33,35]. Notably, some studies evaluated the decision problem from more than one perspective. Next to the perspective, the studies' time horizons present a core issue, with the longer time horizon generally being preferred but requiring long-term data and/ or additional assumptions. The time-horizon varied across studies from one year to a lifetime. Four stud- ies performed a retrospective analysis in which the additional benefit of QIV was estimated over 10 influenza seasons [26,27,32,34]. In some dynamic models, the total analysis time is longer than the time horizon (i.e. evaluation period) because of a 'burn-in'/'run-in' period [23,24,30,31]. This burn-in period is used to allow the model's dynamic behavior to settle down before the analysis between TIV and QIV is undertaken. For instance, in the study of Dolk et al. [24], each simulation ran for 40 years. The first 20 years were used for initializing age-dependent infection and immunity patterns in the population and the final 20 years for studying the intervention of QIV versus TIV .116 Chapter 6Table 1: Main characteristics and study design of the included studies Reference and countryFunding Type of analysisModeling approach Perspec- tiveTime horizon Currency mul - tivariate PSACross-validation out - comes Chit [21], United StatesIndustry CUA Static Society 1 season USD (2013), 3%/3%Univariate, mul - tivariate PSANR for QIV vs. regular TIV outcomes Clements [22], United StatesIndustry CUA Static Society 1 year USD (2011), 3%/3%Univariate, mul - tivariate PSACross-validation of model out - comes de Boer [23], United StatesIndustry CUA Dynamic Payer and society20 years USD (2013), 3%/3%Univariate, mul - tivariate out [24], GermanyIndustry Payer (2014), 3,0%/1,5%Univariate, mul comes SpainIndustry Society Life-time EUR (2014), 3%/3%Univariate, AustraliaIndustry CC, (CCA)Static Payer and society10 2012, 2009 excluded)AUD (2014), no discountingUnivariate Cross-validation of model out - comes Lee [27], United StatesPublic CC Static Payer and society10 Mullikin [29], United CUA Dynamic NA/3%Univariate, mul - tivariate PSACross-validation of model out Nagy [30], FinlandIndustry CUA Dynamic Payer and society20 years - tivariate PSAModel fit testing, cross-vali - dation of model outcomes & validation against independent empirical data Thommes [31], Canada and United KingdomIndustry CUA Dynamic Payer - variate PSAFace validity of input data, mod - el fit testing and cross-validation of model outcomes117 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccineReference and countryFunding Type of (NR), Cross-validation Bellingh - en [33], Unit- ed KingdomIndustry PSACross-validation of the concep - tual model and model outcomes, double programming You [34], Hong KongNo fundingCUA Static Society 9 seasons, (2001-10, excluding 2009)USD (2014), no discounting/3%Univariate Cross-validation of model out - comes You [35], Hong KongNo fundingCUA Static Payer NA/3%Univariate, - tivariate Uhart al.[32] reported results of five European Union countries (EU5) (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) and extrapolations of these results of 27 European Union countries (EU27).Table 1: Main characteristics and study design of the included studies ( continued )118 Chapter 6All studies except one applied an equal discount rate for costs and health effects, rang- ing from 3% for the US [21,22,27,34,35], Finland [30], and Spain [25], to 5% for Canada [20,31]. Only the study for Germany used differential discount rates, that is, 3% for costs and 1.5% for health effects [24]. Three studies reported a discount rate for health effects only [29,34,35], as they limited discounting to life-years gained of influenza-related deaths. Two studies analyzing the impact of QIV retrospectively did not apply discounting [26,32]. To accommodate for uncertainty of relevant parameters in the model, most studies performed sensitivity analyses. A total of 13 studies performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) [20-25,27-31,33,35], 14 studies univariate sensitivity analyses [20-25,28-35], and one study a deterministic multivariate sensitivity analysis [31]. Descriptions on model validation were found to be scarce. The majority of studies performed cross-validation of the model outcomes to other studies [21-26,28-35]. Other reported validation efforts were double pro- gramming [33], face validity testing of the input data [31], and testing of the fit of the dynam- ic model to influenza incidence data [30,31]. In addition, Nagy et al. [30] reported that the temporal patterns of influenza incidence in Finland produced by the calibrated model were validated against Finnish national surveillance reports. For two studies, we did not find any model validation effort reported [20,27]. 3.3. Characteristics of the vaccination programs and vaccines Table 2 shows the characteristics of the vaccination programs/vaccines, used as main inputs for the models. Most studies focused on the whole population [20,22-24,27,29-33,35]. Two studies focused on the vaccination of the elderly aged 65 years [21,34], while three studies included elderly aged 65 years and people <65 years with clinical risk conditions [25,26,28]. Vaccine coverage was predominantly based on current national uptake rates of the influenza vaccination program. Most studies focused on inactivated influenza vaccines only, while three studies also included a live-attenuated vaccine (LAIV) for age-groups where this vac- cine is licensed [22,30,31]. All studies assumed equal vaccine efficacy of TIV and QIV against influenza type A viruses, as both vaccines contain the same influenza type A strains. Therefore, the vaccine efficacy against influenza A is not explicitly taken into consideration in this review. With regard to vaccine efficacy against influenza B, most studies used data from published meta-analysis by Tricco et al. [43] or DiazGranados et al. [44], while two studies [20,31] adopted the vaccine efficacy reported for the US vaccination program by Reed et al. [42]. Two studies did not differentiate between vaccine efficacy against influenza A and influenza B [24,29]. 119 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccineAlmost all studies assumed that the vaccine efficacy of TIV against influenza B is proportion- al to the relative match with the circulating influenza B lineage in the last decade, with the match failing in approximately half of the seasons. In case of mismatched seasons, 11 stud- ies assumed that TIV provides cross-protection against the mismatched influenza B lineage [20-24,26,28,31-34]. This level of cross-protection ranged between 60% and 70% of the matched vaccine efficacy. For QIV , studies predominantly applied the matched vaccine effi- cacy of TIV against both B-lineages. Chit et al. [21] increased the efficacy for 65+ year-olds from 49.0% for TIV to 50.7% for QIV . Four dynamic modeling studies reported information regarding the duration of the vaccine-induced protection [23,24,30,31]. Two studies set the average duration of vaccine protection at 1 year [23,31] and one study at 1.81 years [24] (presented in [39]). The study of Nagy et al. [30] used a probabilistic approach during the cal - ibration process, sampling durations from a range of 0.5-3 years using a uniform distribution. Figure 2 shows the incremental vaccine price of QIV over TIV . Seven studies based the vac- cine price of QIV on published price lists [20,22-25,28,31], for instance, from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention vaccine price list. Other studies assumed a hypothetical vac- cine price for QIV [20,29,33,35], extrapolated the price increase from another country [31], or explored a range of vaccine price differences [27,34]. The incremental vaccine price var - ied considerably across studies, ranging from US $1.25 for Canada [20] to US $7.14 for the US [21]. Two studies assumed an equal vaccine price (price parity) of QIV and TIV [26,30], while the study of Uhart et al. [32] did not report vaccination costs, which, in interpreting their results, also reflects price parity between QIV and TIV . The three studies that includ - ed LAIV in their analysis used the same price for trivalent LAIV and Q-LAIV [22,30,31]. Vaccine administration costs were excluded in this review, as these costs are expected to be identical for TIV and QIV .120 Chapter 6Table 2: Characteristics of the vaccination programs and its vaccines Reference and countryIncluded popu - lationVaccine Type Vaccine coverage (%) influen TIV opposite B-virus (%)Efficacy of QIV against influenza B (%)Incremental vaccine price (2015 US $) Chit United StatesElderly influenza efficacy TIV against both B-lineages5.16121 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccineReference and countryIncluded popu - influen TIV opposite B-virus (%)Efficacy of QIV against influenza B (%)Incremental vaccine price (2015 US $) Mullikin efficacy of 0.40-0.65a in high match season, and 0.25-0.56a in low match seasonNR Overall influenza efficacy of high match season4.34 Nagy [30], FinlandAll ages IIV 5.22 - , c: Adopted from Eichner et al.

Prices are converted to 2015 US$. * These studies assumed price parity between QIV and TIV . For these studies incremental vaccine prices of inactivated vaccines were shown only. For live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV), price parity was assumed between LAIV and quadrivalent LAIV . The study of Uhart et al. [32] did not include vaccination costs, which reflects price parity. 3.4. Influenza-related characteristics Table 3 depicts an overview of the influenza-related input characteristics. An important ep- idemiological parameter concerns the probability to contract influenza among unvaccinat - ed persons (attack rate). Half of studies reported this parameter [21,22,25-29,33]. In these studies, the probability of getting infected was age-dependent, being higher for children than for adults. Influenza cases were then split to subtype and lineage using laboratory data on influenza-positive tests. No distinction by age group was made in any study in the division of the influenza cases over influenza A and influenza B. Dynamic models estimated influ- enza incidence by subtype and lineage incidence by calibrating the model on time series of influenza-like illness incidences combined with laboratory data on influenza-positive tests [23,24,30,31]. Studies with a dynamic modeling approach rather reported a basic reproduc- tion number (R0) than attack rates to demonstrate the spread of infection within the popu- lation. Notably, the R0 reflects the average number of secondary infectious individuals pro- duced by an average primary infectious case in a totally susceptible population. The number of influenza-related hospitalizations or deaths was mostly calculated by mul- tiplying the number of symptomatic influenza cases with the age-specific probabilities of these events, while some studies applied event rates on the study population directly. Other studies [34,35] used a top-down approach similar to the model of Reed et al. [42], estimat -Table 2: Characteristics of the vaccination programs and its vaccines ( continued )123 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccineing the number of influenza cases by dividing national influenza-associated death rates with influenza case-fatality ratios from the literature. Three studies used outcomes data that were specific for influenza B [30,34,35]. Two studies from Hong Kong used influenza B-specific hospitalization rates and/ or influenza B mortality rates [34,35], while Nagy et al. [30] adapt - ed subtype-specific outcomes estimated from the UK to Finland. All other studies used the same outcome probabilities across all influenza subtypes. The QALY loss per influenza illness is calculated using two main parameters, that is, the quality of life estimate of influenza disease (utility) and the duration of the associated epi- sode. Most studies split the duration and utility for influenza in two different categories, that is, uncomplicated and complicated influenza infections (including hospitalization) [21,23- 25,28,31,33-35], while three studies applied average estimates of influenza-related QALY losses directly from the literature [20,23,30]. One study ignored QALY losses due to influen- za illness assuming the disease to be transitory with negligible impact on the overall quality of life, but included QALY losses due to mortality [22]. We found that all studies based their QALY estimates on published data from non-subtyped influenza cases; that is, no studies used data specific for influenza type B infection. Influenza-related costs can be separated into health-care and non-health-care costs. The health-care cost includes predominantly GP costs, hospitalization costs, and drug costs, while non-health-care costs include costs for travelling and productivity losses due to work loss. Overall, we found that on average the studies for the US had higher health-care costs than the studies from other countries. With regard to productivity losses of influenza-associated deaths, five studies [24,27,28,30,35] used the human capital approach valuing productivity losses until the age of retirement (Table 3). Three studies [20,21,23] applied the friction cost methods, assuming that an employee falling out of the production process will be replaced by an unemployed person after a friction period and that a certain elasticity of labor time and production applies. Again, no studies used data on resource use or absenteeism that was stratified by influenza subtype. A final important parameter of interest concerns the duration of protection after natural in- fection. This parameter was implemented in four dynamic modeling studies [23,24,30,31]. All these studies assumed that the duration of naturally acquired immunity was longer than vaccination-acquired immunity. Two studies used an average duration of naturally acquired immunity for influenza B of 12 years [23,31], while one study used a duration of 7 years [24] (as presented in [39]). The study of Nagy et al. [30] used a probabilistic approach for this parameters during their calibration process, sampling input values between 0.5 and 75 years using a uniform distribution.124 Chapter 6Table 3: Influenza related input parameters of the included studies Reference Annual influenza attack rate (%) / R0% influenza B of total influenza cir - culation, % influ - enza B unmatchedHealth effects influenza morbidity Health effects in - fluenza mortalityWork days lost Chit [20], CanadaNR NR QALY for age-specific utilityIllness: NR; Mortality: Friction period days Chit [21], United States65y: 5.7 NR Uncomplicated: Utility of 0.25 for 6.0 days.

Study outcomes The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness results of QIV versus TIV are summarized in Table 4 and Figure 3. We found that the impact of QIV on influenza-related morbidity and mortality varied considerably across studies. Overall, dynamic models reported higher reductions of influenza-related morbidity as compared with static models. The impact of QIV on the total number of influenza cases (type A and B) as compared with TIV ranged from a reduction of 0.15% in the US using a static model [22] to 6.47% in the US using a dynamic model [29]. Studies presenting results for influenza B only found reductions of 29.2% for the US using a dynamic model [23] and 14.7% for Hong Kong using a static model [35]. One study focusing on elderly in Hong Kong presented incidence rates of averted influenza B cases, finding a to- tal reduction of 118-508 per 100,000 person years [34]. Impact on influenza-related mortality was generally estimated somewhat higher than influenza morbidity (T able 4). Most studies drew a conclusion on whether implementing QIV could be regarded as a cost-ef- fective intervention. However, most countries do not have an official willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, whereas the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK considers a WTP threshold of US$29,070-43,600 (\u00a320,000-30,000) per QALY for vaccines [45]. When no official thresholds were available, studies often referred to WTP thresholds used in earlier published cost-effectiveness studies or to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), suggesting that an intervention is cost-effective if the ICER is below three times the gross domestic product per capita of a country [46]. Applying this WHO recommendation on the US would result in a WTP threshold of US $150,000 per QALY gained. All cost-utility studies concluded that vaccination with QIV would be at least cost-effective as compared with TIV , when official or hypothetic thresholds were considered [20-25,28-31,33-35]. 3.6. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness results Parameters that were found to be of highest impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes are shown in Table 4. The four most reported key parameters were the vaccine price of QIV , the level of cross-protection of TIV against the mismatched B virus strain, the distribution of influenza incidence between influenza A and influenza B, and the level of vaccine match of TIV with the circulating B lineages (Table 4). Obviously, higher vaccine price differences between QIV and TIV resulted in less beneficial cost-effectiveness outcomes. For instance, Nagy et al. [30] found that when an incremental vaccine price of US $3.96 for QIV over TIV would be assumed instead of price parity, the estimated amount of cost saving would be reduced by 30%. Also, the high ICER of US $139,027 per QALY gained for the US elderly by Chit et al. [21] could be explained by a relatively high vaccine price of QIV .127 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine Fig. 3: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in US$/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of quadrivalent influenza vaccine as compared with trivalent influenza vaccine.

[23], showing that decreasing the level of cross-protection from 70% to 50% in the US turned the ICER from US $27,891 per QALY gained into cost-saving/dominant. Furthermore, the circulation and distribution of, respec- tively, influenza A and influenza B and related vaccine matching/efficacy had also a strong effect on the ICER. For example, van Bellinghen et al. [33] noted that, in a scenario of 0.4% circulation of influenza B, the ICER would increase to US $587,000 per QALY gained and, in a scenario of 30% circulation of influenza B, the ICER would decrease to US $2,200 per QALY gained, both as compared to a base case of US $8,611 per QALY at 24.8% circulation. Additionally, in a scenario of 99.0% matching of TIV with the circulating influenza B virus strain instead of 52.3%, the ICER would rise to US $450,000 per QAL Y gained. 4. Expert commentary This is the first systematic review concerning the health-economic value of QIV so far. Ac- cording to the current literature, QIV appears to be a cost-effective intervention as compared with TIV . All studies found that QIV resulted in valuable health benefits as compared with TIV by reducing influenza related morbidity and mortality within a range of 0.15-6.5%. Ad- ditionally, QIV was estimated to save costs to the health-care system and to society, partially or even fully compensating for the higher vaccine price of QIV compared to that of TIV . Although conclusions on cost-effectiveness were generally similar, we found substantial het- erogeneity across cost-effectiveness results. ICERs varied from a health-care payer's perspective and cost-saving to $140,000 from a societal perspective. Identified key parameters to cost-effectiveness outcomes included vaccine price, circulation of the B-virus not included in TIV and cross-protection of TIV against the opposite B-virus. The modeling approach was found to be important with regard to cost-effectiveness results. Despite the recommendations of Quinn et al. [13] and working groups on cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccines [40,47], only five studies used a dynamic transmission model. We found that dynamic models predicted a higher impact of QIV on influenza morbidity than static models, resulting in better cost-effectiveness outcomes. Vaccination reduces the overall in- fluenza transmission within a population. As static models use a constant force of infection, they do not quantify the indirect impact of vaccination. Therefore, we recommend that, al- though static models can be informative for an initial preliminary analysis, dynamic models are required to study the full impact of QIV on health-economic outcomes. Obviously, the downside of this recommendation is that dynamic models demand more (fine-grained) input data than static models [41].131 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccineThe impact of modeling approaches depends on the current vaccination policy of the studied country. Countries with universal influenza vaccination recommendations, such as the US, have relatively high vaccination coverage among children. As children seem to represent an important group in influenza transmission [48,49], the additional impact of dynamic models over static models will be higher in countries with universal vaccination as compared with countries restricting influenza vaccination to elderly and specific high-risk groups. Addi- tionally, when - from a societal perspective - cost savings due to (parental) work loss are taken into account, potentially better cost-effectiveness outcomes may ensue. On the other hand, complication rates are highest among the elderly. Therefore, we would emphasize that cost-effectiveness outcomes might be highly influenced by the target group of the vaccina - tion program. An important key aspect to cost-effectiveness outcomes is whether cross-protection of TIV against the mismatched B virus is taken into account. As mentioned by Quinn et al. [13], recent evidence suggests that cross-protection of TIV to the opposite influenza B virus ex- ists, potentially diminishing the impact of QIV significantly [43,44]. Our review shows that the majority of studies included cross-protection in their analyses. Most studies referred to systematic reviews by Tricco et al. [43] and DiazGranados et al. [44], estimating that the vaccine efficacy of TIV against the non-included B virus strain is 65-70% of the matched efficacy. Studies on single influenza seasons confirmed the finding of cross-protection during the 2012-2013 season in the US and Canada [50,51], but not during the 2011-2012 sea- son in Canada [50]. Additionally, a recently published serological study demonstrated that antibodies elicited with inactivated TIV containing a Victoria-lineage strain were highly cross-reactive to a Yamagata-lineage strain [52]. As current evidence supports the existence of cross-protection, we endorse the inclusion of this aspect in cost-effectiveness models. However, as bias cannot be ruled out due to pre-existing immunity as a result of prior vacci - nation or natural infection, the exact estimate is unclear. Therefore, we highly recommend to perform sensitivity analyses on this parameter. Another key parameter influencing cost-effectiveness outcomes is the vaccine price. Many studies had to make assumptions on the price premium of QIV as compared with TIV , since no official vaccine price was available at the moment of analysis. Therefore, the vaccine price should be taken into account when interpreting results, as for instance cost-effectiveness studies assuming a price parity between QIV and TIV will almost automatically result in cost-saving outcomes. On the other hand, assuming price parity in the absence of an official QIV price and just showing the expected net health benefit of QIV over TIV avoids drawing the wrong conclusion. Cost-effectiveness results could then be easily updated when a vaccine price becomes available. Currently, price lists of the US CDC show that the vaccine man-132 Chapter 6ufacturers increased the price of inactivated QIVs significantly, at around 50% higher than inactivated TIVs, although there was no price increase shown for Q-LAIV as compared with trivalent LAIV [53]. However, in large-scale public health programs, such as influenza vacci - nation, vaccines might be procured at relatively lower prices than indicated by the list prices. Cost-effectiveness results also tend to be highly sensitive to the level of circulation of the influenza B virus. In seasons with a proper vaccine match and no co-circulation of both B lineages, the effect of QIV over TIV is likely to be negligible. This was highlighted in some studies that analyzed the impact of QIV retrospectively over the period 2001-2010, demon- strating a wide variation in cost-effectiveness results between different seasons [27,33,34]. As any influenza virus, influenza B incidence varies across countries and regions [4,5]. For instance, three studies estimated the proportion of mismatched influenza B infections at 50% of the total influenza B infections in the US between 1999 and 2009, in line with 52.6% in Australia between 2002 and 2012, and 52.4%, in the UK between 2000 and 2010 [22,26,33]. However, the study by Heikkinen et al. [54] found that this proportion was only 41.7% in Finland in the period 1999-2012. Therefore, studies analyzing the retrospective impact of QIV should aim to use country-specific data. We noticed that most studies used equal estimates of resource use and costs across all influ- enza subtypes. As suggested by Quinn et al. [13], influenza B might be associated with higher morbidity in children as compared with the elderly. In the elderly, highest hospitalization and mortality rates were found for the influenza A/H3N2 subtype, followed by influenza B virus and the A/H1N1 subtype. Usage of outcome estimates that are not specified by seasonal influenza subtype might therefore be considered nonoptimal. However, a study of Mosnier et al. [55] showed that despite differences in age-distribution between influenza A and in- fluenza B, no differences on clinical severity were found between influenza virus types and subtypes among GP visiting influenza cases. Notably, when influenza B causes less severe disease in adults and the elderly as compared with influenza A, patients with influenza B will be underrepresented at medical facilities to undergo laboratory testing for subtype. This may complicate the split of influenza cases by subtype as performed in static models. A further complication might be that available data on laboratory tests were often subtyped between A and B, but not between B/Vic and B/Yam [56]. Regarding influenza-related mortality, the impact of QIV might be overestimated when A/H3N2 is indeed related to higher mortality in elderly than influenza B. As data on influenza B incidence and its resource use are still not widely available, more evidence on incidence and resource use by subtype would be desir - able to improve the validity of cost-effectiveness results.133 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccineNext to nonlinear influenza epidemiology by age and sub-type, pre-existing immunity due to prior natural influenza infection or vaccination history might induce inaccuracy. Duration of naturally acquired immunity is expected to be influenced by the natural waning of immunity within the individual as well as the drift of influenza viruses over time [57]. However, evi- dence on this aspect is, to the best of our knowledge, still scarce. Dynamic modeling studies included in this review, predominantly derived inputs for this parameter from a study of Vynnycky et al. [58]. This study calibrated a dynamic model on influenza incidence patterns of the UK, with optimal fit occurring when durations of naturally acquired immunity were set at 6 years for influenza A and 12 years for influenza B. Also a study by Eichner et al. [39], describing the influenza dynamics for Germany, assumed a longer naturally acquired immunity for influenza B as compared with influenza A/H3N2 (3.5 years versus 7 years). The study of Nagy et al. [30] found eligible simulations during their calibration process for durations of naturally acquired immunity against influenza B ranging between 0.5 and 75 years. A recent dynamic modeling study from Japan [59], however, estimated much shorter durations of natural immunity against influenza B than the above mentioned studies, estimat - ing 1.15 years for B/Vic and only 0.08 years for B/Yam, although this does not align well with current knowledge on the relatively conserved antigenic nature of influenza B [60]. For the duration of vaccine-induced protection, a recent study by Kissling et al. [57] suggested that protection against influenza B was longer than that against influenza A/H3N2, possibly due to a more rapid antigenic drift of A/H3N2 [61]. Related to this aspect, H\u00f6pping et al. [62] recently presented an approach to optimize the effectiveness of TIV by choosing the included influenza B strain on the basis of the population's pre-existing immunity instead of taking the virus strain that circulated in the prior season. They argued that by taking into account the time since vaccination, antigenic drift, and serological parameters of each B virus strain, the level of residual protection against B/Yam and B/Vic could be estimated. By selecting the in- fluenza B virus strain with the lowest residual protection, high protection levels against both influenza B viruses would be present after vaccination, potentially giving a better protection in case of a vaccine mismatch. Although this strategy is expected to be still inferior to QIV , H\u00f6pping et al. [62] suggested that it might at least partially capture the benefit of QIV , with- out any additional vaccine costs. So far, no study has ever compared the cost-effectiveness of QIV versus TIV using this 'H\u00f6pping' approach, which, however, might be of interest and complement existing studies. With regard to the quality of reporting according to the CHEERS criteria [15], we found that adherence to this checklist was acceptable. However, we noticed that only a few studies pro- vided arguments whether the chosen time horizon was appropriate to capture all the various effects and consequences of the intervention. Indeed, influenza is often considered a seasonal issue, with each year different types and/or subtypes of influenza predominantly circulating, 134 Chapter 6varying in disease severity. Yet, considering the fact that influenza is an annual recurrent disease with potential crossover effects from season to season, a time horizon of more than one year is needed to capture all the various effects and consequences of vaccination policies. Hence, models should transparently argue whether their chosen time horizon is long enough to include relevant subsequent effects. A second concern that emerged from the analysis using the CHEERS checklist relates to the exact descriptions of the population and instruments used to estimate the impact of influenza on quality-of-life. We noticed that many of the included studies used utilities from outdated studies (mostly other models) that were based on small sample sizes. Updating a systematic review on studies measuring the impact of quality-of-life estimated of influenza morbidity by Van Hoek et al. [63], we found that the evidence on this aspect is still limited [64]. Although two studies were published that used EQ-5D to measure quality-of-life of influenza morbid- ity based on larger sample sizes [63,65], generalizability might be limited as these analyses were conducted among patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 influenza strain. As pan- demic H1N1 was generally seen as a milder variant of disease than A/H3N2 in adults, these values might not be truly representative for seasonal influenza in general [66]. Therefore, we recommend precise studies on estimating the quality-of-life in laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza patients with standardized instruments. The reporting regarding performed validation processes was found to be limited. A proper validation process of the model and its transparent reporting will improve the credibility of the model outcomes. Although most studies performed cross-validation of model outcomes to similar studies, these comparisons are mostly hampered by differences between model types and/or model inputs. Notably, as the inclusion of parameters such as waning of im- munity or antigenic drift of viruses strongly enhance the complexity of (dynamic) models, validation techniques on the computerized model and its outcomes will become increasingly important. Obviously, the transparency of a model increases considerably by making the model publicly available, which - to the best of our knowledge - was only done for the mod- el used in the Canadian study by Chit et al. [20]. In addition, we would advocate the use of structured model validation checklists, as researchers tend to do more validation efforts than they report in their manuscripts [67]. Finally, we found that the majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. We feel that, in addition to these sponsored studies, also publicly funded economic evalua - tions of QIV are needed to validate the findings from industry-funded studies. Furthermore, there were no studies performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it would also be valuable to know if more restricted budgets could be better spent on QIVs or 135 Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccineTIVs. Indeed, due to differences in demographics, comorbidities, and healthcare facilities, results from industrialized countries are not directly transferable to LMICs. For instance, as influenza B rather tends to infect adolescents and young adults than elderly, the impact might be higher in LMICs which generally have younger populations. An individual-based mod- eling exercise found that QIV would reduce influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths by 18% as compared with TIV in a community in South Africa between 2003 and 2013, while this was only 2% in Australia in the same period [68]. A limitation of our study is that our search was restricted to the English language. A major strength of our study is that we systematically searched for economic evaluations of QIV using multiple databases. We converted study results to the same price year and corrected for differences in purchasing power to enhance comparability. Another strength is that we checked whether the key challenges mentioned by Quinn et al. [13] were addressed properly. We also included studies in which the primary goal was not to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of QIV as compared with regular TIV , but for instance with high-dose TIV or adjuvant TIV [21,29], with cost-effectiveness of QIV emerging as an additional result. Chit et al. [21] esti- mated that a high-dose TIV , containing four higher viral-loads as compared with regu- lar TIV , would be more effective in preventing influenza disease in US elderly as compared with QIV . From the societal perspective, the authors estimated that high-dose TIV would be cost-saving as compared with QIV or US $5,157 per QALY gained as compared with regular TIV . Mullikin et al. [29] found from a TIV adjuvanted with the squalene-containing oil-in-water emulsion MF59 would be cost-saving in US elderly as compared with regular TIV and QIV . In conclusion, published evidence of the economic consequences found that quadrivalent influenza vaccination is expected to be a cost-effective intervention as compared with TIV . However, the cost-effectiveness potential is strongly related to the price difference between QIV and TIV , and the level of cross-protection that TIV provides against the B virus strain that is not included in the vaccine. In other words, the benefits of QIV will vary strongly by season according to the match of TIV with the circulating B virus strain. It is therefore recom- mended to assess the impact of QIV versus TIV using data from multiple influenza seasons, which on average will give a better reflection of influenza B virus strain circulation from one year to another. As previously discussed by Quinn et al. [13], we support the inclusion of cross-protection of TIV against the mismatched B virus, the use of influenza B-specific data to estimate the disease burden, and the use of dynamic models. As we noticed that influenza B-specific data on disease burden and costs remains scarce, we recommend more research into these topics.136 Chapter 65. Five-year view With regard to the future, we endorse studies aiming to unravel the immunogenicity of natu- ral influenza infection and vaccination. Uncertainty around potential influential aspects like cross-protection, duration of vaccine-induced and natural immunity is large. Further insight into these aspects will improve the understanding and modeling of influenza transmission dynamics. However, as modeling of the relationship between (drifting) influenza viruses and immunity in the human population will increase the complexity of dynamic modeling, we would also advocate proper and transparent model validation processes in order to guarantee continued adequate evidence-based immunization decision-making. Although newly developed influenza vaccines, like high-dose vaccines and adjuvanted vac- cines, have been shown to have improved immunogenicity and may, potentially, induce bet- ter cross-protection as compared with standard vaccines [69,70], their efficacy toward un- matched viruses remain to be analyzed. To definitively overcome this issue, the development of broad-spectrum influenza vaccines is currently widely explored [71]. These so-called 'universal' vaccines aim to induce a humoral response against viral antigens or antigenic epitopes which are not affected by antigenic drift or they may activate a different immune pathway like the cellular immune response [60]. Universal vaccines may thus provide pro- tection against not only many different viral strains and drift variants, but also against anti - genically shifted viruses with pandemic potential. A recent modeling exercise demonstrated that such broad-spectrum vaccines have the potential to interrupt influenza transmission even at moderate uptake levels [72]. Although some promising broad-spectrum vaccines have entered already the phase of testing in clinical trials [60], it remains uncertain whether and when such vaccines will become publicly available. Certainly, duration of vaccine-induced protection will become a very important aspect with regard to the public-health impact and cost-effectiveness of these vaccines.

Dec;19(8): 964-975 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.012 )142 Chapter 7Abstract Background: Designed to B mismatch, new quadrivalent influenza vac- cines (QIVs) contain one additional B strain compared with trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs). Objective: To examine the expected public health impact, budget impact, and incremental cost-effectiveness of QIV versus TIV in the United States. Methods: A dynamic transmission model was used to predict the annual incidence of influen- za over the 20-year-period of 2014 to 2034 under either a TIV program or a QIV program. A decision tree model was interfaced with the transmission model to estimate the public health impact and the cost-effectiveness of replacing TIV with QIV from a societal perspective. Our models were informed by published data from the United States on influenza complication probabilities and relevant costs. The incremental vaccine price of QIV as compared with that of TIV was set at US $5.40 per dose. Results: Over the next 20 years, replacing TIV with QIV may reduce the number of influenza B cases by 27.2% (16.0 million cases), resulting in the prevention of 137,600 hospitaliza - tions and 16,100 deaths and a gain of 212,000 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The net societal budget impact would be US $5.8 billion and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio US $27,411/QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 100% and 96.5% of the simulations fell below US $100,000/QALY and US $50,000/QALY , respectively. Conclusions: Introducing QIV into the US immunization program may prevent a substantial number of hospitalizations and deaths. QIV is also expected to be a cost-effective alternative option to TIV .143 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the United States1. Introduction Seasonal influenza is a viral infectious disease caused by influenza type-A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses or influenza type-B viruses (Yamagata and Victoria). Surveillance data show that B strains represent on average 24% of viral isolates in the United States (US) and from the 2001-2002 season to the present, both B lineages have cocirculated each season at varying levels and with no regularity [1]. In the US, the average annual public health burden of seasonal influenza (types A and B) is estimated at 24,000 deaths and 95,000 hospital ad- missions; however, in severe seasons, this can increase to 49,000 and 270,000, respectively [2,3]. Also, the economic burden of influenza is significant. Annual influenza-related medical costs in the United States have been estimated at US $10 billion and productivity costs at US $16 billion [4]. Seasonal vaccination against influenza is regarded as the most effective strategy to prevent influenza disease [5]. Traditional influenza vaccines are trivalent, con- taining strains of two influenza A subtypes (one of each H1N1 and H3N2) and one strain of an influenza B lineage (Victoria or Yamagata), according to recommendations of the World Health Organization. However, over the decade 2001 through 2012, mismatches between the circulating B lineage and the B strain of the vaccine occurred in 5 of the 10 seasons in the US because of the cocirculation of both influenza B lineages [1]. Two recent meta-analysis have demonstrated that TIV offers suboptimal protection when there is a mismatch between circulating influenza B and B vaccine strains (B-lineage vaccine efficacy is 71%-77% when TIV influenza B is lineage matched and 46%-49% when mismatched) [6,7]. To address the problem of influenza B matching, quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) were developed and licensed in the US market in 2012 [8]. In addition to strains of the two influenza A subtypes, QIVs contain strains from both type-B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that QIV might have prevented on average 340,000 influenza cases, 2,700 hospitalizations, and 170 deaths within the seasons 2001/02 to 2008/09 [9]. Moreover, two economic evaluations demonstrated that the cost-ef- fectiveness of shifting from TIV to QIV was favorable [10-12]. However, published economic evaluations of QIV versus TIV in the US so far are based on static models. The static approach assumes a constant risk of infection and does not incorporate the indirect protection that the successfully immunized proportion of the population provides to those individuals who are still susceptible, by reducing the risk of transmission (herd effects). Dynamic models simu- late disease transmission by taking into account contact patterns between humans and the risk of transmission per contact, which allows the model to account for herd effects [13]. Because influenza vaccination impacts disease transmission, the dynamic approach can be regarded as the more appropriate approach to quantify the epidemiological and economic impact of replacing TIV by QIV [14]. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of QIV versus TIV for seasonal vaccination in the US on the basis of a dynamic modeling approach.144 Chapter 72. Methods 2.1. Overview The cost-effectiveness model uses an age-structured dynamic transmission model to estimate the impact of QIV over TIV in terms of clinical outcomes, costs, and health effects. Clinical outcomes included outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Costs were assessed from the third-party payer's (TPP's) perspective, considering reimbursed direct medical costs only, as well as from the societal perspective, which also accounts for out-of-pocket-paid over-the- counter medication and indirect costs due to productivity losses. Final outcomes of the study were incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and incremental costs per life-year (LY) gained. 2.2. Model Design The dynamic transmission model developed by Crepey et al. [15] was used to estimate age- stratified numbers of symptomatic influenza B cases under the QIV and TIV strategies. The model is a variation on the compartmental SEIR model, where individuals can be susceptible to infection (S), exposed but not infectious (E), infectious (I), or recovered (R) from an infec- tion and therefore immune for a certain time period. A vaccination compartment was added to account for individuals effectively protected from infection by vaccination. The model accounted for cross-protection, that is, the protection that vaccination against or natural in- fection by a B lineage offers against the opposite B lineage. A more detailed description of the dynamic model and main input parameters can be found in Supplemental document A and Appendix Table 1 in the Supplemental Materials. For the economic model, we used an age-structured decision tree model (Fig. 1), developed in Excel 2010 and linked to the dynamic model described above. The output of the dynamic model, age-stratified symptomatic influenza cases, served as input to the economic model. First, the age groups of the dynamic model were recategorized in the economic model to align with available data on economic parameters (0-23 months, 2 years, 3-4 years, 5-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years, 65+ years), using age-distribution data of the US population [16]. Next, the economic model stratified influenza cases between non-high risk (NHR) patients and high risk (HR) patients on the basis of the presence of chronic dis- ease [17]. Then, cases were divided into four categories (no medical attention, outpatient visit, hospital admission, and death) on the basis of relevant medical complication probabili - ties reported by Molinari et al. [4]. For children younger than 18 years, outpatient visits were further subdivided between uncomplicated cases, cases with otitis media, and cases with pneumonia/other complication following the model design of Prosser et al. [18]. We ignored the adverse events of vaccine in our model because the safety profile of TIV and QIV was 145 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the United Statesfound to be similar [19-21]. Fig. 1: Flow diagram of the economic decision tree model. NHR: Non-high risk, HR: High risk. 2.3. Probabilities Table 1 lists all relevant probabilities included in the model. 2.3.1. Health status Age-specific proportions of the US population at high risk of complications were derived from Molinari et al. [4]. HR statuses were based on the Advisory Committee on Immuniza - tion Practices recommended groups for influenza vaccination [22]. Notably, being 65 years or older was not sufficient on its own for an individual to qualify as being at high risk. Because the dynamic transmission model did not stratify by health status, we divided the symptomatic influenza cases between HR and NHR according to the prevalence of HR in the different age groups. This assumes that HR and NHR patients were at equal risk of influenza infection and of developing symptomatic influenza. To correct for difference in vaccination coverage between HR and NHR (higher in the HR group), we adjusted the division of influenza cases between NHR and HR according to NHR-/HR-specific vaccination coverages [23,24]. 2.3.2 Primary care The probability of an outpatient visit per influenza B case was based on published studies [4,18]. In these studies, it was assumed that the probability of an outpatient visit for an HR patient was estimated to be approximately twice that of an NHR patient, except for elderly, where the corresponding factor was estimated at 1.3. For children, outpatient visits were further divided between uncomplicated cases and complicated cases, which were defined as cases presenting with otitis media and pneumonia/other complications [18].146 Chapter 72.3.3 Hospitalizations and mortality Consistent with primary care data source, probabilities of hospitalization and death were derived from the same source [4]. These probabilities were based on 1980-2001 data and estimated by modeling excess hospitalizations and deaths using International Classification of Diseases-9 codes for underlying respiratory and circulatory conditions. No distinction between risk groups was available here, so this was not included in the base-case analysis. However, a scenario with higher probability of hospitalization and death for HR individuals was explored in the sensitivity analysis. 2.4. Costs 2.4.1. Medical costs Costs are presented in Table 1 and adjusted to 2013 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index [25]. All medical costs were derived from published US studies. Cost data of outpatient visits included outpatient service claims as well as pharmaceutical claims and laboratory testing [4,18]. For children, costs of a hospitalization included diagnostics, therapeutics (in- cluding prescriptions), room costs, and physician services [18,26]. For adults, total costs of hospitalized patients and deaths were based on all direct costs of 2 weeks before admission to 30 days after admission, including inpatient costs, outpatients cost, and pharmaceutical claims [4]. Notably, the assumption was that all patients dying received some hospital care before they died. Costs of over-the-counter medication were retrieved from published sourc- es [4,18,27], and counted for all influenza cases, including cases that did not seek medical attention. 2.4.2. Vaccination costs Total yearly number of administered vaccinations was calculated by multiplying the age- specific coverage rates with the corresponding population sizes, as already present in the un- derlying dynamic model. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that children younger than 8 years receiving influenza vaccination for the first time should be vaccinated twice, although this advice is likely not strictly adhered to [22]. As such, and in accordance with previous modeling studies, the number of vaccines given to children aged 6 to 23 months, 2 years, and 3 to 4 years was multiplied by 2, 1.5, and 1.33, respectively [18]. Vaccine prices of TIV and QIV for the public and private markets were obtained from the CDC vaccine price list of 2013 [28]. We assumed that 50% of children younger than 12 years, 30% of adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years, and 10% of the adults obtain the vaccine funded under the public price and the remainder by paying private market prices [29]. No administration costs were included in this analysis because these were assumed to be equal in both alternatives.147 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the United States2.4.3. Indirect costs Age- and health-status-specific productivity losses were derived from Molinari et al. [4]. Up to the age of 17 years, lost productivity was counted as parental work loss, whereas for cases 18+ years old work loss was assigned to the cases themselves. Following the US Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, we used the friction costs method approach to count productivity losses [30]. This approach limits productivity losses of long-term absence to a friction period, assuming that employees have been replaced after this initial period [31]. The friction period was set at 40 days, which comprises 20 days to make the decision whether an employee has to be replaced and another 20 days to fill the vacancy [32,33]. In line with the friction costs method, we multiplied the number of workdays lost with the elas- ticity adjustment factor, as the proportion of reduction in effective labor time due to absence will be less than 1 due to, for example, a company's internal labor reserves [34]. Because we were not able to identify data on US elasticity of labor, as such, we used an internationally suggested elasticity of 0.8 [35]. Finally, adjusted productivity losses were calculated by mul- tiplying the lost productivity days with age-specific daily earnings [36]. These daily earnings were further adjusted for age-specific labor participation rates [16]. For productivity losses of caregivers, we used average daily earnings of the age group 25 to 54 years. 2.5. Health Effects QALY losses of influenza and its complications are presented in Table 1. For children young- er than 18 years, QALY loss for uncomplicated influenza was estimated at 0.005 per episode [37]. This was based on time trade-off questions for parents on uncomplicated influenza of their child. Additional QALY losses for children with otitis media, pneumonia, and hospital - ized influenza were derived from a pneumococcal study, and were estimated at 0.042, 0.046, and 0.076, respectively [38]. QALY loss of a non-hospitalized influenza episode in the adult population was estimated at 0.0071 [39,40]. This was based on pooled patient-level data from four clinical trials in which data on quality of life (QOL) of ambulatory patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were collected for 7 days using the visual analogue scale score [40]. The QALY loss of an adult with influenza-related hospitalization was estimated to be 1.8 times higher than that of an ambulatory patient on the basis of a QOL assessment among patients with clinically diagnosed influenza in Belgium using the standardized 12- Item Short Form Survey (SF-12)[41]. The number of LYs lost because of influenza-related deaths was calculated by estimating remaining life expectancies at the age of death using life tables [42]. LYs were transformed to QALYs by adjusting these with baseline age-specific QOL estimates [43].148 Chapter 7Table 1 - Input of the economic model.

Cost-Effectiveness A time horizon of 20 years was used (week 30 of 2014 to week 29 of 2034) to cover fluc- tuations in influenza disease between seasons regarding, for example, attack rate, dominant strains, and vaccine mismatches. Cumulative direct costs, indirect costs, LYs lost, and QA- LYs lost were determined for both alternative vaccines over the full time horizon. The incre- mental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of shifting from TIV to QIV were then calculated by dividing the net difference in costs by the net difference in QALYs or LYs. To take time preferences into account, future costs and health effects were annually discounted at a rate of 3% [30]. 2.7. Sensitivity Analysis A deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to vary to the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval (CI) parameters considered of main interest (Table 1). For proba- bilities and costs derived from Prosser et al. [18], we interpreted the presented ranges as 95% CIs. SDs of costs derived from Molinari et al. [4] were used to estimate 95% CIs. Results of the deterministic sensitivity analysis were presented in a tornado diagram. Scenario analysis was performed to explore the effect of alternative plausible inputs on cost-effectiveness outcomes. Concerning parameters of the dynamic model, vaccine efficacy (range -20% to +20% of base-case efficacy), vaccine coverage (range -20% to +20% of base- case coverage), cross-protection against opposite B lineage (range 40%-95% of matched vaccine efficacy), and duration of natural protection (6-18 years) were explored. For the economic model, there were higher risks of hospitalization and mortality for the HR group than for the NHR group [44-46]. Concerning health effects, alternative QALY loss assump- tions as estimated by Sander et al. [47] were explored in the model. Also, assumptions on calculations of the productivity losses were varied by excluding the elasticity of adjustment factor and increasing the friction period to 23 weeks, according to Dutch cost-effectiveness guidelines [32], and a scenario using the human capital approach. Here, lost earnings in all remaining LYs till retirement were counted, ranging from $235,294 for the age group of 65+ years to $1,739,727 for the age group of 18 to 49 years [4]. Finally, discount rates were varied, using 5% for both costs and health effects and a scenario with 3% for costs and 0% for health effects. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to analyze the robustness of the results. Parameters of the dynamic model involved in the PSA were probability of influenza infection () with B Yamagata and B Victoria, cross-protection due to natural infection and due to vaccination, duration of protection after natural infection, weight of seasonal forcing, 153 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the United Statesand duration of the infectious period. Sampling was performed from the estimated posterior distributions of the listed parameters whose 95% high-density intervals are given in Table 1. In addition, plots of the posterior of these parameters are given in the Supplemental Materials (see Appendix Fig. 1 in Supplemental Materials). Parameter distributions in the economic model were defined using means and SDs as presented in Table 1. A total of 1000 iterations were done and for each combination of parameters, the results were presented in a cost-effec- tiveness plane. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was generated to show the proportion of cost-effective simulations over a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. 3. Results 3.1. Health Outcomes, Costs, and Cost-Effectiveness The impact of shifting from TIV to QIV on health outcomes and costs is presented in Table 2. Over the next 20 years, shifting to QIV will decrease the number of influenza B cases by 16.0 million (27.2%). Annual average numbers of prevented influenza B cases by age group can be found in Appendix Table 2 in Supplemental Materials. Consequently, this will avoid 6.1 million outpatient visits, 137,645 hospitalizations, and 16,199 deaths, a reduction of 29.4%, 30.4%, and 31.7%, respectively. In addition, a total of 99,558 QALYs will be gained because of reduced influenza illness and 113,190 QALYs because of averted influenza deaths. Con- cerning costs, shifting to QIV leads to an increase of $11.6 billion in vaccine costs; however, $1.5 billion in outpatient visit costs, $2.5 billion in hospitalization costs, and $0.8 billion in costs of influenza-related deaths would be saved. From the societal perspective, an additional $0.8 billion of productivity losses and $0.05 billion in over-the-counter medication costs are estimated to be saved. Table 3 presents the incremental costs, health effects, and ICERs of QIV versus TIV . The incremental costs of shifting from TIV to QIV are $6.7 billion and $5.8 billion from the TPP perspective and the societal perspective, respectively. Consequently, a total of 212,722 QALYs and 143.7 LYs will be gained. This results in ICERs of $31,385/ QALY gained from the TPP perspective and $27,411/QALY gained from the societal per - spective. Regarding LYs, the ICER is $46,477 per LY gained (TPP) and $40.591 per LY gained (societal). 3.2. Univariate Sensitivity Analysis The deterministic sensitivity analysis shows that the ICER was most sensitive to the prob- ability of death (Fig. 2A). Two further parameters with high impact on the ICER were the probabilities of hospitalization and the QALY losses attributed to influenza illness. The sce- nario analysis demonstrated that the ICER was most sensitive to the level of cross-protection (Fig. 2B). Decreasing the cross-protection from 70% to 40% of vaccine efficacy changed the ICER to cost saving, whereas increasing the cross-protection to 95% of vaccine effica-154 Chapter 7cy resulted in an ICER of $297,000/QALY gained. Quantifying productivity losses using the human capital approach instead of friction methods approach decreased the ICER to $15,000/QALY gained. When QALY losses due to influenza illness were used as presented by Sander et al. [47], the ICER decreased to $15,700/QALY gained. Altering the incremental vaccine price of QIV over TIV 25% downward and upward resulted in ICERs of $13,840 and $40,991/ QALY gained, respectively. A threshold analysis estimated that an incremental price of $7.63 rendered an ICER equal to $50,000/QALY gained. Extended results of the univariate analysis of the most influential parameters, cross-protec- tion of vaccine efficacy against matched strain and vaccine efficacy, is presented in Figure 2. Cost-saving ICERs were obtained when cross-protection was 50% or less of the vaccine effi- cacy (Fig. 2C). Variation of the vaccine efficacy within \u00b120% of the base-case value resulted in an ICER ranging between $10,983 and 35,620/QALY gained (Fig. 2D).

Discussion Our results indicate that shifting from TIV to QIV is expected to reduce the health burden of influenza B over the next 20 years by 27.2% (16.0 million influenza B cases) in the US. This would prevent 6.1 million outpatient visits, 137,645 hospitalizations, and 16,199 deaths. Moreover, our analysis has demonstrated that QIV is a cost-effective alternative, with ICERs of $31,385 and $27,411/QALY gained from the TPP perspective and the societal perspective, respectively. The PSA showed that the results were robust, given that more than 94% of the simulations were below a threshold of $50,000/QALY gained and all simulations were below $100,000/QALY gained. Variables with a high impact on the ICER were level of cross-pro- tection against opposite B lineage, vaccine efficacy, vaccine price, and probability of death given symptomatic influenza. So far, two economic comparisons of QIV versus TIV in the US have been conducted, in- volving a cost-benefit [10,11] and a cost-effectiveness analysis [12]. The cost-benefit analy - sis used data on clinical outcomes (symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) from a retrospective study by Reed et al. [9]. This study, using a static model, estimated that during the seasons 1999-2000 to 2008-2009 QIV could have reduced the number of influenza cas- es on average by 342,700 per year, resulting in annual reductions of 2,144 hospitalizations and 137 deaths [9]. Our dynamic model estimated the number of prevented influenza cases to be more than twice as high (mean yearly reduction of 799,155 influenza cases), which might be at least partly explained by our model's ability to account for herd immunity. Other differences as compared with Reed et al. [9] are that our analysis is age-stratified and takes into account the existing population immunity and cross-protection against the mismatched B strain. Regarding health-related outcomes, it is striking that our estimate on the number of influenza deaths is relatively high as compared with Reed et al. [9] (810 vs. 137). This might be related to the fact that we used influenza-related mortality estimates based on Internation - al Classification of Diseases-9 codes of all underlying respiratory and circulatory diseases, whereas Reed et al. [9] restricted the analysis to only those causes of death corresponding to International Classification of Diseases-9 codes of influenza and pneumonia only. Because it has previously been suggested that including only respiratory categories might result in an underestimation of deaths attributed to influenza [48], we chose to use mortality estimates that included all underlying respiratory and circulatory diseases. The corresponding cost- benefit analysis by Lee et al. [10,11] estimated the mean incremental costs per influenza case averted at $1218, using the TPP perspective and an incremental vaccine price of $5. Applying exactly the same vaccine price difference, we estimated a lower incremental cost per case of $488. This might be related to the higher hospitalization costs used in our analysis, although we had no access to specified cost data of the study of Lee et al. [10,11].159 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the United StatesThe second economic analysis comparing QIV with TIV in the US was a cost-effectiveness analysis by Clements et al. [12]. This study also used a static approach and estimates on in- fluenza incidence, vaccine efficacy, and cross-protection, which were similar to ours. Despite the different modeling approach, we found similar reductions in hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the incremental costs of QIV over TIV were comparable from a TPP perspective ($340 million by Clements et al. [12] vs. $445 million in our study [undiscounted]) and even closer from a societal perspective ($327 million by Clements et al. [12] vs. $390 million in our study [undiscounted, productivity losses of death excluded for consistency]). Because Clements et al. [12] did not account for herd protection and did not count QALY losses due to influenza illness, but only due to deaths, we found a higher QALY gain in our study (9584 vs. 3593). This explains our lower estimated cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,415/QALY gained as compared with the one by Clements et al. [12] ($90,301/QALY gained). A comparison of QIV with TIV in the United Kingdom found an ICER of \u20ac27,378/QALY gained ($44,300) for the TPP perspective, which is also in the range of what we found [49]. Important differences to our analysis are the static approach they used. A strong point of this study was the use of a dynamic transmission model, which provides the ability to account for changes in the force of infection arising from the reduction in the prevalence of infected individuals brought about by vaccination. Static models, in contrast, use a fixed force of infection, which makes them able to capture only the impact of direct protection at the very start of an influenza season. As soon as direct protection of vaccination influences the prevalence of infectious cases, a change in the force of infection occurs. Static models then cease to quantify the direct protection of vaccination correctly, making the value of a direct comparison between the static and dynamic modeling approaches of limited value only. Moreover, because the force of infection influences the direct and indirect impact of the vaccination in our analytic context, this comparison is further hampered. Yet, if comparing static and dynamic models, the most valid comparison might be between Reed et al. [9] (as already discussed above) and results of our dynamic model previously shown in Crepey et al. [15], because these studies cover the same time period (2001-2009). This comparison shows that in this situation the dynamic model predicted twice the number of influenza cases prevented per year as compared with the static model (342,700 vs. 661,600). As with any economic evaluation, our analysis is a simplification of the real world and we had to make some assumptions. One simplification of our model structure concerned the exclusion of the use of antiviral medication (such as zanamivir and oseltamivir). However, the efficacy of antiviral medication was included intrinsically in the probabilities of influen- za-related complications we used, as well as the costs of antiviral medications (including the \"older\" drugs amantadine and rimantidine) that were included in the cost data of outpatient 160 Chapter 7visits. Because these cost data were based on the period 2001-2003, prescription behavior may have changed in the meantime and could therefore have an impact on our results. We ex- pect this impact to be small, however, because the univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the outpatient visits' costs had a minor impact on the ICER. Second, we used probabilities of complications, cost estimates, and QALY losses of influenza in general, because data specific to influenza type B were scarce. However, literature so far did not show significant differ - ences in clinical burden between influenza A and influenza B [50]. Furthermore, estimates on probabilities to a clinical event stratified between HR and NHR population were scarce. Therefore, the influenza-related probabilities of outpatient visits for HR populations had to be based on assumptions taken from earlier studies [4,18]. For the probability of hospitaliza - tion and death, we applied the same risk for the HR population as for the NHR population, in the absence of data. Because HR individuals tend to have a higher risk of hospitalization or death [45,46,51] and higher treatment costs [4], our assumptions can be considered as conser - vative in this regard. Also, we did not explicitly take into account potential vaccination with live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in our model. The current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations do however not prefer LAIVs over inactivated influenza vaccines because efficacy estimates were found to be similar [52]. Concerning costs, incremental vaccine costs of QIV over TIV were based on inactivated vaccine price differences, whereas the CDC list-price of trivalent-LAIV and quadrivalent-LAIV remained the same [53,54]. This might result in an overestimation of the incremental vaccine costs of QIV over TIV , which can therefore be regarded as a conservative approach in our analysis. Finally, we assumed a complete one-off switch from TIV to QIV for all age groups, whereas in reality this switch might be gradual. However, adoption of QIV in the US has been wide- spread, although no public data by age group are available at the moment. Moreover, full- scale adoption of QIV might again be considered a conservative approach for estimating the ICER as compared with targeted adoption. No official willingness-to-pay threshold exists for the US; however, $50,000/QALY gained has been cited in most articles [55]. Our study demonstrates that shifting to QIV would be a cost-effective intervention in the base case applying this threshold. Another approach, which has recently been proposed by the World Health Organization, is to relate the cost-effective - ness threshold to other health program alternatives to judge whether an intervention offers good value for the health care budget [56]. In the US, multiple vaccines have been added to the CDC's vaccination schedule during the last decade. Examples of these recommend - ed vaccines and their cost-effectiveness are pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 17-year-olds 161 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the United [60], and human papillomavirus for 250,000/QALY) [61]. The cost-effectiveness of QIV is at least as favorable as all aforementioned vaccines. 5. Conclusions Our model estimates that replacement of TIV by QIV would reduce the number of influenza B cases by 27.2% (16 million cases) over the next 20 years in the US. This would avoid 6.1 million outpatient visits, 137,645 hospitalizations, and 16,199 deaths. In the base case, the ICER was estimated at $31,385/QALY gained from the TPP perspective and $27,411/QALY gained from the societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the results are ro- bust with similar cost-effectiveness results over various ranges of assumptions. QIV could be considered to be a cost-effective intervention from both the TPP perspective and the societal perspective applying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY gained.

Methods: Individual based dynamic simulation models were interfaced with a health eco- nomic analysis model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 15% of the popu- lation with QIV or TIV in each community over the period 2003-2013. Vaccination was prioritized for HIV-infected individuals, before elderly aged 65+ years and young children. Country or region-specific data on influenza-strain circulation, clinical outcomes and costs were obtained from published sources. The societal perspective was used and outcomes were expressed in International$ (I$) per quality-adjusted life-year (QAL Y) gained. Results: When compared with TIV , we found that QIV would provide a greater reduction in influenza-related morbidity in communities in South Africa and Vietnam as compared with Australia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of QIV versus TIV was estimated at I$4183/QALY in South Africa, I $1505/QALY in Vietnam and I$80,966/QALY in Australia. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of QIV varied between communities due to differences in influenza epidemiology, comorbidities, and unit costs. Whether TIV or QIV is the most cost-effective alternative heavily depends on influenza B burden among subpopulations tar - geted for vaccination in getary impact.167 Cost-effectiveness vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and Australia1. Introduction Seasonal influenza has been estimated to cause between 3 and 5 million cases of severe ill - ness and 250,000-500,000 deaths globally each year [1]. The elderly, very young children and people with specific health conditions are at highest risk of developing serious compli - cations [2]. In addition, influenza imposes a significant economic burden involving health care costs and productivity losses. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), costs due to seasonal influenza may have a considerable economic impact, estimated at 2-6% of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, compared to only 0.04-0.13% of GDP per capita in high income countries [3]. Annual vaccination is currently the most effective way of preventing influenza disease [1]. The commonly used trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) contain strains of two influenza A sub-types (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B lineage (either Victoria or Yamagata), based on recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO). Over the last de- cade, vaccine protection was regarded as suboptimal in some years due to mismatches with the dominant circulating B lineage, or due to co-circulation of both B lineages in the same season [4]. In a response to this, quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) have been developed containing both B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata). Previous cost-effectiveness analyses on influenza vaccination have had a focus on high-in- come countries with few economic studies of influenza vaccination in LMICs [3,5-7]. For instance, in a recent paper QIV was found to be cost-effective in the United States [8]. Some LMICs are now considering whether seasonal influenza vaccination should be introduced in their vaccination programs and whether this should involve TIVs or QIVs. Significantly, cost-effectiveness outcomes are not directly transferrable between countries, due to differ - ences in circulating strains, demographics, climate, co-morbidities, health care infrastructure and budgets. For example, a study in South Africa, a country with considerable human im- munodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, estimated that the incidence of influenza-associated severe lower respiratory tract infections was 4-8 times higher in HIV-infected individuals as compared with HIV-uninfected individuals [9]. In this study we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination with TIV and QIV in three communities: Agincourt, a low-income rural community in South Africa; Thai Nguyen, a middle-income urban community in Vietnam; and Albany, a high-income urban/rural com- munity in Australia. For this purpose, individual based simulation (IBS) models for each of the three communities were developed and interfaced with a health economic analysis model, capturing the specific demographics and health profiles of each community. As circulation of the different influenza B lineages and corresponding TIV vaccine matches are hard to predict, 168 Chapter 8we studied the impact of TIV and QIV using retrospective data, over the period 2003-2013 (11 seasons). 2. Methods 2.1. Model overview An overview of the analytic methodology used in this study is shown in Fig. 1; parenthe - sized numbers below refer to numbered items in the figure. Population and geographic data was used to build models for communities in South Africa, Vietnam and Australia (1). For each country, influenza strain circulation data was used to calibrate strain-specific influenza transmission parameters for the years 2003-2013 (2). For each of these combinations of communities and study years (39 in total), 3 different vaccination strategies were created: no vaccination, vaccination with TIV (using the actual influenza B strain present in the vaccine used in that country in that year), and vaccination with QIV (using both influenza B lineages) (3). For each combination of community, year and vaccination strategy (in total 117 scenar - ios) established individual based influenza spread simulation models (4) were used to assess the incidence of symptomatic influenza, stratified by age and HIV status (5). Influenza spread simulations also generated counts of work-days lost due to influenza (6). Fig. 1. Overview of the interfaced individual based simulation model and the health economic model. HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus; QALY: Quality-Adjusted Life Year. The numbers refer to the textual methodology overview given at the beginning of the Methods section. These outputs, along with community, age, and HIV status-specific risk parameters (7) served as input to a health outcomes model (8), which generated numbers of clinical visits, hospi- talizations and deaths due to influenza (9). Using cost and quality of life parameters (10), an economic analysis process (11) subsequently took the health outcomes counts, work-days lost and generated total costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses for each scenar - io. The differences between corresponding no-vaccination and vaccination scenarios served 169 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and Australiato calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the TIV and QIV vaccination strategies. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results due to un- certainty in health outcome parameters, cost parameters and the stochastic nature of influenza spread. 2.2. Individual based simulation models 2.2.1. Community models The main characteristics of each community are shown in Table 1. Agincourt represents a low-income rural area in northern South Africa, with HIV prevalence at 16% in the adult population and a relatively low life-expectancy. The lower-middle income community of Thai Nguyen is located in north Vietnam near Hanoi and represents an urban setting and a relatively low HIV prevalence in adults (2.3%). Albany reflects a combined urban and rural community in Western Australia, representative of high-income countries with high life-ex - pectancy and low HIV prevalence (0.2%). Current seasonal influenza vaccination coverage is moderate in Albany (20%), negligible in Agincourt (<2%) and absent in Thai Nguyen. Table 1: Main characteristics of the communities studied in this analysis.

Census and local government data was used to assign each individual to a number of contact groups (i.e. groups which the individual meets daily, including house- holds, school classes, or groups of work colleagues). The size and overlapping memberships of contact groups is a key determinant of influenza spread, and these groups were constructed taking into account community-specific details including employment rate, workplace size, school attendance, number and size of schools, and household sizes. The IBS community models of Agincourt and Albany have been described in more detail previously [10,11]. The community model of Thai Nguyen in Vietnam was developed using the same methodology 170 Chapter 8as the other models and is described in detail in the supplementary material. 2.2.2. Influenza transmission As the simulation software runs, individuals come into daily contact with other individuals in their contact groups, where influenza transmission from infectious to susceptible individuals may occur: a stochastic choice determines if transmission fails, or results in symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. The model is able to capture the infection history of each individual regarding infection status, i.e. susceptible, infected, infectious or immune (due to infection or vaccination). Separate infectivity status was recorded of each of the four seasonal influ- enza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1), B Yamagata, and B Victoria. The output of the IBS-model consisted of the number of symptomatic influenza cases and number of work days lost. A workday lost was deemed to have occurred when an individual who would have otherwise attended a workplace withdrew to their household, either due to influenza infection them - selves, or because one or more children in the household was ill with influenza. Main input parameters of the IBS-model are listed in the supplementary methods Table S2. The annual attack rate of influenza infection in each unvaccinated community was set at 21% and annual symptomatic attack rate (SAR) at 5% [12,13]. However, as the SAR of 5% has been deter - mined in a setting where seasonal influenza vaccination already existed, we also performed analyses using a SAR of 10%. The transmissibility of each strain in each simulation year was calibrated to match the proportion of each strain occurring that year for each community (Fig. 2) [14-17]. As no information on the lineages of influenza B infections was available for Vietnam, influenza B lineage data from Thailand was used to partition the Vietnamese B infection between the two lineages [18]. A more detailed description of the transmission parameter calibration process is given in the supplementary material. 2.2.3. Vaccination The number of vaccine doses used each year was assumed at 15% of the population and prioritized to vulnerable sub-groups: first to HIV-infected individuals, then to elderly aged 65 years and older, and the remaining to children aged <5 years. Age-specific coverages are shown in supplementary methods Table S3. In the Agincourt and Albany communities, the Southern Hemisphere TIV vaccine composition as used in Australia and South Africa was assumed (Supplementary methods Table S4) [19]. In the case of VN, where currently no seasonal influenza vaccination occurs, the TIV recommendation for the previous northern hemisphere winter was used [19]. Vaccine efficacy was set at 65% for individuals aged <65 years and at 55% in people aged 65 and older [20-22]. No cross-strain vaccine protection was assumed; that is, vaccination with TIV did not provide any protection against the influenza B strain not included in the vaccine and vaccine efficacy for that strain was zero.171 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and Australia Fig. 2. Relative proportions of influenza A viruses and influenza B viruses stratified by matched and mismatched lineage (See Supplementary methods Table S4 for more details) by influenza season as used in the model. Split of influenza B by lineage in Vietnam was based on surveillance data from Thailand. 2.3. Health outcomes model Using the age and HIV-specific counts of symptomatic cases generated by the IBS model, counts of clinical visits, hospitalizations and deaths were generated using age- and coun- try-specific probabilities for each community and vaccination strategy (Supplementary meth - ods Table S5). We applied higher risks of clinical events for HIV-infected individuals with influenza disease as compared with HIV-uninfected individuals [9,23]. As not all probabili - ties of a clinical event were available for each country, we also relied on data from countries 172 Chapter 8in the same region. We used data on influenza-related clinical visits from Kenya [24] for Agincourt and data on hospitalizations and mortality from Thailand [25] for Thai Nguyen. 2.4. Economic analysis 2.4.1. Costs In the health economic analysis, a societal perspective was taken, including health care costs as well as costs due to productivity losses. Healthcare costs included clinic visits with con- comitant drug prescriptions, hospital admissions, vaccines and their delivery costs, while non-health care costs included productivity losses due to lost work days (Supplementary methods Table S6). All costs were expressed in International dollars (I$) and transformed to the base-year of 2013 using national consumer price indices [26- 28]. International dollars adjust for differences in purchasing power, enhancing the comparability of monetary out- comes between LMICs and high-income countries. As the price of QIV was not available for the countries examined, we had to make an assumption. We assumed a price for QIV at 50% higher than the TIV price, similar to the price premium of QIV over TIV given by the US CDC [29]. Productivity losses due to influenza illness were calculated by multiplying the number of work days lost by average daily earnings in the community and applying the friction methods [30]. More details on conversion rates and cost inputs are presented in the supplementary material. 2.4.2. Health effects Influenza-related QALY losses were quantified by summing up QALY losses due to influenza illness and premature mortality. QALY-losses for non-hospitalized and hospitalized cases were obtained from the literature [31,32]. Age-specific QALY losses due to influenza-re - lated death were based on the national life expectancies [33-35] converted to QALYs us- ing health-related quality-of-life estimates [36-38]. Notably, HIV-infected individuals were assumed to have a lower life expectancy and health-related quality of life compared with HIV-uninfected individuals [39]. More details on QALY-loss inputs are presented in the sup- plementary material and Supplementary methods Table S7. 2.4.3. Cost-effectiveness analysis Total costs and QALY losses of the no-vaccination, TIV and QIV alternatives were added together over the period 2003 to 2013 and the ICER was calculated by dividing the incre - mental costs by the incremental QALYs. As the analysis was retrospective and vaccination occurred seasonally, we did not discount costs or health effects falling in the same year as vaccination. Future costs (e.g. lifelong productivity losses) were discounted to present values at 3% annually, while future health effects (e.g. preterm mortality) were not discounted [40].173 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and Australia2.5. Sensitivity analyses We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the robustness of model outcomes and the impact of specific assumptions in both the simulation model and the combined health out- comes/economic analysis model. For each scenario a multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to assess the effect of parameter uncertainty. 1000 Monte-Car - lo samples were created, with health outcomes and economic parameter values drawn from predefined distributions. This resulted in 1000 separate outcomes for total costs and total QALY loss per vaccination strategy. Details on interval ranges of the included economic parameters can be found in Supplementary methods Tables S5-S7. Net monetary benefits (NMBs) of each simulation were calculated for the three studied vaccination strategies (no vaccination, TIV , QIV) using the equation: NMB = x QALY - Cost, where is the willing - ness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. For each simulation it was analyzed which vaccination strat- egy was the most cost-effective (i.e. the one with the highest NMB) over a range of WTP thresholds. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were subsequently designed to present proportions of being the most cost-effective for each vaccination strategy. Finally, a univariate sensitivity analysis on the price difference between QIV and TIV was performed, by varying the price premium of QIV over TIV between 0% (QIV price equal to TIV price) to 100% over TIV (QIV price double of TIV price). 3. Results 3.1. Clinical outcomes The clinical impact under the three alternatives of no-vaccination, TIV , and QIV is shown in Table 2 for SARs of 5% and 10%. Assuming a SAR of 5%, introduction of vaccination with TIV was found to reduce the incidence of symptomatic influenza in each community by 47.3-49.2%. These reductions were found to be similar across all age-groups (see supple- mentary results Figs. S1 and S2). Vaccination led to reductions in clinical visits, hospitaliza - tions and deaths in the range 48.2-59.4% (Table 2). In Agincourt SA, the additional benefit of QIV over TIV was estimated to give a 12.1% reduction of symptomatic influenza and a 17.0% reduction of influenza-related mortality. In Thai Nguyen, the impact of QIV over TIV was estimated highest (22.5% reduction of symptomatic influenza and 27.6% reduction of influenza-related mortality) and in Albany lowest (1.2% reduction of symptomatic influen- za and 2.3% of influenza-related mortality). Under the 10% SAR assumption scenario the additional benefit of QIV over TIV was estimated to be 9.5% for symptomatic influenza and 14.0% for influenza-related mortality in Agincourt; 8.9% for symptomatic influenza and 14.5% for influenza-related mortality in Thai Nguyen; and 2.0% for symptomatic influenza and 3.3% for influenza-related mortality in Albany.174 Chapter 8Table 2: Impact of vaccination with TIV and QIV on the incidence of symptomatic influenza cases, clin - ic visits, hospitalizations and deaths in Agincourt (South Africa), Thai Nguyen (Vietnam) and Albany (Australia) over the period 2003-2013.

Cost-effectiveness outcomes Table 3 shows the effect of TIV and QIV on total influenza-related costs and QALY losses per person in each community over the period 2003-2013. Assuming a SAR of 5%, the ICER of TIV versus no vaccination was 1803/QALY gained in Agincourt, I$1064/ QALY in Thai Nguyen and I$907/QALY in Albany. Increasing the SAR to 10% resulted in lower ICERs or even cost-savings (for instance, vaccination with TIV was estimated cost-saving as compared with no vaccination). When QIV was compared with TIV , the ICER was estimated at I$4183/175 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and AustraliaQALY in Agincourt, I$1505/QALY in Thai Nguyen and I$82,669/QALY in Albany using a SAR of 5%. Assuming a SAR of 10%, the ICER decreased to I$1364/QALY in Agincourt, I$745/QALY in Thai Nguyen and I$28,419/QALY gained in Albany. More detailed results on the impact of vaccination on costs and QALY losses are presented in supplementary results Table S1 (5% SAR) and Table S2 (10% SAR). In Agincourt, highest QALY gains due to influenza vaccination were found, but least productivity losses were saved. In Albany, vacci - nation prevented relatively more healthcare costs and productivity losses.

Sensitivity analyses A univariate sensitivity analysis of the vaccine price of QIV versus TIV is shown in Fig. 3. Overall, the price premium of QIV over TIV had a significant impact on cost-effectiveness results. With a SAR of 5%, the price premium of QIV should be lower than I$0.31 in Agin- court, I$0.67 in Thai Nguyen and I$0.16 in Albany to result in cost-saving ICERs. When a SAR of 10% was assumed, this price premium was allowed to increase to I$0.73 in Agin- court, I$1.05 in Thai Nguyen and I$1.26 in Albany. Fig. 3. Univariate sensitivity analysis of the price premium of QIV over TIV when a SAR of (A) 5%, and (B) 10% was assumed. 0% price premium means that the QIV price is equal to the TIV price, while 100% price premium means that the QIV price is double of the TIV price. Aus: SAR: Symptomatic attack rate, TIV: Trivalent influenza vaccine, VN: Vietnam. After using a PSA of 1000 Monte-Carlo samples, CEACs are presented in Fig. 4. These graphs show for each vaccination alternative the chance of being the most cost-effective over a range of WTP thresholds. Corresponding cost-effectiveness planes are shown in sup- plementary results Fig. S3. At a SAR of 5%, QIV had a >90% probability of being the most cost-effective alternative when the WTP threshold was above I$5200/QALY in Agincourt, I$2150/QALY in Thai Nguyen and I$220,000/QALY in Albany. The high WTP threshold in Albany can be explained by the small impact that was modelled for QIV as compared with TIV , resulting in more uncertainty. When a SAR of 10% was used, QIV had a >90% probabil - ity of being the most cost-effective alternative a WTP threshold QALY and and Albany, respectively. 177 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and Australia Fig. 4.

Discussion In this study the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination with TIV and QIV was mod- elled in communities in South Africa (Agincourt), Vietnam (Thai Nguyen) and Australia (Albany), having different demographics, economic status, health care resources, influenza epidemiology and HIV prevalence. We found that cost-effectiveness of QIV as compared with TIV differed significantly between countries, being the highest in Albany and lowest in Thai Nguyen. This difference was explained by greater influenza B co-circulation and vac- cine mismatches in South Africa and Vietnam during the period 2003-2013 as compared to Australia. Highest QALY gains due to influenza vaccination were found in Agincourt, mainly due to a higher risk of influenza-related death in the HIV-infected population. In Albany, vaccination prevented more health-care costs and productivity losses due to relatively higher hospital costs and daily wages. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the SAR and the price of QIV had a high impact on the ICER. When a no-vaccination SAR of 10% was assumed the proportional reductions in SAR were lower than for the 5% scenario across all communities, and consequently proportional reduc- tions in clinical visits, hospitalization and mortality were also lower. This is expected since influenza is more transmissible (i.e. has a higher R0) in the higher attack rate scenario, which makes all interventions proportionally less effective. This occurred particularly in the Thai Nguyen model where coverage among young children, who are disproportionally responsi- ble for onward transmission, was higher than in other communities (see supplementary re- sults for more explanation). Note however that while the proportional reductions are lower in the 10% SAR scenario compared to the 5% scenario, the absolute number of cases prevented is higher. Increase of the SAR from 5% to 10% improved the cost-effectiveness, explained by the increase of the absolute number of clinical events prevented using the same quantity of vaccine. To decide whether influenza vaccination is cost-effective and, if decided yes, whether this should be TIV or QIV , depends on the country, influenza epidemiology and the countries' WTP threshold. For none of the countries involved in this analysis an official cost-effective - ness threshold is available. For South Africa and Vietnam, however, a previously estimated threshold for LMICs in general of I $1045/QALY might be used [41], while a previous study in Australia used a threshold of I$32,900 (=Aus$50,000)/QALY [42]. Then, TIV would be cost-effective in Vietnam and Australia, while for South-Africa this depends on the attack rate. QIV would only be cost-effective when a high SAR of 10% was assumed. For Vietnam, also an official threshold of Thailand might be used, which has been estimated at I$8100 (=100,000 Thai Baht)/QALY [43]. In that case, QIV would be cost-effective independent of influenza attack rate assumptions.179 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and AustraliaHowever, a review of the role of cost-effectiveness on introducing human papillomavirus and rotavirus vaccination in LMICs has shown that budgetary impact is often deemed more important for implementing a vaccination program than cost-effectiveness [44]. Extrapolat - ing the annual budget impact of TIV and QIV to a national scale in South Africa, the costs of TIV and QIV would be I$59 million and I$76, respectively, being 0.14% and 0.18% of the national healthcare budget as estimated by the WHO [45-47]. Historic case studies of implemented vaccines for children in South Africa showed that vaccine costs of pneumo- coccal vaccination and rotavirus vaccination were estimated at IS$66 million and IS $22 million, respectively, while the ICERs ranged between US $523-1347/QALY [48]. Although the annual budget impact and cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination with TIV is still in line with for instance pneumococcal vaccination (I$1803/QALY), the ICER we estimated for QIV is significantly higher (I$4183/QALY). For Vietnam, nationwide vaccination costs would be estimated at I$63 for TIV and I$79 million for QIV , being 0.34% and 0.43% of the healthcare budget. Although currently no vaccines have been implemented structurally, cost-effectiveness analyses of rotavirus and hepatitis B for children were estimated at I$556/ QALY and I $4/QALY , respectively [49,50]. This could imply that in Vietnam other non-im- plemented vaccines might be of higher priority than influenza vaccination with TIV (I$1.064/ QALY) or QIV (I$1505/QALY). It should be noted, however, that influenza requires annual vaccination, while pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccination confer longer -term immunity. To date, the cost-effectiveness of QIV has been shown to be favorable in several high-income countries [7]. One other study also assessed the public health and economic impact of QIV versus TIV in Australia [51]. Excluding vaccination costs, they found that QIV would result in $I30.6 million (AUS$46.5 million) of savings to the society between 2002-2013. When we would extrapolate our results to the whole Australian population, we found savings of I$6.5 million over a similar period. This difference can be primarily explained by that in our analysis we used approximately three times lower probabilities of consulting a GP or being hospitalized due to influenza disease. Other differences were that we used a dynamic model instead of a static model, a lower coverage rate (15% vs. 17.5%) and lower hospitalization costs for the elderly population. This study has its limitations. The annual attack rate of symptomatic influenza was kept constant at 5% (and 10%) over the 11 years in all three regions, whereas influenza incidence varies per year and per region. Furthermore, influenza peaks differently country-by-country, for example southern Vietnam has a tropical climate with year-round circulation [52], while our model of Thai Nguyen assumed a winter influenza season. This complicates the timing of vaccination and may affect vaccine protection, enhancing the risk of a vaccine mismatch or waning of the vaccine-induced protection. We used data from Thailand for Vietnam to parti -180 Chapter 8tion influenza B between Victoria and Yamagata lineages, as data for Vietnam was absent. We chose Thailand because it is located in the same influenza transmission zone as considered by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System [53]. Moreover, online available influenza laboratory data from WHO's Flunet showed a comparable partition of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H1N3 over the period 2006-2013 for both countries (data prior 2006 was not available for Vietnam here) [54]. In Thailand, A/H3N2 contributed to 44% of the total influenza A positive samples, while this was 47% in Vietnam. We did not apply cross-protection of TIV to the non-matched B lineage in our study. How- ever, recent evidence suggests that such a cross-protection exists, that might reach up to 60-70% of the efficacy of the matched influenza strain [55,56]. Including cross-protection in the analysis would increase the estimated ICERs of QIV as compared with TIV , as the relative impact of QIV over TIV is diminished. We assumed the northern hemisphere com- position of TIV for Vietnam in our analysis. Vietnam has a relatively long latitudinal span, stretching up far above the equator, where also the community of Thai Nguyen is located. Moreover, it covers tropic and subtropical areas where the concept of hemispheres may not directly be applied [57]. Although the government eventually decides whether the northern or southern hemisphere vaccine is to be used and despite the limitation on the applicability of the hemisphere concept in a country like Vietnam, the WHO recently recommended the southern hemisphere vaccine for tropical Asian countries including the whole of Vietnam [58]. In supplementary methods Table S2, the B-strains of northern TIV (see Vietnam) and southern TIV (see South Africa and Australia) are presented by season, as well as the con- tribution of both B-lineages to influenza circulation. It shows that the B-strain included in TIV only differed between the northern and southern hemisphere vaccine during the seasons 2006 and 2008. Co-circulation of both B-lineages occurred in these two seasons, however, the southern hemisphere TIV matched the B-lineage that contributed highest to influenza circulation better than the northern hemisphere TIV (18.3% vs. 15.0% in 2006 and 25.0% vs. 16.7% in 2008). This would result in a slightly lower impact of QIV in Vietnam and a slight worsening of the cost-effectiveness, without changing our overall conclusions. Finally, the vaccine efficacy was assumed to be similar between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected indi- viduals, which might be regarded as a simplification as this is still uncertain for HIV-adults with low CD4 cell count [59]. With regard to clinical and health-economic outcomes, we used hospitalization and mortality incidences that were based on pneumonia and influenza diagnoses only, while influenza is also associated with other respiratory as well as cardiorespiratory complications [60]. This reflects a conservative approach, as the prevented number of hospitalizations and deaths might be higher. We ignored possible side-effects of the influenza vaccine, although serious 181 Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and Australiaadverse outcomes are rare and the influenza vaccine is generally regarded as safe, including in HIV-infected individuals [61]. We limited costs in our analysis to direct medical costs and productivity losses due to work absenteeism. Costs not involved in our analysis include, for instance, transport costs, over-the-counter medication/traditional medicine, and productivity losses due to influenza-related presenteeism. Finally, the results of the community models cannot be directly translated to a national setting. For example, the income level and access to healthcare differs considerably within a country, especially in SA. Our use of community-specific individual based simulation models can be considered a ma- jor strength of this analysis. Use of such dynamic systems for cost-effectiveness analyses in infectious diseases interventions is nowadays considered as the preferred approach [62]. Furthermore, experience with previously developed community-based models has demon- strated that community characteristics, such as household size, co-morbidities and population age structure, strongly influence influenza spread and the effectiveness of potential influenza mitigation measures [63]. This illustrates that prevalence of co-morbidities that increase the risk of severe influenza-related complications, such as HIV for the Agincourt region, should ideally be evaluated in the context of a specific community model that represents the target country or target population within a country. A further strength of our analysis was the pre- dominant use of data on clinical event probabilities and resulting costs based on country or region specific data sources. For future research we encourage cost-effectiveness studies to include other groups at higher risk of influenza illness and its complications recommended by WHO such as children and pregnant women. For instance, children are generally known as key transmitters of influenza and targeting them could be indirectly effective in protecting vulnerable populations, the elderly and people with medical conditions, against influenza disease [64]. Vaccination of pregnant women has been urged as a priority by the WHO [65] and performing cost-effec- tiveness studies for these target-groups might inform decision makers which target-groups should be prioritized when distributing vaccines over the population. 5. Conclusion Our study showed that the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with TIV and QIV varies by country and is dependent on influenza epidemiology, vaccine price, willingness-to-pay thresholds and budgetary impact. Given our assumptions on WTP-threshold and vaccine price, we found that vaccinating the most vulnerable populations, being HIV-infected before elderly and young children, with TIV was cost-effective in communities in Vietnam and Aus- tralia during the period 2003-2013. In the South African community, however, the cost-ef- fectiveness of TIV was dependent on the assumed attack rate. QIV was cost-effective in all 182 Chapter 8three communities when a high attack rate was assumed. We note that our cost-effectiveness estimates do not automatically apply to different settings/target groups with different vacci - nation coverages. Also, our study is based on historic data, which does not necessarily reflect future influenza circulation. Obviously, our interpretation should be considered next to the general context for influenza vaccination in which the notion always exists that worldwide coverage of vaccination is thought to increase irrespective of the specific vaccine applied, i.e. be it QIV or TIV .

When the additional budget required for QIV would be invested in a higher uptake of TIV , the vaccination coverage would increase from an assumed 15% for TIV/QIV to 19.2% in Agincourt (South Africa) 19.0% in Thai Nguyen (Vietnam) and 17.8% in Albany (Australia, repectively) for 'more TIV' . The target-population consists of HIV-infected individuals, before elderly aged 65+ years, and the remaining vaccines to children aged <5 years. The symptomat- ic attack rate was assumed at 10% in an unvaccinated population. Simulations with the community models indicate that such use of an additional number of TIV doses results in a similar number of symptomatic influenza cases prevented in Agin- court (South Africa) and a higher number of symptomatic influenza cases prevented in Thai Nguyen (Vietnam) and Albany (Australia). The reduction in disease burden (measured in quality adjusted life years [QALYs]) was somewhat higher with QIV in Agincourt (South Africa), similar in Thai Nguyen (Vietnam) and lower in Albany (Australia) as compared with 'more TIV' . The higher impact of 'more TIV' on the number of cases as compared to the im- pact on the QALY loss is explained by the fact that those at highest risk of complications are prioritized for vaccination.189 Additional calculations on cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in South Africa, Vietnam and Australia Figure 1: Reduction in (A) symptomatic influenza cases and (B) QALYs loss under 3 different scenarios in Agincourt (South Africa), Thai Nguyen (Vietnam), and Albany (Australia).

Methods: An age-structured dynamic transmission model was used that was calibrated to influenza-associated GP visits over four seasons (2010/11 to 2013/14). The clinical and eco- nomic impact of different paediatric influenza vaccination strategies were compared over 20 years, varying the targeted age range, the vaccine type for children and the vaccine type for elderly and clinical risk groups. Outcome measures include averted symptomatic infec - tions and deaths, societal costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-ef- fectiveness ratios, and net health benefits (NHBs), using a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained. Results: At an assumed coverage of 50%, adding vaccination of 2- to 17-year-olds with quad- rivalent-live-attenuated influenza vaccine (Q-LAIV) to the current influenza vaccination pro- gramme was estimated to avert on average 406,270 symptomatic cases and 83 deaths per sea- son compared to vaccination of older adults and risk groups with trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV), and was paediatric vaccination strategies targeting 2- to 6-year-olds or 2- to 12-year-olds, or paediatric vaccination strategies with TIV . The highest NHB was obtained when 2- to 17-year-olds were vaccinated with Q-LAIV and existing tar - get groups switched from quadrivalent that paediatric influenza vaccination reduces the disease burden of influenza substantially and is cost-saving. 193 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlands1. Introduction Seasonal influenza epidemics are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality world- wide, resulting in a substantial clinical and economic burden [1, 2]. Although the most severe outcomes of influenza occur among older adults and persons with chronic medical condi- tions, increasing evidence shows that the burden of seasonal influenza among children is also substantial [3]. Young children are frequently hospitalized or require an outpatient visit for influenza, or stay at home from school in much greater numbers, causing substantial work loss among caregivers [4, 5]. Furthermore, children are thought to play a key role in the trans- mission of influenza because they remain infectious for a longer period than adults and have many close contacts [6]. Ecological studies [7, 8] as well as mathematical modelling studies [9-12] suggest that paediatric influenza vaccination would provide not only direct protection but also indirect protection to susceptible contacts due to herd immunity . Anticipating these direct and indirect benefits, several countries have issued positive rec- ommendations for vaccination of children against influenza [13]. For instance, the United Kingdom is currently rolling out a publicly funded influenza vaccination programme for chil - dren aged 2-16 years using the intranasally administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) [14]. In the Netherlands, influenza vaccination is offered free of charge to all individ - uals aged 60 years and individuals aged <60 years with certain chronic medical conditions [15]. Until the 2018/19 season, influenza vaccination occurred with a trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV), but TIV has been replaced by a quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV) for the 2019/20 season [16]. Extending the influenza vaccination programme to healthy children was not recommended by the Health Council of the Netherlands, as the risk of severe com- plications and mortality among children was not considered high enough [17]. However, this advice dates from 2007, and in the meantime the discussion about the implementation of paediatric influenza vaccination in the national immunization programme continued. A reassessment of the decision on paediatric influenza vaccination by the Health Council of the Netherlands is scheduled for 2020 [18]. Cost-effectiveness is an important consideration in the decision framework for the implemen - tation of vaccination programmes in most countries including the Netherlands [19]. Against this perspective, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of inclusion of paediatric in- fluenza vaccination in the current vaccination programme for older adults and clinical risk groups in the Netherlands. As paediatric influenza vaccination is expected to confer indirect effects upon the wider community, a dynamic transmission model was used that accounts for herd immunity. Various vaccination strategies for children were explored with regard to the targeted age group, vaccine type (TIV or Q-LAIV), and vaccination coverage. The vaccine type used for existing target groups was also varied (TIV or QIV).194 Chapter 92. Methods 2.1. Overview The analysis uses a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) approach, taking into account the uncertainty in the transmission, clinical, and economic parameters. A deterministic trans- mission model was used to simulate the population-level dynamics of influenza infection (Section 2.2). To incorporate uncertainty in the transmission parameters, a set of key trans- mission parameters was repeatedly sampled from input distributions. Those sets that fitted the observed information from the Netherlands were retained and are collectively referred to as the 'calibrated model' (section 2.3). The updated sets of parameter distributions were then integrated with the transmission model to produce a PSA of the transmission parameter inputs. The results of the transmission model served as an input for the economic PSA in which the clinical and economic parameters were sampled and outcomes were compared for a range of vaccination policies (section 2.4). 2.2. Dynamic transmission model The dynamic transmission model is a compartmental model, stratified by age in months. The model uses a SEIRFRLS(V) structure. For a given influenza strain, individuals begin as susceptible (S), move to the exposed (E) state upon infection, then move to the infectious (I) state, and finally move to the first recovered (RF) state, with immunity that gradually wanes until the individual becomes susceptible (S) again. A proportion of patients develop long- term immunity (RL), for which the duration of protection is much longer than the first recov- ered state; on a population level, this compartment was included to account for low levels of persistent immunity. Alternatively, susceptible individuals may transfer to a vaccinated (V) state, in which immunity also wanes until they become susceptible again. Vaccination was assumed to provide immediate complete protection and to have no effect on individuals in the exposed, infectious, or recovered state. Ageing was simulated on a monthly basis, informed by Dutch data on age structure [20], birth rates, and mortality rates [21, 22]. To emulate the observed influenza dynamics, the model population was seeded annually with new infectious influenza cases. Contact rates between age groups were obtained from an age-stratified mixing matrix from the section of the POLYMOD study specific for the Netherlands [23]. The magnitude of these age-specific contact rates and the probability of transmission per contact yielded an age-stratified matrix of transmission coefficients. As the incidence of influenza follows a marked seasonal pattern, the magnitude of these transmission coefficients was assumed to vary sinusoidally over time, peaking near the end of the calendar year. 195 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the NetherlandsInfluenza A and influenza B were simulated independently. Within an influenza type, two strains were assumed to be modelled: a strain from each of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes for influenza A, and a strain from each of the Victoria and Yamagata lineages for influenza B. Both strains were modelled simultaneously, so the model compartmental structure com- bined the SEIRFRLS(V) structure of each. No cross-protective immunity between strains was assumed. The pre-existing immunity structure (proportion of the population immune, by age and virus) at the model start was estimated by running the model forward, then obtaining the compartmental populations from a year in which the model incidence approximated the observed incidence of the first season of the calibration period [24]. The vaccination campaign was assumed to start in mid-October (day 288) and last between 30 and 40 days. During the calibration period, the model simulated vaccination using trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) with the vaccine composition as recommended by the WHO [25]. Influenza vaccine uptake was obtained from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) reports for 2010/2011 to 2013/14 [26]. Efficacy against labora - tory-confirmed influenza applied by age [27, 28]. No cross-protection of TIV against the non-included influenza B lineage was assumed. The duration of vaccine-induced protection was assumed to be much shorter, on average, than that of naturally acquired immunity. More details on the structure of the dynamic transmission model, structural assumptions, and other input parameters are provided in the Supplementary Methods. 2.3. Calibration In the calibration stage, the transmission model was run for the 2010/11 through 2013/14 sea- sons for each set of input parameter samples. The main data source for the model calibration was a set of Netherlands-specific general practitioner (GP) consultation rates obtained from a regression of influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultation data against laboratory-confirmed in- fluenza reports [24]. Influenza-associated GP consultation rates were stratified by influenza strain, age group (0-4, 5-19, 20-59, and 60 years), and season (2010/11-2013/14). The cur - rent study used the subtype/lineage-specific consultation rates from the regression analysis in which the unspecified influenza-positive samples were not redistributed to influenza subtype/ lineage. Prior to each simulation in the model calibration stage, the transmission parameters were sampled. The resulting simulated influenza GP consultation of each simulation was compared with observed data from the same period using the Poisson deviance and a set of other fit criteria (Supplementary File 1). Sets of parameter samples that met the criteria were retained for the calibrated model (see Table 1 and Supplementary File 1).196 Chapter 9Table 1: Key transmission model inputs Input Stratified byDistribution Min Max R0 parameters Transmission coefficient Virus Uniform 2.76E-08 8.29E-08 Latent period (days) Virus Uniform 0.01 3 Infectious period (days) Virus Uniform 0.5 5 Immunity parameters Duration of initial naturally acquired immunity (years)Virus Uniform 0.5 Influenza A: 10 Influenza B: 30 Duration of long-term naturally ac - quired immunity (years)Virus Uniform 10 70 Probability of acquiring long-term immunityVirus Uniform 0 1 Duration of vaccine-induced immunity (years)Virus Uniform 0.5 3 Vaccination parameters Vaccine Vaccination campaign duration Uniform (integer) 30 40 Probabilities Probability of symptoms given in - fectionBeta: Mean = 0.669, SE = 0.04130 1 R0: Basic reproduction number, SE: Standard error 2.4. Expected net benefit analysis The calibrated model was then used to compare the clinical and economic impact of a range of vaccination strategies. For each set of parameter samples of the calibration, the model was run forward from 2010/11 to 2034/35. Explored vaccination strategies diverged from the 2015/16 season, and results from the period 2015/16 to 2034/35 were used for the analysis (time horizon of 20 seasons). The initial output of the model integration concerned incidence of infection. Risk functions of clinical outcomes were applied to the outcomes of the trans- mission model in order to estimate the number of symptomatic cases, GP visits, hospitaliza - tions, and deaths. Estimates of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost were then applied to the clinical outcomes. In accordance with the Dutch guidelines [29], costs were discounted at 4% per year and QALYs at 1.5% per year from the start of the 2015/16 season. 197 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlands2.4.1. Vaccination strategies Explored vaccination strategies are listed in Table 2. For the existing vaccination programme for older adults and persons with chronic medical conditions, vaccination with TIV or QIV were considered (the latter including an additional influenza B virus lineage compared with TIV). To quantify the impact of the vaccination programme for current target groups, a strat- egy of no influenza vaccination at all was also added. Table 2: Explored vaccination strategies. Scenario name Description No vaccination No influenza vaccination in any age TIV TIV in individuals 6 months of age and older QIV QIV in individuals 6 months of age and older TIV/TIV Paediatric programmea with TIV; QIV in inactivated influenza vaccine. a Paediatric programmes were explored for the age groups 2-6, 2-12 or 2-17 years. The main analysis assumes a vaccination coverage in healthy children of 50%. For the additional paediatric vaccination strategies, vaccination with TIV and the intranasally administered quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (Q-LAIV) were considered. As post-licensure studies comparing the effectiveness of LAIV with inactivated vaccine (IV) found equivocal results [30-32], the efficacy of LAIV was assumed to be equal to that of IV . As a consequence, the effectiveness of childhood vaccination programmes with Q-LAIV also represent results of childhood vaccination programmes with QIV . In the sensitivity analysis, a higher efficacy of LAIV was explored in accordance with a meta-analysis of clinical trial data [33]. Paediatric vaccination strategies were considered for the age groups 2-6 years, 2-12 years, and 2-17 years. The vaccination programme consists of annual vaccinations and was as- sumed to be introduced for the whole age range at the same time. Children were assumed to receive only one dose irrespective of whether influenza vaccine had been received before or not. The vaccination coverage of the paediatric programme was assumed to be 50%, in accordance with emerging UK data on uptake during a paediatric vaccination programme [34]. In age groups outside the paediatric vaccination programme, the vaccine uptake was un- changed; the latest data (2013/14 season) were carried forward in each year of the simulation.198 Chapter 92.4.2. Clinical outcome risk functions The probability of symptoms, given influenza infection, was obtained from the literature [35]. The age-specific probability of a GP consultation, given infection, was calculated as part of the calibration using the GP consultation rates and the modelled incidence of infec- tion, in order to calculate the deviance of the run compared with the GP rate data [24]. The age-specific probability of hospitalization, given infection, was determined by the multiplica - tion of Dutch estimates of the relationship between respiratory-associated hospitalization and ILI incidence at the GP and the probability of a GP visit given infection [36]. The age-specific probability of death, given infection, was obtained by dividing the Dutch average incidence of respiratory-associated influenza death with the modelled incidence of influenza infection [37]. More details are provided in Supplementary File 1. 2.4.3. Economic outcomes The economic analysis was conducted from a societal perspective. All costs were converted to 2017 euros using the Dutch consumer price index [38]. We distinguished healthcare costs (vaccination costs, GP visits including prescribed medication and specialist visits, hospi- talizations, indirect healthcare costs), patient costs (over-the-counter medication and travel costs), and productivity losses (from patients or caregivers of sick children). The tendered vaccine price of TIV in the Netherlands was \u20ac3.59 in the 2017/18 season (latest available at time of calculations) [39]. The vaccine price of QIV was assumed to be 50% higher than that of TIV , given that the Dutch list price of QIV is also 50% higher than that of TIV [40]. The vaccine price of Q-LAIV was assumed to be equal to that of QIV (similar to the as- sumption on equal vaccine efficacy of QIV and Q-LAIV , so economic results of vaccination with Q-LAIV represent also results for vaccination with QIV), and the price of Q-LAIV was varied in the sensitivity analysis. For administration costs, the Dutch influenza tariff of \u20ac11.36 from 2017 was used, covering the costs of patient selection and invitation, vaccine administration by a GP, record keeping, vaccine storage, and waste destruction [41]. Influ- enza-associated costs by age and clinical outcome were obtained from published sources or national datasets and more details are given in Supplementary File 1. As recommended by the most recent Dutch guideline for economic evaluations in healthcare [29], indirect healthcare costs (i.e., healthcare costs unrelated to influenza in gained life years) were included, which were estimated using a pre-specified tool [42]. Productivity losses from influenza-associated deaths were valued using the friction method [43], which assumes that the number of work- days lost due to long-term absence is limited to a friction period of 85 days [29]. QALY loss per influenza episode was based on published studies that used the validated Eu- roQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument to measure loss of quality of life in patients with a lower-respiratory infection [44]. QALY losses differed by clinical outcome but were assumed 199 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlandsto be equal across age. Life years lost due to premature death were calculated using the life expectancies at age of death from the general Dutch population and were subsequently con- verted to QALYs lost using Dutch population norms for health-related quality of life [45]. To account for the increasing life expectancy over the prospective time horizon of 20 seasons, life expectancy predictions from Statistics Netherlands of the year 2024 (halfway through the analysed time horizon) were used [46]. More details are presented in Supplementary File 1. 2.4.4. Cost-effectiveness The base-case estimate per vaccination scenario was obtained by averaging the clinical and economic results across simulations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was then calculated by dividing the difference in costs by the difference in QALYs. Results are also presented in the form of net health benefit (NHB), converting monetary outcomes into QALYs using a willingness-to-pay threshold (in \u20ac per QALY). The NHB is calculated as QALY - (Costs/), and a positive NHB indicates that the intervention is cost-effective. We used a of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained, which is the lowest Dutch threshold published, and is often applied for prevention programmes such as influenza vaccination [47]. Cost-ef- fectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) are drawn to present the number of cost-effective simulations over a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. As the policy with the highest NHB may not always be the optimal decision (for instance, a policy with the highest NHB could be subject to extended dominance, example provided in Barton et al.[48]), the probability of optimum policy was shown in a cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF). 2.4.5. Univariate sensitivity analysis Several univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to test for structural uncertainty, in- cluding variation of the vaccination coverage, efficacy of Q-LAIV , vaccine price, included cost-components, QALY loss associated with illness or premature death, and discount rates. 3. Results 3.1. Calibration During the calibration stage, 7,198 simulations were selected as a close enough fit to the Dutch data. The resulting updated distributions are plotted in the Supplementary Results (Supplemen - tary File 2: Figure S2.1-Figure S2.7 and Table S2.1-Table S2.3), as are visual comparisons of the model incidence to the GP regression data (Supplementary File 2: Figure S2.8-Figure S2.11). Sampling from uniform input distributions, and keeping the samples that met the cal - ibration criteria, produced clearly defined unimodal distributions for the basic reproduction number; these distributions were clearly updated from their initial inputs by the acceptance-re - jection sampling according to the calibration heuristic (Supplementary File 2: Figure S2.2). 200 Chapter 93.2. Clinical impact Table 3 shows the expected 20-year average seasonal number of clinical events in the Neth- erlands for various vaccination scenarios (outcomes of all explored strategies are available in Supplementary File 2: Table S2.4). The average outcomes across 7,198 simulations are pre- sented, along with ranges in which 95% of the simulations fell. The average annual number of clinical events for older adults and clinical risk groups vaccinated with TIV was 954,353 (95% (700-2,961) hospitalizations and 274 (76-1,152) deaths. This represents a reduction of on average 202,931 (95% range: (467-2,331) hospitalizations and 249 (101-582) deaths per season compared with no influenza vaccination at all. Introducing annual paediatric influenza vaccination at an assumed coverage of 50% is ex- pected to avert a substantial additional number of clinical events, and its impact increases by targeting a broader age group or by using Q-LAIV instead of TIV or both. Adding TIV for 2- to 17-year-olds was estimated to prevent on average 263,302 (95% range: 108,775-598,074) symptomatic cases, 41,585 (15,539-84,524) GP visits, 420 (118-937) hospitalizations, and 34 (-17-116) deaths per season compared with the vaccination programme for older adults and clinical risk groups with TIV . Adding Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds was estimated to prevent on average 406,270 (95% range: 225,122-775,282) symptomatic cases, 53,597 (24,625-100,130) GP visits, 583 (252-1,156) hospitalizations, and 83 (30-180) deaths per season compared with the vaccination programme for older adults and clinical risk groups with TIV . Herd immunity amongst other age groups contributed substantially to this reduc- tion. A proportion of 50% of all prevented symptomatic cases and 99% of all prevented deaths following the introduction of Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds were in other age-groups than children aged 2-17 years (see Supplementary File 2: Figure S2.12 for age-stratified results). Adding Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds was also estimated to prevent more deaths than a switch from TIV to QIV for older adults and clinical risk groups. The lowest number of clinical events was estimated for the use of QIV for older adults and clinical risk groups in combination with Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds. Annual paediatric influenza vaccination induced an age-shift of influenza cases to older age groups. For instance, introducing vaccination for 2- to 6-year-olds increased the number of symptomatic cases among children aged 10-17 years (Supplementary File 2: Figure S2.12). However, this increase in cases was compensated by a much higher number of prevented influenza cases in all other age groups. 201 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the NetherlandsTable 3: 20-year average seasonal number of clinical outcomes in the Netherlands.

Cost-effectiveness Table 4 summarizes, for each vaccination strategy, the expected 20-year cumulative total costs and total influenza-associated QALY loss. Averages over 7,198 simulations are pre- sented, and strategies are ranked in descending order of QALYs lost. Compared with no vaccination, TIV for older adults and clinical risk groups is estimated to be leading to a gain of 35,627 QALYs and an increase of \u20ac63 million in costs, resulting in an ICER of \u20ac1,776/ QALY gained. Thus, this programme is highly cost-effective against the conventional Dutch threshold of \u20ac20,000/QALY gained. A switch from TIV to QIV for the current target groups gave an estimated further gain of QALYs and saving of costs\u2014i.e., QIV dominated TIV . All paediatric vaccination scenarios were expected to dominate the current strategy of vac- cination of older adults and clinical risk groups with TIV , and each extension of the targeted paediatric age group and/or a switch from TIV to Q-LAIV dominated the preceding scenario. For instance, for vaccination of 2- to 17-year-olds with TIV , the 20-year cumulative savings (NHB: 76,665 QALYs) and QALYs and \u20ac1,680 million (NHB: 120,411 QALYs) compared with the vaccination programme for older adults and clinical risk groups with TIV . Most paediatric vaccination strategies dominated a switch from TIV to QIV for older adults and clinical risk groups. Considering all strategies explored, QIV for older adults and clinical risk groups in combination with Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds dominated all other scenarios. For this strategy, the 20-year cumulative additional savings were estimat - ed at 43,977 QALYs and \u20ac1,779 million (NHB: 132,907 QALYs) compared with the current vaccination programme for older adults and clinical risk groups with TIV . 203 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the NetherlandsTable 4: 20-year cumulative economic outcomes.

The 95% ranges of were 69,473 QALYs and \u20ac693 million-\u20ac3,736 million compared with TIV for older adults and clinical risk groups, resulting in a 95% range of the NHB of 54,032-256,268. All simulations for this strategy resulted in a total QALY gain and lower total costs. For adding TIV for 2- to 6-year-olds, however, the current analysis found that 2.3% of the simulations resulted in an overall QALY loss. This proportion decreased to 0.2% for adding TIV for 2-to 12-year-olds and to 0.1% for adding TIV for 2- to 17-year-olds (Supplementary File 2: Table S2.7). 204 Chapter 9 Figure 1A: Results of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (7,198 simulations) of a selection of influ - enza vaccination strategies in the Netherlands over 20 seasons.

Univariate sensitivity analysis Figure 2 shows the results of a univariate sensitivity analysis of extending the vaccination programme for the strategy using TIV for older adults and clinical risk groups with Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds. Varying the vaccination coverage of the paediatric programme be- tween 20% and 80% indicated a non-linear relationship between the coverage and the NHB, with increasing coverage resulting in relatively lower returns. Nevertheless, paediatric vac- cination strategies at 80% coverage dominated strategies at 20% or 50% coverage (Supple- mentary File 2: Table S2.5-Table S2.6). Applying a higher efficacy of Q-LAIV in accordance with a meta-analysis of clinical trial data [27] led to a substantially higher clinical impact and NHB. For targeting 2- to 17-year- olds, the symptomatic infection rate dropped by a further 29.2% and the death rate by 19.5% compared with the main analysis (Supplementary File 2: Table S2.4) and the NHB increased by 43% to 175,263 QALYs (Supplementary File 2: Table S2.8). As the majority of QALYs gained were due to prevention of influenza illness (improvement of quality of life) rather than prevention of influenza deaths (increased life expectancy) (Sup- plementary File 2: Figure S2.13A), applying a higher QALY loss for influenza illness had a higher impact on the NHB than the assumption of a reduced life expectancy for influenza-as- sociated deaths. The cost-effectiveness of the vaccination programme was not particularly sensitive to the vaccine price. At 50% coverage, the additional discounted vaccination costs of Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds would be \u20ac402 million over 20 seasons (Supplementary File 2: Table S2.8). This strategy was still expected to dominate vaccination of older adults and clinical risk groups with TIV as well as the strategy of adding TIV for 2- to 17-year-olds even if the vaccine price of Q-LAIV would increase more than threefold. The productivity losses of influenza represented the majority of the cost burden of influenza (Supplementary File 2: Figure S2.13B). When the analysis was performed from a healthcare payer's perspective (excluding patient costs and productivity losses), the ICER of Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds was estimated at \u20ac13,132/QALY gained (Supplementary File 2: Table S2.8) compared to TIV for older adults and clinical risk groups, and the NHB was 13,491 QALYs. The NHB would be 152,302 QALYs, when costs and effects were not discounted. Exclusion of indirect healthcare costs or application of the human capital approach for the valuation of productiv - ity losses of premature deaths had limited impact on the NHB. 207 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlands Figure 2: Scenario analysis of paediatric influenza vaccination of 2- to 17-year -olds with quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine, while other target groups were vaccinated with trivalent inactivated vaccine.

Effects among children Table 5 shows the economic results when only costs and effects for the children aged 2-17 years themselves are considered. The current strategy of TIV for clinical groups was expected to be cost-saving compared with no vaccination at all. Adding Q-LAIV for 2- to 12-year-olds at 50% coverage was found to dominate the current strategy of TIV for clinical risk groups (20-year cumulative savings of \u20ac20 million and 12,138 QALYs; NHB 13,137 QALYs), and also dominated the other paediatric strategies considered, which all resulted in lower QALY gains. The ICER of Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds compared to Q-LAIV for 2- to 12-year- olds was estimated at \u20ac30,470 per QALY gained.208 Chapter 9Table 5: 20-year cumulative economic outcomes when only the impact in children aged 2-17 years are considered.

Discussion 4.1. General statement and explanation of main findings A dynamic transmission model calibrated with Dutch influenza epidemiology data was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlands. Vac- cination of children was estimated to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality substantially on the population level. From a societal perspective, paediatric influenza vaccination was estimated to be cost-saving compared with the current policy of vaccinating older adults and clinical risk groups. The NHB increased when a broader paediatric age range was targeted or when Q-LAIV was used instead of TIV . The highest NHB compared with vaccination of old- er adults and clinical risk groups was obtained with vaccination of children aged 2-17 years with Q-LAIV , and vaccination of older adults and clinical risk groups with QIV . Indirect protection made a pronounced contribution to the cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination, given that half of the prevented symptomatic cases and nearly all pre- vented deaths were among adults. This reduction in mortality occurred despite the already high current vaccination coverages among older adults. Furthermore, this modelling study indicates that paediatric vaccination strategies with Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds are more effective in preventing mortality among older adults than switching from TIV to QIV in the vaccination of older adults. Recently, the Dutch government decided to switch from TIV to QIV for the current target groups in the 2019/20 season [16], but adding paediatric influenza 209 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlandsvaccination prevents also a substantial burden among older adults and is cost-saving when older adults and clinical risk groups are vaccinated with QIV . Paediatric influenza vaccina - tion was also cost-saving compared with vaccination of clinical risk groups when only costs and effects among children themselves are considered. There was a non-linear relationship between coverage and effects of vaccination. This is explained by the concept that once a critical uptake rate has been achieved, further increase yields diminishing returns [49]. Nonetheless, our analysis indicated that the economic returns of paediatric vaccination were such that the NHB kept increasing with increasing coverage. Paediatric influenza vaccination is also likely to induce an age-shift of influenza infections to older age groups. This age-shift occurs because there is a reduction in the force of infection, leading to a lowering in the probability of becoming infected. It therefore takes longer to be- come infected, so infection occurs at an older age, on average. However, this age-shift did not outweigh the benefits of paediatric influenza vaccination as a whole, and could also be con- sidered as a good thing, as there is a lowering of the likelihood of infection in the very young. 4.2. Strengths and limitations As recommended by international guidelines [50, 51], a dynamic transmission model was used that accounts for indirect effects of vaccination. The transmission model was calibrated using Dutch influenza epidemiology data for four seasons in order to obtain realistic parame - ter sets, and Dutch data on contact patterns, outcome probabilities, and economic parameters were used. The long-term effects of paediatric influenza vaccination on the dynamics of infection and immunity were captured and the analysis accounted for the longer duration of protection acquired through natural infection compared with vaccination. New in the trans- mission model is the compartment for the acquisition of long-term immunity through nat- ural infection that allowed for protection over decades. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that influenza infections may well have lifelong effects on immunity patterns [52]. The inclusion of this compartment results in less build-up of long-term immunity in the population as paediatric influenza vaccination reduces circulation of the influenza virus and replaces long-term natural immunity with short-term vaccine-induced immunity. However, the probability of acquiring long-term immunity and its duration had no strong influence on the model fit (Supplementary File 2: Figure S2.3). The waning rate of immunity and vaccine efficacy was assumed to remain constant over time; however, these parameters may vary between seasons due to irregular antigenic drift and vaccine match. A recently published modelling study that accounted for seasonal vari- ation found a lower population-level impact of paediatric influenza vaccination compared 210 Chapter 9with studies that did not account for such variation [53]. Furthermore, this recently published modelling study estimated that paediatric influenza vaccination could lead to an increased variability in the scale of the epidemic; that is, seasons with small epidemics are occasionally alternated with seasons with very large epidemics due to a build-up of susceptibles [53, 54]. Increased variability in epidemic size could potentially lead to simulations in which the loss of QALYs in seasons with large epidemics offsets the gain of QALYs in seasons with small epidemics [55]. The current analysis found no simulations that resulted in an overall QALY loss for adding Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds, but there was a small risk of an overall QALY loss for paediatric strategies with TIV . The vaccine efficacy of LAIV and IV was assumed to be equal. However, there is ongoing debate about the vaccine effectiveness of LAIV . Clinical trials found that the efficacy of LAIV was superior to that of IVs [27], whereas effectiveness studies found the effectiveness of LAIV to be superior, similar, or inferior to IV [30-32]. For the 2017/18 season, Q-LAIV received a negative recommendation from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices after a lack of effectiveness of the vaccine in the 2013/14 and 2015/16 seasons, particularly against subtype A/H1N1 [56, 57]. Although this recommendation has been with- drawn for the 2018/19 season following the replacement of the A/H1N1 strain [58], the vac- cine effectiveness of the modified Q-LAIV has not yet been assessed. Studies in England and Finland found significant effectiveness of Q-LAIV in the 2015/16 season and these countries continue its use in their national immunization programmes [59]. Our sensitivity analysis in- dicated that the use of a higher vaccine efficacy of Q-LAIV resulted in a substantially higher NHB. No difference in duration of protection between LAIV and IV was assumed. Some evidence suggests that IVs already wane through the season [60, 61], while LAIV could also protect in a second season [62]. However, applying a longer duration of protection of LAIV is not expected to have significant impact on our outcomes, because the analysis assumes LAIV to be given on an annual basis. No cross-reactivity between influenza subtypes was considered in this analysis, while in re- ality such mechanisms could exist. For instance, the cross-protection of TIV against the mis- matched influenza B lineage has been estimated at 70% of the efficacy against the matched influenza B lineage [27, 63]. If true, our study may underestimate the effectiveness of TIV and overestimate the additional effectiveness of Q-LAIV over TIV . Influenza-associated mortality rates that were regressed against respiratory diagnoses were used, while an ecological study from the Netherlands that used all-cause mortality data found substantially higher influenza-associated mortality rates [64]. However, the use of all-cause mortality data could also result in an overestimation of the number of influen- 211 Cost-effectiveness of paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlandsza-associated deaths, and the use of respiratory diagnoses reflects a conservative approach. Furthermore, assumptions had to be made for the vaccine prices of Q-LAIV and QIV , as ten- dered prices for the Dutch setting are unavailable. However, our sensitivity analyses demon- strate that paediatric influenza vaccination is expected to be cost-effective even at substan- tially higher vaccine prices. This finding also indicates that some other cost components not included in our analysis (such as implementation costs or costs related to the side effects of vaccination) are not expected to significantly affect the conclusions of this analysis. 4.3. Comparison with the literature A recent study by Backer et al.[53] assessed the potential clinical impact of paediatric influ- enza vaccination in the Netherlands using a dynamic transmission model. These authors esti- mated that vaccination of 2- to 16-year-olds with Q-LAIV at a coverage of 40% would reduce the overall infection attack rate by 15%. As this study assumed the efficacy of Q-LAIV to be equal to that of TIV , their findings were compared with adding TIV for 2- to 17-year-olds strategy at 50% coverage, for which we estimated a reduction of the symptomatic attack rate by 28%. Next to differences in vaccine coverage and age-range targeted, the higher reduction in infection attack rate in the current study may be explained by differences in the model structure and the use of an on average somewhat higher vaccine efficacy and longer duration of vaccine protection as compared with those used by Backer et al. Our finding that paediatric vaccination is expected to be cost-effective from a healthcare payer's perspective and cost-saving from a societal perspective is in line with published studies from surrounding European countries [65-67]. 4.4. Implications Results of this study are relevant for policy-makers deciding whether to introduce paediatric influenza vaccination in the national immunization programme of Netherlands or elsewhere, even though cost-effectiveness is not the only criterion involved in this decision [68]. For instance, acceptability of the vaccination programme is also important. Although paediatric vaccination was also cost-effective for children themselves, most of its benefits are among other age groups via indirect protection. A non-uniform distribution of advantages and disad- vantages of a vaccination programme may well be perfectly acceptable when adverse events of vaccination are mild and public health in general is substantially improved [19]. However, acceptance among the parents of the children is also important, as objections could harm not only the trust in the paediatric influenza vaccination programme, but also the trust in the national immunization programme as a whole. A recent Dutch survey showed that only 15% of parents would be inclined to vaccinate their children against seasonal influenza, and 212 Chapter 9the willingness to vaccinate against influenza was substantially lower compared with other currently unimplemented vaccines against rotavirus, varicella, and Meningococcus B [69]. It should be noted that the implementation of paediatric influenza vaccination could also af- fect the cost-effectiveness of the existing influenza vaccination strategy for older adults and clinical risk groups via herd immunity. A recent dynamic modelling study from the UK indi- cates that vaccination of the low-risk elderly group may cease to be cost-effective from the healthcare payer's perspective in the presence of paediatric influenza vaccination [70]. Finally, the impact of routine influenza vaccination in early childhood on the long-term de- velopment of immunity against influenza viruses is a matter of debate. Accumulating ev- idence suggests that the first influenza infections in life influence the quality and quantity of the immune response against subsequent infections (imprinting) [71, 72]. However, it is unknown whether vaccination interferes with or promotes immune imprinting [71]. LAIV is thought to be a more appropriate vaccine candidate than IV for children na\u00efve to influenza infections because it mimics a natural infection in the upper respiratory tract that activates mucosal antibodies and 5. Conclusions This modelling study indicates that paediatric influenza vaccination leads to a substantial reduction of influenza morbidity and mortality across all age groups and is cost-saving from a societal perspective. The highest NHB is observed for the vaccination of children aged 2-17 years with Q-LAIV , in combination with vaccination of older adults and clinical risk groups with QIV . It is anticipated that results of this study will be useful for policy-makers in decid - ing whether to introduce paediatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlands or elsewhere.

Systematic review on reporting of validation efforts of health economic decision models in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer de Boer PT, Frederix GW, Transparent reporting of validation efforts of health economic models give stakeholders better insight into the credibility of model outcomes. In this study we reviewed recently published studies on seasonal influenza and early breast cancer in order to gain in- sight into the reporting of model validation efforts in the overall health economic literature. Methods: A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Embase to retrieve health eco- nomic modelling studies published between 2008 and 2014. Reporting on model validation was evaluated by checking for the word validation, and by using AdViSHE (Assessment of the Validation Status of Health Economic decision models), a tool containing a structured list of relevant items for validation. Additionally, we contacted corresponding authors to ask whether more validation efforts were performed other than those reported in the manu- scripts. Results: A total of 53 studies on seasonal influenza and 41 studies on early breast cancer were included in our review. The word validation was used in 16 studies (30%) on seasonal influenza and 23 studies (56%) on early breast cancer; however, in a minority of studies, this referred to a model validation technique. Fifty-seven percent of seasonal influenza studies and 71% of early breast cancer studies reported one or more validation techniques. Cross-valida- tion of study outcomes was found most often. A limited number of studies reported on model validation efforts, although good examples were identified. Author comments indicated that more validation techniques were performed than those reported in the manuscripts. Conclusions: Although validation is deemed important by many researchers, this is not re- flected in the reporting habits of health economic modelling studies. Systematic reporting of validation efforts would be desirable to further enhance decision makers' confidence in health economic models and their outcomes.219 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer models1. Introduction Health economic decision analytic models play an important role in the economic evaluation of therapeutic interventions [1]. Since policy decisions are influenced by the results of such models, all stakeholders have a vested interest in a high validation status of these models. Transparent reporting of validation efforts and their outcomes will give the stakeholder better insight into the model's credibility (is the model scientifically sound?), salience (is the mod- el applicable within the context?) and legitimacy (are all stakeholder concerns, values and views included properly?) [2, 3]. Proper information regarding these aspects allows stake- holders to make their own judgement of the models' validation status. Several systematic reviews of health economic evaluations in different disease areas indicat - ed that little was reported on model validation [4-10]; however, most of these reviews were not focused on the general quality of modelling aspects and contained little details on model validation performances. Only one review, focusing on interventions on cardiovascular dis- eases, provided a clear overview on which part of the included studies reported on model validation tests distinguishing model validation techniques according to the International So- ciety for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society for Medical Decision Mak- ing (ISPOR-SMDM) guidelines [9]. However, modelling evaluation processes might vary between different disease areas, therefore more studies assessing model validation efforts are needed. In this study we aimed to systematically review the reporting of validation efforts of recent - ly published health economic decision models, explicitly distinguishing between different validation techniques. For this purpose, we chose two example diseases, namely seasonal influenza (SI) and early breast cancer (EBC). These two diseases are well-defined and by choosing both a communicable disease, which is often modelled using dynamic models [11], and a non-communicable disease, which is often modelled using static models, we expected to cover a wide range of model types [1]. This should provide a good overview of the current standard in the reporting of validation efforts in the health economic literature. Since validation is an integral part of the modelling process (see, for example, Fig. 2 in Sargent [12]), low reporting of validation efforts does not have to mean that they were not performed. For instance, impromptu checking of bits of computer code while coding may not always be reported. In order to gain insight into the discrepancy between the performance and reporting of validation efforts, we also reached out to the corresponding author of each of the included papers in this review for comments.220 Chapter 102. Methods 2.1. Search Strategy and Study Selection We searched the PubMed and Embase databases to identify studies focusing on the health economic evaluations of SI and EBC. The full search strings for both diseases can be found in Appendix 1 and contained free-text searching terms as well as exploded (Medical Sub- ject Heading [MeSH]) terms. For both disease areas, the health economic evaluations had to meet the following criteria: (1) published in peer reviewed journals from January 2008 to December 2014; (2) presented results of costs as well as health effects; and (3) used a computer simulation model to generate these results. We also screened reference lists of se- lected articles. Review papers, meta-analyses, letters and non-full-text such as abstracts were excluded, and we restricted our selection to the English language. For SI, studies focusing only on pandemic influenza were excluded, as well as studies analyzing interventions against multiple infectious diseases without showing separated results for SI. For EBC, we excluded studies on metastatic breast cancer, breast cancer screening and diagnostic systems to stage breast cancer. 2.2. Study Characteristics General characteristics of the studies extracted included year of publication, country, income level of the country according to the classification of the World Bank [13], funding source, type of intervention, type of evaluation and model type. For SI, studies that incorporated disease transmission dynamics (i.e. from carrier/infected to a susceptible individual), or used discrete event simulation were categorised as dynamic models. In all other cases, the model was categorised as static. 2.3. Reporting of Model Validation Efforts In this study, we defined validation as the act of evaluating whether a model is a proper and sufficient representation of the system it is intended to represent in view of an application, where 'proper' was defined as ''the model is in accordance with what is known about the system'' and 'sufficient' was defined as ''the results can serve as a solid basis for decision making'' [14]. We first searched the publication's text and appendices for the word validation and its conjugate forms (valid*, verif*). When present, we reported the context in which the word was used. Then, the reporting of model validation efforts were systematically as- sessed, using the outline presented in the validation-assessment tool AdViSHE (Assessment of the Validation Status of Health Economic decision models) [15]. This tool was designed to provide model users with structured information regarding the validation status of health economic decision models, and therefore enables systematic extraction of the reporting of 221 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer modelsmodel validation efforts. An added advantage of this tool is that it explicitly presents clear definitions of validation techniques since there is little, if any, consensus on terminology in the validation literature [16]. An abbreviated form of the AdViSHE tool is shown in Table 1 and includes five validation categories, i.e. validation of the conceptual model (A, the the- ories and assumptions underlying the model concepts, and the model's structure and causal relationships), input data (B, available input data and data transformations), computerised model (C, implemented software program, including code, mathematical calculations and implementation of the conceptual model), and operational model (D, behaviour of the model outcomes). Remaining validation techniques, such as, for instance, double programming, are assigned to category E. Assessment of studies on validation reporting was performed by two of the authors (PdB and PV for influenza, and PdB and GF for EBC) separately. After com- paring results, differences between the two authors were resolved in a consensus meeting. Examples of each validation technique found were collected and presented.

Comments from Authors The corresponding authors of the included studies were contacted by email in August 2015, followed by a reminder in November 2015. In this email, we explained the aim of our study, provided details of the corresponding author's paper that was included in our review, and enquired whether authors had performed validation efforts other than those reported in their manuscript. To provide help on validation techniques that could have been performed, we attached the AdViSHE tool to this email. Any answers from the authors were reported. 3. Results 3.1. Study Selection The searches resulted in 53 SI studies [17-70] and 41 EBC studies [71-111] that were eli - gible for inclusion in our review. More details on the study selection process are shown in Fig. 1a, b. Fig. 1: A) Seasonal influenza literature search, B) Early breast cancer literature search 3.2. Study Characteristics General characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 2. For both disease areas, most studies were performed in countries in North America, followed by countries in Europe and Asia. Studies were predominantly performed for high-income countries, although we also found studies for middle-income countries such as China, Taiwan and Argentina (SI), and China, Brazil, Colombia and Iran (EBC). We found no studies for low-income countries.223 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer modelsTable 2: General statistics of the studies included in the review Study characteristicSeasonal influenza Early breast cancer N % of total N % of total Total studies included 53 100% 41 100% Region Europe 8 15% 14 34% North America 34 64% 16 39% Asia 6 11% 7 17% South America Funding Public health sources 28 53% 17 41% Industry 15 28% 17 41% No external funding 2 4% 3 7% Not stated 7 13% 4 10% Type of intervention* Pharmaceutical related Vaccine 45 85% - - Drug 8 15% 37 90% Non pharmaceutical related Personal protection 1 2% - - Radiation - - 3 7% Surgical intervention - - 1 2% Type of evaluation Cost-benefit 6 11% 15% 0 0% Semi Markov 0 0% 2% 0 stated 2 4% 2 5% *Multiple interventions might be studied in one study224 Chapter 10All SI studies analyzed pharmaceutical interventions, i.e. influenza vaccines or antiviral drugs. One study additionally assessed non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies, including ventilation, face masks, hand washing and ultraviolet irradiation [21]. For EBC, antineo - plastic drugs were predominantly studied, although we also included four studies on radia - tion or surgery treatments [72, 84, 100, 111]. SI was analyzed using static models in 43 (81%) of the studies, mostly a decision tree model (36, 68%) or a state transition model with Markov properties ['Markov model'] (6, 11%). One study used a multicohort model, in which cohorts of different ages were simultaneously followed over their lifetimes [64]. A total of eight studies (15%) used a dynamic transmission model, with all compartmental models using an SIR structure [17, 21, 25, 28, 29, 50, 51, 54]. Such models divide the population between susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R), and include a (often age-stratified) mixing pattern between different groups. One study did not elaborate on model structure [57], and another study called the model 'spreadsheet based', with no further information on model type or structure [70]. Thirty-seven EBC 109-111], one study used a decision tree [96], and one study used a semi-Markov model [84]. Two studies did not pro- vide information on model type, but either defined the model as a 'decision analytic model' [108] or stated that 'the model took a state-transition approach' [103]. Within the study selection process, multiple studies had the same first author. For SI, one author conducted ten studies [32-42], two authors conducted three studies [49-51, 67-69] and three authors conducted two studies [23, 24, 55, 56, 60, 61], while for EBC, one author conducted three studies [93-95] and three authors conducted two studies [80, 81, 103, 104, 109, 110]. 3.3. Model Validation 3.3.1. Free-Text Search For SI, the word 'validation' or its conjugates was found in 16 studies (30%). The context in which 'validation' was used diverged widely. Three studies did not use validation in a model validation context [27, 52, 53]; two studies mentioned that the evidence level of some input data was low and not validated [47, 57]; one study stated that picking a starting date for the simulation between two influenza seasons would be useful ''to demonstrate model validity'', but did not specify how this was the case [48]; two studies used the word 'validation' in a context that might be linked to a validation technique, but did not provide information on which parts of the model were validated, by whom, or which techniques were used [44, 64]; and three studies stated that a previously validated model was used, without stating whether 225 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer modelsthe model would be valid for the new purpose [56, 60, 61]. Consulting the prior publica - tions these studies were based on did not provide further clarification on validation efforts performed. In seven studies (13%), the word 'validation' was used in such a way that we were able to link this directly to a validation technique [17, 20, 25, 30, 48, 62, 64]; these are discussed in the next paragraph. For EBC, 23 studies (56%) reported the word 'validation' or its conjugate forms, also in var - ious contexts. In four studies we found 'validation' was not related to validation techniques of the health economic model [73, 78, 101, 106]. A fifth study debated ''[t]he validity of the assumption of differences in effectiveness with letrozole and anastrozole'' [91], while a sixth study mentioned that ''[n]o relevant cost and/or utility data were identified against which the model's outputs could be validated'' [88]. In two studies by the same first author it was stated that that ''[t]he validity of the model is presented using cost effectiveness-acceptance curves'' [93, 95]. A total of 16 (39%) of the included EBC studies used the word 'validation' in a con- text linked to a model validation technique, which will be addressed below [71, 72, 74, 76, 77, 80, 82,84, 85, 87, 88, 92, 100, 104, 109, 110]. 3.3.2. Validation Techniques We identified 30 studies (57%) on SI that reported one or more validation techniques, and 28 (68%) EBC studies. Two or more validation techniques were found in five studies (9%) o SI and 15 studies (37%) on EBC. Figure 2 shows the model validation performance stratified by (sub)category. Five studies reported on validation of the conceptual model (category A). Four EBC studies reported on face validity of (part of) the conceptual model [74, 85, 88, 92] (A1). For example, Au et al. [74] reported that ''validation of [treatment] strategies were achieved by consensus of a Canadian panel of breast cancer oncologists'', including the identities of the concerned oncologists. Hall et al. [85] reported that ''[t]he structure of the model was developed by con- sensus between clinical experts, health economists and medical statisticians'', and reported the background as well as selection procedure. This study also performed cross-validation of the conceptual model (A2) by performing a systematic review to identify all previously pub- lished models of the same intervention and subsequently comparing the conceptual model. We also found cross-validation of the conceptual model in one other study on EBC [88] and one study on SI [47]. Reporting on validation of input data (category B) was found in nine studies. Face validity (B1) was described in two SI studies [20, 62]. For example, Tarride et al. [62] mentioned that ''144 Canadian physicians were surveyed to validate [complication rate] estimates for 226 Chapter 10children aged 2-5 years old''. Testing of the model fit (B2) was addressed in one study on SI [30] and six studies on EBC [77, 81, 92, 94, 98, 107]. Jit et al. [30] performed multiple linear regressions to estimate the proportion of hospitalisations that was caused by influenza and provided details on the goodness of fit (R2) of the model. They also indicated that different re- gression models to estimate the proportion of healthcare attendances related to influenza gave similar outcomes, which provided internal validation of this input into the health economic model. Purmonen et al. [98] used different parametric survival models (Weibull, exponential, log-logistic) to optimally fit the trace of the curves; however, how they decided on optimal fit was not reported. Validation of the computerised model (category C) was not found in any of the reviewed articles. A total of 56 studies reported on validation of the operational model (category D). Cross-val- idation of the results (D2) was the validation technique found most often in SI (57%) as well as EBC (51%). For example, Chit et al. [22] performed an extensive comparison of the number of influenza cases and various other clinical outcomes with data published in a model from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Next to cross-validation, validation of model outcomes to empirical data (D4) was often found, namely in 20 studies. Three studies on SI reported on independent validation (D4B) by validating the predicted incidence of a specified influenza-related clinical event against data from a national surveillance system or a national registration agency [17, 25, 48]. Seventeen EBC studies performed dependent val- idation (D4A) by comparing the results with data of the clinical trial the study was based on. Two different EBC studies performed validation against independent data sources, namely against the 'Adjuvant! Online' prediction tool [84, 100], an online tool used in the US to help oncologists estimate the risks of mortality and side effects, given different clinical and treat - ment scenarios [112]. Face validity testing of the results (D1) was not reported in either of the disease areas, and validation by using alternative input data (D3) was found in one study [47]. This study used all parameters of a similar study analyzing the same intervention in the same country to compare the results. Finally, two studies reported validation techniques that were not categorised in the AdViSHE tool (Category E) [64, 81]. Van Bellinghen et al. [64] performed double programming by programming one cohort in another software package, and Delea et al. [81] conducted an extensive comparison of the input data compared with the input data of other models, which might be regarded as cross-validation of the input data. 227 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer models Figure 2: Model validation performances of 53 studies on seasonal influenza as reported in publica - tions, using the classification of the AdViSHE tool.

Comments from Authors We reached out twice to the corresponding authors to ask whether, in practice, more vali - dation efforts were performed than those reported in the manuscript. We were able to reach 77/94 corresponding authors, and of these we received a total of ten responses. Three re- sponding authors informed us that they were not able to answer the enquiry due to various reasons, such as no access to project files anymore, study was conducted a long time ago, or current workload was too high. Comments from the remaining seven responding authors are shown below. A first author response of an SI study included that, additionally to what had been reported in the manuscript, the complete model was double programmed (category E) using a different software package, and results were compared. When modifications were completed, the af- fected modules were checked for face validity by another programmer (C1) and run against test data to ensure consistency (D3). A second author response of an SI study reported that face validity of the conceptual model (A1), input data (B1) and model outcomes (D1) were assessed internally and externally by two different panels of independent researchers. More- over, tests such as likelihood ratio testing, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian in-228 Chapter 10formation criterion (BIC) and goodness of fit (B2) were performed to select the optimum regression model to determine the attributable fraction of influenza within surveillance data of 'influenza-like illness'. The authors indicated that all input data have been varied outside their ranges to detect coding errors (C2), and mentioned that this was not reported in the manuscript since this was considered a natural part of model development. A third author response of a SI study indicated that face validity of the conceptual model (A1), input data (B1) and outcomes (D1) were tested within the team containing clinical experts of different fields. Moreover, the entire model was double programmed (E). Additionally, the authors in- dicated that validation of the computerised model (C) was not reported as this was considered standard procedure. Concerning EBC, a first author response mentioned that the majority of the validation tech - niques that are found on the AdViSHE tool were performed. The model was constructed to the standards of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on technical appraisal, which, according to the author, in turn implies a certain standard of vali - dation. A second author response indicated that not all validation performances were reported due to a very restrictive word limit of the journal and the audience of the journal being mainly clinical. However, the structure of the model was reviewed by clinical and health economic experts within and outside the team (A1). In addition, a quality control on input data (B1) and model programming (C1) was performed by health economists not involved in the original model design. Additionally, they attempted to perform cross-validity of the model outcomes (D2) but were unable to do so due to a lack of suitable comparison studies. A third author re- sponded that face validity of model structure (A1), input parameters (B1) and code checking (C1) were performed, and that links between different submodules were also tested (C4). A third author indicated that no other additional validation efforts than those described in the manuscript were performed. 4. Discussion In this study, we assessed the reporting of model validation efforts in the disease areas of SI and EBC within the period 2008 to 2014. Overall, reporting of model validation efforts was found to be limited. Reviewing the papers systematically using the AdViSHE tool, demon- strated that 57% of the studies on SI and 71% of the ECB models performed at least one validation technique; however, only 9% and 37% of studies on SI and EBC, respectively, performed two or more validation techniques. A limited number of author's responses to our enquiry on model validation efforts performed, indicated that, in practice, considerably more validation techniques might be used than those reported in the manuscripts, provided these few responders are representative of the majority who did not reply to our request for additional information.229 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer modelsThe most performed validation technique was cross-validation of the model outcomes. A first explanation for this might be that many general guidelines for writing scientific papers state that the discussion section should include a comparison of the study outcomes with the existing literature (e.g. Hall [113]). Moreover, Eddy et al. [114] specifically name cross-vali- dation as one of the five types of validation. Few reports were identified regarding validation of the conceptual model, and no reports regarding validation of the computerised model. As indicated in two author responses, validation techniques such as code checking and extreme value testing might be regarded as implicit in the model development process and were there - fore not reported [12]. This might also partly explain why face validity of the input data and results was not often reported. Moreover, the peer-review process before publication might be regarded by some authors as a way of testing face validity. Another reason why little is reported on validation of the conceptual model might be that many studies of SI used a ba- sic decision-tree model; however, even in case of such simple models, validation remains important. Conceptual model validation in that case might possibly be even more important since the choice of such a simple structure should be justified. A final explanation might be that the word count or the (clinical) audience of the journal might restrict authors on reporting of validation efforts. In addition to simply describing the conduct of validation, it may be useful for model users to report what was done with the outcomes of the validation techniques. For instance, did the authors make any changes to (parts of) the model when faced with the validation outcomes? Such outcomes may emphasize the importance of validation. Unfortunately, none of the stud- ies included in this review reported this aspect of model validation. The main difference between SI and EBC was found in validation of the model outcomes by using empirical data. Dependent validation of the model outcomes was found in several studies of EBC but not in studies on SI. This may be due to the nature of SI, which, as a com- municable disease, requires complex transmission dynamics and should therefore be studied on a population level rather than on a cohort level. For such dynamic SI models, understand- ing disease transmission dynamics is complex and the level of indirect protection caused by herd immunity is dependent on vaccine uptake levels. This complicates direct validation of model outcomes using randomised clinical trials of influenza vaccines, further enhanced by the variation of influenza activity by season or nation, and that the vaccine might not match the prevalent circulating strain. Independent validation of model outcomes to incidence data of national healthcare registries might therefore be more suitable compared with randomised clinical trial data, although the quality of influenza monitoring systems should then be taken into account. Such monitoring systems might not always be available in the studied countries.230 Chapter 10We feel that simply mentioning that the model was previously validated does not guarantee a high validation status as new validation efforts are necessary when a model is used in a different setting or with different data (a 'new application'). On the other hand, indicating that some particular input data was not validated due to a lack of suitable data sources was found to be useful for the reader as they can distinguish which parts of the model include high uncertainty [1]. Reporting that the model is validated according to the guidelines of ISPOR- SMDM Task Force on Good Research Practices-Modelling Studies [115], as was reported by Van Bellinghen et al. [64], or to the standards of the NICE, as was communicated through author comments, is insufficient. Although such guidelines give guidance on how model validation should be performed [115], these guidelines are general in nature and it is not clear which parts of validation have been performed, how and by whom. Therefore, simply follow- ing these guidelines does not guarantee that a model has a high enough validation status for its purpose, nor that model users can assess the validation status themselves. Although a probabilistic sensitivity analysis is the most important technique to demonstrate the uncertainty around the model outcomes, using cost effectiveness acceptability curves to demonstrate validity of the results [93, 95] does not evaluate how accurately the model sim- ulates what occurs in reality. The model that was applied by the author presenting with ten papers in our review was very similar in nine of these studies; however, no cross-validation of the conceptual model, or additional testing for variations, was described in any of these pa- pers. For instance, the model type and structure were similar in most of the studies but were adapted because of a different target group, perspective or vaccination strategy. Explanations on these deviations or validation of their outcomes were lacking. A positive example of reporting of model validation in the eyes of the authors was the study of Campbell et al. [77]. In this study, the underlying probability of a first recurrent breast cancer was based on a regression-based survival model that was externally validated against two online prediction tools: Nottingham Prognostic Index and Adjuvant! Online. A separate paper was devoted to the estimation and validation of this model [116]. Moreover, the web appendix contained an extensive report on external validation of the model used to estimate health-related quality-of-life during and after receiving chemotherapy. Our finding that reporting of validation activities is limited was confirmed by other studies. Carrasco et al. [10] assessed the validation of dynamic transmission models evaluating the epidemiology of pandemic influenza, and found that 16% of the compartmental models and 22% of the agent-based models reported on validation. As validation of model outcomes might be more difficult in cases where pandemic influenza is studied, reporting validation efforts of conceptual models or model inputs might be relatively more valuable. A study by 231 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer modelsHaji Ali Afzali et al. [9] reviewed the validation performances of 81 studies on therapeutic interventions for cardiovascular diseases, and found that 73% of the papers reported some form of model performance. The most executed form of validity was cross-validation (55%), similar to this study. Reporting of face validity (7%), internal validity (12%) and external va- lidity (16%) was low. Although the review process was carried out using a different checklist and was therefore not completely comparable, these results at least support our findings that cross-validation is the most reported validation procedure, and reporting of other validation efforts is rare. Moreover, it demonstrates that limited validation documentation is not restrict - ed to the disease areas of SI and EBC. A strong point of this study is that we systematically assessed model validation performanc - es. We looked at two disease areas, thereby covering a wider range of models than previous studies. Moreover, compared with previous studies analyzing reporting of validation efforts, we judged validation not only by technique but also by model aspect: conceptual model, in- put data, computerised model and the model outcomes. This made our findings more specific on which model aspects are generally validated and which are not. A final strong point is that we provided authors an opportunity to comment on whether more validation techniques were performed than those reported in the paper, which gave insight into the difference between performance and reporting of validation. A limitation of our study was that for most studies we could only evaluate published vali - dation efforts, rather than actual validation efforts undertaken. Thus, these models may have seemed less well-validated to the reader than they actually were. Although the responses of contacted authors of non-reported validation efforts were helpful, the response rate was low. Moreover, authors who performed more validation efforts might have been more aware of the importance of model validation and therefore more eager to respond to our enquiry. On the other hand, the poor response rate might also indicate that authors do not record which model validation tests were performed at the time the analysis was carried out. This was illustrated by three authors responses indicating that they were not able to provide additional informa - tion because the analysis was performed many years ago or because their current workload was too high. Next, we included ten papers on SI from the same first author, which might have had an effect on the total model validation performance within SI. Finally, although our search algorithm was extensive, we still may have missed publications that were not included in PubMed or EmBase. However, the main focus of the current review was to give insight into present practice with regard to reporting of model validation, rather than a complete comprehensive overview of model-based publications in the fields of SI and EBC. The main implication of our findings is that readers have no structured insight into the val-232 Chapter 10idation status of health economic models, which makes it difficult for them to evaluate the credibility of the model and its outcomes. In order to prevent making wrong decisions due to improper model validation status, readers might therefore be forced to perform validity checks themselves, which is highly inefficient. To date, we are not aware of any studies that have looked into the impact of the model's validation status on the correctness of the model outcomes; however, we are aware of a case in The Netherlands in which the validation status of the health economic model can have a decisive effect on the reimbursement status of a drug. In this case, a vaccine against human papillomavirus was rejected for reimbursement because of a lack of model transparency and non-face valid model inputs and model out- comes [117, 118]. Based on our results, we have several recommendations. First, better attention should be giv- en to validation efforts in scientific publications. A more systematic use of model reporting guidelines might be useful [119, 120], possibly aided by reporting tools specifically aimed at validation efforts, such as AdViSHE [15]. In order to circumvent space limitations, inclusion of a small summary on model validation techniques in the Methods and Results sections would be desirable, in combination with a full model validation report in online appendices. Moreover, validation is important for all published health economic models, even if the model was validated for an earlier purpose. In addition, the choice of validation techniques reported deserves more attention and should be less guided by general publication guidelines, which now seem to imply undue attention for cross-validation only. Finally, it will be interesting to see whether the reporting of validation efforts will improve in time. A similar publication in a few years' time will be very welcome. 5. Conclusions Although validation is deemed important by many researchers, this is not reflected in the re- porting habits of health economic modelling studies. A limited number of studies reported on model validation efforts, although good examples were identified. This lack of transparency might reduce the credibility of study outcomes and hamper decision makers in interpreting and translating these study outcomes to policy decisions. Since authors have indicated that much more is undertaken than is reported, there is room for quick improvement of the re- porting practices if stakeholders such as journals, editors and policy makers start explicitly requesting the results of the validation efforts. Therefore, systematic reporting of validation efforts would be desirable to further enhance decision makers' confidence in health economic models and their outcomes.233 Reporting on model validation efforts in seasonal influenza and early breast cancer modelsSupplemental Materials Supplemental materials may be found here: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-016-0410-3 Acknowledgements No funding was received for performing this study.

This chapter summa- rizes and discusses the principle findings of each part and their implications of each part. In part III, the findings of this thesis are put in a broader perspective in the context of an 'elderly vaccination programme' by (i) comparing the cost-effectiveness results of vaccina - tion against HZ and influenza with vaccination strategies against other infectious diseases, (ii) estimating the budget impact of a vaccination programme for older adults, (iii) discuss- ing further challenges of health economic evaluations of vaccination programmes for older adults, and (iv) mentioning some future considerations. Part I: Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster Principle findings of this thesis In part I, the objectives were to determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of older adults against HZ in the Netherlands, to demonstrate how the cost-effectiveness of the recombinant subunit vaccine (HZ/su) would compare with that of the live-attenuated vaccine (Zoster vac- cine live [ZVL]), and to estimate the optimal age of vaccination. Generally, we found that reductions in the list prices of vaccines are required before vaccination against HZ would become cost-effective for the conventional Dutch threshold for preventive interventions of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained (Chapter 3 and 4). However, for a threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained, HZ vaccination would be cost-effective even at the current list prices. Due to its high- er efficacy, vaccination with HZ/su results in significantly higher health gains as compared to vaccination with ZVL, and thus allows for a substantially higher vaccination cost per series to remain cost-effective (Chapter 4). However, as HZ/su requires double dosing, there are also pricing scenarios in which ZVL has the highest probability of being the most cost-effec- tive option. Optimal age of vaccination from a cost-effectiveness point of view was 70 years for HZ/su and 60 years for ZVL, but this was highly dependent on assumptions around the duration of protection (Chapter 4). The cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination may improve after the introduction of a varicella vaccination programme for children, because varicella vaccination may increase the incidence of HZ in older adults due to a reduction of immune boosting from the circulating varicella zoster virus (VZV) (Chapter 5). Implications of this thesis Results of this thesis have been considered by the Health Council of the Netherlands (Dutch: \"Gezondheidsraad\" [GR]) in their decision whether or not to recommend HZ vaccination for older adults. In 2016, the GR recommended against HZ vaccination with ZVL within a pub- lic programme, because vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection were judged to be 243 General discussiontoo limited in the oldest age-groups [1]. In 2019, the GR recommended the vaccination with HZ/su within a public programme, as it was considered essential health care [2]. However, the GR indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) would be higher than \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained (using the expected list price of \u20ac113.40 per dose in Germany [3]; 226.80 per series), and this list price should decrease by 50% to meet this threshold. An ICER below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained was considered as desirable by the GR, because the disease burden of HZ is substantially lower than that of influenza and pneumococcal disease. The age of vaccination was recommended at 60 years, because the GR expected that vaccination at this age would prevent the most disease burden and this age of vaccination was the most cost-effective. At the moment of writing of this thesis, the Ministry of Health is considering whether or not to follow the GR's recommendation. Long-term protection of HZ vaccination The cost-effectiveness and optimal age of HZ vaccination is highly dependent on the duration of protection. The GR's recommendation for HZ/su to vaccinate at the age of 60 years relies upon the assumption that the duration of protection is longer than 17 years, the minimum duration of protection required to change the optimal age of vaccination from 70 years to 60 years in the model. However, a duration of protection longer than 17 years is uncertain, because the clinical trial providing the relevant evidence had a follow-up of only four years, and the long-term efficacy of HZ/su was based on extrapolation of the trial data. Although the durability of humoral or cellular immune responses following vaccination with HZ/su is substantially longer than four years, these parameters do not always provide a correlate of protection. For instance, immunogenicity studies of ZVL indicated significant cell-mediated immunity at 10 years after vaccination [4], but data from clinical trials and observational studies found no significantly protective effect against HZ or PHN after 10 years [5]. Al- though clinical trials indicate that the efficacy of HZ/su is somewhat lower and the waning is somewhat faster in adults aged 70 years as compared to adults aged <70 years, the risk of HZ and PHN given HZ is higher above the age of 70 years. If HZ/su appears to be only pro- tective for 10 years, older adults may no longer be protected above the age of 70 years when vaccination is at 60 years. A more conservative approach would be to initiate the programme with vaccination at the age of 70 years, and then adjust to 60 years or even to 50 years when a durable duration of protection has been confirmed. The long-term protection of HZ/su is cur - rently investigated in separate clinical trials, and real-world vaccine effectiveness estimates from countries that already have implemented vaccination with HZ/su will become available in the next decade. Reassessment of the cost-effectiveness of HZ/su is important to evaluate the validity of the recent decision from the GR.244 Chapter 11Indirect effect of a childhood varicella vaccination programme Currently, the Netherlands has not implemented a childhood influenza vaccination pro- gramme against varicella, but the GR has planned to give their recommendation on this in 2020 [6]. A childhood varicella vaccination programme has been hypothesized to increase the disease burden of HZ in older adults due to the absence of exogenous immune boosting. Modelling indicates that, if this hypothesis is valid, the cost-effectiveness of the childhood varicella vaccination programme changes from being cost-effective to being more costly as well as causing an overall loss of health [7]. So far, real-world data have not provided conclu - sive evidence on whether or not a varicella vaccination programme increases the incidence of HZ in older adults [8]. Possibly, endogenous boosting (subclinical reactivation of the latent VZV) has taken over the role of exogenous boosting [9]. If varicella vaccination is added to the childhood vaccination programme, the incidence of HZ in older adults should be closely monitored in order to detect a potential increase. Varicella vaccination could also be com- bined with a HZ vaccination programme, which has been estimated to be cost-effective for vaccination with ZVL in Belgium, UK and Italy [10-12]. In the long term, HZ vaccination may become less cost-effective with ageing of varicella-vaccinated cohorts, as observational studies in children and adolescents suggest that the incidence of HZ in vaccinated individuals is significantly lower compared to unvaccinated individuals [13, 14]. Conclusion HZ/su is the preferred vaccine candidate for vaccination of older adults against HZ, because HZ/su is expected to result in a larger health gain compared to ZVL. However, a substantial reduction in the assumed list price is required to meet the indicated cost-effectiveness thresh- old of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained. Given the uncertainty around the duration of protection of HZ/su, 70 years would currently be the recommended age of vaccination, but this could be lowered to 60 years or even 50 years if long-term follow-up data show a durable duration of protection. A vaccination programme against HZ may also be recommended if varicella vac- cination for children were to be implemented, because such a vaccination programme could potentially increase the incidence of HZ in adults. Part II: Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against influenza Principle findings of this thesis In part II, one objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a switch from the tradi - tionally used trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) to the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). Furthermore, we investigated if augmenting the vaccination programme for older adults and clinical risk groups with a paediatric influenza vaccination programme would be cost-effec- tive. We also compared whether paediatric influenza vaccination prevents more disease bur -245 General discussionden in older adults as compared to a switch from TIV to QIV for vaccination of older adults and clinical risk groups themselves. We found that in the majority of high-income countries a switch from TIV to QIV was estimated to be cost-effective for the national willingness-to-pay thresholds (Chapter 6, 7). In the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), South Africa and Vietnam, QIV was not cost-effective for a general cost-effectiveness threshold specifical - ly estimated for LMICs (Chapter 8), and in Vietnam the additional money spent on QIV may be better invested in increasing the uptake of TIV (Annex 8.1). In the Netherlands, paediatric vaccination was estimated to be cost-saving, and paediatric vaccination strategies with the quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (Q-LAIV) dominated vaccination strategies with TIV (Chapter 9). The majority of paediatric influenza vaccination strategies prevented a higher number of deaths among older adults compared with switching from TIV to QIV for older adults. The highest net health benefit was obtained when paediatric influenza vaccina - tion with Q-LAIV was combined with vaccination of clinical risk groups with QIV . Implications of this thesis The question regarding a potential switch from TIV to QIV became urgent in the Netherlands after the 2017/18 season, a very severe season in which the TIV-unmatched B virus was dom- inant [15]. A rapid decision-making process was required for the potential implementation of QIV in the 2019/20 season, and an outbreak management team (OMT) meeting was orga- nized in September 2018. The OMT did not come to a conclusive recommendation, because there was doubt as to whether the unmatched influenza B-lineage would dominate in the next season, and whether QIV would have reduced the severity of the epidemic in the 2017/18 season [16]. As a result, three alternatives were provided to the Ministry of Health: 1) contin - ue the use of TIV pending the decision of the GR that is expected in 2020, 2) switch to QIV for children with chronic medical conditions only, because this target-group is expected to benefit most from QIV , and 3) switch to QIV for all ages as it would reduce the disease bur - den and is expected to be cost-effective based on modelling. In October 2018, the Ministry of Health decided to switch from TIV to QIV arguing that the best available vaccine should be used to reduce the burden of influenza [17]. The GR's recommendation regarding paediatric influenza vaccination is expected in 2020 [6]. Long-term protection of influenza vaccination There are potential long-term effects of influenza vaccination that are currently not account - ed for in modelling studies, because the mechanisms remain to be clarified. There is debate regarding the impact of repeated influenza vaccination. Some studies report that previous vaccination negatively interferes with vaccine effectiveness in the current season, while other studies report continuous protection [18]. The antigenic distance hypothesis has provided a 246 Chapter 11framework to understand variability in epidemic size, suggesting that the current season's vaccine effectiveness is negatively affected when the vaccine strain is unchanged and anti - genically distinct from circulating viruses [19]. A recent study from Canada estimated that the vaccine effectiveness of TIV against influenza B was higher than 50% regardless of lin- eage match, except when the vaccine strain was unchanged from the prior season and the circulating lineage did not match [20]. Selection of the B-lineage of TIV based on number of years since vaccination with either lineage, and whether there has been antigenic drift in either lineage during that time may provide some of the benefits of QIV , but without the additional cost [21]. More studies on the impact of repeated vaccination that account for the history of vaccination as well as natural infection over multiple seasons are needed. Indirect effects of a childhood influenza vaccination programme Modelling indicates that herd-immunity contributes substantially to the net health benefit of a paediatric influenza vaccination programme, and most paediatric influenza vaccination strategies that have been considered are more effective in the prevention of mortality in older adults than the use of QIV in older adults themselves. It is important that such findings are validated by real-world data. An ecological study estimated that a school-based vaccination programme reduced influenza mortality among elderly in Japan in the period 1962 to 1987 [22]. Recent studies from the US and the UK, however, did not find a significant impact of paediatric influenza vaccination programmes on mortality in older adults thus far [23, 24]. Large-scale studies of implemented childhood vaccination programmes are required to bet- ter quantify indirect influenza vaccine effectiveness. While childhood influenza vaccination should not be considered as a strategy to replace vaccination of clinical risk groups [25], it has a potential effect on the cost-effectiveness of the existing vaccination programme for older adults. This is illustrated by a modelling study from the UK that indicated that influen- za vaccination for low-risk older adults may cease to be cost-effective in the presence of a childhood influenza vaccination programme [26]. The duration of immunity following a natural influenza infection is substantially longer than the duration of protection following influenza vaccination [27]. Modelling indicates that age-cohorts that leave the paediatric influenza vaccination programme have an increased risk of influenza due to a lack of build-up of long-term natural immunity. Childhood vaccination is expected to be more cost-effective in the first seasons after introduction of the vaccination programme, when the population still benefits from pre-existing natural immunity (honey- moon effect). Economic evaluations of childhood influenza vaccination should therefore be evaluated over a longer time-period, e.g. 20 or 30 years, and not over a single season.247 General discussionAny vaccination programme should be carefully considered concerning potential negative in- direct effects to avoid inefficient allocation of scarce resources and to maintain the trust in the vaccination programme as a whole. A recently published modelling study for the Netherlands indicates that paediatric influenza vaccination may increase the variation in epidemic size; i.e. seasons with small epidemics are occasionally alternated with a season with a larger ep- idemic than seen without paediatric influenza vaccination [28]. Such disproportionally large epidemics occur due to an increase of the susceptibles fraction of the population in seasons with small epidemics. The occurrence of large epidemics may have consequences for public health, when, for instance, health care demand exceeds hospital capacities. Therefore, future modelling studies are recommended to report both the average estimated impact of childhood influenza vaccination across seasons and the variability in attack rate between seasons. Accumulating evidence shows that the first influenza infection in life determines immune responses against subsequent infections (imprinting) [29], but whether vaccination promotes or interferes with imprinting is still unclear [30]. It has been suggested that the prevention of influenza infections with inactivated vaccines in early childhood increases the vulnerability to pandemic strains due to the lack of build-up of cross-protective immunity [31]. However, this suggestion is mainly based on animal studies, and it is unclear whether the finding is also valid for humans [32]. LAIV has been shown to induce a cross-protective immune response due to actual replication in the upper-respiratory tract, and therefore may also provide some protection against pandemic strains [33]. However, pre-existing immunity may inhibit the replication of the attenuated influenza virus, which has been referred to as one of the possible explanations why LAIV was not effective against the influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus in the United States in the 2015/16 season [34]. Conclusion Modelling indicates that a switch from TIV to QIV for older adults and clinical risk groups would be cost-effective, but high quality data on the additional protection of QIV compared to TIV is lacking. Prospective studies comparing the effectiveness of different vaccines over multiple seasons are desirable to underpin decision making on the use of QIV , but have not yet been carried out. Childhood influenza vaccination is expected to result in substantial health gains in children and in the wider population, and would be cost-saving from a societal perspective. Q-LAIV would be the preferred vaccine for children, as repetitive vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccines may increase the vulnerability to future pandemic strains due to the interference of a build-up of cross-reactive immunity. However, there are still con- troversies regarding the long-term effectiveness of vaccination with LAIV due to inhibition of replication of the attenuated virus by pre-existing immunity, the validity of modelling re-248 Chapter 11sults in terms of the number of deaths prevented among older adults through herd immunity due to the childhood vaccination programme, and the risk of large outbreaks following child - hood vaccination. The UK is currently rolling out an LAIV vaccination programme for 2-16 year-olds; data from the surveillance system connected to this programme start to address the need for evidence regarding the direct and indirect effects of such a programme over a longer time-period. However, in order to give conclusive answers on the aforementioned questions, a UK data set covering more seasons than currently available is needed, and it is therefore recommended to wait for these data before making a decision on the implementation of child - hood influenza vaccination in the Netherlands. Part III: Towards a broader elderly vaccination programme Comparison with vaccination strategies against other infectious diseases Cost-effectiveness allows the comparison of vaccination against HZ and influenza with other vaccine-preventable diseases that cause substantial disease burden in older adults, i.e. pneu- mococcal disease and pertussis. In Table 1 we summarize the cost-effectiveness and health impact for a range of vaccination strategies against different infectious diseases. As well as vaccination strategies against HZ and influenza, we show economic outcomes of vaccination strategies against pneumococcal disease (23-valent against pertussis (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis [DTaP] vaccine). In addition, we added economic out- comes of vaccination strategies for children that could indirectly affect the disease burden in older adults, such as varicella vaccination, and a switch from the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) to PCV13. These economic outcomes were obtained from the literature [7, 10, 35, 36]. Due to the high disease burden of pneumococcal disease in older adults [37], pneumococcal vaccination of older adults is expected to result in the largest health gain per vaccinated individual (Table 1). Vaccination with PPV23 is expected to be the more cost-effective than vaccination with PCV13 due to a lower vaccine price. Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that the implementation of pneumococcal vaccination should be prioritized above the im- plementation of HZ vaccination, as it results in a higher health gain and the ICER is lower. A switch from PCV10 to PCV13 in children could also lead to substantial health benefits in older adults, but could also negatively affect the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccina - tion in older adults in the longer term due to serotype replacement [35]. Pertussis vaccination at the age of 60 years is estimated to be cost-effective when the reported incidence among older adults is substantially adjusted for underreporting. Vaccination of older adults is not es- timated to be cost-saving for any disease considered. From a cost-effectiveness perspective, 249 General discussionvaccination of children against influenza with Q-LAIV would have the highest prioritization, as it is expected to result in substantial health gains in older adults and on a population-level, and is estimated to be cost-saving. Table 1: The cost-effectiveness and relative health impact in quality adjusted life years of different vaccination strategies. Vaccination strategies in other target groups that could affect the disease bur - den among older adults via indirect effects are presented in italics.

HZ/su: Zoster vaccine live. Budget impact of vaccination programmes for older adults Next to cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of vaccination programmes is also considered important by policy makers. Table 2 shows the potential budget impact of an extended vacci - nation programme for older adults against influenza (switch from TIV to QIV for the current programme), pneumococcal disease (PPV23 at 60, 65, 70 years and 75 years), HZ (HZ/ su at 60 years) and pertussis (TDaP at 60 years). We used several assumptions regarding the vaccine coverage and vaccine price that are explained below (Table 2), and which can be subject to change. The total increase in vaccination costs (cost related to vaccines and 250 Chapter 11administration) as compared to the existing programme against influenza with TIV alone is estimated at \u20ac49.2 million, and the budget impact is estimated at \u20ac41.0 million. Adding up the vaccination costs of \u20ac49.2 million to the vaccination costs of the existing influenza vaccina - tion programme with TIV (\u20ac55.3 million), the total expenditure on vaccines for older adults would become \u20ac104.5 million. These vaccination programme costs would be higher than the total expenditure of \u20ac93 million on the national immunization programme for children in 2014 [38]. It should be noted that a significant part of the health care savings will not be incurred in the year of vaccination, as the effectiveness of vaccination programmes against pneumococcal disease, HZ and pertussis are spread out over a longer time period, while vac- cination with QIV only lowers health care costs in seasons with a TIV mismatch. Moreover, we assumed a steady state situation and start-up costs may be significantly higher when a catch-up programme for older cohorts is added. Policy makers should be aware that, although potentially cost-effective, vaccination programmes for older adults would be expected to lead to a substantial increase in the health care budget that is spent on vaccination, because vacci - nation programmes for older adults are not estimated to be cost-saving.

Further challenges regarding economic evaluations of vaccination pro- grammes for older adults Decision making based on cost-effectiveness alone would obviously ignore the shortcomings that are inherent in economic evaluations. Cost-effectiveness models are always a simplifi-251 General discussioncation of the truth and assumptions are made when relevant data is not available. Below, we discuss some challenges regarding the economic evaluation of vaccination programmes for older adults. Heterogeneity in older adults Heterogeneity refers to differences between individuals or population subgroups in terms of health status, vaccine responsiveness and social behaviour [39]. As compared to children, there is wider variation in health status among older adults due to a higher prevalence of comorbidities. As high-risk groups are more likely to develop severe disease given infection, differences in vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness between risk groups could introduce a bias in these analyses. For instance, the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination could be overestimated when HZ incidence rates of the general population are applied on an immuno - competent target-population, while the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination could be overestimated when the vaccine effectiveness of older adults in general is applied to a frail elderly population. However, to properly account for heterogeneity in economic evaluations, support from relevant data is necessary. Clinical trials and post-licensure studies on vaccine effectiveness in different risk-groups should be conducted, as patients with certain medical conditions and the frail elderly are usually excluded from trials. Heterogeneity in behaviour could also be important, since frail elder persons living in a nursing home presumably have different contact patterns than healthy older adults who may take care of their grandchildren. Frequently used contact data from the POLYMOD study does not contain information about living situation or frailty [40]. Furthermore, country-level population models do not account for heterogeneity in population density, age-distribution and vaccination coverage between regions. For instance, in the Netherlands, unvaccinated people are clustered in specific re- gions. Besides sublevel data on disease burden and vaccination characteristics, there is also a need of sublevel data on demographic parameters used in health-economic decision models such as life-expectancy, labour participation rates and social status. Interaction between pathogens Current health-economic models usually focus on a single pathogen, while in reality there could be interaction between different pathogens. For instance, some evidence exists that influenza infection may facilitate the progression of Streptococcus pneumoniae from carriage to severe disease [41]. An ecological study from the UK indicates that influenza has statis- tically significant contribution to invasive pneumococcal disease in children and younger adults [42], although in absolute number the contribution of influenza was low. As a con- sequence, paediatric influenza vaccination may also alleviate antibiotic usage, which could subsequently contribute to the prevention of antimicrobial resistance [43]. Other evidence suggests that influenza infections induce non-specific immune responses that can protect 252 Chapter 11against other respiratory viruses. Modelling suggests a negative interaction between influ- enza A virus and rhinovirus [44], and influenza-vaccinated individuals were found to have a significantly increased risk of rhinovirus infection in Hong Kong [45]. Infectious diseases may also contribute to a deterioration of general health status (patients do not return to their baseline health status after infection), which could result in increased sus- ceptibility to other infectious diseases. An observational study from the Netherlands found that older adults with suspected pneumonia had a lower health-related quality of life and a higher risk of mortality after 12 months as compared to comparable non-diseased subjects [46]. A reduced health status may eventually result in frailty, and the frail elderly are thought to be at increased risk of, for instance, HZ and cytomegalovirus infection [47, 48] as well as having an increased risk of vaccine failure of vaccines against influenza and pneumococcal disease [49, 50]. More work is needed to find out how pathogens interact with each other, how infections affect long-term health status, and to clarify the role of vaccination in the prevention of premature deterioration of health status. Mathematic modelling may contribute to the understanding of these issues, but the mechanisms are complex and embedding model results in economic frameworks may be challenging. Accounting for public support It is acknowledged that evaluation frameworks alone offer insufficient basis for fair and efficient decision making on public funding of vaccinations. In cost-effectiveness analyses, the QALY summarizes the overall health gain on a population level, but ignores the so- cial context in which this health gain occurs. For instance, the QALY integrates quantitative (prevented death) and qualitative (improved quality of life) health gains and sums up health gains for different age- and risk groups [51]. The social context is particularly important for decisions regarding vaccination programmes, as the vaccinated part of the population affects the disease burden in the unvaccinated part of the population as a result of herd immunity. A recent study from the UK that addressed people's preferences between efficiency of vacci - nation programmes and equity in health distribution found that averting a side effect carried more weight than the prevention of a natural infection with similar disease burden [52]. Furthermore, the prevention of an infection had more weight in children than in older adults. Incorporation of such preference patterns in cost-effectiveness analyses could be relevant to address \"public support\" in the prioritization of vaccination programmes. Recently, the Na- tional Health Care Institute of the Netherlands decided to involve the public in the discussion regarding which health care should be funded under the health insurance act [53]. Model transparency and validation Trust and confidence in model outcomes are critical for the use of modelling in policy mak-253 General discussioning. Transparency (how the model is built) and validation (how well it reproduces reality) are relevant aspects for achieving this [54]. Dynamic transmission models are often complex and data hungry, and there is a risk that policy makers are not able to oversee all model processes and thus consider the model as a black box. The gives rise to the risk that policy makers becomes wary of using model outcomes and will base their decisions on methods that are comprehensible but perhaps too simplified. Regarding transparency, it is important that non-technical descriptions of the model are available, and that the model structure, inputs, outputs and other components that determine function are well-described. Validation encom - pass factors such as the overall quality of the model (model structure, assumptions and input parameters), cross-validation to results of other models, and a subjective assessment or face validity [55]. Better structural reporting of model validation efforts would help to increase transparency on whether the model produces realistic outcomes. When different models pro- duce conflicting outcomes, model comparison studies are useful to provide insight in how these differences can be explained. Future considerations for a vaccination programme for older adults As previously mentioned, the Netherlands will replace TIV with QIV in the 2019/20 season, while the decision on vaccination with HZ/su is pending for approval from the Ministry of Health after a positive recommendation from the GR. In 2018, the GR recommended the vaccination of older adults against pneumococcal disease with PPV23 at the age of 60, 65, 70 and 75 years [13], which will be implemented in 2020. This section discusses future con- siderations on how to optimally protect older adults again infectious diseases using vaccines. Improve vaccination coverage The first step towards optimal protection of older adults is a better use of existing vaccines. Although elderly vaccination is not expected to significantly reduce transmission on a pop- ulation level, the total health gain of a vaccination programme depends on the vaccination coverage. The coverage of the influenza vaccination programme for older adults and clinical risk groups in the Netherlands has gradually declined from 70% in 2008 to 51% in 2018 [56]. The coverage among Dutch adults aged 65 years was 60% in 2018, which is substantially lower than the coverage target of 75% recommended by the WHO and the European Council [57, 58]. Improving the uptake of TIV may also be more effective than a switch to an im- proved influenza vaccine such as QIV , as shown in the annex of Chapter 8 and further dis- cussed in Hendriks et al. [59]. The pneumococcal vaccination programme can be combined with the annual influenza vaccination programme to ensure a significantly high uptake rate. However, at current influenza vaccination programme coverage levels a significant part of the elderly population will remain unprotected and efforts to increase vaccination coverage 254 Chapter 11are needed. HZ vaccination can also be combined with influenza vaccination, but HZ/su is a two-dose vaccine given 2 to 6 months apart and requires an additional consultation upon the annually administered influenza vaccine. The administration of the second dose of HZ/su is important for a good and durable vaccine-induced protection, and methods to ensure good compliance should be considered during its implementation. Also the availability of vaccines needs attention. For instance, the high demand for HZ/su in the first year after its launch has led to a vaccine shortage [60], and an increase in manufacturing capacity is ongoing to ensure sustainable supply. Vaccination of immunocompromised adults against HZ As HZ/su is also registered for immunocompromised patients, future studies on the cost-ef- fectiveness of HZ vaccination in different groups of immunocompromised populations are needed. A clinical trial in patients with an autologous stem cell transplantation, in which incidence of HZ is relatively highest [61], showed that vaccination with HZ/su was 68% effective against HZ over a median follow-up of 21 months [62]. The efficacy of HZ/su is currently being investigated in other immunocompromised patient groups [63]. Improved influenza vaccines 'Improved' influenza vaccines for older adults have either become available or are expected to soon become available on the European market, such as the MF-59 adjuvanted TIV (or adjuvanted QIV in the near future), the high-dose TIV (four times higher antigen load than the standard-dose TIV), the cell-based QIV (grown in mammalian cells instead of eggs), and the recombinant QIV (grown in insect cells instead of eggs). A recent study from the US estimated that adjuvanted TIV , high dose TIV and cell-based QIV could all be more effective than QIV , and cost-effectiveness analyses from other countries suggest that adjuvanted TIV and high-dose TIV are estimated to be more cost-effective than QIV [64-66]. The UK rec- ommended vaccination with adjuvanted TIV for older adults aged 65 years in the 2018/19 season [67] and added the cell-based QIV as a reimbursed vaccine option for the 2019/20 season [68]. However, the absolute benefits of these improved vaccines are relatively small as compared to standard TIV , and the development of new influenza vaccines is necessary. Many initiatives have been started to develop a universal vaccine that provides a broad, du- rable protection against all influenza viruses, and the first candidates are currently entering the clinical trial phase [69]. Future vaccine candidates for older adults In the future, vaccination programmes for older adults can be optimized, and new vaccines may become available. Close monitoring of the vaccination programme against pneumo- coccal disease should point out whether PPV23 is a better candidate for older adults than 255 General discussionPCV13; this depends on future trends of pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccines and the effectiveness against community-acquired pneumonia which is less established for PPV23 as compared to PCV13. Vaccination against pertussis may be indicated once, when more data on the burden of pertussis in older adults become available. Rotavirus is also thought to cause a substantial disease burden in older adults [70], but currently available rotavirus vaccines are only licensed for children. If rotavirus vaccines turn out to be effec- tive and safe in older adults, rotavirus vaccination may be a potential vaccine candidate for older adults as well. Several candidate vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus - a cause of respiratory infections in older adults potentially leading to hospitalizations or death - are currently in development and may become available within five years [71]. Concluding remarks Older adults are at increased risk of complications from infections, and vaccination could be an important preventive measure to facilitate healthy aging. Cost-effectiveness models can contribute to decision making on vaccination programmes by estimating their long-term costs and consequences. It is important to realize that vaccination programmes for older adults against influenza and HZ (and also against pneumococcal disease and perhaps pertus- sis) are expected to reduce a substantial disease burden, and can be cost-effective depending on the vaccine price. However, vaccination programmes for older adults are generally not cost-saving, and are expected to lead to an increase in the total health care expenditure. Vac- cines for older adults often have moderate effectiveness and/or a limited duration of protec- tion; hence, boosters are required. Decision making will benefit from a better understanding of the differences in disease burden and vaccine responsiveness between subgroups with regard to age, comorbidities, with economic analyses accounting for such heterogeneity. Then, the available budget can be allocated in such a way that those subgroups that benefit most from vaccination are targeted. Vaccination programmes for older adults should not be seen in isolation, as childhood vaccination programmes could affect the cost-effectiveness of vaccination programmes in older adults via indirect effects and vice versa. A childhood influ- enza vaccination programme may prevent more disease burden in older adults than improved vaccines for older adults themselves. However, potential negative indirect effects of a vacci - nation programme such as occasional large outbreaks or an increased susceptibility to sub- sequent infections should be excluded. Continuous monitoring of vaccination programmes is important, both in the target group as well as at the population level, to determine their long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

Cost-effective of vaccination of immunocompetent older adults against herpes zoster in the Netherlands: a comparison between the adjuvanted live-attenuated vaccines. BMC Med 2018, samenvatting List of publications Dankwoord / Acknowledgements Curriculum vitae Research Institute SHARE262 SupplementsSummary Older adults are at increased risk of complications from infections. Vaccination can reduce the burden of infectious diseases in older adults by targeting older adults themselves (direct protection) or reduce transmission on a population-level (indirect protection). Given the fact that healthcare budgets are under pressure, economic considerations have become a common part in the decision whether or not vaccination should require public funding. This thesis provides economic evidence on vaccination strategies to protect older adults against herpes zoster (part I) and influenza (part II). Part I: Vaccination against herpes zoster Herpes zoster (HZ) is the reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus, previous- ly introduced during primary infection (varicella). Currently, there are two licensed vaccines against HZ, the live-attenuated vaccine (zoster vaccine live [ZVL]) licensed since 2006 and the recombinant adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine (HZ/su) licensed since 2018. In Chapter 2, we reviewed the existing literature on the economic evidence of ZVL in older adults up to April 2013. The efficacy of ZVL decreased with age and waned over time. The majority of the studies estimated that vaccination of older adults with ZVL would be cost-effective if vaccination occurred in the age-range of 60-75 years and the duration of vaccine protection was longer than 10 years. The cost-effectiveness was also sensitive to the vaccine price. Chapter 3 describes the cost-effectiveness of ZVL in older adults in the Netherlands from a societal perspective. Using a cohort model, we estimated that vaccination is not expected to be cost-effective against the conventional Dutch threshold for preventive interventions of \u20ac20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, but would be cost-effective for a threshold of curative interventions of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained. After licensing of HZ/su, a new cost-effectiveness analysis of HZ vaccination was needed. HZ/su is more efficacious than ZVL and efficacy remains relatively stable across age, but is also expected to be more expensive as it requires double dosing. Using a Markov model with a decision tree, we show in Chapter 4 that vaccination with HZ/su prevented substantial dis- ease burden, potentially larger than with ZVL or ZVL plus a booster after 10 years. The HZ/ su maximum vaccine costs to equal the conventional Dutch threshold of \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained was \u20ac109 per series for vaccination at 70 years of age, which is considerably lower than the vaccine costs of \u20ac226 per series based on the list price of HZ/su in the United States (US). The optimum age of vaccination was 70 years, but due to its stable efficacy across all ages the cost-effectiveness was relatively similar for vaccination at 60 and 80 years. Sensi-263 Summarytivity analysis on the vaccine price indicates that for vaccination at 60 years some pricing scenarios exist in which vaccination with ZVL could be the most cost-effective strategy. In Chapter 5 we comment on a cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination of children against varicella in the Netherlands. A varicella vaccination programme in children may increase the incidence of HZ in adults due to a lack of exogenous immune boosting with the circulating wild-type varicella-zoster virus. If true, the varicella vaccination programme is expected to result in a net health loss. The simultaneous introduction of HZ vaccination could mitigate the potential increase in HZ incidence and the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination on its own would improve. Part II: Vaccination against influenza Seasonal influenza is a respiratory infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in high-income countries despite existing vaccination programmes targeting those at highest risk of complications. The quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), which contains antigens against one additional influenza B virus as compared to the traditionally used trivalent influ- enza vaccine (TIV), gives broader protection but is also more expensive. In Chapter 6 we discuss the existing economic evidence of QIV as compared to TIV , suggesting that a switch from TIV to QIV would be a cost-effective intervention with respect to corresponding nation - al willingness-to-pay thresholds. The main limitation is that, in absence of studies comparing the effectiveness between QIV and TIV , biologically plausible assumptions had to be used to estimate the additional effectiveness of QIV . Also, a better understanding of cross-reactivity between B viruses after vaccination and natural infection is needed. Chapter 7 contains cost-effectiveness results of QIV as compared to TIV in the United States. The US recommends influenza vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and has achieved substantial vaccination coverage in children. Using a dynamic transmission model we estimated that QIV was highly likely to be cost-effective from a societal perspective for commonly cited willingness-to-pay thresholds of US$50,000 and US$100,000 per QALY gained. QIV would be cost-saving when the cross-protection of TIV against the unmatched influenza B virus was reduced from 70% to 50% or lower. As a consequence of national healthcare authorities in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) questioning whether seasonal influenza vaccination should be introduced and whether this should involve vaccination with TIV or QIV , Chapter 8 presents a cost-ef- fectiveness analysis for South Africa and Vietnam and compared findings to those for the high-income country Australia. Individual-based simulation models for communities in each 264 Supplementscountry were integrated with a cost-effectiveness model to estimate the retrospective impact of vaccination with QIV or TIV over the period 2003-2013. Vaccination coverage was pri- oritized first to individuals infected with human-immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and older adults, and then to children aged <6 years. At an assumed symptomatic influenza attack rate of 5% per year and using a societal perspective, we found that QIV would not be cost-effec- tive in any community as compared to TIV for a threshold of international$1,045 per QALY gained for LMICs and a threshold of I$33,000 per QALY gained for Australia. In Annex 8.1 it was demonstrated that more cases could be prevented in communities in Vietnam and Australia when the additional money spend on QIV would be invested in a higher uptake of TIV . For the community in South Africa, spending the budget on QIV or on more TIV was equally effective. A childhood influenza vaccination programme could be an effective strategy to reduce the burden of influenza on a population level, as children are thought to be important in the transmission of influenza. Chapter 9 presents results of a cost-effectiveness analysis of pae- diatric influenza vaccination in the Netherlands, while accounting for indirect effects of vac- cination. Using a dynamic transmission model, paediatric influenza vaccination programme was estimated to reduce the disease burden of influenza in the population substantially and was cost-saving from a societal perspective. Indirect effects contributed significantly to the cost-effectiveness of the paediatric vaccination programme. The majority of paediatric vac- cination strategies resulted in a higher QALY gain than a switch from TIV to QIV for clinical risk-groups. The highest net health benefit was expected to be obtained when children aged 2-17 years are vaccinated with the intranasally administered quadrivalent live-attenuated vaccine (Q-LAIV), while other age-groups are vaccinated with QIV . As transparent reporting of model validation efforts provides stakeholders better insight into the credibility of model outcomes, efforts to validate health-economic decision models for seasonal influenza (and early breast cancer) were assessed in Chapter 10. Reviewing the studies with a structured list of relevant validation techniques indicated that 57% of the 53 influenza studies published in the period 2008-2014 had reported one or more validation techniques. Comments from authors on the question whether validation efforts other than those reported in their manuscript were performed suggested that in practice considerably more validation techniques were being used than had been reported. Therefore, more com- prehensive and systematic reporting of such validation efforts of health-economic models would be desirable. The main findings are discussed in Chapter 11. Vaccination programmes against HZ and 265 Summaryreplacement of TIV with QIV for influenza are expected to prevent substantial disease bur - den in older adults and could be cost-effective, depending on the vaccine price. However, a substantial increase in healthcare expenditure is foreseen as vaccination was not always expected to be cost-saving. Economic evaluations would benefit from a better understanding of heterogeneity in disease burden and vaccine responsiveness in older adults, so vaccination can be tailored to those sub-groups that would benefit the most. Indirect effects of child - hood vaccination programmes can affect the cost-effectiveness of vaccination programmes for older adults positively or negatively. Influenza vaccination for children is expected to be cost-saving; however, there are concerns described in the literature that such a programme would lead to occasional larger epidemics. Moreover, the long-term effects of repetitive vac- cination on the build-up of immunity in children is uncertain. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of a vaccination programme is important to assess and optimize its long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.266 SupplementsNederlandse samenvatting eerste over de economische lager dan de potentiele kosten van \u20ac226 per serie op basis van de van HZ/su op 60 jaar of op V oor de leeftijd van 60 jaar vaccin (QIV) bevat een antigen tegen een extra influenza B vergeleken het traditioneel nationale grenswaardes.
