His energy was down, he was eating the typical American diet filled with dairy, meat and sweets, and he woke up every morning with a mucous cough. A friend introduced him to the four-week detoxification plan at Karyn's restaurant and wellness center, 1901 N. Halsted St., in Lincoln Park, a plan that incorporates raw foods, colonics, fasting and more. The result? Monroe, director of a non-for-profit organization, lost his cough, his taste for ice cream and 22 pounds (although he stressed that he did not join the program to lose weight). His energy improved--so much so that the 45-year-old took up marathon running--and he has since gone through Karyn's detox plan four other times. \"Each time,\" Monroe said, \"I feel myself getting cleaner and cleaner.\" Owner Karyn Calabrese, 59, has been detoxing for more than 25 years and attributes her youthful appearance to the often-controversial practices of fasting, colonics and raw foods. But she is emphatic about encouraging the up-to-200 people who often fill her classes to never feel pressured to do anything they don't feel comfortable with. \"This is my life, it's what I teach, but I'm extreme,\" she conceded. \"You can try the whole thing or dip one toe in,\" is the motto she repeats to her clients, who include doctors, judges, psychics and schoolteachers. A body cleanse is any number of specific techniques used to enhance the body's ability to eliminate toxins--pollutants acquired through the air, water or food supply that hamper the ability of one's system to run efficiently. These include preservatives and pesticides used in and on foods, hairsprays and aerosol cleansers, lawn fertilizer, even the hormones in birth-control pills. So says naturopathic cardiologist Decker Weiss, assistant professor of medicine at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Scottsdale, Ariz., where he maintains his private practice. But one type of body cleanse does not suit everyone, as they range from very subtle, herbal-based plans to more aggressive fasting programs. Our body is naturally designed to remove these waste products, Weiss said. But our internal cleansing systems may become so overtaxed by the large volume of toxins encountered in today's society that detoxification may be needed to assist in the removal process. \"We've never seen this amount of toxic load,\" he explained, \"especially in women, because of the amount of estrogens in the foods and the waters and plastics. That's why we're seeing [increasing amounts of] perimenopause, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis.\" The critical question in this hotly debated topic is, \"Does the body need outside help clearing toxins?\" After all, isn't that what the liver, kidneys and colon are for? Dr. Jeanette Newton Keith, assistant professor of medicine in gastroenterology at University of Chicago Hospitals, said cancer-causing agents in foods do build up inside the body, but the body's elimination process, when working properly, carries them away effectively. \"That's why you want to move your bowels every one to two days,\" she said--to limit the colon's exposure to these cancer-causing agents. In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer found in American men and women; about 55,000 people will die from it this year. That said, Keith added that she has never seen a study showing the benefits of repeat colon cleansing. \"You can overdo it in terms of long-term colonic cleansing,\" she said, meaning one can become dependent on these programs if used to an extreme degree. But adherents of cleansing swear by their procedures, which involve two groups, Weiss said: Those who are healthy and use laxatives and colonics for preventive reasons; and sick people who use them in recovery. (The latter group includes certain cancer patients and sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, Weiss said.) Weiss suggested using a product that includes a non-stimulant-type laxative to encourage healthy elimination (look for magnesium hydroxide, slippery elm bark and marshmallow root to draw water into the intestines); some herbal components such as artichoke and dandelion root; and, perhaps most important, he said, easily dissolvable fiber to bind up toxins. \"Fiber is always the underestimated part of a good cleanse,\" he said. The reason? Most detoxification plans are successful at helping the body release toxins but fail to complete the cleansing process by getting rid of them, so the toxins simply are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, Weiss said. Fiber ensures the elimination of such substances. - - - Just in case you wonder how a colon cleanse feels . . . I'm not going to sugarcoat this: Colonics are not for the fainthearted. Then again, I'm writing about having a tube stuck where the sun don't shine, so I suppose you could say I'm not exactly a shrinking violet. I've always wondered what happened during one of these internal irrigations, so when the opportunity for a 90-minute appointment at one of the Chicago area's premier establishments, Chicago Colonic, arose, I grabbed it. Let me start by saying Chicago Colonic was clean to the point of being pristine. Fresh flowers, candles and hand-painted walls created an inviting atmosphere, the individual rooms were practically spalike . . . so much so that I almost forgot about the slo-infusion method colonic irrigation machine mounted on the wall and the personal bathroom (again, spotless) provided for post-colonic evacuation. My certified colonic hydrotherapist, Nina Nicolai, pesident of Chicago Colonic, began our session with a medical history, making sure I had no reasons not to have the procedure (such as hemorrhoids, high blood pressure or pregnancy). She also took a dietary inventory, being sure to point out both in writing and orally that her suggestions were not medical advice. I was then led into one of the private rooms and introduced to the machinery, given a soft sheet and asked to change in private. Once on the table, tush exposed, I tried to continue taking notes like a good journalist but quickly scrapped that idea once I heard the words, \"OK, why don't you give me your hand and help me guide the speculum in?\" The next hour or so was somewhat of a blur--the kind of amnesia your body grants you to block out traumatic experiences--although I must say, Nicolai was the consummate professional the entire time. I received a number of what are termed \"fills\" with water, accompanied by abdominal massaging, but because I live a life of constant dehydration, my \"releases\" were, shall we say, unproductive. It wasn't until Nicolai tried a cold-water fill, known to cause the colon to contract, that the real action started. It was painful, in the way I'd imagine childbirth is painful: Sure, it hurts, but you asked for it and hopefully something good is going to come out of all of this. Ultimately, I did make some nutritional changes as a result of my cleanse: I'm drinking more water, eating less chocolate and less bread. But am I ready to hop back on the table anytime soon? I think I'll sit it out for a while. For more information, e-mail chicagocolonic@aol.com "}
