Pranic Healing is a no-touch form and non-toxic form of energy healing. The body has been fully equipped and is capable of healing itself by channeling and integrating the life-force or \"prana\" that is all around us from the sun, air and earth. When our bodies are not processing that energy in a healthy way, imbalance begins to take its toll and disease can manifest. During a session, trained energy wellness practitioners assess where imbalances have manifested in the body and correct it. Pranic Healing is not designed to replace conventional medicine but rather to complement it and when used together the healing process is much faster.

Founder of Modern Pranic Healing Pranic Healing as a science was developed and introduced in 1987 by GrandMaster Choa Kok Sui through the publication of a book called \"The Ancient Science and Art of Pranic Healing. GMCKS developed a comprehensive method of healing that helps in cleansing and energizing the energy system which pervades the physical body, thus accelerating the rate at which the body can heal itself. Through his teachings and practical application of Pranic Healing, he demonstrated that energy is an important factor in healing not only the physical being but also the psyche. GMCKS' in-depth study of ancient esoteric sciences had led him to discover and develop practical healing techniques significant to man's physical health and well-being, as well as to boost his spiritual potential. He believed in the Law of Correspondence, that states that whatever affects the energy body or aura, affects the physical body and vice versa and that whatever happens to the energy body manifests itself in the physical body.
