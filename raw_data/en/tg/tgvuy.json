How long vaccines take to work It usually takes 2 weeks for vaccines to work. Your child will not be protected immediately. Why your child needs more than 1 dose of a vaccine Most vaccines need to be given several times to build up long-lasting protection. For example if a child received only 1 or 2 doses of the whooping cough vaccine, the child is only partly protected. They may still catch whooping cough if the full course is not completed. Booster doses are also recommended for some vaccines. The booster dose stimulates the immune system again and gives your child better long term protection.
