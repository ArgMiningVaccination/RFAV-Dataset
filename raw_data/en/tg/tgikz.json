Drawing upon this experience, this guide aims to provide practit ioners with a broad framework for carrying out project level Participatory Impact Assessments (PIA) of livelihoods interventions in the humanitarian sector. Other than in some health, nutrition, and water interventions in which indicators of project performance should relate to international standards, for many interventions there are no 'gold standards' fo r measuring project impact. For example, the Sphere handbook has no clear standards for food security or livelihoods interventions. This guide aims to bridge this gap by outlining a tried and tested approach to measuri ng the impact of livelihoods projects. The guide does not attempt to provide a set of standards or indicators or blueprint for impact assessment, but a broad and flexible framework which can be adapted to different contexts and project interventions. Consistent with this, the proposed framework does not aim to provi de a rigid or detailed step by step formula, or set of tools to carry out proj ect impact assessments, but offers an eight stage approach, and examples of tools which may be adap ted to different contexts. One of the objectives of the guide is to demonstrate how PIA can be us ed to overcome some of the inherent weaknesses in conventional humanitarian monitoring evaluati on and impact assessment approaches, such as; the emphasis on measuring process as opposed to r eal impact, the emphasis on external as opposed to community based indicators of impact, and how to overcome the issue of weak or non-existent baselines. The guide also aims to demonstrate a nd provide examples of how participatory methods can be used to overcome the challe nge of attributing impact or cha nge to actual project activities. The guide will also demonstrate how data collected from the systematic use of participatory tools can be presented numerically, and can give representative results a nd provide evidence based data on project impact. With reference to the eight stage approach, the guide will give examples of how PIA methods have been used to measure and attri bute the impact of differe nt types of livelihoods interventions in different contexts. Objectives of the Guide 1. Provide a Framework for Assessing the Impact of Livelihoods Interventions 2. Clarify the differences between measuring process and real impact 3. Demonstrate with examples of how PIA can be used to measure the impact of different projects in different contexts using community identified impact indicators 4. Demonstrate how participatory methods can be used to measure impact where no baseline data exists 5. Demonstrate how participatory methods can be used to attribute impact to a project 6. Demonstrate how qualitative data from participatory tools can be numerically presented, and systematically collected to give representative results of project impact 7WHY BOTHER MEASURING IMPACT? Much of the academic literature suggests that in recent years there has be en little incentive for humanitarian organizations to measure the impact of their work (Roche 1999, Hofmann et al 2004, Watson, 2008). However, the emergence of initiati ves such as the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP-I) the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance (ALNAP) the Organizational Learning Partners hip (OLP) and the Fritz Institut e Humanitarian Impact Project have catalyzed a growing inte rest and demand for greater effectiveness, learning and accountability within the human itarian sector. This emphasis on learning, accountability and effectiveness has created a demand for organizations to demonstrate and measure the real impact of their projects on the livelihoods of the recipient communities. Although many if not all humanitarian agencies cl aim to be having an impact, these claims are rarely substantiated with rigor ous evidence based data (Hofmann et al 2004, and Darcy 2005), and the 'gap between the rhetoric of agencies and what they actually achieve is increasingly met with skepticism and doubt amongst donors and ot her stakeholders' (Roche C, 1999). Evidence to support claims of project impact, are largely su pported by information fr om agencies monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems and anecdotes from project monitoring reports . Most organizations M&E systems focus on measuring the process of pr oject implementation and service delivery, with the emphasis being on upward financial account ability. Although, the m onitoring of project activities is an important mana gement function, and the information is certainly useful in attributing impact to a given interv ention, M&E data rarely tells us much about the real impact of a project on the lives of project clie nts or participating communities. A well designed impact assessment can capture the real impacts of a project, be they positive or negative, intended or unintended on the lives of th e project participants. An impact assessment can therefore demonstrate if the mone y allocated towards a project is actually having an effect on the lives of the project participants. This alone s hould create a greater demand from donors, and greater incentives for implementing agencies to measure the results of their work. In the experience of the Feinstein Center, even where the re sults of an assessment show that impact is not as significant as expected, or where negative impacts are reveal ed, honesty in reporting can be appreciated by donors, as it suggest s a willingness by the implementing agency to learn from its programming, whereas less transparent and defens ive reporting tends to evoke skepticism. The ability to define and measure humanitarian impact is essential to providing operational agencies with the tools to systematically evaluate the relative efficacy of various types of interventions. Aggregating lessons learned across organizations, operations, and time is critical to the creation of an evidence base which can continue to inform the sector about improvement. Institutionalizing good practice in the systems and structures of relief organizations is critical to their ability to meet the growing demands on the sector and the needs of people made vulnerable by disasters and humanitarian crises. Similarly, communicating the effectiveness of impact is necessary for the humanitarian sector to respond to increasing pressure from donors and the general public to demonstrate the results of its efforts (Fritz Institute, 2007). \u00a9 Kadede 2007 8The experience of the Feinstein Center shows that where project participants are included in the impact assessment process, it can create an oppo rtunity to develop a lear ning partnership involving the donor, the implementing partner, and the part icipating communities. The impact assessment process can create space for dial ogue, and the results can provide a basis for discussions on how to improve programming, and where best to allocate future resources. Results from some impact assessments supported by the Feinstein Center demonstrated unintende d impacts that differed from, and were possibly more significant than the expected impact associated with the stated objectives of the project. If these impact assessmen ts had not been carried out this would not have been captured or documented, and the opportunity to use this information in designing future projects would have been lost. Aside from the internal organizational learning benefits derived from measuring impact, when rigorously applied, the results from impact assessme nts can be used as a powerful advocacy tool to influence the formulation of policy and best practice guidelines for humanitarian programming. Experience from Ethiopia shows that evidence ba sed data derived from impact assessments was successfully used to develop Government endorse d best practice guidelines for drought response interventions in the livestock sector (Behnke et al 2008). A more systematic approach to impact measuremen t in the humanitarian s ector can only help to improve accountability, not only to donors and extern al stakeholders, but more importantly to the recipients of humanitarian aid. It will also answ er the fundamental question s that are rarely asked, what impact are we really having, and do these ai d interventions and activi ties really work? This can only lead to better programming and a more effective use of humanitarian funds. Overall, a greater emphasis on measuring and demonstrat ing impact can only enhance the image and credibility of donors, and humanita rian organizations within the sector. Indeed, as Chris Roche (1999, 3) argues; \"In the long term the case for aid can only be sustained by more effective assessment and demonstration of its impact, by la ying open the mistakes and uncertainties that are inherent in development work, and by an honest a ssessment of the comparative effectiveness of aid vis-\u00e0-vis changes in policy and practice\". 9WHAT IS PARTICIPATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT? Participatory Impact Assessment (PIA) is an exte nsion of Participatory Ru ral Appraisal (PRA) and involves the adaptation of partic ipatory tools combined with more conventional statistical approaches to specifically measure the impact of humanitarian assistance and development projects on people's lives. The pr oposed approach is a flexib le impact assessment methodology which can be adaptable to local conditions. The approach acknowledges local people, or project clients as experts by emphasizing the involvement of project part icipants and community members in assessing project impact - and by recognizing th at 'local people are capable of identifying and measuring their own indicator s of change' (Catley, 1999). All the definitions of impact in either the development or humanita rian assistance field involve the concept of change this can be positive or negative. Consistent with this, a project level PIA tries to answer the fo llowing three key questions (Watson, 2008): 1. What changes have there been in the community since the start of the project? 2. Which of these changes are attributable to the project? 3. What difference have these changes made to people's lives? In contrast to many traditional pr oject M&E approaches, PIA aims to measure the real impact of a project on the lives of the projec t participants, as opposed to m easuring the process of project implementation and the delivery of project inputs and services. Mo st evaluations tend to focus on measuring aspects of project implementation, such as the delivery of input s, the construction of project infrastructure, the numbe r of trainings carried out or the number of people trained. PIA tries to go a step further by inve stigating if and to what extent these project activities actually benefited the intended reci pients, and if these benef its can be attributed to the project activities. The use of participatory methods in PIA allows impact to be measured against qualitative indicators of impact, such as changes in dignity, status, and well being, or changes in the level of community participation throughout the implem entation of a given project. The use of participatory ranking and scoring methods enables these types of qualitative indicators, often based on opinions or perceptions to be numerically presented. The use of comparative scoring and ranking methods can be used in PIA to assess pr oject attribution, by comp aring both the project and non-project factors that contri buted to any assessed change. This is particularly useful where the use of a control group is uneth ical or impractical, which is of ten the case in the context of humanitarian assistance projects. Comparative scoring methods used in PIA can also be used to develop a retrospective baseline against which to measure impact. Again the lack of baseline data is a common feature of humanitarian assistance pr ojects, particularly thos e being implemented in an emergency setting. The PIA approach emphasizes the standardization and repetition of participatory methods, helping to improve the reliability of the information, but ideally leaving enough scope for the open-ended and flexible inquiry typical of PR A. In this respect PIA tries to find a balance between systematic methods and the richness of qualitative inquiry. In summary, a systematic, well designed PIA can assist communities and NGOs to measure impact using their own indicators and thei r own methods. It can also overco me the weaknesses inherent in 10many donor and NGO monitoring and evaluation sy stems which emphasize the measurement of process and delivery, not results or impact.

Eight Stages of a Participatory Impact Assessment Stage 1: Define the questions to be answered Stage 2: Define the geographical and time limits ofthe project Stage 3: Identify and prioritize locallydefined impact indicators Stage 4: Decide which methods to use, and test them Stage 5: Decide which sampling method and sample size to use Stage 6: Assess project attribution Stage 7: Triangulate Stage 8: Feedback and verify the results with the community 12 STAGE ONE: IDENTIFYING THE KEY QUESTIONS The most important and often the most difficult part of designing an impact assessment is deciding which questions should be answere d. Defining the questions for an impact assessment is similar to defining the objectives of a proj ect-unless you know specifically wh at you are trying to achieve, you're unlikely to achieve it. Many assessments try to answer too many questions and end up doing so poorly. Although it's tempting to try an d capture as much information about a given project as possible, there's always a risk that in doing so, you will collect too much information to effectively manage and analyze. It is better to limit the assess ment to a maximum of five key questions and answer these well. If you have already worked with communities to id entify their impact indicators at the beginning of the project, the assessment will focus on the measurement of these indicators and assessment of project attribution. If yo u are using a retrospective approach, discuss the impact assessment with the project participants, and jointly define the questi ons with them. Example: Provision of sheep or g oats to female headed households For such a project, the impact assessment may only need to answer three questions. 1. How has the project impacted, if at all, on the livelihoods of the women involved in the project? 2. How has the project impacted, if at all, on the nutritional status of the women's children? 3. How might, the project be changed to improve impact in the future? \u00a9 Suji 2007 13 STAGE TWO: DEFINING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PROJECT IN SPACE AND TIME Defining the spatial or 'geogra phical' boundaries of a project aims to ensure that everyone understands the limits of th e area in which impact is supposed to take place. DEFINING THE PROJECT BOUNDARY Participatory Mapping is a useful visualization method to use at th e beginning of an assessment to define the geographical boundary of the project area. It also acts as a good ice-breaker as many people can be involved. Maps produced on the ground using locally-available materials are easy to construct and adjust until informants are co ntent that the information is accurate. Examples of maps include \u0083 Natural resource maps \u0083 Social maps \u0083 Opportunities and service maps \u0083 Livestock mobility and grazing maps \u0083 Conflict maps \u0083 Market Maps Mapping is a useful method for the following reasons: \u00be Both literate and non-literate people can contribut e to the construction of a map (as it is not necessary to have writ ten text on the map) \u00be When large maps are constructed on the ground, many people can be involved in the process and contribute ideas. People also correc t each other and make su re that the map is accurate. \u00be Maps can represent complex information that would be difficult to describe using text alone. \u00be Maps can be used as a focus for discussion. 99 14 A map of Zipwa Project Site, Zimbabwe Drawing a community map in the sand The Method 1. Mapping is best used with a group of informan ts, say between 5-15 people. Find a clean piece of open ground. Explain that you wo uld like the group to produce a picture showing features such as: - Geographical boundaries of the community. In pastoral areas, these should include the furthest places where people go to graze their animals. - Main villages or human settlements. - Roads and main foot paths - Rivers, lakes, dams, wells and other water sources. - Crop production farmed areas, fishing areas , forests and other natural resources. - Market centers - Services, clinics, schools, shops, seed and ferti lizer distribution outlets , veterinary clinics, government offices. - Ethnic groups - Seasonal and spatial human and livestock movements - Areas of high risk, flooding, insecurity, tset se flies, ticks and other parasites. Explain that the map should be constructed on the ground using materials that are to hand. For example, lines of sticks can be used to show boundaries, and stones may be used to represent human settlements. In some communities people may be more comfortable using flip charts and colored markers to construct the map. If in doubt ask the participan ts which option they prefer to use. 2. When you are confident that the group understands the task they are being asked to perform, it is often useful to explain that you will leave th em alone to construct th e map and return in 30 minutes. At that point, leave the group alone a nd do not interfere with the construction of the map. 3. After 30 minutes, check on progress. Give the group more time if they wish. \u00a9 Suji, 2007 15 4. When the group is happy that the map is finished , ask them to explain the key features of the map. The process of \"interviewing the map\" enables assessors to learn more about the map and pursue interesting spatial f eatures. As mentioned a map can be a useful focus tool for discussions and follow-up questioning. It is import ant that one member of the team takes notes during this discussion. During this part of the exercise ask the partic ipants to include any project infrastructure on the map in relationship to the other feat ures. For example if the project constructed wells or a cereal bank, or estab lished a community vegetable garden, ask the participants to illustrate these on the map. In many cases these may already have been included, which already tells us something a bout the importance of the project from the perspective of the participants. Similar or ot her types of physical a ssets may have been established by the government or another NGO in the project area, it is important to also include these on the map. 5. It is often useful to add some kind of scale to the map. This can be done by taking a main human settlement and asking how many hours it take s to walk to one of the boundaries of the map. In less remote communities people may alr eady know how many kilometers it is from one settlement to another and can define this on the map. A north south orientation can also be added to the map, or arrows pointing to a major urban center or natural feature lying outside of the boundary of the map. 6. Make two large copies of the map on flip chart paper. Give on e copy to the group of participants. When maps are used to show s easonal variations, such as floodi ng, livestock movements, or crop production, these can be cross-check ed using seasonal calendars. The increasing use of computer s canners and digital cameras means that copies of maps can easily be added to reports. 16EXAMPLES OF MAPS FIGURE 2.1 COMMUNITY MAP INDIA Map of Pyutar Village Committee area, Ward 9 by Krishna Bahadur and Iman Singh Ghale This map was produced by two farmers in a sedentary community in India. The map shows the location of the main livestock types, areas of cultivation and other features (source: Young, Dijkeme, Stoufer, Shrestha and Thapa, 1994, PRA Notes 20) 17 FIGURE 2.2 GRAZING MAP KENYA Map of Kipao village, Garsen Division, Tana River District. This map was constructed by Orma herders. It shows the dry season grazing areas for cattle around Kipao and proximity to tsetse infested areas. During the wet season, the area became marshy and cattle were moved to remote grazing areas. (Source: KETRI/IIED/IBAR study, 2001) 18 DEFINING THE PROJECT PERIOD - TIMELINES Defining the project boundaries in time, sometimes called the 'temporal boundary' aims to ensure that everyone is clear about the tim e period that is being assessed. A timeline is an interviewing method which captu res the important historical events in a community, as perceived by the community themselv es. In impact assessments, timelines can be used to define the temporal boundaries of a project . In other words, the timeline helps to clarify when the project started and when the project en ded, or how long it has been going on for. This method is useful in helpi ng to reduce recall bias. FIGURE 2.3 TIMELINE ETHIOPIA 1010 Source: Participatory Impact Assessment Team, 2002 A timeline is created by identifying a knowledgeable person (or persons) in a community and asking them to describe the history of the community. In many rural communities, such descriptions usually refer to key events such as drought, periods of conflict or disease epidemics. After the key events have been described, the time when the project started should be related to these events. Similarly, the time when the project ended (or the time of the assessment) should also be related to the key events. 19 The following timeline was produced by five key informants in a rural community in Zimbabwe participating in an drought recovery project Key political events were used as reference points for the timeline. The timeline shows when the project started, and a consequent improvement in food s ecurity shortly thereafter. Note that the timeline also shows external project factors that might have contributed to food security, such as improved rainfall, and other NGO interventions. Where applicable a timeline should highlight non project factors in order to help isolate the impact of the project from other relevant variables.

Grains (maize) ran out by November. People started selling livestock to buy grain and eating fewer meals. They also started consuming svovzo. Some people moved to more productive neighboring areas in search of agricultural work. Concern started distributing in kind food assistance from December through to March 2003. Small Harvest in March, Grains (maize) ran out by November, people started exchanging household items for grain; some sold ox carts, ploughs, window frames and roofs in order to purchase maize. Good Harvest DROUGHT year, little or no harves t, people selling livestock and belongings to purchase grains. In August Africare started developing the GIRA project proposal in partnership with the community. Concern started distributing in kind food assistance in November through to April 2006. Africare initiated the GIRA project in December 2005- distributing soy bean, sorghum and sweet potato seeds. Although late in the planting season, many farmers managed to plant at least some of these seeds. Distributions continued through to January 2006 Good harvest in March, particularly for sorghum, sweet potato and soy beans. This was attributed to high rainfall, and the seeds distributed by Africare. Two bad years and one medium year implied that most farmers either had no seeds left or at least no good quality seeds. Africare did a second round of seed distributions in September/October. (Soya beans, sweet potato, sunflower, maize and groundnuts) Bad maize harvest, as a result of poor rainfall. Soya beans and sweet potato did well, groundnuts did okay. By June people already having to purchase maize. GTZ have also been carrying out restocking interventions in the same wards as the Africare project however, there is no indication of any overlap in terms of assisted communities or individual household recipients. Source: Burns and Suji, 2007 20STAGE THREE: IDENTIFYING INDICATORS OF PROJECT IMPACT A key feature of all types of project assessment is that inputs, activit ies, outputs, change or impact are measured. The things that we measure are usually called \"indicators\" . There are two types of indicators as follows: Process indicators sometimes called outcome indicators usually measure a physical aspect of project implementation such as the procurement or delivery of inputs such as seeds, tools, fertilizer, livestock or drugs, the construction of project assets and infrastructure such as wells or home gardens, the number of training courses run by the project or the nu mber of people trained. Process indicators are useful for showing that pr oject activities are actua lly taking place according to the project work plan. However this type of in dicator may not tell us much about the impact of the project activities on the pa rticipants or community. Impact indicators measure changes that occur as a result of project activities. Impact indicators can be qualitative or quantitative, and usually involve the end result of a projec t on the lives of the project participants. Most projects involve some sort of direct or indirect livelihoods asset transfer, such as infrastructure, knowledge, livestock, f ood or income. These asset transfers sometimes represent impact, but usually it is the benefits or changes realized through the utilization of these assets that represents a real impact on the lives of project participants. For example, if a project provide s training in new and improved fa rming practices, a skills and knowledge, or human capital transfer would be e xpected. While this knowledge is all well and good, it is the utilizati on of the knowledge that will ultimately result in real impact on the lives of the participating farmers. If a pplied, this knowledge transfer ma y translate into improved crop yields, resulting in improved household food secu rity. It may also lead to improved household income from increased crop sales. Therefore, th e knowledge and improved yi elds attributable to this knowledge are effectively only Proxy Indicators of Impact. However, if some of the extra food produced is consumed by the farmer and his fa mily, this utilization represents a real food security and nutritional benefit, or livelihoods impact. Alternativel y, if increased income derived from crop sales allows for livelihoods investme nts in health, education, food and food production, or income generation; these expend itures would represent a real impact on the lives of the project participants. Most project M&E systems measure the process or delivery of i nputs and activities as opposed to the real impact of the project on people's liv elihoods. Not that measur ing process is any less Process indicators measure the implementation of the project activities. These indicators are usually quantitative e.g. 'number of government staff trained' is a process indicator which might be reported as '15 agricultural extension officers trained'. Impact indicators look at the end result of project activities on people's lives. Ideally, they measure the fundamental assets, resources and feelings of people affected by the project. Therefore, impact indicators can include household measures of income and expenditure, food consumption, health, security, confidence and hope. 21important than measuring impact; process monitori ng data is a valuable step in determining how impact relates to a specific project activity. For example if a food security project introduces high yielding crop varieties into a community and an impact assessment shows an overall improvement in food security, the process monitoring reports s hould tell us whether the improved seed varieties were indeed delivered and planted. In addition to measuring process indicators, some M&E systems do measure livelihoods asset transfers and proxy indicators of impact. For example, knowledge transfers from a farmer training might be measured by testing the pa rticipants to see if they have learned the techniques that had been taught. Alternatively the project that in troduced high yielding crop varieties might measure crop yields as a proxy for impact, assuming that in creased production automati cally translates into improved household food security. If the project was implemented in an insecure area, it is possible that the harvested crops ne ver made it to the granary of the intended recipient, or that it was looted by militias shortly after the harvest. In some cases the transfer of project derived assets can and do actually put people at risk, resulting in a negative impact. Alternatively the farmer may have immediately sold his crops to pay taxes, loans, or debts, or to pay for school fees or medical expenses. In other words the food wasn't consumed in the household, and the project may not have provided the food security benef its anticipated under the projec t objectives. The project may well have had other impacts, possibly even more import ant than the food security benefits anticipated, but these would not be captured using the pr oxy indicator of improved yields. Although proxy indicators of impact can be useful, and easy to quantify, they do not always provide a useful benchmark for measuring impact, as they do not go far enough in investiga ting the utilization of project asset transfers, or the actual changes to people's lives brought abou t by these transfers. Therefore, when identifying impact indicators it is useful to thi nk about what livelihoods transfers are expected from the project in question. Howeve r, once you have identified these assets, it is useful to think about them in terms of utilization. In other words, how will the project participants use the knowledge, food, income and so on derived from the project, how will these assets help them, and what difference will this make to their lives? COMMUNITY DEFINED INDICATORS OF PROJECT IMPACT As far as possible, a PIA should use impact indi cators which are identif ied by the community or intended project participants. Communities have their own priorities for improving their lives, and their own ways of identifying impact indicators and measuring change. Ofte ntimes these priorities and indicators are different from those identified by external act ors. Traditional M&E systems tend to over emphasize 'our indicators' not 'their indicators'. For exam ple, selected drought response projects in Zimbabwe and Niger aimed to meas ure project impact against specific household food security indicators, such as increased crop production, and dietary dive rsity. When project participants were asked to identify their own benchmarks of project impact, these included the following indicators. \u0083 The ability to pay for school fees using pr oject derived income (education benefits) \u0083 The ability to make home improvements \u0083 Improved skills and knowledge from the projects training activities \u0083 Improved social cohesion \u0083 Time saving benefits provided by the project 22One way of collecting community indicators of impact is simply to ask project participants what changes in their lives they expect to occur as a direct result of the project. Or in the case where the project has already been implemented you can as k what changes have already occurred. This should be done separately for each project activity that you plan to asses. If the project has a technical focus, for example natural resource mana gement, the provision of agricultural inputs or livestock, ask the participants how they benefit from the ownership or use of the resources in question. Alternatively if the proj ect focuses on training or skill tr ansfers, ask how the training or improved skills will benefit them. These benefits are impact indicators. FIGURE : 3.1 LIVESTOCK BENEFITS INDICATORS Source: Catley, 1999 One challenge that you may come across when collec ting community indicators is that participants will assume you automatically know what livelihoods benefits will be derived from project activities or inputs. For example participants in a re-stocking interventi on may tell you that they now have more goats as a result of the project. An increase in livestock would be a good community indicator of impact, however this alone doesn't tell you how the goats will benefit that person or their household. When collecting these ki nds of indicators it is important to follow up with additional questions. It may be that the actual benefit derived from the goats is an increase in milk production which 'we feed to our children'. From this you can deduce that increased milk production, or increased household milk consumption are better indicators of impact than simply an increase in the number of livestock assets 1. These indicators can easily be represented 1 If the impact assessment takes place before the desired project impact is expected, you may have no choice but to use proxy indicators such as an increase in the number of livestock. Although not ideal, at least if these have been identified by project participants, they can to some extent be validated as community indicators. Example: Benefits derived from Livestock, Dinka Rek Communities Community Animal Health Project , Tonj County Southern Sudan 1999 Method: standardized proportional piling with 10 community Some of these benefits can be used as impact monitoring indicators; For example an increase in milk production, consumption, or an increase in the number of marriages may be good indicators of improved livestock health that might be attributed to the project 34% 6% 25%3%9%10%3%7%2% 1%milk hides/skins ceremonies 23numerically. You can then go a step further and ask how milk is beneficial to their children, and the participant might mention the health and nutritional benefits that milk provides. Ultimately the best indicator of impact in this case may be an improvement in children's health. Alternatively the participants may have gotten income from the sale of the goats or goat products. If this is the case you will want to ask how they used this extra income. Expenditures on food, education, clothes, medicine, ceremonies, and investments in livest ock, agricultural inputs, or income generating activities are all good livelihoods indicators of impact that can be easily measured. Again, investigating how livestock, livestock products, and the income earned from these are utilized can be a useful way of unpacking and iden tifying livelihoods impact indicators. Example: A restocking project where projec t participants receive sheep and goats: How do you benefit from goats? \u0083 \"I feed the milk to our children\" \u0083 \"I sell the offspring, we use the money for food\" \u0083 \"I now have more status in the community\" \u0083 \"I can now join the local saving and credit group\" When identifying the impact indicators try to be specific not general. For example, \"The goats give me milk\" is not very specific. A better and more specific indicator is \"The children drink the goats milk\" or \"I use the income from sell ing milk to pay school fees \". Similarly, the indicator \"I have more status in the community\" is not very specific. A better indicator might be \"I can now join the local savings and credit group in the village\". When collecting community indicato rs, it is important to capture the views of different groups of people within the community. Women will often ha ve different priorities and expectations of project impact than men. The same might a pply to different groups. For example Fulani pastoralists are likely to attach greater importanc e to the livestock health benefits from a project well than their Haussa neighbors in the same community, whose livelih oods practices focus on agricultural production. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INDICATORS Community impact indicators may be quantitative , such as income earned from crop sales, or qualitative, such as improved skills, knowledge or social status . People often believe that impact is difficult to capture because it is qualitative. Ho wever, any opinion, perception or feeling can be expressed numerically using par ticipatory ranking or scoring me thods. Having said this, it is important to apply these methods systemati cally and repetition im proves reliability. These are all impact indicators 24 If the community or participants produce many impact indicators, ask the participants to prioritize the indicators using ranking . It is important not to have to o many indicators, as with the key assessment questions, it is better to have a few good indicators, try to limit the number of indicators to no more than five per project activity being assessed. CHANGES IN LIVELIHOODS STRATEGIES Often times during a humanitarian crisis, people will employ a variety of economic or livelihoods strategies to cope with the e ffects of a particular shock such as a drought. These strategies, sometimes called coping mechanisms are often good indicators by which to measure change or impact. For example during a drought people may sell mo st of their livestock (usually at a reduced price) in order to purchase food and cover other priority expenses. Once the situation has improved and people move into a recovery period, they will often restock by re-investi ng in livestock assets. By capturing these changes you can determine wh ether the situation has improved and to what extent the project played a role in facilitating this change. To identify these coping strategies, simply ask people what they did during the pe riod leading up to and during the crisis. Table 3.1 Example of Common Livelihood Coping Strategies Coping Mechanisms 1 De stocking to save remaining livestock and purchase grain (early stages of drought) 2 Stress sale of livestock at reduced prices in order to purchase grain (later stages of drought) 3 Sale of household assets (including roofing, doors, windows, and cooking utensils) in order to purchase grain. 4 Migrate to other areas in search of better pasture for livestock 5 Increase vegetable production for consumption and sale. 6 Migration of young men to urban areas as well as to other countries in search of employment 7 Expand on informal income generating activities such as mat weaving, brick making, firewood collection 8 Increase production/collection and consumption of wild foods 9 Reduce the number of meals consumed (even down to one meal a day). 10 Engage in agricultural work in neighboring communities less affected by the drought, or for wealthier farmers. 11 Participate in food for work projects or public safety net program 12 Permanently migrate to urban areas and give up agropastoralist livelihoods practices For most livelihoods projects, community indicators of project impact will often relate to changes or improvements in income, food security, health a nd education. Impact agains t these indicators as well as changes in coping strategi es can often be broadly captured by looking at changes in income and food sources, as well as household expenditure. For example, using the strategies from the table above; in comparison to a normal year, after a poor cereal harvest, one might expect a greater portion of household food to come from wild foods (strategy #8) re lative to cereals. One might also expect a greater por tion of income to come from the sale of household assets (strategy # 3) relative to other income sources during this period. In terms of household expenditure, after a poor harvest you might expect a greater proportion of household income to be spent on food to \u0083 Examples of quantitative impact indicators: (Increased Milk consumption by children, Income from crop sales) \u0083 Examples of qualitative impact indicators: (Trust Confidence Hope, Status Participation, Security, Dignity, Social Cohesion, wellbeing) 25compensate for the decline in farm producti on. During a 'recovery' period following a drought, one might expect households to spend more of thei r income on livestock asse ts, as they re-stock after suffering livestock losses due to death or stress sales. Th erefore tracking changes in food, income and expenditure can often be a useful way of measuring impact against community indicators of impact and against coping strate gies. Many livelihoods proj ects also have food security, income generating, or livelihoods divers ification objectives and again food, income and expenditure changes can be a useful way to measure change against these objectives. It needs to be emphasized that an understanding of the context is essent ial to deriving meaning from these indicators, as livelihoods and coping stra tegies will vary depend ing on the kind of crisis being experienced. They will also change over ti me and between different communities. Simply measuring changes in livelihoods impact indicato rs will not tell you much about impact unless you understand the reasons behind those ch anges. Therefore, it is impor tant to understand the context, and the reasons behind any changes in liveli hoods strategies or im pact indicators. An understanding of livelihoods and co ntext is an important part of any impact assessment. STAGE FOUR: METHODS This section provides real life, and hypothetical examples of how different methods have, or might be used to measure project impact on livelihoods. The exact tools used in these examples may or may not be transferable to other projects or assessments. However, they should provide an overview of how participatory tools can be adapte d and applied in different contexts to measure the impact of different types of projects. For additional resource material s on participatory tools and methods see Annex 1. Once you have identified your impact indicators , you will need to decide which methods should be used to measure changes in these indicators. Some useful methods which can be used to measure impact or change numerically include, proportional piling, \"before and after\" scoring, simple ranking, matrix sc oring, and radar diagrams. All these methods involve the use of semi- structured interviews as part of the method. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and some methods are more appropriate for certain cultu res and contexts. It is important to field test your methods with community members before the assessment. \u00a9 Abebe 2007 \u00a9 Burns 2007 26RANKING AND SCORING METHODS Ranking and scoring methods require informants to assess the relative importance of different items. Ranking usually involves placing items in order of importance (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.) whereas scoring methods assign a value or a score to a specific item. This is usually done by using counters such as seeds or stones, nuts or beans to attribute a specific score to each item or indicator. Proportional piling and scoring techniqu es can be used to assess the relationship between two or more given variables; these ma y include indicators of project impact. For proportional piling informants are asked to dist ribute one hundred counters amongst the different variables or indicators, with th e largest number of counters being assigned to the most important indicator, and the smallest number of counters be ing assigned to the leas t important indicator. FIGURE 4.1: WORKSHOP EVALUATION SCORING SHEET The table on the right is a photograph of an evaluation form filled out by a participant at an impact assessment training workshop. It provides an example of how a simple scoring exercise was used to assess the effectiveness of the training against the workshop objectives and other indicators identified by participants and facilitators during the workshop. Participants were asked to assign a score to each indicator on a scale of 15, with five being the most important, and one being the least. Impact assessment scoring methods essentially follow the same principles applied in this example. 27If a food security project were to establish a community nutrition garden, you may want to measure the impact of the project garden on household food security using a simple scoring exercise. This could be done by asking project participants to identify all the food sources that contribute to the household food basket. Using visual aids to represent each of th e different food sources, you would then ask the participants to dist ribute the counters amongst the differe nt variables to illustrate the relative proportion of household f ood derived from each food source. FIGURE 4.2: EXAMPLE - SCORING OF FOOD SOURCES Cereal Crops Project Garden Livestock Poultry Fishing Wild Foods Purchased Food Aid The results from this hypothetical example indicate that ten percen t of household food comes from the community garden (figure 4.2). Assuming that this particular food source (community garden) was introduced by the project it repres ents a new food source and the ten percent contribution to the food basket represents an impact on house hold food security that can be dir ectly attributed to the project. - Although using a hundred counters makes it easier to automatically assign a percentage score to the results of scoring exercises, it's not essential that you use this many, and often it is quicker to use fewer counters when carrying out repetitive scoring exercises. As a general rule, if you are comparing many indicators, you will need more counters, if you are only comparing two variables, ten counters may be sufficient. 30% 10% 13% 7%10%10%17%3% Cereal Crops Project Garden Livestock Poultry Fishing Wild Foods Purchased Food Aid 28 The use of visual aids and indicator cards in PIA Where several different indicators are being compared it is useful to use visual aids, such as the picture cards illustrated in the example above. Alternatively local materials can be used to represent each indicator. For example a head of sorghum might represent rainfed production, a broad green leaf might represent vegetable production, and a feather might be used to represent poultry production. Where informants are literate you may choose to simply write the name of the indicator on a card. The use of these aids helps to avoid piles of counters being assigned to the wrong indicator. Where indicators have already been identified prior to the assessment, it is useful to preprepare indicator cards beforehand, particularly when using picture cards. It is also important to use strong pieces of card that will not get damaged in the field. 29BEFORE AND AFTER SCORING \"Before and after\" tools are an ad aption of scoring methods which enab le a situation before a project to be compared with a situation dur ing or after a project. Definitions of \"before,\" \"afte r\" or \"during\" can be obtained from time-lines which provide a us eful reference for establishing agreement between the investigator and assessment participants on these different points in time. With \"before\" and \"after\" scoring, rather than simply scoring items agai nst indicators, each score is further subdivided to give a score \"before\" the project and a score \"now\" or \"after\" the project. This kind of tool is particularly useful in measuri ng impact where project baseline data is weak or non-existent. FIGURE 4.2.1 EXAMPLE - \"BEFORE \" AND \"AFTER\" SCORING OF FOOD SOURCES Food Source (indicator) Counters (score) Rainfed Production BEFORE AFTER Project Garden BEFORE AFTER Livestock Production BEFORE AFTER Poultry BEFORE AFTER Fishing BEFORE AFTER Wild Food Collection BEFORE AFTER Purchases BEFORE AFTER Food Aid BEFORE AFTER Interpreting the results Although \"before\" and \"after\" scoring exercises can be useful for recording change, these changes may have occurred for any number of reasons. For example, the results shown in figure 4.2.1 might be explained as follows: In terms of impact, the results indicate that food produced in the project garden provides a ten percent contribution to the household food basket. They also illustrate that the project has provided people with a new source of food, represented by the zero contribution from the project garden before the project started. The relative reduction in the contributions of rainfed crops, wild foods, and relief aid may be partly attributed to the fact that these contributions have been offset by production from the project garden, and therefore represent a reduced dependency on these food sources. Increased wild food consumption is often cited as a food security coping mechanism, and so a reduced dependency on this food source, as well as on food aid may also represent a positive impact on food security. However, it is also possible that a reduction in food aid may have been due to supply issues, and the reduction in rainfed crops and wild foods may have been the result of inadequate rainfall and a poor harvest. In this case Steps 1. Using the hypothetical example of the project garden; ask the participants to distribute the counters to represent their food source contributions before the project started. 2. Once they are happy with the distribution of the counters, record the results. 3. Then ask them to repeat the exercise for the current or \"after\" situation. 4. If you observe any changes in the scores (food contributions) from \"before\" and \"after\" - ask the participants to explain the reasons for these differences, and record the explanations. 30production from the project garden may have helped people to cope with the bad harvest, and project impact would be framed more in terms of improving people's resiliency to food shocks, rather than an improvement in food security. Consistent with this, the results do not show an overall increase in food, or even an improvement in food security, only the relative change in the contributions of the different food sources. The increase in the food contribution from poultry production may be due to the fact that the respondent was able to invest in hens using income from the sale of crops produced in the project garden. This livelihoods investment would represent a project impact, and the increase in the contribution from this source is a useful indicator of this impact. Alternatively, the income to invest in poultry may be attributed to project savings as opposed to direct project derived income. It's possible that before the project, people would have to purchase some of the food they now produce in the project garden. This saving may account for the results showing a relative reduction in the amount of household food now being purchased. While all or none of these interpretations may be true, there is no way of knowing unless you ask the informants to explain the changes observed. Although participatory scoring methods are a useful way of collecting numerical data on project impact, on their own, the numbers produced from these exercises can be fairly meaningless without the reasoning to explain them. Therefore, it is essential that these exercises are conducted as part of a semi structured interview process, and not done in isolation. FIGURE 4.2.2 EXAMPLE OF A \"BEFORE \" AND \"AFTER\" SCORING OF FOOD BASKET CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DIFFERENT CROPS (N=145) Source: Burns and Suji 2007 The scoring exercises in the prev ious examples essentially measur e relative as opposed to actual changes in the indicators being assessed. For exampl e, if the contribution to household income from one income source were to increase over a period of time, this increase is only relative to contributions from the other income sources. For example, let's say that a farmer in Zimbabwe earns a hundred percent of his income from selling co tton, and in a typical year he can expect to earn the equivalent of 31$ US 900 from cotton sales. However, a fairly su dden decrease in the domestic and international demand for cotton brings down the price, and this year the farmer can only expect to earn the equivalent of $ US 500 from cotton sales. During the same period, an international NGO started implementing a project in the area promoting crops such as soya and sweet potato with the objective of promoting household food security. The cotton farmer had participated in the training, and had received seeds and planting materials and had manage d to produce a surplus which he sold locally for the equivalent of $ US 400. The percentage of hi s income earned from other sources (soya and sweet potatoes) went from zero to almost forty five perc ent, and the percentage income earned from cotton almost halved, his actual income remained the same at $ US 900. Similarly if cotton prices had remained stable, and he had participated in the pr oject and had earned $ US 900 from cotton sales and $ US 400 from soya and sweet potato sales, a scor ing exercise would roughly show a thirty percent reduction in the contribution of co tton to his overall income, this does not represent a thirty percent reduction in income earned from cotton, as his overal l income actually increased by forty five percent. The point being that these types of \"before\" and \"a fter\" scoring exercises onl y show the relationship between different variables, and impact is measured in terms of the relative changes in the importance of these indicators in relationship to each other, not quant ified in exact metric or monetary units. Having said this, it is possible to estimate an actual (comparative) percentage increase or decrease against certain indicators using participatory scoring tools. The following example shows how \"before' and \"after\" proportional piling was used to measure changes in cattle disease during a community based animal health project in South Sudan. Proportional piling was done with 6 groups of informants and the results were compiled. Th e \"before\" project situation, was described first by dividing 100 stones according to the main cattle diseases at the time. The informants were then asked to increase or decrease or leav e the hundred stones accordi ng to the \"after\" project situation. The areas of the two pie charts are proportional. FIGURE 4.2.3: EXAMPLE \"BEFORE \" AND \"AFTER\" SCORING OF LIVESTOCK DISEASES Source: Catley 1999 \"Before\" and \"After\" cattle diseases in Ganyiel, Before Now Gieng Liei Rut Doop Dat Duny Yieth Ping 32 FIGURE IMPACT SCORING OF MILK PRODUCTION Awet - Rinderpest Daat - Foot and mouth disease and foot rot Guak - Probably fascioliascis Joknhial - Anthrax Abuot - Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia Ngany - Internal parasites Liei - Disease characterized by weight loss , includes trypanosomiasis & fascioliascis Makieu - behaves abnormally and cries Source: Catley 1999 This example illustrates how proportional piling was used to compare milk production in healthy cattle as opposed to those suffering from different types of cattle disease. The black dots represent the piles of counters. A hundred counters (in the center of the diagram) were used to represent milk production from healthy cattle. The smaller piles on the periphery represent milk production in infected livestock. 33SCORING AGAINST A NOMINAL BASELINE Another way of capturing actual (comparative) as opposed to just relative change is by using a nominal baseline to represent a quantity of a given indicator at a certain point in time. The following example describes how this method was used to assess changes in income during an impact assessment of a project which was designed to achieve household income benefits. Table 4.1 Measuring impact against a nominal baseline Scoring against a nominal baseline can be useful in estimating changes in certain indicators such as income, livestock numbers, and crop yields. In many cases, people will be unwilling to reveal certain types of information, and this method does not require exact income, or herd sizes to be quantified. Therefore, sensitive questions like 'how much money did you make ', or 'how many cattle do you own' are not necessary. FIGURE 4.2.5: SCORING CHANGES IN CROP YIELDS AGAINST A NOMINAL BASELINE Data derived by scoring with 20 counters against a nominal baseline of 10 counters. (Source, Burns and Suji, 2007) 024681012141618Mean ScoreProduction Changes in Existing Crops Nemangwe (n=145) 2005 2007Example: Project participants were asked to show if there had been any increase or decrease in actual income since the project started. This was done by placing ten counters in one basket which represented their income before the project. The participants were then given another ten counters and asked to show any relative changes in household income, by either adding counters to the original basket of ten, or removing them. For example if someone were to add four counters to the original basket this would represent a forty percent increase in income. Alternatively if they were to remove four counters it would represent a forty percent decrease in income. The participants were then asked to account for these changes. The table below shows the aggregated results indicating between 15% to 16% average increase in income in the two project communities. Location Variable Mean Score (increase) 95% CI Njelele (n=117) Changes in HH Income 16.3 (15.9, 16.8) Nemangwe (n=145) Changes in HH Income 15 (14.3, 15.7) Data derived by scoring a total of 20 counters against a given baseline of 10 counters. (Source, Burns and Suji, 2007) The chart shows the results from an exercise that estimated changes in crop yields against a nominal baseline. The project had been promoting production of groundnuts, sweet potatoes, and drought resistant varieties of maize. 34 SIMPLE RANKING As implied, simple ranking involves asking participan ts to categorize or grade items in order of importance. This can be a useful way of prioritiz ing the impact indicators you wish to use in an assessment, or to get an understand ing of which project benefits, or project activities are perceived to be of greatest importance to the community members. Table 4.2: Overall project benefit s by focus group participants Benefit Ranking in order of Importance (n=16) Better farming skills 1st More food (fewer hunger months) 2nd Increased variety of food/dietary diversity (improved nutrition) 3rd Improved health 4th Increased income from sale of food 5th Data derived using the summary of ranks from 16 focus group discussions. The original data was collected using simple ranking (Source, Burns and Suji, 2007) Table 4.3 Ranking of livestock assets Ranking of Community Livestock Assets Women Men Cattle 1st Cattle 1st Sheep 2nd Goats 2nd Goats 3rd Sheep 3rd Camels 4th Camels 4th Donkeys 5th Donkeys 5th Horses 6th Horses 6th (Source: Burns, 2006) It is also possible to pr ioritize indicators by getting people to vote using a ballot sc oring exercise. For an impact assessment of a food secu rity project in Zimbab we, indicators were prioritized by asking participants to vote using a secret ballot. After a discussion about all the pot ential impact indicators that applied to the project, participants then wr ote down what they perceived to be the single most important indicator of project impact. These were then collected and tallied and disaggregated by gender. Needless to say this method would need to be adapted in non- literate communities. It is possible that other voting me thods could be applied to impact m easurement. In many ways project impact assessment is no different to a consumer su rvey or a polling exercise. Simple voting exercises include getting people to stand in lin es or groups representing different indicators, or getting them to raise their hands in response to a specific question comparing two vari ables. These kinds of exercises lend themselves to focus group discussions, howev er, public voting can be problematic, as peer pressure may influence the vote, or the views of mi nority groups or less powe rful individuals in the community may not come through. Nevertheless there is scope for experimentati on with these kinds of exercises particularly where th e objective is to capture a quick vote on a non-sensitive issue. In this example pastoralists were asked what benefits they derived from different livestock. They were then asked to rank them in terms of the overall benefits they provided. The exercise was done with both women and men's groups to ensure that any gendered differences were captured. In this example the only variation was that women ranked sheep higher than goats as they fetched a higher market price. The men valued goats slightly higher than sheep as they are more resilient to drought. 35PAIRWISE RANKING AND MATRIX SCORING Matrix scoring is a useful method in PIA. Primar ily it is used to identify and prioritize impact indicators, and as a method for a ttributing impact to a project or a given project activity. Matrix ranking or scoring is essentially us ed to compare several items agains t a set of different indicators. Matrix scoring involves three main stages - a pai r-wise comparison followed by the scoring of items, and finally 'interviewing the matrix'. EXAMPLE OF A RANKING AND MATRIX SCORING OF FOOD SOURCE PREFERENCES The following example describes how a pair-wise ra nking and matrix scoring exercise was used to assess food source preferences during an assessment visit to an integr ated livelihoods project in Niger. The project had several component s -these included re-stocki ng of small ruminants and the establishment of cereal banks, and vegetable gardens. They were asked to individually compare or rank each food source against each of the other food sources in terms of overall preference. The participants were asked to give reasons for their preferences. The name of the food source that ranked highest was then entered into the appropriate cell in the pairwise matrix (Table 4.4) Table 4.4 Pair-wise ranking s howing food source preferences Food Source Millet Vegetables Purchases Cereal Bank Livestock Millet (own production) Millet Millet Millet Millet Vegetables (own production) Vegetables Vegetables Vegetables Purchases Cereal Bank Purchases Cereal Bank Cereal Bank Livestock Data collected from a pair wise ranking ex ercise with focus group participants duri ng a field testing visit (Source: Burns, 200 7) An overall preference score is then calculated by counting the number of times each food source was ranked highest and thus recorded in the matrix: Score: Rainfed cereal production: 4 Vegetable production: 3 Cereal Banks: 2 Purchase: 1 Livestock: 0 However, the objective of this exercise was not just to assign a rank or score to each of the food sources, but to identify indicators by which the food source could be scored against. These indicators were largely derived from the following reasons that were given for assigning a higher rank or preference to one food source over another: During a focus group discussion participants identified their existing food sources as follows: Own farm production (millet) Vegetable production Purchased food (excluding cereal bank) Livestock production (milk and meat) Cereal bank (millet) purchases \u00a9 Kadede 2007 36Table 4.5 Reasons given for food source preferences 1 Millet vs. Vegetables We prefer millet, as vegetables require allot of water, which is hard to come by in this area, making vegetables difficult to grow. 2 Millet vs. Purchase Millet is easier to come by, in that we can grow it, and it is cheaper as we don't have to pay for it. 3 Millet vs. Cereal bank We don't pay for the millet we grow; therefore it's cheaper than the cereal bank millet. 4 Millet vs. Milk It's easier to sell millet than milk 5 Vegetables vs. Purchase If we get a good harvest we can earn good income from selling the vegetables. 6 Vegetables vs. Cereal banks Vegetables are cheaper 7 Vegetables vs. Milk: Vegetables are easier to sell than milk, and are therefore better at generating income for the poor. 8 Cereal bank vs. Purchase Cereal banks are cheapest (Source, Burns 2007) From these discussions it transpired that the overall preference for millet from own production was largely attributed to the volume or quantity of food that is produced from this source. The assessment team also asked participants what sources provided the most nutritious or healthy foods as opposed to just the largest quantities. Based on the discussion during and after the exercise, the assessors and participants agreed on four broad categories of food preference indicators: 1. Availability (quantity/volume) 2. Accessibility (easy to come by/grow/cheap) 2. Income earning or savings potential. 4. Nutritional /health value Participants were then asked to score the five food sources against each of the four food preference indicators identified. This was done using visual aids to represent each food source. A millet stem was used to represent rainfed millet production, a broad green leaf was used to represent vegetable production, a handful of coins was used to represent food purchases (excluding cereal bank purchases) , a bottle top was used to represent livestock production (milk and meat), and small bag of groundnuts was used to represent cereal bank purchases. After carefully explaining what each visual aid symbolized, the assessors asked the participants to score each of the food sources against the first food preference indicator using fifty counters. The exercise was then repeated for each of the other three food preference indicators. The physical distribution of counters was done by one volunteer, but this was based on group consensus. 37 Table 4.6 Matrix scoring of different food sources against indicators of preference Millet Vegetables Purchases Cereal Bank Livestock Availability (Quantity/Volume) 15 12 5 13 5 Access (Easy to come by) 22 8 3 13 4 Income earning and savings potential 12 13 0 8 17 Nutritional Value 6 17 6 6 15 Total 55 50 14 40 41 Data derived from a matrix scoring exerci se using 50 counters, collected during fo cus group discussions (Source: Burns, 2007) Note Although livestock ranked lowest on the food source preferences during the pairwise ranking exercise, against specific indicators such us income potential and nutritional value, it ranks much higher than some of the other food sources.

Project participants were given twenty five counters representing a households' post harvest food balance. Using twelve cards representing each month of the year, participants were asked to distribute the counters along a twelve month calendar to show the monthly household utilization of the harvested maize up until depletion. This exercise was done with project participants for the agricultural year before the project started, and again for the agricultural year after the project had started. The exercise was then repeated with community members who had not participated in the project. 39 MEASURING PARTICIPATION Source: Rifkin, S.B., Muller, F. and Bichmann, W. (1988).

This is a good illustration of how a qualitative indicator such as participation can easily be measured. In this example levels of participation are measured against five components of the project cycle. This would be done by asking participants to gauge their own level of participation in each of the activities identified on a scale of 05 each level being represented by the spokes on the radar diagram. The results show increasing levels of participation over time. Resourc e m obilis ation Management Needs Assessments LeadershipOrganisation Year 5 Year 3 Year 1 40 TIME SAVINGS BENEFITS Time saved as a result of a project, or project ac tivity is often cited as a key community impact indicator or project benefit. In the following example from a dam rehabilitation project, participants suggested that the time saved on domestic water collec tion was an important proj ect benefit. Using the same concept as \"before\" and \"afte r\" scoring but without the counters, and using minutes as a standard unit of measurement, project participants were simply asked how much time they spent each day collecting water before the construction of the dam, and how much time they spent on this activity now. The responses were recorded, and the rada r diagram below (figure 4.5) provides a visual illustration of the results from eight respondents.

FIGURE 4.6 SCORING UTILIZATION OF MILK Source: Burns et al 2008 Consumed 50% Sold 30%Given Away 20%Milk Utilization from Restocking Fadama Village 30%Milk Utilization from Restocking Marafa VillageThese charts show the results of a proportional piling exercise which was done during the assessment of a re stocking project in Niger. One of the project benefits identified by participants was an increase in milk production. Participants identified three different ways in which the milk was being utilized. They were then asked to distribute ten counters amongst the three categories to illustrate what portion of the milk was utilized in each way. The ways in which the milk is being utilized implies a nutritional benefit (consumed), an income benefit (sold) and a social benefit (given away). These are all project impacts. 42 The following example is from an impact assessment of a drought mitigation de-stocking intervention which was carried out in a pastoral ist region of Ethiopia. The results are derived from the systematic application of a scoring exercise, and show the utilization of inco me derived from the de-stocking across 114 participating households. FIGURE 4.7: SCORING INCOME UTILIZATION Proportion (%) use of income derived from a commercial de-stocking (n=114) Source: Abebe et al 2008 The results show that a significant portion of th e income was spent on human and animal food, and transporting livestock. Effectively the income earned fr om this de-stocking intervention allowed people to purchase animal feed and transport some of their re maining livestock to better grazing areas. The income also allowed them to purchase food for human consum ption offsetting the food from livestock production that would have been lost during th e drought. Expenditures on feed and li vestock transport helped preserve people's livestock asset base, prot ecting their livelihoods and helping them recover from the drought.

Broadly speaking, there are three types of sampling method which ca n be used for a participatory impact assessment: 1. Convenience Sampling (go to easily accessible villages) 2. Purposive Sampling (go to \"typical\" villages - \"typical\" of the project area) 3. Random sampling (put all the names of the project villa ges in a hat and pick out the number you plan to assess) Although random sampling is considered to be th e most scientific, and convenience sampling the least, each method has its strengt hs and weaknesses. For example, convenience sampling may save time, but all the selected villages being easily accessible may not be representative of the greater project area (road side bias). A lternatively random sampling may give more truthful results, but it can be costly and time consuming. And with purpos ive sampling, there may be a tendency to go to villages where you think your project worked well, a nd where the results will s how an impact that is not representative of other villages in the project area. One way of minimi zing this tendency is to deliberately select equal numbers of good, bad and medium villages. Although, there is no right or wrong answer on sa mpling method, you do need to consider the end users of the assessment findings. If you wish to influence policy, or publish the findings in an academic journal, then it's important to use random sampling if you want the results to be accepted. If the results are for internal use only, then random sampling is probably not necessary. Although it is not essential to use a random sample, and often it isn't practical, if you wish to extrapolate the results to make decisions that will apply to the entire project area, you need to use a random sample. For example, if you implement a project in 50 villa ges, and you plan on as sessing only 10 villages, you would have to randomly select the 10 villages . The only other option would be to asses all 50 villages. If on the other hand you decided to purpo sively select 10 villages, there is nothing wrong with this, although the results woul d only be applicable to the vill ages assessed and could not be extrapolated to the othe r 40 project villages. Similarly there is no correct answer on the actual sample size. For mo st project impact assessments, the important thing is to capture th e overall trend, and this can usua lly be done with a smaller sample size. As long as it is done systema tically it can be representative. Nevertheless, there are a number of factors that need to be taken into consideration. Your sample size will depend on the type and number of questions you are trying to answer, and the number and type of assessment tools and attrib ution methods needed to answer th ese questions (see next section). For example, if you decide to use control groups for attribution, you may be able to get a greater level of evidence with a smaller sample, even though a control group immediately doubles the size of your sampling frame. Again some tools, such as \"pair-wise\" and \"matrix\" ranking are extremely time consuming, and will be more suitable for fo cus group discussions. To use these tools for household interviews would imply reduci ng your sample size considerably. 44 You may also need to stratify your sample in order to capture the views of di fferent groups within a project area, or if you want to disaggregate the data by gender or wealth group. When designing your assessment it is important to consider that , for every sub category you wish to stratify you effectively have to double your sample size in order to make each sample representative. Similarly, if a project involves different activitie s, targeting different people, you effectively need an independent sample for each activity. FIGURE 5.1: EVIDENCE HIERARCHY A hierarchy of evidence for the assessm ent of emergency livestock projects On the hierarchy of evidence di agram developed for emergency liv estock projects (figure 5.1), most PIA's should aim to fall in between the second and third highest levels in terms of evidence. The highest level on the scale would no t apply to a PIA, as a blind approach could not be reconciled with the principle of par ticipation. The second highe st level can and has been used for PIA, although it tends to be less participatory, and in a hum anitarian context, the practical and ethical implications of using a control group would generally exclude this option (see next section). Table 5.1 shows some sampling options that have been used to carry out A preferred option for some clinical research trials; can be blind or double-blind.

Mostly these have used purposive sampling, although in some cases random sampling has been used for village selection, participant selection, or both. Table 5.1: Sampling options for impact assessment Type of sampling Description Examples of assessments using this approach fully, or in part Random (probability sampling) \u0083 Based on the principle that any lo cation or informant has an equal chance of being selected relative to any other location or informant \u0083 Generally viewed as the most representative type of sampling and therefore, the most rigorous \u0083 Allows results from the sample to be extrapolated to the wider project area \u0083 Can be used in humanitarian contexts when lists of targeted households are available, and wh en all selected locations or households are accessible \u0083 Sample size(s) are determined us ing mathematical formulae which include the level of statistical confidence (error) required and estimates of the amount of change expected in the population in question \u0083 Tends to be less participatory than other approaches \u0083 Randomization can miss key informants i.e. individuals who have particular knowledge about an area or project \u0083 Commercial de-stocking, Ethiopia (Abebe et al, 2008) \u0083 Restocking, Kenya (Lotira, 2004) Purposive (non- probability sampling) \u0083 Uses the judgment of community representatives, project staff or the assessors to select representa tive locations and/or informants \u0083 Useful if no sampling frame is available \u0083 Results cannot be extrapolated to a wider area \u0083 Moderately rigorous if conducted well, and clear criteria for sampling are described and followed \u0083 Can include a comparison of impacts in areas judged to be 'weak', 'moderate' or 'strong' in terms of implementation \u0083 Can be participatory if community members are involved in selected assessment site and informants \u0083 Subject to bias, particularly bias towards more successful project areas or households \u0083 Gokwe Recovery Action, Zimbabwe (Burns & Suji, 2007) \u0083 Chical Recovery Action, Niger, (Burns & Suji, 2007) \u0083 Pastoralist Survival and Recovery, Niger, (Burns et al, 2008) \u0083 Veterinary services, Ethiopia (Admassu et al., 2005 ) \u0083 Feed supplementation (Bekele and Abera, 2008) Convenience (non- probability sampling) \u0083 Easily accessible locations or informants are sampled \u0083 The least rigorous sampling option and unlikely to be representative, particular ly in larger projects \u0083 Commonly used, especially during wet season with poor road access, or in insecure areas Various - this is commonly used type of sampling in assessments 46GETTING NUMERICAL DATA FROM PARTICIPATORY TOOLS Directly related to the issue of representativeness and sampling is the systematic application of the participatory impact assessment tools. A fundamental principle of the PIA approach proposed here is that the same tool be applied cons istently, using the same indicators, the same number of counters, and framing the questions in exactly the same way. One w eakness of participatory methods is that people often only do it once. If consistently applied, even a limited set of results can show agreement or not, as few as 10-15 repetitions may be enough to get reliabili ty. Needless to say, the more repetitions, or the larger the sample size, the more statis tically reliable the results will be. It is also this process of standa rdizing and repeating the participatory exercises in a systematic way that enables us to derive representative result s from qualitative participatory tools. Even though the data may be subjective, it is systematic and therefore scient ifically rigorous.

Standardize your methods, and repeat the exercise over and over again to improve confidence Develop your methods, standardize and repeat 47STAGE 6: ASSESSING PROJECT ATTRIBUTION In any community or area where a project is im plemented, changes will take place over time. Some of these changes may have nothing to do with the project and would have happened regardless of whether or not the project ever ex isted. Other changes occu r as a result of the project, and these changes can be attributed to the project. The assessment of attribution is an important aspect of project assessment that is often overlooked. For example, an organization implemen ts an agricultural recovery project in a food insecure area affected by peri odic drought and conflic t. After a period of time a survey is carried out and the results show improvements in the food security and nutritional status of the participating community. The assessment conclude s that the project was a success. Is this a correct assumption, or might other factors such as rainfall, seasona lity, or security have been more important in influencing food securi ty and nutrition outcomes? The objective of assessing attribution is to isol ate and contextualize the impact of the project from non project factors. FIGURE 6.1: ATTRIBUTION FACTORS Before Now Project Factors Non Project Factors Improved Seeds Improved Rainfall Provision of Tools Improved Security Provision of Fertilizer Improved Government Extension Services There are two main approaches fo r assessing project attribution: 1. Within a project area, assess the relative importance of project and nonproject factors. 2. Comparison between project and nonproject populations within the project area. The first approach aims to understand all the project and non-project factors which contributed to changes in the impact indicator s identified. These factors should be listed. It also aims to understand the relative importan ce of these project and non-project factors. Methods such as simple ranking a nd scoring, or causal diagrams w ith scoring of causes can be used to measure the relativ e impact of both project a nd non-project factors. 48The second approach to attribution is the classic scientific approach and involves the use of control populations or groups. In this appr oach, the 'treatment' or 'interve ntion' populations are compared with control populations to determ ine statistical differences betw een the two groups, the assumption being that the control group has the same character istics as the intervention population. The use of controls in participatory impact asse ssment might include the following: 1. A comparison of areas where the project in tervention took place against an area where there was no intervention. 2. A comparison of project and non project part icipants within the same community. 3. A comparison of different interventions in the same area. Although a good control can address the problem of a ttribution, there are a num ber of practical and ethical issues involved in using control groups, particularly in the c ontext of a humanitarian intervention. Finding two population groups that share the same char acteristics can be a challenge, and there is a high probability th at the control population receiv es similar interventions from another agency during the same time period. The us e of control groups may also imply doubling or more than doubling the time and resources needed for the assessment. From an ethical perspective, by definition, the use of a control or 'non-projec t' population means that decisions are made to exclude a population from an intervention which ra ises concerns in a humanitarian context. These concerns would also apply to a staggered control whereby the control group will be assisted during a second phase of an intervention, as there is also a temporal dimension to targeting exclusion. The decision to use or not to use a control group w ill ultimately have to be determined by weighing these practical and ethi cal considerations. Table 4.2 provides a summary of some practical and ethi cal concerns of using control groups identified by participants during a participatory impact assessment workshop in Addis Ababa in 2006. The workshop was held as part of a Bill & Melinda Gates funded impact assessment initiative involving six international NGOs. The workshop participants included project staff, program managers and country representatives of the participating NGOs. Table 5.2 Some practical and ethical concerns with using control groups Identification of a control population with similar characteristics Willingness of comparative group to participate openly and honestly -if incentives are given for participation, is this really a true control group? How can you be sure that the control group will not receive assistance from another source? Potential security risk to NGO staff for excluding the control group from the project If a control group is selected from non project participants in the same community, how can you be sure that they do not indirectly benefit from the project? Increased cost and time of including a control group, staff, vehicles* Exclusion of one community goes against the humanitarian imperative and the principles of participation It's unethical to use human placebos in a humanitarian context -good research protocol should not take precedence over the provision of assistance The use of a control group is disrespectful of people's time Raising expectations of the control group - will the information be reliable? The extra resources required to include a control group should be used to assist the excluded community* Using controls could potentially create tensions or even fuel conflict between recipient and nonrecipient communities *This concern may be partly offset by the fact that a good control may mean that you get the same or a greater level of evidence from a smaller sample 49PROJECT AND NON PROJECT FACTORS Due to these practical and ethical concerns, most imp act assessments of humanitarian projects will use the first approach to assessing at tribution by comparing the relati ve importance of project and non project factors. This can be done by prioritizing, ranking, or scoring the different factors that contributed to any positive or negative cha nges that took place in the project area. Figure 6.2 shows (fictitious) results of a scoring exer cise to assess changes in food security following an agricultural recovery project in a post conflict setting. The results show a positive change in food security status, and the participants have li sted the key reasons e ffecting this change. FIGURE 6.2 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF RESULTS FROM AN IMPACT SCORING EXERCISE One way of attributing impact to the project activities would be to ask the participants to rank or score the different contributing factors in orde r of importance. The results may look something like this: Table 6.1 Attribution by Simple Ranking/Scoring Factor Rank Score Improved Rainfall 1st 33 Improved Security 2nd 26 Improved Seeds 3rd 19 Government Extension Services 4th 12 Provision of Fertilizer 5th 8 Provision of Tools 6th 2 The results show that the two most important fact ors contributing towards an improvement in food security in fact had nothing to do with the project. However, they also show that the project had a considerable impact in contributing towards an overall improvement in Food Security. From the scoring exercise you can assign th e project related factors a 29% relative contribution towards improved food security 02468101214161820 Before NowChanges in Food Security StatusReasons Project Factors Improved Seeds Provision of Tools Provision of Fertilizer Non Project Factors Improved Rainfall Improved Security Government Extension Services (resumed) 50Example: Attribution using simple ranking A PIA of an animal health project visits 10/30 locations with a project animal health worker Scoring in each location indicates improved animal health during the project period Simple ranking was used to understand the factors contributing to this change Table 6.2 Ranking of project and non pr oject factors - animal health project Factor Median Rank Increase usage of modern veterinary drugs due to attitudinal change of the community for modern veterinary medicine Biannual vaccination for communicable disease by Community Animal Health Workers Good rain and better availability of pasture (during 2002) Reduced herd mobility and herd mixing due to increasing settlement 1st 2nd 3rd 4th N=10 informant groups; there was a high level of agreement between the groups (W=0.75; p<0.001). Source: Admassu et al, 2005 Field testing PIA tools in Malawi \u00a9 Abebe 2007 51Another way of attributing impact to project relate d factors is by asking peopl e to list all the factors that contributed to a particular impact and r ecord each response. Every time the same reason is repeated put a check or a cross next to it. At th e end of the assessment tally the number of times each factor was mentioned. The assumption here is that the most frequently mentioned factors hold a greater weight or importance than those less freq uently mentioned. This method is a convenient way of quickly attributing impact when using a fa irly large sample. Also, by not pre-defining the factors/indicators contributing to impact in theory you should not in fluence people's response. On the other hand, participants will be well aware that you are assessing th e impact of a given project and may fail to mention other important (non-pr oject) factors without being prompted. Table 6.3 Example of an Attribution Tally Form Table 6.4 shows result from an impact assessment of a drought response project in Niger.

The example below shows how a simple control was used in scoring disease amongst livestock ha ndled by community animal health workers (CAHW) and livestock that were not. FIGURE 6.5 CAMEL DISEASE IMPACT SCORING Source: Admassu et al 2005 A similar type of control was used below to co mpare mortality rates in livestock that received supplementary feed with those that did not dur ing a recent drought in Ethiopia (Bekele, 2008): Table 6.5 Comparison of livestock mortality rates (Source: Bekele, 2008) Location/Group Mortality Bulbul area - affected by moderate droughtProgramme started on 15thMarch 2008 Unfed cattle moved to grazing areas Cows fed using SCUS feed Cows fed using private feed 108/425 (25.4%) 13/161 (8.1%) 56/151 (37.1%) Web severe droughtProgramme started 9thFebruary 2008 Unfed cattle moved to grazing areas Cows fed using SCUS feed Cows fed using private feed 142/419 (33.8%) 55Comparisons in the number of months of food security were also done between project and non-project participants during assessments in Zimbabwe. In situations where non project participants attend focus groups, and are willing to provide comp arisons there is a possibility of using them as a spontaneous control group. Howe ver, the fact that they were excluded from the intervention raises questions about their comparability. FIGURE 6.6 COMPARISONS BETWEEN PROJECT AND NON PROJECT PARTICIPANTS The data was collected using twenty five counters which were us ed to represent a households' post harvest cereal balance. The counters were then distributed along a calendar to indicate utilization up until depletion. The data was colle cted during focus group discuss ions, and the distribution of the counters was agreed upon by consensus of participants from each group. (Source: Burns and Suji 2007) Although some of the attributions methods descri bed are certainly more rigorous than others, they may require greater time and resources, an d may not be practical. As with sampling, the type of attribution method used will be a judgm ent call in trying to ba lance scientific rigor with the practical realities of carrying out asse ssments in a challenging context. The important thing to remember is that whic hever method you decide to use, it will be better than not trying to attribute impact at all.

Secondary data may include previous studies and reports. External surveys done by the government, other organizations or research in stitutes may also provide useful data for triangulation. However, for most projects the key source of secondary information is the project's process and implementation monitoring (M&E) data. For example, if the results of the impact asse ssment show that there has been a reduction in disease patterns. \u0083 Did the project actually provide the specifi c types of drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent the disease in question? \u0083 Did the project provide sufficient quantitie s of drugs or vaccine which might account for these changes? This information should be available from the projects process monitoring reports. If any of the diseases in ques tion are part of an official disease control program, is there additional information available from these pr ograms, such as disease surveillance data? Another way to triangulate or validate your data is to use different participatory methods to measure the same indicator, and then compare the results. If the results are similar then they are more likely to be accurate. Alternatively, you can look for trends and patterns from the results of different exercises. For example, if you were to do a before and after scoring of food sources, income and expenditure, th e results from the first exercise may show an increase in cereal production, the second may show an increase in the pr oportion of household income from the sale of millet, and the expenditure exercise may show a relative reduction in the amount of household income spent on millet purchases. As long as you have asked the participants to explain these ch anges, and the responses support the results of th e participatory exercises, you can be fairly confident that the results from all three exercises are consistent with each other. 57FIGURE 7.1 TRIANGULATING DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION STAGE 8: FEEDBACK AND VALIDATION This is the final stage of the assessment and i nvolves the presentation of the findings back to the community. If a local partner such as a Community Based Organization (CBO) is involved in the project, they should rece ive a copy of the results , and later the final report. This stage is the final opportunity for the community and projec t participants to verify that the results are correct. If there is to be a sec ond phase of the project, or if the same project activities are to be implemented in another community, a \"feedb ack\" workshop can be held. This is a good opportunity to plan further work to improve th e project. Alternativel y a number of focus group exercises can be carried out with the objective of sharing the results with the participating communities. 58WHEN TO DO AN IMPACT ASSESSMENT The timing of an impact assessment will invariably have implications on the results, and an important question to ask is when to carry ou t an impact exercise. Many livelihoods projects have a delayed impact, and in a humanitarian context, where funding and project cycles are typically short, the project will end before the true impact of a project has been realized. Certain interventions will have a more or le ss immediate impact. For example, loans from village savings groups may be immediately inve sted in income generating activities, which turn an immediate profit which is then utilized on livelihoods investments. Similarly cash from a de-stocking intervention may be invested in food, fodder and veterinary drugs in a very short period of time. An agricultural interven tion will require at least one crop cycle to achieve any impact, and training projects may ta ke even longer. In some cases, project participants may have expectations of the project that will take years to realize. For example, participants in a sheep re-sto cking project in Niger hoped to eventually save enough income from the sale of the offspring of the pr oject sheep to purchas e a young cow, with the expectation that this cow would start producing milk, which could be fed to their children, and the surplus sold for cash which would be re-i nvested in more cattle. The participants suggested that a good long term i ndicator of project impact would be an increase in cattle ownership. However, the actual impact asse ssment took place long before any of the participants had saved up enough money to purch ase a cow, and so an increase in cattle ownership would have been a meaningless indica tor of impact. Alternatively the participants proposed that the number of ewes born from the project sheep should be used as a proxy indicator of project impact. In this case it is best to use shor t term, or proxy indicators of impact, as long as these are id entified by project participants, they can still be considered community identified indicators. Similarly, some interventions will continue to have an impact for a long period of time, whereas the im pact from other projects is only designed to have a short term life saving impact. This needs to be considered when designing an assessment, and when interpreting the results. It is useful to ask project participants when is the best time to do an assessment, and try to do it during the time period they suggest. Although th is may not always be practical, community members will have the best idea as to when th ey expect the project to achieve an impact against the indicators they have identified. Ther e are also times of the year that may be inappropriate to do an assessment as people are involved in cultural, religious or agricultural activities that will take priority, and community members can advise on what periods to avoid. Even if people do agree to participate in an assessment during busy pe riods, it's only natural that their responses will be rushed and this will compromise the quality of the results. In any case, from a purely ethical persp ective this should be avoided. 59References Behnke et al. (2008). Evaluation of USAID Pastoral Development Projects in Ethiopia.
