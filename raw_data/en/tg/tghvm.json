On today&rsquo;s menu: Herbs that can cut cancer risk. &ldquo;I think people can forget, or don&rsquo;t realize, that herbs are plants and contain a wide variety of phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants,&rdquo; says Candice Schreiber, RD, CSO, LD, a JamesCare for Life outpatient clinical dietician. &ldquo;When you use herbs to add flavor to a dish, you can also reduce the use of fats, sugar and sodium.\\\" Here are five of Schreiber&rsquo;s favorite herbs, along with some info on their anti-cancer benefits. Basil Benefits: Full of flavonoids, basil &ldquo;may have a protective effect against cancer,&rdquo; according to the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR). The herb is used in many popular dishes, including stir fry, curry, tomato-based sauces, salads, dressings and marinades. &ldquo;Pesto is probably the number-one basil dish &mdash; I like to add some spinach or another leafy green for a little extra nutrition and taste,&rdquo; Schreiber says. Adding walnuts and almonds can replace the more expensive pine nuts called for in many pesto recipes. Rosemary Benefits: Rosemary is rich in carnosol, a phytochemical that can slow cancer cell growth, strengthen immune functions, limit the production of cancer-related hormones and work as an antioxidant, according to the AICR. Rosemary has a sweet, piney flavor and can be used in a wide variety of dishes. &ldquo;I love to add rosemary to diced potatoes and then roast them,&rdquo; Schreiber says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also great in a marinade for poultry, and you can add it to olive oil for a real flavor boost.&rdquo; Thyme Benefits: Thyme contains terpenoids, a group of phytochemicals that can work as antioxidants and may protect cells from cancer. This aromatic herb can be used in sauces, soups and stews, vegetable dishes, marinades and homemade bread. &ldquo;I really like lemon thyme,&rdquo; Schreiber says. &ldquo;It has a really nice flavor and the stems are softer, so you don&rsquo;t have to remove them when you cook with them.&rdquo; Mint Benefits: Mint contains perillyl alcohol, which has been shown in lab studies to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, according to the AICR. Mint may also help to reduce digestive issues, something many cancer patients deal with in the midst of treatment. &ldquo;Mint tea or mint candy may help some cancer patients reduce their nausea,&rdquo; Schreiber says. The two most common forms &mdash; spearmint and peppermint &mdash; are used to flavor sweet and savory dishes, and with desserts, salads, fruit, smoothies and yogurt-based sauces, such as tzatziki.&nbsp; Benefits: than a garnish, parsley contains apigenine, another flavonoid that may play a role in preventing cancer. Curled parsley is more common as a garnish, while the flat leaf variety (also called Italian parsley) is used more regularly in soups and stews, as well as in vegetable dishes. &ldquo;You can also use parsley in homemade dressings and marinades,&rdquo; Schreiber says. Schreiber&rsquo;s tips for cooking with herbs Always add fresh herbs, such as basil, at the very end of the cooking process to get the most flavor. It&rsquo;s the opposite with dried herbs &mdash; add them at the beginning. There&rsquo;s a three-to-one ratio between fresh and dried herbs. So, if a recipe calls for one tablespoon of dried rosemary, use three tablespoons when it&rsquo;s fresh. To store fresh thyme, and other herbs, wash and dry thoroughly, snip off the ends, put them in water-filled jars and refrigerate, changing the water weekly. "}
