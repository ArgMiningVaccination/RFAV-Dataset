The pressure to take COVID 19 vaccine to reach herd immunity and to protect the vulnerable has inflamed worries about side effects. So, what do you need to know? There are three COVID 19 vaccines available in the UK: Moderna, Oxford/ Astra Zeneca, and Pfizer/ BioNtech. They all simulate an immune response without causing illness by using a harmless form of the virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The antigens trigger an immune response, which builds our body's immune memory in case it needs to fight off SARS-CoV-2 for real. It is normal to experience side effects as it means the vaccine is working. If you feel uncomfortable you can ease the symptoms with paracetamol. Fever can be a common side effect. It usually appears within 48 hours and takes as long to go. If you are worried before vaccination, speak to your GP. Afterwards, if symptoms persist call 111- 24hrs a day. As with all medication, each vaccine is a balancing act between side effects and its benefits so bear that in mind.
