{"title": "Mitigation of antibiotic resistance in poultry through resensitization, vaccination, and microbial restoration", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The reduction of antibiotic use in animal agriculture in the United States is a necessary step towards reducing the emergence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens of humans and animals. However, reduction of use does not promise reduction of resistance, and this approach may create ancillary problems related to increased disease-associated mortality. This work will attack these problems in a multi-pronged effort. First, genetic technology will be used develop a system that targets antimicrobial resistance. Second, web-based open access tools will be developed to educate poultry producers about vaccination strategies and provide a simple way to choose vaccine strains. Third,probiotics will be characterized and examined in commercial turkeys to develop better probiotics. Finally, symposia and online educational materials related to prebiotics and probiotics will be delivered to appropriate audiences to provide clarity to the confusing realm of alternative feed additive selection and use. Overall, this project will build on the future of mitigation strategies against antimicrobial resistance and will provide educational and hands-on tools to enable science-based decision-making by the poultry producer.", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-01-07", "cleaned_text": "Progress 07/01/18 to 03/31/23 Outputs Target Audience:The target audiences during this reporting period included: 1. Laboratory-based training: scientists focusing on bioinformatic and laboratory approaches to analyze and validate multi-omics datasets were trained during this period. 2. Informal outreach: This work was discussed extensively with members of the MN poultry industry and allied industry. This includes primarily broiler and turkey companies in MN, and several agricultural feed additive companies. Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?This work supported research by two PhD students in the Comparative Molecular Biosciences graduate program at the University of Minnesota. One graduated in 2021 and the second will graduate in 2023. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?Results have been shared with the scientific community and with members of the poultry industry via local meetings (Minnesota Turkey Growers Association), national meetings (Poultry Science Association, Conference for Research Workers in Animal Diseases), and industry member meetings (National Chicken Council). What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? Nothing Reported Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? Objective 1. We have develoiped a CRISPR/Cas system in E. coli and Salmonella. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we have successfully developed a system that targets avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) multidrug resistance-encoding plasmids. Interestingly, we determined that the target sequences of these plasmids have varying levels of efficacy in vitro against APEC plasmids. The most efficacious target identified was targeting the hlyF hemolysin gene of APEC plasmids. With this target, we are able to eliminate the plasmid following electroporation at rates of 90%, both when the plasmid is in laboratory strains and wild type APEC strains. We have next developed plasmid-based delivery systems utilizing IncP and IncX plasmid backbones. These plasmids were tested to deliver the CRISPR-Cas9 systems against wild type APEC in a simulated poultry litter environment. Thisdemonstrates its ability to target a highly relevent poultry pathogen (APEC) habroring MDR phenotypes. Objective 2. Two vaccine ecology studies were conducted. First, we partnered with a commercial turkey company to collect samples from 16 different farms with matched control/vaccinated barns. These farms were receiving a commercial E. coli vaccine for the first time ever. Flocks were followed for 2 cycles. Weekly samples were collected, including litter samples, boot sock samples, cloacal swabs, and tracheal swabs. Samples were cultured in enterobacterial enrichment broth and stored. More than 12,000 samples were collected. We screened over 1,000 of these samples using a top-down approach (PCR through whole genome sequencing) to determine if application of a commercial E. coli vaccine shifts on-farm ecology of commensal and clinical E. coli populations. We found that two rounds of E. coli vaccination with an O78-based APEC vaccine do shift the populations of E. coli in the gut and respiratory tract of birds, with shifts away from Clermont phylogenetic groups haboring the O78 serogroup. A second was done as a part of a PhD thesis with a student funded through a separate USDA National Needs Fellowship. She partnered with a commercial turkey company to follow flocks with histories of no Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) vaccination versus those with histories of continuous ORT vaccination. She developed an ORT culturing method where she can isolate ORT from a mixed community. Samples were collected for this project in 2020. This workillustratedthe lack of efficacy of \"controlled exposure\" of live, non-attenuated Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) to prevent subsequent infection with ORT. Our analyses indicate that this practice has little to no impact on preventing the same strains from causing disease later in the turkey's life. We have collected clinical E. coli, ORT, and Pasteruella from turkey producers. To date we have collected nearly 4,000 total isolates, and the majority of these have been whole genome sequenced. These data form the basis for online tools and research tools for the poultry industry to track bacterial pathogens through production systems. As a result of this work, we published a paperwhich redefines the avian pathogenic E. coli pathotype. Objective 3. A systematic review has been completed by scientists in our laboratory studying the impact of probiotic use on poultry performance. This is pending publication. We have published multiple papers describing lactobacilli-based and phytogenic interventions which successfully reduce Salmonella load within the bird and/or during processing. We have established a cell adhesion/invasion model to study lactobacilli/Salmonella interactions, and have screened lactobacilli from ten different species for their adhesion and/or invasion abilities. This work is currently under review for publication. We studied host specificity of L. johnsonii in detail using high-resolution genomics, in vitro phenotypic assays, and live bird trials. We determined that evidence of host specificity exists even between different avian species (chickens versus turkeys), and host-specific strains demonstrate superior ability to influence performance compared to non-host-specific counterparts. Objective 4. Blog articles have been written with focus on vaccination and its impacts on poultry bacterial pathogen populations. We have utilized the data from this study to develop a course at the University of Minnesota on poultry food safety (POUL 5102) which is a component of a newly developed Poultry Health Certificate Program.

This includes primarily broiler and turkey companies in MN, and several agricultural feed additive companies. Meetings were conducted at the Mid-Central Research and Outreach Center in Willmar, MN. Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?This project has provided the opportunity to train and mentor twopostdoctoral students and two PhD students (National Needs Fellows)in bioinformatics and laboratory techniques related to Objectives 2 and 3. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?The PI has made a number of presentations at local high schools and community colleges in the central MN area using the goals and results of this project as an example of cutting-edge science that occurs in the heart of agriculture in the USA. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?Objective 1. The CRISPR/Cas tools developed will be tested against field strains in vitro to assess the efficacy of the system towards eliminating plasmids. A conugative system using IncP-type plasmid vectors will be developed as a means to naturally deliver the CRISPR/Cas system to other bacteria, and this will be tested in vitro using natural conjugation experiments. Objective 2. Longitudunal field studies will be conducted to assess ORT and E. coli ecology across farms, geographical locations, and time in the US turkey production sector. The database to harbor genomic data used to predictors of ecological pathogen shifts in response to vaccination and other mitigation strategies will continue to be developed. Objective 3. A systematic will be started to survey literature for determination of the effectiveness of prebiotic and probiotic approaches towards enhancing performance and reducing disease in poultry production. In vitro screens will be conducted to determine host adaptive properties of probiotic strains in turkeys and chickens. In vitro pathogen inhibition studies will be conducted. Objective 4. A symposium will be proposed for the Midwest Poultry Federation meeting in Minneapolis in March 2020. Similarly, a symposia will be proposed for upcoming meetings at the American Association for Avian Pathologists and IPPE. Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? Objective 1. The CRISPR/Cas system targeting different plasmid types has been developed in the laboratory. These tools will be used towards in vitro testing to determine the theoretical ability of a CRISPR-Cas delivery system to target multiple plasmids circulating in poultry production systems in the US. Objective 2. Genome sequences of approximately 100 ORT and 500 avian pathogenic E. coli have been obtained and analyzed. Tools used to analyze strains included whole genome SNP-based typing, pangenome analysis, and mining of genomic data for molecular serotype, virulence genotype, plasmid content, resistance gene content, MLST type, cgMLST type, and wgMLST type. The database that will harbor these strains is in development. Poultry companies have been contacted for enrollment into studies examining on-farm ORT and E. coli ecology using clinical, commensal, and environmental isolates collected in longitudinal manner. Objective 3. In vitro avian and mammalian epithelial cell line modelshave been established in the laboratory and are currently being tested using strains of Lactobacillus, E. coli, and Salmonella. In vitro pathogen inhibition models are in development using supernaten-based and direct cell-cell inhibition models. Objective 4. Two articles were published in trade magazines for turkey producers to introduce the concepts of bacterial strain typing, and why this matters for the producer.
