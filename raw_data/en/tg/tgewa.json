Various elements influence the kind of physical healing approaches and paradigms used. These factors may be based on religion, social class, and the culture in which people live, among other things. [Crystal healing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_healing) has a long history, having graced the breastplates of warriors and priests, served as guiding lights for ancient tribes, used in shamanic rituals, and been tucked away in the pockets of princesses, sailors, and healers. Let's delve deeper into how people long ago used crystals for healing. Crystal healing use in Ancient Egypt The most well-known usage of healing stones throughout history may be traced back to ancient Egypt. The Egyptians practiced a complicated polytheistic belief system. Their religion had numerous deities, each in charge of a different universe aspect. In honor of their cherished gods and goddesses, royalty or those of high social status frequently wore specific gems and stones. Royal ladies, for example, frequently wore jewelry containing crushed lapis lazuli stones, which were linked with Isis, the sky goddess. People still like lapis lazuli jewelry because of its intuitive and spiritual enlightenment properties. Royals would place gemstones and crystals in their crowns and amulets to stimulate and open the third eye chakra. Quartz crystals were even found on the foreheads of certain ancient Egyptians, and it was supposed to grant them safe passage into the afterlife. Quartz was also utilized to balance one's soul's Ba and Ka energies. The Ka is one's personal life energy, which everyone is said to be born with. On the other hand, the Ba indicates distinct qualities of a person's personality, such as humor, friendliness, or charm. Carrying quartz assisted ancient Egyptians in combining these two sides of their spirit and finding inner balance. Mesopotamia Crystals and healing have been used for millennia and are estimated to have originated as early as 4000 BCE. The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia were among the first to record the use of crystals and gemstones as medicinal ingredients. Ancient Sumerians constructed cylinder seals out of softer crystals like gypsum and hematite that could be imprinted with pictures and words in cuneiform. These seals frequently depicted one's status in life, significant events like birth and marriage, and religious rites. These cylinders were frequently put in temples and utilized during spiritual ceremonies because gypsum and hematite were supposed to have protective characteristics. Ancient Greece Ancient Greek beliefs and mythology heavily influence our knowledge of healing stones and crystals. The term \"crystal\" is derived from the Greek word \"krustallos,\" which means \"ice,\" and the ancient Greeks believed that pure crystals like quartz were perpetual ice poured down from the sky. Furthermore, the term amethyst comes from an ancient Greek story involving the goddess Diana and Dionysus, the god of wine. Amethyst was used to preserve sobriety because of its relationship with the frequently drunk Dionysus, and it is still used in this fashion today. The middle ages Healing stones and crystals were used practically long into the Middle Ages. Crystals and stones were widely investigated throughout this period, which lasted roughly from 300 CE to 1500 CE. Lapidaries, or tomes that described the qualities and applications of numerous stones and jewels, began to appear. The earliest surviving lapidary may be traced back to Theophrastus, Aristotle's ancient Greek successor. Even though his lapidary preceded this era by several hundred years, Theophrastus' tome was frequently used throughout the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance. The Middle Ages also saw a surge of Christianity across Europe. Although this theological change discouraged some old spiritual ideas, healing gemstones may still be seen throughout the Bible. For example, the priestly breastplate was thought to contain twelve diamonds, each representing a distinct tribe of Israel. This element, first stated in the Book of Exodus and later featured in both the Christian and Jewish religions, was thought to decide god's will. However, the actual name of each of these diamonds has been disputed throughout the years. Several distinguishing qualities have assisted historians in determining what these stones may have been. The new age The usage of healing crystals and gemstones declined as the globe entered the twentieth century. The use of healing gemstones decreased slightly in the early 1900s. However, as the century progressed and the New Age culture arose in the 1970s and 1980s, healing gemstones saw their own rebirth, gaining popularity as people relied on the various old traditions and beliefs. During this time, crystal therapy arose as a way of fixing physical, spiritual and mental issues, and it is still commonly practiced today. Choosing the right gemstone for you It might be challenging to decide which stone to bring into your life. One of the essential things crystals teach you is to tune in, listen to your intuition, and believe that you have all the information you need. Your body, mind, and spirit are all interconnected, and you, like everything else in the cosmos, are formed of energy. You can listen to the earth's indications and messages if you can tap into that power. Finding the correct crystal requires intuition about the ones you are drawn to (or which ones are drawn to you). Even simply hearing a crystal's name, seeing a photo, or reading a blurb may cause you to sense a deep inner tug that draws you to that specific stone. Each gemstone also has its unique set of therapeutic qualities. Because you are occasionally aware of your strengths and limitations, you may select healing gemstones based on their characteristics to assist you. Another option for selecting gems is to consult the zodiac. Certain crystals work with specific zodiac signs, so knowing this information might help you find a combination of stones that harmonize with the stars.
