Currently Accepted: Private Pay, United, Medicare, Cigna, BCBS, Aetna, Tricare, Medicaid, Kaiser Ronald Smith Licensed Psychologist I appreciate the opportunity to share about myself and my life experiences, and to be able to serve individuals and families in Southern Colorado. I am the son of an elementary school teacher and office supply salesman who grew up in smalltown Ohio in 1950s/1960s. My mother grew up on a farm, and the odds that I would ever be involved in counseling/psychology may have seemed pretty remote at that time. But after attending university in Ohio and being exposed to New York City from a previous relationship, a whole world opened up to me that I had never seen. I was introduced to psychotherapy/counseling by professional mentors who led me to want to aid and help others, and I have been in professional practice for almost 45 years. My wife MJ is the strongest person I have ever met in her recovery from severe injury in the last 40 years, and she has also served others as a licensed massage therapist for 32 years as well. I was in private practice in Ohio for 16 years before moving to Colorado, and have worked in child protection/social service, juvenile prisons, medical and psychiatric hospitals, mental health centers, and marriage and family services. I have taught students in Colorado colleges and schools, yet I have seen myself as a counselor/therapist training other healers and mental health practitioners. It is extremely rewarding when you see yourself making a difference, and I have worked with children/teens, individuals, couples and families. I enjoy the process of helping others to help themselves, serving others in Pueblo and Southern Colorado, being part of a team of servics professionals at A New Leaf Therapy.

Currently Accepted: Aetna, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, United (UHC), Private Pay, Park Care, Cigna, Kaiser Venice Gallegos, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Venice comes to us with 30 years experience working with adults, couples, teenagers and children with expertise in helping people of all sexual orientations through all manner of pain whether affecting concentration, anxiety, difficulty managing daily life, feeling angry and unheard when what you really are is heart-broken or scared, about a few things. Or, feeling lost and unseen, friends or not, we can sometimes feel alone, secretly afraid there's something wrong with us and don't know what to do with that. Venice is a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist with years of experience listening and helping people find and do their work on their terms. She works with individuals of all ages, and also provides couples and family therapy. She likes to say that the client leads and she collaborates, grateful to be the working partner for this part of the journey. Further, she offers mind-body practices closely aligned with gratitude work, believing that this work can help quiet the static our repetitive thoughts create, better enabling our clients to do the work they came for. She also has 20 years experience as a sandtray therapist, using this work in a number of different ways, sometimes helping a child or family communicate or seek further services, for example, and sometimes letting sandtray be of more use in other ways, whether a soothing tool or a way to work in silence when needed for adults too. Venice has developed a way to work with couples that goes deep and changes lives. Her people have told her so. She loves this work because very often the parties involved actually learn how to really negotiate through uncomfortable feelings, making all the difference along the way for all involved. Venice received her Masters in Community Counseling from Adams State and her Bachelors from USC-Colorado. Starting her career at Parkview, working on the mental health floors and Emergency Department, she was schooled in a systems approach to client care that she maintains to this day, identifying that one's sense of self is formed through the experiences you enjoy or endure and what you say they mean as each of us grow up. Experience has taught her that when the alliance between client/s and therapist is enabled to be built and mutually trusted, the work can often feel lighter, even powerful, definitely different than what the client first feared therapy might be.

I am currently a graduate student at Adams State University (online) working towards obtaining my masters in clinical mental health counseling. I received my bachelors in psychology from Colorado State University-Pueblo in 2020. I have worked many jobs that involve interacting with people; including retail and case management in a community mental health clinic. The clinical approaches that interest me are CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), Person-Centered, and Solution-Focused. I find that the approach varies on what works best on the individual and may change based on circumstances. Most of my experience is based in a clinical mental health setting with adults but I am open and willing to work with other populations.

My name is Gianna, and I am a Master's level counselor working to complete an M.A. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at Palo Alto University. The therapeutic approaches most rely on are existential, person-centered, Gestalt, transpersonal, and ecotherapy theories. These approaches focus on creating meaning in our lives, uncovering our inner resources, more fully experiencing present-moment awareness, and connecting to resources outside of ourselves, such as nature and community. My hope as your therapist is to show up as my authentic self, meet clients wherever they are, and co-create a safe space that is ripe for self-exploration, curiosity, and transformation.
