Artigo em Ingl\u00eas deletion of the [viral genome], explains Kelly Lyn Warfield, vice development]within Emergent of live, attenuated [viral vaccines], caution must be applied due to potential immunocompromised individuals (i.e., primary immunodeficiencies, [patients]on [immunosuppressant] [treatment], [HIV]-infected people, and sometimes the very young or old), since this type of [vaccine]has the potential to replicate in an uncontrolled manner. spread to other individuals due to shedding of the [vaccine], or revert to a virulent ( [disease]-causing) vector-based [vaccine]can cause an [immune response]to the viral vector itself in addition to the [antigen]of interest for which it is delivering the [nucleic acid], according to Gregory Bleck, vice president of development]at Catalent Biologies. [...]to achieve complete immune [protection]and to increase its duration, a prime boost dosing regimen in two consecutive [vaccinations]with the same or a different [vaccine]may be applied, which is what we're seeing in the [mRNA] [COVID-19 vaccines],\" he says.
