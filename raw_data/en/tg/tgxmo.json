In this report, to a ccord with data sources, allergies are grouped as: /boxshadowdwn allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and /boxshadowdwn allergic chronic sinusitis; and /boxshadowdwn other allergies, which include food, drug, latex, s ting and bite allergies, urticaria (hives, nettle rash), contact dermatitis and anaphylaxis, a mong other disorders. Allergy testing for diagnosis involves the detectio n of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies directed against environmental allergens, either by skin prick testing (SPT) or blood allergy testing. Patch testing can also be used to detect non-IgE mediated disorders such as contact allergic dermatitis. Allergies can cause s ignificant discomfort, affect sleep, and impair learning, memory and behaviour in children. In children with severe food allergy, management in the community is complex and has the potential to cause anxiety within affected families regarding care in schools, risk o f death and the need or otherwise for injectable adrenaline. For affected adults, allerg ic disorders can lead to impaired quality of life, absenteeism from work, other reduced producti vity, aids (especially self-care aids such as dressings for atopic eczema) and home modificati ons (eg, to prevent or reduce allergen levels in the home). Most patients with allergic d isorders have associated comorbidities. The relative risk of death in people with allergic diso rders is slightly elevated, estimated in this report as 1.02 across all Australians with allergie s. Prevalence of allergies in Australia Allergies have emerged as a major public health pro blem in developed countries during the twentieth century; Australia and New Zealand have a mong the highest prevalence of allergic disorders in the developed world. This report esti mates that in 2007: /boxshadowdwn 4.1 million Australians (19.6% of the population) h ave at least one allergy, of which 2.2 million (55%) are female and 1.9 million (45%) are male; /boxshadowdwn the highest prevalence of allergies is in the worki ng age population, with 78% of people with allergies aged 15 to 64 years (see chart below ), and /boxshadowdwn there are 7.2 million cases of allergy (ie, an aver age of 1.74 comorbid allergies per person). The economic impact of allergic disease iii ALLERGIES , PREVALENCE RATES BY AGE AND GENDER Females Literature evidence indicates increases in the prev alence of many types of allergies in recent decades. For example, hospital admissions for food anaphylaxis in Australia have doubled over the last decade, and increased five-fold in ch ildren aged 0-4 years. Peanut allergy has doubled in prevalence in young children over a five year period. Linear estimation from historical data from the Aus tralian Bureau of Statistics National Health Survey suggests that the age-gender prevalence of a llergies has changed in Australia over the period 1995-2005, for males and females togethe r, by: /boxshadowdwn -0.08% per annum for annum for allergic annum for allergic sinusitis; annum for other allergies; and /boxshadowdwn 0.09% per annum for all allergies - this means that while prevalence is 19.6% this year, if current trends continue, it would be 19.7% next year and so on. There is stronger overall growth in the number of o lder Australians (particularly males). If current trends continue, there would be a 70% incre ase in the number of Australians with allergy, from 4.1 million currently to 7.7 mil lion by 2050 (26.1% of the population or more than one in four Australians compared to on e in five Australians today). If the rise in age-gender prevalence rates could be immedi ately arrested, there would be 5.62 million Australians with allergies by 2050 (wi th growth in numbers due solely to population growth and ageing) and in fact a decline relative to population from 19.6% now to 19.1% by mid-century. Costs In 2007, the financial cost of allergies was $7.8 billion . Of this: /boxshadowdwn lost due to: lower productivity at work - household productivity illion); and /g51/g51 /g51/g51 premature death, including employers' search and hi ring costs ($84 million). The economic impact of allergic disease iv /boxshadowdwn $1.2 billion (15%) was the direct health system exp enditure of which: /g51/g51 /g51/g51 non-asthma and /boxshadowdwn $262 million (3%) was other indirect costs such as aids and home modifications and the bring-forward of funeral costs; and /boxshadowdwn $783 million (10%) was the deadweight loss from tra nsfers including welfare payments (mainly Disability Support Pension and Carer Paymen t) and taxation forgone. To put this financial cost in perspective, it is mo re than twice as large as schizophrenia ($1.8 billion) and bipolar affective disorder ($1.6 billion) combined. Additionally, the net value of the lost wellbeing (disability and prematu re death) was a further $21.6 billion . For 156,144 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). This represents almost double the same figures for either arthritis or hearing loss ( both $11.7 billion). In per capita terms, this amounts to a financial cost of around $1,912 per person with allergies per annum. Including the value of lost wellbeing, the cost is $7,200 per person per annum. Individuals with allergies bear 48% of the financia l costs, and their families and friends bear a further 1%. Federal government bears 32% of the fi nancial costs, mainly through taxation revenues forgone ($1.9 billion), funded health expe nditures ($497 million) and welfare payments ($78 million), as well as other expenditur es ($65 million). State and Territory governments bear around 5% of the costs, with the r emaining 13% borne by others in society (including employers). If the burden of disease (the economic cost of disa bility and premature death) is included, individuals bear 86% of the costs. Total cost shar es are depicted in the following charts. TOTAL COSTS OF ALLERGIES , BY TYPE OF COST AND BY BEARER (% TOTAL ) BoD 73% Health System Costs 4% Other financial Costs Australia would need 178 allergy/immunology special ists by 2017 to correct the current maldistribution and achieve the benchmark of NSW/AC T specialist to population ratios (SPRs) over the ten-year period till then. This co ntrasts with the likely 115 specialists who would be available if training places are kept at t he six per year currently projected. The additional 63 specialists could be achieved by trai ning 127 over the period rather than 64, given the simple assumptions of the basic modelling in this report. There would be little The economic impact of allergic disease v impact by 2012, with the SPR only 0.52 compared to 0.51 in the likely case; however, the benefits would start to emerge from 2013 onwards. Future directions In Australia there is a lack of public and professi onal appreciation of the impact of allergic and immune disorders on quality of life, and even l ess of the economic impact to society and individuals who suffer allergic disease. Raising a wareness of the economic and health impacts is an important factor in facilitating the early recognition and control of allergic disease. Development of a framework of best practice for man agement of allergic disease in Australia will be enhanced by: /boxshadowdwn timely access to specialist allergy/immunology serv ices; /boxshadowdwn access to early and accurate diagnosis; /boxshadowdwn access to affordable and cost-effective therapy and novel therapies; /boxshadowdwn support for community and medical education outside the current paradigm; /boxshadowdwn support for local research to develop interventiona l strategies to reduce the burden of disease in the community; and /boxshadowdwn development of a model of allergy as a chronic dise ase.

INTRODUCTION Access Economics was commissioned by the Australasi an Society for Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) to estimate the demographic pre valence, financial cost and disease burden of allergic disorders in Australia. Allergi c disorders are chronic immunological disorders that can impact negatively on quality of life and productivity. ASCIA is the peak professional body of Australian a nd New Zealand Allergy and Immunology specialists. The aims of ASCIA are to improve the c are of patients by providing evidence- based information on allergic and immune disorders within the medical and lay community. Its aims are supported by the provision of educatio nal material for health professionals and patients, support for research, and collaboration w ith other professional and government organisations such as the National Asthma Campaign and Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA). This report is structured as follows. /boxshadowdwn The rest of this chapter provides background inform ation on the immune system, specific allergic diseases and their symptoms and t reatment, as well as methods of diagnosis. /boxshadowdwn Chapter 2 presents current and projected future pre valence of allergy in Australia. /boxshadowdwn Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the health system costs an d other financial costs associated with allergic disease. Other financial costs includ e productivity losses (due to lower employment rates, worker absenteeism and premature death), carer and other costs, as well as deadweight (efficiency) losses (DWLs) fr om transfer payments, such as government welfare and income support payments 1. /boxshadowdwn Chapter 5 presents burden of disease (BoD) estimate s, which refers to the years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature m ortality caused by allergic disease, and is measured by Disability Adjusted Life Years ( DALYs). /boxshadowdwn Chapter 6 summarises the economic impacts of allerg ies. /boxshadowdwn Chapter 7 reviews the adequacy of the allergy and i mmunology workforce in Australia, based on simple projections of demand and supply. /boxshadowdwn Chapter 8 presents strategic, forward-looking concl usions from the analysis. 1.1 THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The immune system is a complex network of cells and proteins that defends the body against infection and protects against the development of m alignancy. In the simplest terms, diseases of the immune system result from either a deficiency of normal immune responses, or overactive or inappropriate immune responses (Sh earer et al, 2006; Verbsky and Grossman, 2006). Inappropriate immune responses in clude allergies (where the immune system responds to innocuous environmental substanc es) and autoimmune diseases (where the immune system responds to components of the bod y as if they were foreign and harmful). 1 A cost analysis of the economic impact of immune di seases (other than allergy) is beyond the scope of the current report. The economic impact of allergic disease 2 Disorders managed by allergy and immunology special ists include the following conditions, some of which may also be occupational. /boxshadowdwn Classical Allergic Disorders /g51/g51 /g51/g51 Allergic rhinitis Allergy /g51/g51 /g51/g51 Drug (eg, antibiotics, pain killers or an aesthetics) /g51/g51 /g51/g51 ce) /boxshadowdwn Overlapping disorders sometimes co-managed with Chronic /g51/g51 /g51/g51 syndrome /g51/g51 /g51/g51 Some psychological disorders (attributed to environ mental factors such as food or inhaled substances) /boxshadowdwn Immune deficiency /g51/g51 /g51/g51 Primary Immune Deficiency /g51/g51 /g51/g51 Acquired Immune Deficiency (eg, HIV infection, The of allergic disease 3 1.2 WHAT IS ALLERGY? Allergy occurs when a person's immune system mounts an abnormal response to substances in the environment that do not normally bother other people. These substances are known as allergens. They are usually small prot eins and include house dust mites, animal skin and saliva, pollen, moulds and foods. W hen allergic people are exposed to allergens, they can form Immunoglobulin E (IgE) ant ibodies against that allergen. 2 A person allergic to pollen protein, for example, will have IgE antibodies capable of recognising the shape of pollen protein (the allergen ), in much the same way that a lock 'recognises' th e shape of a key. IgE antibodies stick to the surface of mast cells w ithin tissues and act as remote sensors within the environment. Mast cells are like 'land-m ines', and contain 'bean bags' filled with irritant chemicals including histamine. When IgE an tibodies attach, mast cells are triggered to dump their contents into the tissues. When these ar e released in small amounts, they cause local itch and irritation. In much larger amounts, the result can be much more serious. Symptoms may include the sneeze and itch of hay fev er, the cough and wheeze of asthma, or the devastating top to toe rash, severe difficul ty breathing and vascular collapse of anaphylaxis. FIGURE 1-1: IGE PRIMED MAST CELL , ANTIGEN , DEGRANULATION Source: Dr P Smith. A delayed inflammatory response may often follow ov er the next several hours, resulting in the attraction of white cells into the tissues, and the ongoing inflammation characteristic of asthma, atopic eczema and allergic rhinitis. 2 While the word 'allergy' is often used by the lay community to represent any perceived adverse reacti on to an environmental insult, it is important to bear in mi nd that the diagnosis of allergy is critically depe ndent on identifying the immune process involved in the alle rgic response. The economic impact of allergic disease 4 FIGURE 1-2: INFLAMMATION OF ECZEMA Source: Dr R Mullins. There are numerous forms of allergic disorders and comorbidity makes classification difficult. To accord with the estimates of prevalence in later sections, this section is structured to describe the symptoms and treatment of: /boxshadowdwn allergic rhinitis (hay chronic sinusitis; and /boxshadowdwn other allergies (including food, drug, sting allerg ies and anaphylaxis, among other things). 1.2.1 ALLERGIC RHINITIS (HAY FEVER ) AND CONJUNCTIVITIS Various sources from around the world (Wilson et al , 2006, Asher et al, 2006; Wist et al, 2005; Hopper et al, 1995) suggest that allergic rhi nitis 3 and conjunctivitis are rare in infants but estimated to affect around one in six children aged 6-7 years, one in ten children aged 13-14 years, 18% of those aged 15-34 years and 10% of older adults aged 35-54 years.4 Symptoms generally persist for at least ten years, often longer (Greisner et al, 1998). Typical complaints are those of a blocked and runny nose wi th clear mucus, itchy nose, sneezing 3 Non-allergic rhinitis is a term used to describe symptoms triggered by c hanges in temperature or humidity, or exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke or pe rfume and occasionally dietary factors. Pregnancy a nd some medications (particularly antihypertensive agents) can also cause nasal congestion. There are various theories describing how this condition may arise, including an imbalance in the function of nerves that make mu cous glands secrete fluid and which cause blood vessels to swell or contract and 'subclinical allergy' (Kali ner, 2007; Ciprandi, 2004; Garay, 2004). In some, non-allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory condition associated w ith eosinophilic inflammation of the nasal mucosa, and is associated with the development over time of chr onic sinusitis, nasal polyps and the 'aspirin triad' (se e Section 1.2.3). 4 Note these prevalence rates are somewhat different from the findings for Australia presented in Chapt er 2. The economic impact of allergic disease 5 and cough from post nasal drip, a symptom that can be mistaken for asthma cough. Allergic rhinitis may masquerade as continuous or recurrent respiratory infection, frequent sore throats and may be complicated by sinusitis or otit is media. Those with allergic rhinitis suffer more frequent and prolonged sinus infection, and tr eatment of the allergic component may reduce the risk (Cirillo et al, 2007). Allergic co njunctivitis is usually accompanied by rhinitis, with red and itchy eyes, sometimes complicated by i nfective conjunctivitis due to frequent rubbing. Seasonal symptoms are most commonly trigg ered by pollen exposure, with perennial rhinitis aggravated by exposure to house dust mite, mould spores or indoor pets (Plaut and Valentine, 2005; Van Hoecke and Van Cauw enberge, 2007). Lethargy, poor concentration and behavioural change s may arise as a result of persistent symptoms and poor quality sleep, and impact on lear ning in young children (Simons, 1996; Marshall and Colon, 1993: Gauci et al, 1993). Thes e factors may be aggravated by use of sedating (as opposed to the more expensive non-seda ting) antihistamines as a cost saving measure (Nolen, 1997; Storms, 1997; Vuurman et al, 1993). Since avoidance of exposure to the allergen is often not possible, the cornerstone s of management revolve around the use of medication (one or more of topical nasal corticoste roids, oral or topical antihistamine nasal sprays or eyedrops) or immunotherapy, a specialist supervised procedure also known as 'desensitisation' (Plaut and Valentine, 2005; Van H oecke and Van Cauwenberge, 2007). Allergic rhinitis may predispose people to obstruct ive sleep apnoea, which results from collapse of the upper airways during sleep. This r esults in reduced airflow, a drop in oxygen levels and disturbed sleep. Factors predisposing t o this condition include being overweight and having a blocked nose. Nasal blockage is assoc iated with more severe obstructive sleep apnoea, arousals during sleep and daytime sle epiness even when sleep apnoea is absent. These abnormalities had been found to be r eversible with surgical correction of anatomical abnormalities, topical nasal steroid spr ays in patients with allergic rhinitis and reduced allergen exposure in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (Craig et al, 1998; University of Wisconsin Sleep and Respiratory Resea rch Group, 1997; McNicholas et al, 1982; Santos et al, 2006). Observational studies have linked chronic mouth bre athing to structural changes of the face. Nasal obstruction due to allergic rhinitis or adeno id hypertrophy (the so-called 'adenoid facies') have been associated with a long and narro w face, a long narrow tongue, high arched palate, small lower jaw, over bite and cross bite and dental crowding and malocclusion. Animal studies have demonstrated the development of similar abnormalities in experimental models. Furthermore, some have been s hown to be reversible when the obstruction has been relieved. These observations have cosmetic and functional implications for patients with severe dental abnorm alities (Spector, 1997; Settipane, 1999; Slavin, 1998). Patients with allergic rhinitis als o suffer from more frequent and prolonged respiratory infections, and asthma has been shown t o be more difficult to control unless allergic rhinitis is also managed (Gaugris et al, 2 006; Cirillo et al, 2007). Allergen immunotherapy is the only treatment that a ddresses the immune problem that causes allergies and can alter the natural history of disease. This treatment involves administration of increasingly larger amounts of co mmercial allergen extracts with the aim of inducing tolerance to allergen with natural exposur e. This form of treatment has been found to be very effective at reducing the severity of al lergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis and to have a beneficial impact in some patients with asthma. Th ere is also preliminary evidence that early use may also reduce disease progression from allerg ic rhinitis to asthma and reduce the development of new sensitisation. Injection of all ergen has been the traditional method of choice for several decades, but recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of high dose sublingual/oral immunotherapy, opening up this form of treatment to young children who The economic impact of allergic disease 6 might otherwise not have been able to tolerate trea tment by traditional Saltoun, 2002 ). This form of therapy has been shown to be cost effective compared to medication a lone (Keiding and Jorgensen, 2007; Petersen et al, 2005; Ariano et al, 2006).

FIGURE 1-4: ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS Source: Dr R Mullins. 1.2.2 ASTHMA Asthma is an inflammatory condition affecting the l argest to the smallest airways. The result is 'irritable' bronchial tubes that contract in res ponse to many irritants. In some cases, The economic impact of allergic disease 7 scarring of the airways with loss of lung capacity may result (Olaguibel Rivera et al, 2007). Most patients will have allergic rhinitis or eczema as well and there is also a strong genetic component. The major causes of airway inflammation are exposure to allergen (eg, dust mite, animals, cold air, mould spores or pollens), cigarette smoke and infections (the major trigger in infants). This provides a rationale for recommending avoidance of such factors, and using medications that reduce airway inflammati on when symptoms are regular or severe (Rimmer and Ruhno, 2006). Recurrent wheezing is common, affecting around one in three infants aged 3 years or younger, and one in ten children aged 6-7 years 5 (Asher et al, 2006). Allergy becomes a more important contributor as children age. Childr en with other evidence of allergy (eg, eczema, allergic rhinitis or food allergy), th ose sensitised to inhalant allergen and those with more regular symptoms (between respiratory inf ections), are more likely to have persistent symptoms into adult life. By contrast, those without evidence of allergy or frequent symptoms between respiratory infections, have a bet ter prognosis, with around three quarters growing out of their symptoms by their adu lt years (Sears et al, 2003). United Airways disease is a concept linking the inflammation that occurs in the upper and lower airways in patients with allergic disease. A round 80% of people with asthma suffer from rhinitis, and around one in four with rhinitis have asthma. In some, asthma may be the dominant presenting complaint, whereas in others, a sthma may be silent or subclinical, sometimes manifesting as complaints of lack of fitn ess or exercise-related complaints. There is accumulating evidence that treatment of rhinitis may improve asthma control and reduce exacerbations (Rimmer and Ruhno, 2006; al, 1999; Taramarcaz and Gibson, 2003; Passalacqua et a l, 2000). The principles of management are similar to those used in allergic rh initis; allergen minimisation, use of medication and specific allergen immunotherapy. Us e of a written management plan and regular review have been shown to reduce disease ex acerbation and hospital attendance (Bhogel et al, 2006). 1.2.3 CHRONIC SINUSITIS , NASAL POLYPS AND THE ASPIRIN TRIAD Chronic sinusitis is an inflammatory condition of the soft tissue li ning of the sinuses. Symptoms include nasal congestion, loss of sense of smell and taste, bad taste and bad breath, facial pain, sore teeth and purulent nasal discharge. Sinus drainage pathways are often blocked, leading to secondary infection and m any of the symptoms experienced. Not all patients with chronic sinusitis are allergic, a nd the degree to which allergic mechanisms (as opposed to other factors) contribute to this co ndition is uncertain, as opposed to acute sinusitis, where infections are much more common in those with allergic rhinitis (Cirillo et al, 2007). Theories as to its cause include chronic ba cterial or fungal infection. There is no evidence that treatment specifically directed at al lergies (allergen avoidance, immunotherapy) can alleviate the symptoms of sinusi tis but it may relieve superimposed allergic symptoms (Dolor et al, 2001; Borish, 2002; Vining, 2006). Approximately 30% of people are aspirin sensitive. Most patients are co -managed by allergy/immunology specialists and ear nose and throat (ENT) surgeons. Nasal polyps are soft, jelly-like overgrowths of the lining of the sinuses that occur in around 1 in 200 people. They look like grapes on the end of a stalk. Most develop by the age of 40 years. Polyps do not always cause symptoms. As they often grow through the tunnel that connects the sinuses to the nose, the result i s often a blocked nose. More importantly, 5 Note these prevalence rates are somewhat different from the findings for Australia presented in Chapt er 2. The economic impact of allergic disease 8 they can block the tunnels connecting the nose to t he sinus cavities. Like water in a stagnant pond, this often leads to frequent sinus infections . The cause is unknown, but chronic inflammation (from allergy or infection) may trigge r polyps and make them grow faster, and come back faster after sinus operations. Sometimes other conditions may occur with greater frequency in people with nasal polyps. These inclu de sinus infections, asthma and allergy to aspirin. Options for management include sinus surg ery to remove them (but 50% eventually recur), cortisone tablets to shrink their size (but this only offers temporary relief, and treatment is limited by side-effects) and topical s teroid sprays to slow their growth (Blaiss, 2005; Hissaria et al, 2006). The aspirin 'triad' (also known as Samter's triad ), is characterised by the development of adult onset asthma (not always allergic), nasal pol yps and aspirin allergy. People with this condition over-produce inflammatory chemicals known as leukotrienes. These chemicals are made by white cells in the tissues, which then attr act more white cells, which then produce more leukotrienes and so on. Leukotrienes also cau se mucus production in the lungs and make wheezing worse by triggering contraction of th e muscle around the airways in the lung. They also promote inflammation in the sinuses and c ause nasal polyps to grow faster, leading to blocked sinuses, the development of freq uent sinus infections and the need for antibiotics and sinus surgery. Even though these p atients are allergic to aspirin, most can be made to tolerate high doses by starting off at a ve ry low dose of aspirin initially and increasing it day by day. Once a higher dose is re ached (generally one to two tablets per day), there is reduced production of leukotrienes. Studies following patients over ten years have shown the benefit of aspirin desensitisation t o reduce asthma severity, the need for asthma medication, the rate of polyp regrowth, and the severity of sinusitis (Pfaar FIGURE 1-5: CT SINUSES Source: Dr R Mullins. 1.2.4 OTHER ALLERGIES 1.2.4.1 A TOPIC ECZEMA AND CONTACT DERMATITIS One of the earliest signs of allergies is atopic eczema , affecting around one in five infants, reducing to around one in six children aged 6-7 yea rs, one in ten children aged 13-14 years The economic impact of allergic disease 9 and one in 14 adults (Asher et al, 2006) 6. Dry scaly skin, scratch marks, weeping vesicles and sores can not only disturb sleep, but may also result in long term changes in skin pigmentation and thickening, and is sometimes compl icated by bacterial infection of the skin (Gold and Kemp, 2005; Katelaris and Peake, 2006). A number of factors can make the symptoms of eczema worse - the warmth of bed clothe s at night, winter heating, the use of soaps, swimming in chlorinated water, wearing wool or synthetics next to the skin, playing in sandpits, infection, allergen (such as dust mite or pet dander) and sometimes diet (Werfel et al, 2007). While atopic eczema may appear in isola tion, more commonly it is accompanied by allergic rhinitis and asthma, and in young infan ts with severe eczema, food allergy may occur in up to 30% of cases. Severe eczema has a s ubstantial effect on quality of life in the sufferer and their family, impacts on social functi oning, influences career choices and may result in substantial out of pocket costs for famil ies of young children. Beattie and Lewis- Jones (2006), studying a spectrum of chronic childh ood diseases found that impact of allergic dermatitis on the health-related quality o f life of children was greater than that from renal disease or cystic fibrosis. Measurements of t he impact on mothers of having a child with eczema is greater than for that experienced wi th a child with deafness or insulin dependent diabetes (Kadyk et al, 2003; Jowett and R yan, 1985; Housman et al, 2002; Faught et al, 2007; Kemp, 1999, Beattie and Lewis-J ones, 2006). In children with moderate to severe atopic eczema, around 50% will have persi stent symptoms into adult life (Williams and Strachan, 1998). FIGURE 1-6: ATOPIC ECZEMA Source: Dr P Smith. Contact allergic dermatitis (contact dermatitis) develops after skin contact with external allergens. A red, itchy and often blistering weepi ng rash develops, typically within a few days of contact with external allergens (Militello et al , 2006). Over 2,000 contact allergens have been identified, of which nickel, plants, perfumes, glues, dyes and cosmetic preservatives are the most common. Management involves identific ation and avoidance of the cause, and use of medication such as topical or oral corticost eroids if accidental exposure occurs. Contact allergic dermatitis is a major occupational problem in some industries, such as those involved in the food industry, health professions a nd hairdressing (eg, latex allergy) (Amado 6 Note these prevalence rates are somewhat different from the findings for Australia presented in Chapt er 2. The economic impact of allergic disease 10 and Taylor, 2006; Biebl and Warshaw, 2006; Dhir, airborne plant-derived allergens can also cause dermatitis. This is commonly known as ' Australian bush dermatitis', 'ragweed dermatitis' or 'weed dermatitis'. Dermatitis often occurs after being outside on windy days in the warmer months of the year, when wind-blown alle rgens come into contact with exposed areas of skin over the face, eyelids, sides of neck and 'V' area of the neck and upper chest. There is usually a sharp line between affected area s and normal skin protected by clothing. FIGURE 1-7: CONTACT ALLERGIC DERMATITIS Left: Contact dermatitis due to to nettle rash) is a common condition charact erised by itchy swelling of the skin. The lifetime incidence is estimated to be ap proximately one in six, with current prevalence estimated at one in one thousand. Infec tion is one of the most common triggers for symptoms, particularly in young children. Alle rgic reactions to food, medication or insect stings may also trigger short-lived episodes of hiv es, but in most cases, no cause is identified. Occasionally, urticaria is a recurrent problem that reappears throughout life, or a chronic condition that persists for many years (Gre aves, 2000). In recent years, evidence has arisen suggesting that chronic urticaria may be an autoimmune disease (Gratten, 2004). The mainstay of treatment is use of non-sedating an tihistamines, with the addition of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medication in refractory cases (Powell et al, 2007; Zuberbier et al, 2006). Chronic disease is associa ted with sleep disturbance, reduced productivity, psychological morbidity and changes i n quality of life comparable to that experienced in ischaemic heart disease (Poon et al, 1999; Beattie and Lewis-Jones, 2006). Severe symptoms frequently trigger attendance at ho spital accident and emergency facilities, and resulted in 1,977 admissions to Australian hosp itals in the 2004-05 financial year. Use of cheaper sedating antihistamines (as a cost-savin g measure) is associated with sedation, impaired motor skills and increased risk of work-re lated and motor vehicle accidents (Nolen, 1997; Storms, 1997). Angioedema is a related condition of the deeper parts of the skin, where swellings can also be painful, and sometimes involve the tongue or thr oat, causing difficulty breathing. Causes include infection, medications (specifically angiot ensin converting enzyme inhibitors and non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) and less commonly , hereditary angioedema due to deficient C1 inhibitor enzyme deficiency or dysfunction (Frig as and Park, 2006). Upper airway swelling (with or without difficulty breathing) may also prompt attendance at emergency facilities, is a source of anxiety and may sometime s be mistaken as anaphylaxis. The economic impact of allergic disease 11 FIGURE 1-8: URTICARIA Source: Dr R Mullins. FIGURE P Smith. 1.2.4.3 S TINGING INSECT ALLERGY AND BITES Local itch and swelling are very common from insect stings, such as those inflicted by honey bees, wasps and 'Jack Jumper' ants (JJAs). They us ually settle within a few days. Swelling can sometimes be severe, and can last up to a week. Fortunately, only a small proportion go on to develop generalised allergic reactions (such as hives all over) or more serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) with dangerous features, su ch as difficulty breathing or light headedness or loss of consciousness due to low bloo d pressure (vascular collapse) (Golden, 2007). Population surveys estimate that approximately 1% o f the population in endemic areas have experienced a potentially dangerous allergic reacti on to JJA stings and that between 1% and 2.7% have experienced allergic reactions to honey b ees (Brown et al, 2003, Douglas et al, 1998; Roberts-Thomson et al, 1985; Stuckey et al, 1 982). JJA anaphylaxis is a uniquely Australian problem. The economic impact of allergic disease 12 Allergic reactions to wasps are considered to be le ss common. Deaths from sting-related anaphylaxis in Australia are estimated at approxima tely 3.25 per year (bees 2; wasps 1; JJA 0.25 - Brown et al, 2001,2003a; McGain and Winkel, 2002). Management of these patients involves strategies to reduce the risk of accidenta l exposure, provision of emergency medication (injectable adrenaline, EpiPen) and the commencement of specific immunotherapy to 'switch off' the allergy and reduc e the risk of further reactions (Golden, 2007; Brown et al, 2003b), shown to improve quality of life in those with this condition (Oude Elberink and Dubois, 2003). Commercial extracts of honey bee and wasp venom are available as registered products for treatment of a ffected patients. While level 1 evidence of effectiveness of JJA venom immunotherapy has been d emonstrated in Australian studies (Brown et al, 2003c), availability of treatment has been hampered by the lack of funding to make such treatment more widely available, and for research studies to examine simplified treatment regimens. FIGURE 1-10: JACK JUMPER ANT FIGURE 1-11: PAPER WASP Source: Dr R Mullins. Mosquitoes and 'March flies' can cause nasty bites, but allergic reactions are exceedingly rare. One of the most common causes of severe irri tating reactions follow contact with caterpillars. The spines projecting from caterpill ars (or their dormant pupae on trees or in letter-boxes) can cause severe local irritation and pain from released toxins. Local pain and sores may develop from spider bites as well. Aller gic reactions to tick bites also occur usually with local swelling and itching only, but o ccasional life-threatening reactions to ticks have been reported, typically soon after the tick i s removed (Brown and Hamilton, 1998). Most bites result in minor local swelling that sett les within a few days. Occasionally, large hot local swellings that last several days to a wee k may occur, and can sometimes be mistaken for secondary infection. Rarely, local we eping blisters may occur at and around the bite site, which can be difficult to control and be distressing, particularly in young children. The economic impact of allergic disease 13 FIGURE 1-12: BLISTERING REACTION TO INSECT BITES Source: Dr R Mullins. 1.2.4.4 F OOD ALLERGY AND ASSOCIATED SYNDROMES Food allergy is estimated to affect 6% of young chi ldren and 3-4% of adults 7 (Milss et al, 2007; Venter et al, 2006a,b; Osterballe et al, 2005 ; Sicherer and Sampson 2006). 8 Recent studies from the UK and USA suggest that peanut all ergy has doubled in the last five years (Grundy et al, 2002; Sicherer et al, 2003). Admiss ions to hospital with anaphylaxis (which have been mainly attributed to food allergy) have a lso doubled in the last decade in both Australia and the UK, particularly in young childre n (Gupta et al, 2007; Mullins, 2007). The most common causes of food allergy in children are cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut/tree nuts and sesame seeds in young children. While the majo rity of those allergic to milk, egg, wheat or soy outgrow their allergies by school age, those allergic to nuts/peanuts, seeds or seafood usually have persistent allergy. The most common symptoms in infants are urticaria a nd/or vomiting within two hours of ingestion. In adults, a more diverse range of food s can trigger symptoms, but the majority are triggered by peanut, tree nuts, sesame seed or seafood (Allen et al, 2006; Sicherer and Sampson, 2006; Nowak-Wegrzyn and Sampson, 2006). A diagnosis of food allergy has a significant effect on quality of life in children a nd their parents, comparable on formal measurement with having a child with insulin depend ent diabetes. The source of stress is related more to perceptions of risk than actual epi sodes of allergic reactions, and the need for planning for outings, school camps, preparation of special meals and the need to liaise with other caregivers such as school and preschool staff (Marklund et al, 2004,2006,2007; Bollinger et al, 2006; Cohen et al, 2004; Avery et al, 2003; Sicherer et al, 2001; Hu et al, 2005). In adults with food allergy and anaphylaxis , psychological morbidity (including anxiety disorder and panic attacks) has been associated wit h episodes of anaphylaxis, which are frequently recurrent despite precautions to avoid t he trigger (Sampson et al, 2006; Mullins, 2003). 7. In a survey of 232 childcare centres and preschoo ls in the ACT and central Sydney in 2006 (13,573 chil dren enrolled), 6.6% were reported to have food allergy (2.1% allergic to peanut), see Loblay R et al (2006 ). 8 In Australia, a questionnaire-based study of 4,173 South Australian school children aged 3-18 years (p ublished in 2000) estimated an incidence of food allergy and food-induced anaphylaxis of 1.3% and 0.4% respecti vely (Boros et al, 2000). The economic impact of allergic disease 14 Oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food syndrome): Around one if ten people with seasonal allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis will develop it ch and irritation of the tongue, mouth and throat after ingestion of some fresh fruits and vegetables , known as Oral Allergy Syndrome (Mullins, in press). The majority of patients are a llergic to cross-reactive proteins common to some pollens and foods. Cooking normally destroys these protein allergens, so that the same food when cooked is often tolerated. While it is generally a benign disorder, angioedema or even anaphylaxis may occasionally occ ur, particularly if ingestion of a large amount of food allergen is followed by vigorous exe rcise. The mainstay of therapy is avoiding the food or cooking it well. Patients who are unable to tolerate fruit or vegetables in an uncooked form are forced to rely on well-cooked food in conjunction with vitamin supplements. Such people usually require advice fr om a specialist dietitian. There is preliminary evidence that this condition is becomin g increasingly common in adults, a not unexpected finding when one considers the recent ri se in allergic rhinitis (Egger inflammatory condition of the oesophagus, wh ere food allergy may play a causative role in the majority o f patients. In children, this condition tends to present as severe oesophageal reflux unresponsiv e to conventional medications, and adults can have a similar presentation, often accom panied by choking episodes and dysphagia of solid foods or even food impaction. I n recent reported studies, some groups claimed that a combination of skin prick testing an d food patch testing with staple foods, will identify potential food allergens which, if avoided , will result in a clinical improvement. This condition appears to not resolve. This is a comple x medical condition requiring the advice of gastroenterologist, allergy specialists and dietici ans. If suspected, referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended in the first inst ance to confirm the diagnosis, then an allergy specialist if confirmed. Therapy involves the use of diet manipulation, anti-reflux medication, the use of 'swallowed' asthma corticost eroids (Noel et al, 2004; Markowitz et al, 2003; Lucendo et al, 2004). Delayed immune-mediated reactions to food: The majority of allergic food reactions in infants result in immediate symptoms (eg, acute urt icaria, vomiting or asthma). Occasional children, however, do not have reactions that occur quickly. Instead, delayed immune reactions start after several hours or days, most c ommonly in response to dairy products, soy or wheat (Allen et al, 2006; Sicherer and Sampson, 2006; Nowak-Wegrzyn and Sampson, 2006). Patients generally present with one or more of severe atopic dermatitis/eczema, chronic diarrhoea (sometimes accompanied by blood), failure to thrive, or severe reflux of food or formula. Symptoms occur due to inflammatio n of the skin or gut, and result from attraction of white cells from the blood into the t issues. Routine allergy testing is often negative, making diagnosis more difficult. Diagnos is usually rests on the history of possible reactions to food, and responses to food withdrawal and re-challenge. Most of these delayed reactions resolve by the age of 3 years. At times, even small amounts of food allergen passing through breast milk can aggravate atopic ec zema or gut symptoms. Allergy testing of the infant may or may not be positive, depending on the mechanism of the sensitivity (immediate versus delayed). If one of these condit ions is suspected, specialist advice is indicated. The economic impact of allergic disease 15 FIGURE 1-13: CHILD WITH FOOD ALLERGY Source: Dr P Smith. Celiac disease is considered to be an autoimmune disorder resulti ng from exposure to dietary gluten within cereals, such as wheat, rye a nd barley. Previously considered to be a rare disease, population studies suggest a prevalen ce of approximately 1% of the population. Symptoms result from inflammation of the upper bowe l, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients and presentation with fatigue, anaemia, i ron deficiency and osteoporosis as well as the more classical symptoms of diarrhoea and weight loss. Management involves confirmation of the diagnosis by specific serologic al testing confirmed by biopsy of the duodenum and lifelong avoidance of dietary gluten ( Monsuur and Wijmenga, 2006; NIH Consensus Development Conference on Celiac Disease, 2004; Craig et al, 2007; Kwon and Farrell, 2006). 1.2.4.5 A DVERSE REACTIONS TO MEDICATION Allergic reactions to a large number of medicines c an occur. Reactions to pain killers or arthritis tablets (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, napr oxen) and antibiotics are the most common, but reactions have been described to many other med icines, including some herbal remedies such as echinacea, Royal Jelly and chamomile (Mulli ns RJ and Heddle R, 2004). Severity may range from mild rashes through to asthma and po tentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. While most adverse reactions to medication are due to side effects or dose-dependent toxicity, rather than immune-mediated reactions, ac curate diagnosis of drug-related allergy (where the immune system is involved) is essential (Romano and Demoly, 2007; Thien, 2006). Unnecessary avoidance of some medications ( such as penicillin) may impede necessary treatment, may result in selection of mor e expensive medication instead or, in some cases (such as patients wishing to enter the D efence Forces), influence their career options. Conversely, lack of appreciation of the c oncept of cross-reactivity may expose the patient to the unnecessary risk of re-exposure. The economic impact of allergic disease 16 Adverse reactions to drugs are common in hospitals and are a very significant and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality responsible for on e-fifth of in-hospital adverse events (Leape et al, 1991). Many of these reactions are du e to allergic drug reactions. In a recent large epidemiological survey from the UK, drug sens itivity accounts for 47% of all mortality due to generalised allergic shock (anaphylaxis) an d anaesthetic allergy accounts for 19% of total anaphylaxis deaths, nearly half of all drug-r elated deaths (Pumphrey et al, 2004). Allergic reactions to antibiotics and anaesthetics are one of the most common causes of drug reactions occurring in hospitals with very signific ant adverse consequences with respect to length of stay and patient outcomes (Classen et al, 1997). Aspirin allergies are estimated to occur in 1% of p eople overall, but in up to 10% of those with asthma (Vally et al, 2002). Allergic reaction s to medicines are no more likely to occur in people with other allergies (such as hay fever or e czema) than anyone else in the general population. While there are reports of some famili es who have many people with allergic reactions to medicine, most drug allergies are not inherited. In general practice surveys, allergic reactions to medication are estimated to have occurred in up to 1% of patients in the preceding six months . By contrast, allergic reactions to X-ray contrast agents and general anaesthetics (approxima tely one in 10,000 exposures) and vaccinations (approximately one in a million exposu res) are relatively rare (Cashman et al, 1991; Fisher and Baldo, 1993; D'Souza et al, 2000). When evaluating patients with possible drug allergy , the circumstances surrounding the episode are analysed to help determine the likeliho od of allergy being responsible. Unfortunately, the circumstances of such reactions are not always clear from the history, making evaluation of possible 'drug allergy' a comp lex process. Assessment is complicated by the fact that allergy testing is of predictive v alue for only a limited number of IgE-mediated reactions to some medications such as penicillin, s ome other antibiotics and anaesthetic agents. Testing for some drug allergies can be exp ensive (eg, penicillin minor determinants), and often requires hospital-based allergy services for their performance. For other medicines, such as painkillers (eg, aspirin) or tab let-only antibiotics, there is no accurate test to confirm the presence of allergy, and there is no validated test to help prove or exclude delayed hypersensitivity reactions. When it is important to prove or disprove sensitivi ty, deliberate challenge is sometimes required to determine the presence or absence of dr ug allergy. This is normally performed under medical supervision, using small doses first. Since some adverse reactions may be serious, the availability of specialised hospital-b ased allergy units is essential, even if initial evaluation is performed in community-based allergy/ immunology practices. The economic impact of allergic disease 17 FIGURE 1-14: ADVERSE DRUG REACTION Source: Dr R Mullins. 1.2.4.6 L ATEX ALLERGY Natural latex or rubber is a natural product obtain ed from the sap of the Havea tree. Preservatives, stabilisers and antioxidants may be added during manufacture to assist its stability. It may be dipped into a mould, then hea ted and dried. A dry powder lubricant (usually cornstarch) is often added to prevent the rubber surfaces from sticking together. Allergic reactions can occur to latex protein as we ll as the chemical preservatives added to it, but not to cornstarch. Allergic reactions to latex may be divided into two groups; immediate hypersensitivity (mediated by IgE) and contact alle rgic dermatitis (Katelaris, 2006). Around 1% of the general population is latex allergic, whe reas up to 7% of health care personnel have evidence of sensitisation to latex, with a low er proportion being clinically sensitive. /boxshadowdwn With immediate hypersensitivity, reactions can occur within minutes and include hives or swollen lips or face at the site of contac t. Others will develop irritation after wearing a condom, having a Pap smear taken or after dental treatment. Allergic rhinitis and asthma may occur, typically in an occupational (usually hospital) setting where frequent changing of gloves can result in suspensio n of fine latex particles in the air. More serious reactions can occur. In very sensitiv e people, rapid absorption of latex through moist surfaces such as the mouth, nose, thr oat, vagina or rectum can result in difficulty breathing, a drop in blood pressure or e ven shock and anaphylaxis. Those at greatest risk are health care workers, and those wi th a history of frequent latex exposure, such as patients with frequent surgery, p articularly in childhood (Bousquet et al, 2006). /boxshadowdwn Contact allergic dermatitis is a reaction to the chemicals added to rubber dur ing manufacture, but only occasionally to latex protein s. Rough, scaly and sometimes weeping rashes can develop within hours or days of contact. As with irritant dermatitis, absorption of latex through damaged skin increases the risk of later developing immediate and delayed contact allergy with continue d exposure. The economic impact of allergic disease 18 Proteins in latex are present in some foods as well . Latex-allergic people sometimes find that some foods cause an itchy mouth or throat swel ling. The most common foods described are banana and avocado and sometimes kiwi fruit, pa ssionfruit, plums, strawberry, tomato or other fruits. Symptoms arise from cross-reactive a llergic responses to protein allergens of similar structure present in latex, as well as othe r plants such as the fruit and vegetables mentioned above. These foods do not have to be avoi ded routinely - just if they cause problems. Management of established disease involves avoidanc e and substitution of non-latex containing gloves in those with occupational exposu res or in those undergoing medical procedures. Use of non-latex containing barrier co ntraceptives is also necessary. The provision of a MedicAlert bracelet is essential, in case a patient requires urgent medical care and is unable to warn health care workers of their sensitivity. There have been studies of immunotherapy to latex, but this is not established routine practice in this condition. Universal adoption in the workplace of low-protein, powder-free gloves and avoidance of latex in non-clinical areas (eg, cleaning, food pre paration) has been shown to dramatically reduce exposure and the risk of developing sensitis ation LaMontagne et al, 2006). 1.2.4.7 O CCUPATIONAL ALLERGY Occupational allergy is defined as the presence of allergy-related symptoms caused or aggravated by occupational exposure. Given the fre quency of allergic disorders and their increasing prevalence in Australia, identification of avoidable environmental triggers is an important part of management (Pedan and Bush, 2007; 2006). Examples of occupational allergy include: /boxshadowdwn contact dermatitis to preservatives in latex gloves - most commonly in health care workers; /boxshadowdwn occupational asthma and contact allergic dermatitis from hairdressing chemicals in hairdressers, and from flours and enzymes in bread- derived products; /boxshadowdwn occupational asthma and rhinitis from animal labora tory workers (and sometimes anaphylaxis); /boxshadowdwn contact allergic reactions to food in chefs and foo d handlers, sometimes leading to secondary food allergy and anaphylaxis; /boxshadowdwn contact allergic dermatitis to glues, perfumes, met als, garden plants, dyes and other chemicals - conditions affecting multiple industrie s; and /boxshadowdwn other occupational asthma from multiple triggers in cluding food proteins in processing plants, detergent enzymes, aluminium salts, paint p roducts (such as isocyanates), plastics industries, wood dust, insects (such as st orage mites, worms and flies), printing inks and soldering fumes. An accurate identification of occupational triggers forms not only the basis of sound clinical management, but also forms the basis of occupationa l health and safety practices, and has economic, social and legal consequences. Furthermo re, early identification of an occupational trigger may allow changes in work prac tice or occupation that may present as work-related problems from becoming (in some instan ces) a permanent disability that persists even after the triggering agent is removed . The economic impact of allergic disease 19 1.2.4.8 A NAPHYLAXIS Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction, resulti ng from massive release of inflammatory mediators, resulting in one or more of difficulty b reathing or vascular collapse. The most common triggers in infants and young children are f oods, with drug, latex and stinging insect allergy being relatively uncommon. Poorly controll ed asthma is the main risk factor for fatal anaphylaxis. The major triggers for anaphylaxis in adults are peanut, tree nuts, seafood and allergic reactions to medication and stinging insec ts. Death may occur from low oxygen levels due to upper airway swelling, constriction o f airways in the lung (bronchospasm) and mucus plugging, and/or shock due to massive dilatio n of blood vessels, leakage of fluid from the bloodstream into the tissues and reduced cardia c function. The cornerstones of initial management are placing the patient in the supine po sition, intramuscular adrenaline into the lateral thigh, intravenous fluids, support of the a irway and ventilation, and supplementary oxygen (Sicherer and Brown et al, 2006).

Estimates as to the incidence of new cases of anaph ylaxis are approximately one new case per 5,000 people per year, although even this may b e an underestimate (Lieberman et al, 2006)9. Evidence from the UK and Australia has shown evi dence of an increased incidence of anaphylaxis, with a doubling in admissions to Au stralian hospitals with this diagnosis over the last 12 years, with a disproportionate five-fol d increase in young infants less than 5 years of age (Gupta et al, 2007; Mullins, 2007). Special ist evaluation is recommended after a diagnosis of possible anaphylaxis, to identify or c onfirm the cause, to provide education on appropriate avoidance strategies, to assist draftin g an emergency action plan and to advise whether immunotherapy (eg, for venom allergy) is ap propriate. Such strategies have been 9 A recent study of children treated in a Brisbane acc ident and emergency department estimated a much hig her prevalence of 8 cases per 10,000 children aged less than 16 years (Braganza et al, 2005). Many of those who have experienced anaphylaxis will have further epis odes; an average of once every two years overall, w ith potentially dangerous allergic reactions once every ten years (Mullins, 2003). The relatively low adm ission rate to Australian public hospitals with anaphylaxis (80.3 p er million people per year) is the tip of the icebe rg in terms of incidence as the majority of cases are treated in a ccident and emergency departments and discharged. Furthermore, Australian studies have also shown that up to 40% patients do not seek medical assistance during an episode (Mullins, 2003). The economic impact of allergic disease 20 shown to reduce the rate of relapse and hospital ad mission (Kim et al, 2005; Choo and Sheikh, 2007; Kapoor et al, 2004). Psychological morbidity and negative impact on qual ity of life is common in patients and their caregivers, and some require emotional support and counselling as well as medical advice (Mullins, 2003; Elberink, 2006). Deaths from anaph ylaxis are relatively rare and, while attempts have been made to predict those at greates t risk, many of those described as having had fatal anaphylaxis have never had a serio us allergic reaction in the past. Provision of a written management plan and patient education in use of EpiPen has been shown to reduce anxiety and the rate of hospital pr esentation (Greenberger et al, 2007; Pumphrey and Gowland, 2007). P Smith. 1.2.4.9 H YPEREOSINOPHILIA SYNDROMES Hypereosinophilia is defined at the presence of sus tained high blood levels of white cells known as eosinophils. Minor elevations are common in various allergic disorders such as asthma allergic rhinitis and atopic eczema. Sustai ned high levels, however, pose the risk of damage to the lining of the heart and nerve endings , regardless of the cause of the elevation, because of the presence of toxic granules within th e eosinophil, which may release their contents into the tissues (Fletcher and Bain, 2007; Antoniu, 2006; Roufosse et al, 2006; of hypereosinophilia include drug allergy, p arasitic disease (rare in Australia), malignancy (lymphoma), vasculitis, some autoimmune disorders, eosinophilic leukaemia and the idiopathic hypereosinophilia syndromes. Clinic al manifestations may present as recurrent urticaria/angioedema, through to sinus di sease with nasal polyps, asthma-like symptoms, lung infiltrates presenting with pneumoni a-like symptoms (but unresponsive to antibiotics), recurrent abdominal pain, neuropathie s (nerve damage) and cardiomyopathy resulting from damage to the heart. More serious c ases may behave like a leukaemia even in the absence of malignancy. Treatment centres aro und immunosuppressive medication such as corticosteroids, cytotoxic and cancer chemo therapy agents, and interferon, as well as novel agents such as imatinib (Antoniu, 2006). 1.3 DIAGNOSIS OF ALLERGIC TRIGGERS - ALLERGY TESTING Allergy testing involves the detection of IgE antib odies directed against environmental allergens, either by skin prick testing (SPT) or bl ood allergy testing. This helps prove or The economic impact of allergic disease 21 disprove the presence of allergy as a contributor t o symptoms and facilitates the identification of avoidable triggers. Skin prick testing : SPT is most commonly performed on the forearm, a lthough the back is sometimes used. After first cleaning with alcohol, a drop of commercially-produced allergen extract is placed onto a marked area of skin. Usin g a sterile lancet, a small prick through the drop is made. This allows a small amount of allerg en to enter the skin, where it comes into direct contact with tissue mast cells. If a person is sensitised, release of mast cell mediators results in the appearance of a small mosquito-like lump. Results are recorded 15-20 minutes after application and are best expressed in terms o f the absolute wheal and flare size in millimetres. Testing is slightly uncomfortable, bu t usually well tolerated, even by small children. Intradermal testing : Intradermal skin testing (IDT) is also used under some specific circumstances to detect allergen specific IgE. A sm all amount of very dilute allergen is injected into the upper layers of the skin, normall y using a diabetic insulin syringe. It is a more uncomfortable test than SPT and so very rarely used in children. While it is more sensitive, is more likely to lead to false positive and clinically irrelevant results. For this reason, it is mainly used for evaluation of patient s with sensitivity to antibiotics or insect venom. FIGURE 1-17: SKIN PRICK TESTING SHOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHEALS AFTER 15 MINUTES Source: Dr R Mullins. Blood allergy testing (ImmunoCap, Immulite, RAST) : Blood allergy testing is also available for a selected range of allergens, and is most commonly used when SPT is not possible (eg, a patient taking antihistamines, or s omeone with severe atopic eczema) or inadvisable (eg, pregnancy). The usefulness of test ing is limited by: /boxshadowdwn the limited number of food allergen tests that have been validated for clinical relevance; /boxshadowdwn the limited number of allergens currently available ; and /boxshadowdwn the complexities of current Medicare funding arrang ements for the number of tests that are subsidised for any one blood collection. Patch testing is frequently used in the evaluation of patients w ith non-IgE mediated allergic reactions, most commonly contact allergic dermatiti s. Commercial extracts of allergen are applied under occlusion to the skin for a few days. The presence of a patch of dermatitis under the allergen extract indicates sensitivity. This testing is sometimes used for the The economic impact of allergic disease 22 evaluation of selected patients with suspected dela yed immune reactions to food or medications. FIGURE 1-18: PATCH TESTING Source: Dr R Mullins. Alternative testing : A number of unproven tests have been proposed fo r evaluating allergic patients including cytotoxic food testing, kinesiol ogy, Vega testing, pulse testing, reflexology and hair analysis. There is no scientific rationale for these methods. Results have not been reproducible when subject to rigorous testing and d o not correlate with clinical evidence of allergy. No Medicare rebate is available and their use is not advised. Issues surrounding the use of such tests and lack of evidence of benefit h as been examined in an ASCIA Position Statement: http://www.allergy.org.au/pospapers/unorthodox.htm (Beyer and Teuber, 2005). Allergic disorders are chronic conditions that can impact negatively on quality of life, cause significant discomfort, affect sleep, a nd impair learning, memory and behaviour in children (Santos et al, 2006; Baiardin i et al, 2006a,b; Chamlin, 2006). In children with severe food allergy, manag ement in the community is complex and has the potential to cause significant anxiety within affected families regarding care in schools, risk of death and the ne ed or otherwise for injectable adrenaline (Hu et al, 2005). For affected adults, allergic disorders lead to impaired quality of life, absenteeism from work, re duced productivity and can be a substantial financial burden. Most patients with allergic disorders have associated comorbidities, resulting in the need for multiple medical interventions. The strong genetic component in allergic disorders often results in several family members consuming multiple medications simultaneous ly for several years (Blaiss, 2000). 1.4 MORTALITY Allergies represent a group of chronic disorders in which morbidity rather than mortality is predominant. The major sources of mortality are as thma, and less commonly anaphylaxis, drug allergy and complications arising from surgica l care of sinusitis. Some deaths from anaphylaxis may also be erroneously classified as b eing due to asthma fatalities (Gupta et al, 2007) and even anaphylactic deaths may not be r ecognised (and thus be underreported) The economic impact of allergic disease 23 given the lack of any specific features (Schwartz e t al 1988, 1995; Low and Stables, 2006; Pumphrey and Roberts, 2000). Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 10 mortality data indicate 68 anaphylactic deaths over the perio d 1997 to 2004. A further 18 deaths over the same period have been attributed to adverse dru g reactions, of which an uncertain proportion may have had an allergic origin, and so may or may not have been counted in the anaphylactic deaths described above. In 2004, 318 people died from asthma (ABS 2006d). Available data on the relative risk of mortality fo r allergy-related conditions have been collected and combined according to their contribut ion to the overall prevalence of allergy. This makes it possible to estimate a combined relat ive risk of mortality due to allergy. /boxshadowdwn A relative risk (RR) of mortality due to asthma of 1.03 was calculated by comparing the proportion of deaths in the asthma population, sour ced from the AIHW publication Asthma in Australia 2005, with the deaths in the general population (sourced from the ABS). This RR of 1.03 was then applied to asthma a nd allergic rhinitis. /boxshadowdwn A RR of 1.0 for sinusitis was sourced from the AIHW burden of disease publication (Mathers et al, 1999) 11 . /boxshadowdwn Combining these two data with their contribution to the overall prevalence of allergy (Section 2.1) provides an estimated RR of 1.02 for other allergies. These estimates were triangulated against other available data, inc luding the AIHW anaphylaxis data above. Overall, this amounted to a RR of 1.02 for all alle rgy. This RR was then applied to prevalence of allergy in 2007 to estimate that ther e are around 586 deaths due to allergy in 2007. 10 AIHW special data request. 11 That is, the relative risk of death for someone wi th chronic sinusitis is modeled as being the same a s for the general population at large. The economic impact of allergic disease 24 2. PREVALENCE Prevalence refers to the number of people with alle rgic disease in a population at a given point or over a certain period of time (one year prevalence is estimated in this study). Allergies have emerged as a major public health pro blem in developed countries during the twentieth century, with particular impacts on child ren and young adults (Kemp et al, 2006; Linneberg, 2005; Isolauri et al, 2004). Allergies - especially the 'big three' of allergic rhinitis, asthma and sinusitis - affect millions of Australia ns. Australia and New Zealand have among the highest prevalence of allergic disorders in the developed world, with over 20% of 13-14 year olds having asthma-like symptoms, compared to less than 5% of children in Eastern Europe, some Asian and African countries (Asher et al, 2001,2006; Robertson et al, 2004). According to public sector sources, four of the top ten most common long term self-reported illnesses in youth aged 12-24 years in Australia ar e allergic rhinitis ('hay fever' - 14%), (NSW Health, 1997; AIHW, 2007). In addition to the prevalence reported for specific allergic conditions from the international literature (eg, Robertson et al, 1998; ISAAC Steeri ng Committee, 1998) and Australian studies (eg, Wilson et al, 2006; Robertson et al, 2 004; Downs et al, 2001) as presented in Chapter 1, Access Economics has investigated overal l prevalence of allergies, by age and gender, using data from the Australian Bureau of St atistics (ABS). Current prevalence is presented in Section 2.1 while Section 2.2 looks at trends in the changing prevalence of allergies and Section 2.3 makes projections of prev alence to 2050. 2.1 CURRENT PREVALENCE OF ALLERGIC DISORDERS The National Health Survey (NHS) (ABS, 2005) report s that in 2005 there were over three million cases of allergic rhinitis, over two millio n cases of asthma and over one million cases of chronic sinusitis. Additionally, there are a ho st of minor allergies that collectively accounted for another million cases (Table 2-1). TABLE 2-1: PREVALENCE OF ALLERGY -RELATED CONDITIONS BY TYPE (CASES ), AUSTRALIA , 2005 Condition Cases (millions) Allergic rhinitis 3.17 Asthma 2.01 Chronic sinusitis 1.82 Other allergies 1.04 Total cases 8.04 Source: ABS (2005). /boxshadowdwn The NHS sought self-diagnosis from respondents for each of the four categories in Table 2-1 above (see Appendix B for relevant detail s from the survey questionnaire). The categories \"asthma\" and \"chronic sinusitis\" ove r-estimate allergies, as these include non-allergic asthma and non-allergic sinusi tis. This report estimates the proportions of such conditions attributable to asth ma from attributable fractions provided by ASCIA (see below). The economic impact of allergic disease 25 /boxshadowdwn Where respondents gave further details on \"other al lergies\", if the allergic conditions were organ-specific, the NHS includes them under \"o ther diseases\" for those organs. For example, \"other eye contains both all ergic and non-allergic conjunctivitis, and \"other skin diseases\" an d non-allergic dermatitis/eczema 12 . /boxshadowdwn The Users Guide for the NHS (ABS, 2006c) states tha t the NHS category \"other allergies\" approximately matches the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2) rubric A92 \"Allergy/Allergic Reaction NOS\" - see Table 2-2 below for details.13 Where NHS respondents indicated non organ specific allergies, the NHS appears to have included these in its \"Other Allergies\" catego ry. This would include conditions such as angioneurotic oedema, which are not always caused by allergies. On balance however, by excluding organ-specific allergies, the \"other allergies\" category is likely to under-estimate the prevalence of According to the NHS data, asthma is the predominan t allergy of young people, with almost half a million cases occurring in children under th e age of 15 during 2005. However, the number of asthma cases steadily falls thereafter, w ith allergic rhinitis becoming the most prevalent condition in the mid-teenage years. Alle rgic rhinitis peaks for people in their late twenties to early thirties. The same age group als o sees chronic sinusitis rise to overtake asthma. Chronic sinusitis continues to increase in prevalence up until age 35-44, but allergic rhinitis still predominates to the oldest age group s (Figure 2-1). 12 Asher et al (2006) surveyed 2,968 Australian childr en between the ages of six and seven years, and fou nd that 17% had symptoms of eczema (the majority of which w ould probably be due to allergies). If prevalence rates in Australia were the same as in the US (Greaves, 2006) some 20,000 Australians would have urticaria. 13 The Users' Guide also states that \"Other Allergy\" the ICD-10 category \"Symptoms, signs & condit ions nec: Allergy (undefined). However, there is no clos ely matching ICD-10 category. \"Symptoms, signs & conditions\" is ICD-10 chapter R, which contains no allergic conditions. ICD-10 Chapter T \"Injury, poi soning and certain other consequences of external causes\" has a category (T78) that is a reasonably close match t o ICPC Rubric A92. While both matchings are approximate, g iven the ABS has given a numerical rubric for ICPC, thi s is probably a more reliable indication of \"Other Allerg y\" than the ICD-10 matching, which is only a vague textual description. 14 Using estimates derived from Australian and foreign studies, there could be up to 400,000 cases of foo d allergy (Sicherer and Sampson, 2006); 200,000 persons at risk of sting-related anaphylaxis (Douglas et al, 1998; Roberts-Thomson et al, 1985; Stuckey et al, 1982); a nd around 4,000 new cases of anaphylaxis per year (Lieberman et al, 2006). The economic impact of allergic disease 26 FIGURE 2-1: PREVALENCE OF ALLEGIES BY AGE (CASES ), AUSTRALIA , 2005 0100 200 allergic rhinitis Chronic sinusitis Allergy (undefined) Source: ABS (2005). To determine age and gender specific incidence rate s, 2001 NHS data were used, because the 2005 NHS data did not cross-tabulate age and ge nder (Figure 2-2). Prevalence was greater among females between the ages of 15 and 75 years, consistent with published data (Osman et al, 2007). Asthma was the dominant allerg y for those aged less than 15 years. The highest prevalence was found in young adults ag ed 25-34 years, when allergic rhinitis predominates. FIGURE 2-2: ALLERGIES , PREVALENCE RATES BY AGE People Males Females The economic impact of allergic disease 27 People may present with similar symptoms, yet not a ll have an allergic origin. As described in Section 1.2.1, patients with chronic rhinitis ma y have allergic rhinitis, or so-called non- allergic rhinitis, where only the former has a well -defined allergic mechanism. Similarly, a substantial proportion of people with asthma have n o evidence of allergic sensitisation, a condition described as 'intrinsic asthma'. Publis hed literature (Rimmer and Ruhno, 2006) and data supplied by Dr Mullins 15 suggest that the fraction of asthma that can be at tributed to allergy (AF) is 85%, the figure used in this analys is. While acute sinusitis is more common in patients wi th allergic rhinitis (Cirillo et al, 2007), it is more difficult to determine the contribution of all ergic disease to chronic sinusitis. The estimate of Steinke and Borish (2004) that approxi mately half of chronic sinusitis could be attributable to allergy is consistent with Australi an data indicating co-morbid allergic rhinitis in 49.5% of patients with chronic sinusitis (Mullins d ata). Gaby (2005), while agreeing that much of chronic sinusitis is allergic, considers th at this is most likely to be allergic fungal sinusitis 16 . However, even after removing non-allergic asthma an d non-allergic sinusitis, the sum of diagnosed allergy cases on the Mullins database is still 24% greater than the number of patients with allergic disease, consistent with the concept of comorbidity described elsewhere in this report 17 . Accordingly, in order to estimate the total numb er of people who suffer from allergies, we have scaled the NHS case totals down by 24% to estimate the number of people (as opposed to cases) of allergy i n Australia. This yields a total prevalence of 4.08 million people who suffered from allergies in 2007 (Table 2-4), which is significantly smaller than the total number of cases of various a llergic diseases, at 7.20 million, indicating the significant degree of comorbidity. Also, as sh own in Table 2-3, a greater proportion of women (21.3%) suffer from allergies than do men (17 .9%) /boxshadowdwn A similar outcome was derived using BEACH (Betterin g the Evaluation and Care of Health) data from the report Allergies in General Practice, April 2000 - March 2 006 published by the Australian General Practice Statis tics and Classification Centre (AGPSCC, 2007). The sum of allergy cases in this c ase was 17% greater than the number of allergy patients. (The Mullins data are used in preference to the BEACH data, as the former can identify specific patient c omorbidities whereas the later cannot). 15 Data supplied by Dr Mullins from de-identified rec ords, covering over 17,500 allergy patients seen in the ACT since 1995, from which diagnostic comorbidity can b e estimated. (By way of comparison, the NHS surveys 25,000 households.) The possibility of referral bia s in the data is acknowledged 16 The evidence linking allergic sinusitis with comor bid allergic rhinitis is not as clear cut as it is for allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. Accordingly, cases of allerg ic rhinitis are not automatically assumed to be dou ble-counted when calculating the total number of people with (o ne or more) allergies. Moreover, acute sinusitis i s much more common in people with allergic rhinitis. 17 In fact for person prevalence, asthma can be ignor ed entirely. If a case of asthma is allergic, the person has already been accounted for under allergic rhinitis. And if the case of asthma is non-allergic, it is n ot counted. The economic impact of allergic disease 28 TABLE 2-3: ALLERGY PREVALENCE RATES is estimated that: - 4.08 million Australians (19.6% of the population ) have at least one allergy, of which 2.23 million (55%) are female and 1.85 millio n (45%) are male; - the highest prevalence of allergies is in the wor king age population, with 78% of people with allergies aged 15 to 64 years (see char t below), and - there are 7.20 million cases of allergy (ie, an a verage of 1.74 comorbid allergies per person).

The economic impact of allergic disease 30 2.2 CHANGING PREVALENCE OF ALLERGIC DISEASES National and international studies have shown that allergies have become more common in recent times. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis and eczema has almost doubled over the last 10-15 years in Australia and New Zealand. Sim ilar to observations in the UK and USA, there is preliminary evidence that food allergy and potentially fatal allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have increased as well, predominantly in young children (Grundy et al, 2002; Sicherer et al, 2003). The emergence of new allerg y-related disorders such as eosinophilic oesophagitis in adults and children (Cherian et al, 2006), and the unabated increase in demand for hypoallergenic infant formulae are addit ional evidence that this growth in allergic disorders is yet to plateau. 2.2.1 ASTHMA , ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND ATOPIC ECZEMA The prevalence of asthma has increased substantiall y in Australia and New Zealand (and in other developed countries) for much of the last 20 years (Asher et al, 2006, Robertson et al, 1998; ISAAC, 1998), and has recently plateaued (Rob ertson et al, 2004) (Figure 2-3, Figure 2-4 and Figure 2-5). This has been achieved throug h the development of management plans in partnership between patient and medical professi onals, community education, and understanding of the role of allergy and developmen t of more effective medication. It is less well appreciated that other allergic dis orders have also become more common over this time in Australia and New Zealand, as they hav e abroad. Using standardised questionnaires, studies of Australian and New Zeala nd children and adults have shown an approximate doubling in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and eczema over the last 10-15 years (Robertson et al, 2004; Downs et al, 2001).

In a study of children aged 3- 4 years old on the Isle of Wight (UK) using a combination of population surveys, SPT and challeng e, sensitisation to peanut trebled from 1.1% to 3.3% between 1989 and 1994-6, with clinical reactivity increasing from 0.5% to an estimated 1.5% (Grundy et al, 2002). Similar chang es in peanut allergy prevalence from 0.6% to 1.2% between 1997 and 2002 were derived fro m a random digit telephone survey of American children, although without confirmatory SP T or challenge (Sicherer et al, 2003). The economic impact of allergic disease 32 While there have been no comparable epidemiological studies on food allergy in Australia, it is clear that hospital admissions for anaphylaxis h ave approximately doubled in Australia over the last 12 years, similar to findings in the UK (Mullins, 2007; Gupta et al, 2003). The changes in Australian age-adjusted admission rates for food induced anaphylaxis and total anaphylaxis over time were even more pronounced in young children aged 0-4 years, where admission rates increased five-fold over a 12 year period, and four-fold in older children aged 5-14 years, compared to an overall doubling in the population taken as a whole (Mullins, 2007). FIGURE 2-6: AUSTRALIAN AGE -ADJUSTED HOSPITAL ADMISSION RATES FOR ANAPHYLAXIS 020 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1993- 94 1994- 95 1995- 96 1996- (2007). 2.2.3 INDIRECT MEASURES OF CHANGING DISEASE PREVALENCE Measuring demand for allergy-related medication is a less direct and therefore less accurate measure of changing prevalence of allergic disease. Hypoallergenic infant formula prescriptions have increased four-fold in the five years ending 2004 (Figure 2-7) but, with significant regional variation in prescribing rates , this may reflect increased awareness, access to specialist services or inappropriate pres cribing as well as an increased incidence of food allergy in infants (Kemp, 2006). The last decade has also seen food allergy related disorders such as eosinophilic oesophagitis increas ing from 0.05 to 0.89 cases per 100,000 Western Australian children between 1995 and 2004 ( Cherian et al, 2006). The economic impact of allergic disease 33 FIGURE 2-7: ELEMENTAL (HYPOALLERGENIC ) INFANT FORMULA USE IN AUSTRALIA , 1994-2004 Source: Kemp (2006). A second indirect measurement of demand for allergy assessment can be gleaned by examination of Australian data for allergy testing in infants aged 0-4 years, which has increased three-fold over the last 12 years (Figure 2-8). While there are many ways to interpret more frequent testing (increased communit y awareness of allergy, more frequent allergy testing of infants with atopic eczema), inh alant allergy is relatively infrequent in young infants, and the data are consistent with increased rates of atopy in children noted in published studies.

The economic impact of allergic disease 34 2.3 PREVALENCE PROJECTIONS The literature and data from the previous section s uggested that, although the prevalence of symptomatic asthma has plateaued, (Robertson et al, 2004) there is reliable evidence of a recent significant rise in the prevalence of allerg ic rhinitis, eczema, food allergy and anaphylaxis in Australia. These trends have import ant implications for public health, medical workforce planning, costs of care and the availabil ity of public allergy/immunology services in Australia, that are currently lacking in some state s of Australia (eg, Tasmania and the Northern Territory). Data from the ABS National Health Surveys (1995, 20 01 and 2004-05) was used to estimate trends in prevalence rates for the various allergic conditions modelled (Table 2-5). Some caution should be applied when using these figures, however. /boxshadowdwn Only three points are available (ie, one from each survey) to estimate trends for each age-gender / disease combination. (Data are also a vailable from the 1989 NHS, but only for short-term conditions, without any age or gender splits. The broad totals do, however, support the trends observed in later years .) /boxshadowdwn The 1995 NHS, unlike later years, does not provide age or gender splits for long-term conditions. It does, however, provide age splits f or the same conditions where they have only been experienced over a short term. The short-term age splits have been applied to the long term totals. Within these age splits, the gender ratios from 2001 have been applied. Trends projected from ABS data support other availa ble evidence that prevalence rates for total allergies are increasing. However, this appe ars to be mostly driven by strong growth in allergic rhinitis prevalence rates, as rates for al lergic asthma, allergic chronic sinusitis and \"other allergies\" appear to be slowly decreasing. Linear estimation from the historical data suggests that the age-gender prevalence of allergie s has changed in Australia over the period 1995-2005, for males and females together, b y: /boxshadowdwn -0.08% per annum for allergic annum for allergic annum for allergic sinusitis; annum for other allergies; and /boxshadowdwn 0.09% per annum for all allergies. These overall trends, however, mask important age, gender and disease specific time trends. For example, some allergies (such as allergic rhini tis) are increasing in all age groups. Others (such as asthma) appear to be in decline. Wh ile \"other allergies\" appears to be in decline (more so in females), the end result may di ffer according to the respective contributions to this group of food allergy and ana phylaxis, which have rapidly increased in recent years. A major contribution to the prevalenc e of allergic disease will of course be related to our aging population. The economic impact of allergic disease 35 TABLE 2-5: PREVALENCE TRENDS BY AGE , GENDER AND ALLERGIC DISEASE , 1995-2005 National Health Surveys . The economic impact of allergic disease 36 The solid lines in Figure 2-9 indicate the extent t o which allergies may increase in the future simply due to a growing, ageing population (ie, ass uming the same age-gender prevalence rates as used to estimate 2007 prevalence). The br oken lines indicate the extent to which allergies can be expected to rise - beyond simple d emographic effects - if rising prevalence rates were to continue at their historical pace.

HEALTH SYSTEM EXPENDITURE Direct financial costs to the Australian health sys tem comprise the costs of running hospitals and nursing homes (buildings, care, consumables), G P and specialist services reimbursed through Medicare and private funds, the cost of pre scribed and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and private), allied health services, research and 'other' direct costs (such as health a dministration). There are essentially two ways of estimating each e lement of cost for each group: 1 top-down: data may be able to provide the total costs of a p rogram element and then allocate those costs by disease eg, health system e xpenditure by disease as estimated by the AIHW, for which asthma (but not non-asthma a llergies) is a component; or 2 bottom-up: data may be available for the number of people wit h a disease who experience a cost impact from the disease ('n') and the average cost impact. The product is the total cost eg, the number of emergen cy department visits to treat food allergy in a year multiplied by the average cost of an ED visit. 18 It is generally more desirable to use top-down nati onal datasets in order to derive national cost estimates for large and well-studied diseases such as asthma, rather than extrapolate bottom-up data from smaller partial datasets. Howe ver, using top-down estimates can be problematic in some areas where data are limited (e g, health costs for non-asthma allergies). In these cases, to obtain parameters for implementi ng the bottom-up approach, statistical analysis of datasets and a literature review (focus sing on Australian literature but sometimes supplemented by international material) has been us ed. Available Australian data on diseases and injuries and their associated costs are subject to considerable uncertainties, with a number of these detailed below. /boxshadowdwn Surveys : /g51/g51 /g51/g51 lack of consensus about definitions; /g51/g51 /g51/g51 lation focused; /g51/g51 /g51/g51 gaps timeframes; /g51/g51 /g51/g51 reluctance to report disease; /g51/g51 /g51/g51 limited and representativeness of t he sample; and /g51/g51 /g51/g51 survey limitations eg, the wording of questions may affect the answers given. /boxshadowdwn Costs : /g51/g51 /g51/g51 patchy administrative information on what proportio n of costs are attributable to different types of diseases; /g51/g51 /g51/g51 focus on other aspects of diseases (such as treatme nt outcomes), rather than on costs; 18 The bottom-up approach is also used to estimate so me indirect cost items such as productivity losses from absenteeism, where the average wage rate is multipl ied by the average number of days off due to allerg ies for the number of people to whom this applies. The top-dow n approach can often be used for program payments s uch as Centrelink payments or community programs such a s palliative care, which are allocable by disease ( although in the case of allergies palliative care expenditur e is not required). The economic impact of allergic disease 43 /g51/g51 /g51/g51 comorbidities: there may be another disease that is responsible for part (or all) of the costs (such as the presence of another chronic disease having a large impact on costs); /g51/g51 /g51/g51 two-way correlation or causation between variables eg, low socioeconomic status (SES) predisposing to illness and illness in turn a lso reducing income/SES; /g51/g51 /g51/g51 factor X: there may be another underlying cause of both a disease and the resulting cost, which makes them look like one is c aused by the other (for example, cigarette smoking resulting in both asthma and greater medical visits). These issues are addressed by controlling for other factors where possible, and conducting sensitivity analysis. Section 2.1 developed a total prevalence all allerg ic conditions by taking account of attributable fractions and netting out comorbiditie s. This in turn was used to derive a single combined prevalence rate for all allergic condition s, which was then applied to changing demographic cohorts to project prevalence in future years. A similar approach is adopted in this chapter for health costs. Total health costs for both asthma and all other allergies are developed for 2005 (the last year for which both NH S epidemiological and hospital casemix data are available). This total is then divided by the combined all-allergies prevalence rate to find the average health expenditure per person with allergies. Demographic changes are then applied to this per capita rate to find total expenditure in 2007. 3.1 ASTHMA Estimates for the direct health system costs of ast hma were drawn from statistics collected by the AIHW for all allergy-related disorders, base d on an extensive process developed in collaboration with the National Centre for Health P rogram Evaluation for the Disease Costs and Impact Study (DCIS). The approach measures heal th services utilisation and expenditure (private and public) for specific disea ses and disease groups in Australia (based on ICD-10 categorisation2). The DCIS methodology h as been gradually refined over the past decade to now estimate a range of direct healt h costs from hospital morbidity data, case mix data, BEACH data, the NHS and other sources. H ealth system costs were estimated by age, gender and type of cost (hospital inpatient, h ospital outpatient, out-of-hospital medical services, other professional services, pharmaceutic als, and research). However, the AIHW include only 87.5% of total recur rent health expenditure in their estimates of expenditure by disease and injury, ref erred to as 'allocated' health expenditure. The 'unallocated' remainder includes capital expend itures, expenditure on community health (excluding mental health), public health programs ( except cancer screening), health administration and health aids and appliances. Allowance has been made for the unallocated components of health system expenditure in the AIHW estimates. Top down expenditure on asthma of $803 million from the AIHW is presented in Table 3-1 for the year 2000-01. The economic impact of allergic disease 44 TABLE 3-1: HEALTH SYSTEM EXPENDITURE FOR ASTHMA , 2000-01 Category $m % Admitted patients 97.58 Non-admitted 2.1% medical services Other pharmaceuticals 296.04 73.83 100% Source: AIHW (2005). Assuming that both allergic and intrinsic asthma ge nerate roughly the same health system costs, then for each of the 2.20 million asthmatics reported in the 2001 NHS, average health expenditure would have been $360 (2001 dollars). T his cost is updated to current (2007) dollars by using an average annual health expenditu re inflation rate of 3.7%, to $448. Multiplying this by the estimated number of allergi c asthmatics in 2007 (1.80 million) yields a total health system expenditure for allergic asthma of $808.0 million in 2007 This total is then added to the total health system expenditur e for other allergies (Section 3.2) to obtain a total expenditure for 2007. 3.2 NON-ASTHMA ALLERGIES (NAA) For non-asthma allergies (NAA), health expenditure estimates had to be derived bottom up from BEACH data (AGPSCC, 2007) - Allergies in General Practice: April 2000 to March 2006 - which surveyed 27,916 people who visited their G P with at least one allergy (not including asthma). A total of 27,916 surveyed visi ts with allergy over six years translates to an average of 4,653 GP visits for allergy per year in the survey. Given the total BEACH sample size was 101,993 visits in 2006 (for all con ditions) and Australians made 95 million visits to their GP that year, applying the populati on to sample size relativity to surveyed NAA visits results in a total of 4.33 million NAA encou nters per year. This means that each of the 5.39 million cases of NAA in 2007 would have result ed in 0.8 GP encounters per person per year. However, allergy sufferers seem to have more than their fair share of comorbidities, as the BEACH data indicates that for each allergy visi t they also needed 0.75 other (non-allergy) problems dealt with (the average is around 0.3 othe r problems). Not surprisingly, two of the top three other complaints were asthma and upper re spiratory problems. This means that effectively only 57% of the cost of each encounter can be booked against NAA. All Medicare fees and AMA fees in the estimates bel ow are current at time of drafting (October 2007). 3.2.1 GP COSTS Standard GP consultation costs While people with allergy often had non-allergy iss ues that they wanted treated at the same visit, almost none wanted treatment for more than o ne allergy in the same visit. Although the The economic impact of allergic disease 45 same person may have two NAA conditions, to treat t hese conditions would usually require two visits by this person (reactions may occur at d ifferent times, for example - an insect sting and a sinusitis attack - so visits appear to only r arely be able to be combined). As the number of NAA problems treated was only 1.01 per en counter, costs per visit are treated as synonymous with costs per (allergy) case. Average costs per case are then multiplied by total cases in 2007 to derive total medical and pha rmaceutical expenditure. The BEACH report does not provide data on the lengt h of consultations, but as the overwhelming majority of total Medicare claims are for Level B consultations (less than 20 minutes), this is assumed to be the case for all ergies too. Taking into account bulk-billing rates and AMA recommended fees 19 , the average cost per encounter is $38.06 (Table 3 -2). TABLE 3-2: NAA GP COSTS GP Costs Cost per encounter Bulk billing rate (%) Standard Consultation of 20 minutes (MBS item 23) $ 32.10 77 Private fee $58.00 23 Average cost $38.06 Source: Medical Benefits Schedule Online http://www.health.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publish ing.nsf/Content/Medicare-Benefits-Schedule-MBS-1 The estimated 4.33 million GP encounters for NAA in 2007 cost $94.4 million (after allocating GP fees between NAA and other pr oblems dealt with at the same encounter). Longer consultation costs The most common therapy category, after pharmaceuti cals (next Section), reported by BEACH for GPs consulting people with NAA, was 'at l east one other treatment', which refers to clinical and procedural treatments provided by t he GP. In total there were 6,100 of these treatments (representing 22% of encounters). Four times out of five (81%), where the GP provided further treatment, this was clinical in th e form of advice, education and counselling on matters such as the nature of the allergy, and t he treatments and medications necessary to ameliorate it. Where GPs specify that they have provided 'at least one other (clinical) treatment', these are modelled as MBS Level C consu ltations, for which the recommended public and AMA fees are $60.95 and $106.00 respecti vely. Using the same bulk-billing rates as for general consultations, this yields an averag e fee of $71.31. However, as BEACH only provides point-in-time snapshots rather than patien t histories, these encounters are modelled as being the same ones already costed in Table 3-2 above, so only the difference between a Level B and Level C consultation ($33.25) is used i n these cases. It is estimated that, of the 4.33 million GP encounters, 768,746 were lon ger (Level C) consultations to deal with more complicated NAA cases. To accou nt for other conditions managed at the same encounter, as with short consultations only 57% of the cost of these has been attributed t o NAA. Since the cost of the short consultation (Level B) has already been inclu ded, these long consultations add a further $14.6 million towards t he total GP cost of NAA. 19 All bulk-billing percentages are from Medicare Onli ne Statistics for the last quarter covered by the BEACH report (March 2006) - http://www.health.gov.au/inte rnet/wcms/publishing.nsf/Content/medstat-mar06-tabl es-b. The economic impact of allergic disease 46 Procedures provided by GPs There were also 1,148 procedural treatments provide d by GPs (4.1% of all NAA encounters). The five most common of these (listed below) accoun ted for 91% of therapeutic procedures/surgery not elsewhere classified. The model uses a sensitivity test (MBS item 12000) - which appears to be the only allergy- specific treatment in the top five - as a cost prox y for these procedural treatments. The MBS fee for this service is $34.00 and the AMA fee $75. 00, which on a bulk-billing rate of 77% yields an average fee of $43.74. In total, there were an estimated 178,215 procedural treatments supplied by GPs for people with NAA as their main condition . As with all other GP encounters, 43% of the fees for these services are allocated to non-NAA complaints, leaving a total cost of $4.6 million for NAA GP procedures . This brings the total GP costs to $113.5 million in 2007 . 3.2.2 PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS The most common action taken by GPs to treat NAA is to give medication. In fact there were more medication treatments than there were encounte rs in the BEACH sample. Including over-the-counter, GP-supplied and prescriptions, th e 27,916 encounters resulted in 31,332 medication treatments. Of those patients given pre scriptions, 24% were for more than one medicine. Based on the top ten categories of medic ation (which account for the majority of all scripts), the average cost of medicines (if pre scribed) was $12.22 (Table 3-3). TABLE 3-3: NAA PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS Generic category % Pharmacy direct prices Most common branded medicine Betamethasone topical Source: AGPSCC (2007) and Pharmacy Direct - www.pharmacy direct.com.au, accessed 28 September 2007. The economic impact of allergic disease 47 An estimated 4.86 million medications were prescribed for NAA in 2007 , directly supplied or recommended (OTC), at a total cost of $59.4 million . These estimates may be conservative as they may und erstate the extent of pharmaceuticals used by people with NAA who self-medicate with acro ss the counter antihistamines and nasal steroid sprays and low dose topical cortisone creams and those paying retail prices greater than discount prices quoted above. Self-pr escribed asthma puffers, however, would be counted in the pharmaceutical cost of asthma. /boxshadowdwn Private correspondence with Synovate-Aztec (a marke t research firm) indicates that Australians annually purchase around $125 million w orth of OTC antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids for allergy treatment. BEACH data does not separately identify OTC medicines that GPs recommend patients purchase. However, prescribed (as opposed to GP supplied or OTC) medications acco unted for 77% of the total number of scripts. Assuming OTC and GP-supplied me dications had equal shares of the remainder, and that OTC medications had the sam e average cost as all medications from costs above ($12.22) indicates tha t only some $6.8 million of OTC medications are purchased as a result of GP recomme ndations. Thus, including this marketing data would increase total medication cost s by $118 million (or, averaged across all 4.1 million allergy sufferers, an extra $29 per person per year). However, due to data uncertainties, and erring on the side o f caution, these costs have not been included in the model. 3.2.3 PATHOLOGY COSTS The BEACH data show a total of 1,556 pathology test s ordered by GPs (5.6% of encounters) for NAA. The top four categories of MBS pathology groups accounted for 95% of these tests (Table 3-4), with blood allergy testing (RAST, Immu noCap) being a common order of GPs. Proxy items have been chosen for each category acco rding to either specificity to allergies, or else their overall frequency according to genera l Medicare statistics. Using a standard pathology bulk-billing rate of 86.3%, where a GP or ders a pathology test for a patient, the average cost is estimated as $20.04.

The economic impact of allergic disease 48 Some 241,553 pathology tests were ordered by GPs in relation to NAA in 2007, at an estimated total cost of $4.84 million . 3.2.4 SPECIALIST COSTS GPs referred patients to specialists in 1,275 cases (4.6% of encounters) 20 . The majority of these referrals were to organ-specialists, with onl y 21% of patients being referred to allergists. For costing purposes, most specialist referrals are assumed to be MBS item 104 (Specialist Consultation) for which the MBS fee is $75.60, the AMA fee is $132.00, and the bulk-billing rate is 25.5%, yielding an average fee of $117.62. 21 However, allergists, immunologists 22 and respiratory physicians are assumed to use MBS item 110 23 (extended consultation), for which the MBS fee is $133.35 and the AMA fee $240.00, making an average of $212.80. This brings the total average specialist fee to $141.93, and the total cost to $28.1 million in 2007.24 TABLE 3-5: NAA SPECIALIST REFERRALS BY TYPE % Fee dermatologist 455 $117.62 ENT 348 their patients to specialis ts in 2007 to provide advanced allergy treatment, at a cost of $28.1 million . 3.2.5 IMAGING COSTS Finally, GP ordered an imaging test for 1.5% of the ir allergy patients (424 encounters). The top five imaging services (Table 3-6) accounted for over 90% of all imaging services. Using a bulk-billing rate of 60.2%, the average cost of s uch imaging services was $252.92. 20 Referrals to allied health services, emergency dep artments and 'other' were also made in a 0.25% of encounters. 21 Fees are higher for these three classes as advised by ASCIA, bulk billing rates are the same. A dding in the MBS 110 increases the average specialist fee to $14 1.93 (from $117.62) and total specialist expenditure to $28.1m from $23.3m. 22 While allergist and immunologist can be considered synonymous terms, they are reported separately in BEACH data. 23 Consultant physicians, as a class, have significan tly longer appointments than other specialists. 24 The costs quoted in the table may be an underestim ate, as allergy skin prick testing, patch testing a nd measurements of lung function are used by several s pecialities as well as some GP's and pathology labor atories, which would result in higher Medicare-related and p rivate (out of pocket) costs.

A total of 65,822 diagnostic imaging services were requested b y GPs in 2007 in support of their patients with NAA, at a cost of $16.6 million . This estimate is conservative, as BEACH data do not include imaging services ordered by specialists.) 3.2.6 HOSPITAL INPATIENT COSTS The National Hospital Cost Data Collection 25 provides top-down data for the treatment of 'Allergic Reactions' (AR-DRG X61Z) in 2005 26 . The average cost per separation was $1,235 with almost half of this (46.5%) being for emergenc y and critical care (Table 3-7). Data from 2005 do not include private hospitals, although 200 3 data show that average private hospital costs were 19% lower than their public counterparts , yielding a cost per private separation of $1,002. In 2005 there were 4,405 separations (92% of which were in public hospitals) for a total cost of $5.36 million. Assuming that admissi ons for allergic reactions rises in line with the general population, in 2007 there would have been 4,532 separations , which in current prices (using health inflation of 3.7%) brings the inpatient cost to $5.9 million . 25 http://www.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/publishing. nsf/Content/88F4E78E15620A80CA2571CB0004DDAA includes anaphylactic shock due to food, anap hylactic shock due to drugs, other serum reactions, angioneurotic oedema, and \"unspecified allergies\" The economic impact of allergic disease 50 TABLE 3-7: COST PER SEPARATION FOR 'ALLERGIC REACTIONS ', PUBLIC HOSPITALS , 2005 Category Direct Overhead Total % Emergency the National Hospital Data Collection does no t provide specific cost estimates for other allergic conditions, approximations can be used. H ence for allergic respiratory conditions, this report uses DRG E02C \"Other respiratory proced ures (without complications); and for allergic skin conditions, the DRG J67A \"Minor skin disorders\". 27 The AIHW records that in 2004-05, there were 2,525 hospitalisations for skin allergies (see Table 3-8). Allowing for growth in line with popul ation indicates 2,598 separations in 2007. The average cost in public hospitals (81% of separa tions) was $3,194 per separation in 2004-05. Assuming private hospitals are 19% cheape r, the average price was $2,592. Allowing for health inflation brings the average co st per separation in 2007 to $3,311. Multiplying this by the 2,598 separations in 2007 g ives a total hospital cost of $8.60 million . TABLE 3-8: SKIN ALLERGY SEPARATIONS Hospital Morbidity Database http://www.a ihw.gov.au/hospitals/inhm_datab.cfm. Similarly, the AIHW records that there were 5,388 s eparations for allergic respiratory conditions in 2004-05 (see Table 3-9 below). Allow ing for growth in population indicates 5,544 separations in 2007. The average cost in pub lic hospitals (56% of hospitalisations) was $3,240, and private hospitals $2,624. Allowing for health inflation brings the average 27 In 2004-05 the AIHW records that there were 88 hosp italisations for \"allergic and dietetic \"acute atopic conjunctivitis\". These have not been costed. The economic impact of allergic disease 51 cost per separation in 2007 to $3,193. Multiplying this by the 5,544 separations in 2007 gives a total hospital cost of $17.70 million .

There a total of 12,674 hospital separations for (non-asthma) allerg ic conditions 2007, at a cost of $32.2 million . 3.2.7 SUMMARY OF NAA COSTS , 2007 For health expenditure to be presented on the same basis as asthma costs, allowances are made for hospital outpatients (non-admitted), aged care homes, allied health, research and non-allocated health costs using similar proportion s relative to the total as those for asthma (Table 3-10). Total health expenditure for NAA in 2007 was thus estimated as $349.3 million. Dividing this by the estimated 4.0 8 million people with allergies in 2007 yields health expenditure per person of $85.63 per annum 28 . TABLE 3-10: TOTAL HEALTH SYSTEM EXPENDITURE , NON -ASTHMA ALLERGIES , 2007 Category $m TOTAL $349.3 100% 28 The individual cost burden varies widely, and fall s more heavily on those with severe and chronic dis ease. Costs of antihistamines are approximately $24/month , nasal corticosteroids approximately $25/month, an d the PBS patient contribution to a single asthma medication or eczema topical corticosteroid at around $33/mon th. It is therefore not difficult for a patient with chronic urticaria to spend $288/year, a patient with severe allergic rhinitis $588/year (on antihistamines and a nasal steroid, a nd even more if they need eyedrops as well), or a p atient with allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic eczema needing all medications approximately $984/year out of poc ket. These costs are not subsidised by the PBS nor do they count towards the Medicare safety net. The economic impact of allergic disease 52 3.3 TOTAL HEALTH SYSTEM EXPENDITURE BY BEARER Adding the 2007 total expenditures for asthma ($808 .0 million) and other allergies ($306.8 million) yields a total expenditure for tha t year of $1.16 billion. Dividing this by the number of persons with allergies (4.08 million) pro duces an annual expenditure per person of $283.71. Based on the average distribution of who bears tota l health expenditure costs derived from AIHW (2007), the burden of this cost is apportioned as shown in Table 3-11. The largest shares are borne by the Federal Government (eg, Med icare and Pharmaceutical Benefits subsidies) and State Governments (eg, hospital cost s).

OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS In addition to health system costs, allergy also im poses a number of other important financial costs on society and the economy, including the fol lowing. /boxshadowdwn Productivity losses of people with allergic disease comprise those from employment impacts, absenteeism and/or premature mortality. /boxshadowdwn Carer costs comprise the value of care services provided in the community primarily by informal carers and not captured in health syste m costs. /boxshadowdwn Other costs comprise the cost of aids, home modifications and o ther pertinent financial costs not captured elsewhere. /boxshadowdwn Transfer costs comprise the DWL associated with government transfe rs such as taxation revenue foregone, welfare and disability p ayments. It is important to make the economic distinction be tween real and transfer costs. /boxshadowdwn Real costs use up real resources, such as capital or labour, or reduce the economy's overall capacity to produce goods and services. /boxshadowdwn Transfer payments involve payments from one economic agent to anothe r that do not use up real resources, for example, a disability su pport pension, or taxation revenue. Data on other financial costs are drawn from a vari ety of sources - for example, the literature (focusing on Australian literature but sometimes su pplemented by international material), data from the ABS Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC), ABS data on Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) and so on. 4.1 PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES Productivity losses are the cost of production that is lost when people with allergy are unable to work because of the condition. They may work le ss than they otherwise would (either being employed less, being absent more often or bei ng less productive while at work) or they may die prematurely. Access Economics adopts a hum an capital approach to measurement of productivity losses in developed countries. 4.1.1 EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS Allergy can affect a person's ability to work. If employment rates are lower for people with allergy, this loss in productivity represents a rea l cost to the economy. Data for the reduction in employment due to allergy was sourced from the A BS SDAC, which reported the likelihood of being employed if persons experienced allergy (7 2.9%) compared with the likelihood of being employed if they were in the general populati on (73.9%). Therefore, people with allergy had an overall employment reduction of around 1%. T his data was then combined with average weekly earnings (AWE) and employment rates for each respective age-gender group to calculate the lost earnings due to reduced employment. The annual cost of lost earnings due to reduced employment is estimate d at around $1.1 billion in 2007. The economic impact of allergic disease 54 4.1.2 ABSENTEEISM AND LOST HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTIVITY Allergy can adversely affect work performance throu gh absence from work due to the allergy ('absenteeism'). Absenteeism is measured by lookin g at the number of work days missed by people with allergy. Data for absenteeism were obt ained from the ABS NHS, which reported that there were 3,209,200 people with allergy takin g 1,083,200 days away per year due to their own illness 29 . This meant there were 0.34 days per person per y ear of absenteeism due to allergy. The same number of days is estimated t o be lost, for those who do not work, from their household productivity, which is valued at 30 % of the average wage rate. Based on these parameters and the AWE for each age- gender group, Access Economics estimates that in 2007, the total cost of absenteeism due to allergy is $196 million . This includes around $166 million due to absentee ism for people in paid work and around $31 million in lost househo ld productivity for those in unpaid work. 4.1.3 PRESENTEEISM Allergy can also affect a person's ability to work effectively while at work ('presenteeism'). Presenteeism can be estimated by multiplying the nu mber of days worked with allergy by the percentage reduction in effectiveness on days worke d with allergy. For example, four days worked with allergy with a 50% decrease in work eff ectiveness would result in an estimate of two reduced effectiveness work days. Lamb et al (2006), studying a broad cross section o f 8,267 employees at 47 employer locations across the US between 2001 and 2002, foun d that employees who experienced allergic rhinitis did so for 52.5 days per year, an d were unproductive for 2.3 hours per typical 8-hour work day while they were symptomatic. Given the lack of data and the relative similarities between the populations, these results have been applied to Australia. This allows us to isolate the days with lower productivi ty at 48.9 days per year and calculate a reduction of productivity of 3.9% per year for thos e with allergy. Using this proportion and the AWE for each age-gender group, the lost work ef fectiveness (or lost productivity) can then be calculated. Access Economics estimates that in 2007, the total cost of presenteeism due to allergy is $4.2 billion . 4.1.4 PREMATURE DEATH Section 1.4 estimated 586 deaths due to allergy in 2007 (298 males and 289 females). Based on this case mortality risk, and incorporatin g employment rates and estimates of average lifetime earnings for different age groups, the present value of lost earnings due to mortality among those who would otherwise have been employed is shown in Figure 4-1. 29 That is, as opposed to taking time off to care for someone else's illness The economic impact of allergic disease 55 The estimated annual cost due to lost productivity from premature death due to allergy is $83.6 million in 2007 . FIGURE 4-1: ALLERGY , COSTS OF PREMATURE MORTALITY BY AGE AND Source: Access Economics based a RR of mortality of 1 .02 for allergy across all ages. Premature death also leads to additional search and hiring costs for replacement workers. These are estimated as the number of people with al lergy who die prematurely (by age and gender) multiplied by their chance of being employe d multiplied by the search and hiring cost brought forward three years (the search and hiring cost is estimated as 26 weeks at AWE and the three year bring forward reflects average s taff turnover rates in Australia). In 2007, additional search and hiring costs are est imated as $118,172 for people with allergy , based on the present value of bringing forward th ree years of average cost of staff turnover (26 weeks at AWE) . 4.1.5 LOST TAXATION REVENUE Reduced earnings due to reduced workforce participa tion, absenteeism and premature death also have an effect on taxation revenue collected b y the Government. As well as forgone income (personal) taxation, there will also be a fa ll in indirect (consumption) tax, as those with lower incomes spend less on the consumption of goods and services. Personal income tax forgone is a product of the ave rage personal income tax rate (18.3%) and the forgone income. With allergy and lower inc ome, there will be less consumption of goods and services, with the indirect taxation rate estimated as 15.1%. These average taxation rates are derived for 2007 from the Access Economics macroeconomic model (AEM). The economic impact of allergic disease 56 Around $1.9 billion in lost potential tax revenue i s estimated to be incurred in 2007 , due to the reduced productivity of people with al lergy. Lost taxation revenue is considered a transfer paym ent, rather than an economic cost per se. However, raising additional taxation revenues does impose real efficiency costs on the Australian economy, known as deadweight losses (DWLs) . Administration of the taxation system costs around 1.25% of revenue raised (derive d from total amounts spent and revenue raised in 2000-01, relative to Commonwealth department running costs). Even larger DWLs arise from the distortionary impact of taxes on workers' work and consumption choices. These distortionary impacts are estimated to be 27.5% of each tax dollar collected (Lattimore, 1997 and used in Productivity Commissio n, 2003:6.15-6.16, with rationale). Altogether the DWL is 28.75% of the value of the ta xation forgone (Section 4.5). Access Economics estimates that around $0.7 billion in deadweight loss is incurred in 2007 , due to the additional taxation required to replac e that forgone due to lost productivity of people with allergy (Ta ble 4-1). TABLE 4-1: LOST EARNINGS AND TAXATION DUE TO ALLERGY , 2007 Average personal income tax rate* 18.3% Potential personal income tax lost $1.1 billion Average indirect tax rate* 15.1% Potential indirect tax lost $0.8 billion Total potential tax revenue lost $1.9 billion Deadweight loss from additional taxation $0.5 billi on * Source: Access Economics macroeconomic model (2007) . Welfare payments made to people who are no longer w orking must, in a budget-neutral setting, also be funded by additional taxation. Th e DWLs associated with welfare transfers are calculated in Section 4.5, where the nature of DWLs is explained in more detail. 4.2 CARER COSTS Carers are people who provide informal care to othe rs in need of assistance or support. Most informal carers are family or friends of the person receiving care. Carers may take time off work to accompany people with allergy to medical ap pointments, stay with them in hospital, or care for them at home. Carers may also take time off work to undertake many of the unpaid tasks that the person with allergy would do if they did not have allergy and were able to do these tasks. Data from the 2003 SDAC sourced specifically for th is report identified around 81,500 primary carers who cared for people with allergy as their main condition. However, it is important to avoid double counting t he people with allergy who would have received care anyway. As such it is necessary to id entify the 'excess' amount of care provided to people with allergy by calculating the usage rates of informal care for people with allergy (2.1% of people with allergies have a prima ry carer, where allergy is the main condition) and comparing them to informal care usag e rates for the general Australian population (2.4% of the general population have a p rimary carer, with very little difference in the age-gender distribution of the respective popul ations). In summary, SDAC data show that the use of carers is neither significantly low er nor higher by age and gender than for the The economic impact of allergic disease 57 general population. Hence, it was concluded that no additional costs (attributable to allergy) were incurred due to the use of informal c arers. /boxshadowdwn This is not to say that there are no additional cos ts imposed on people who care for people with allergies even where they would still h ave cared for them in the absence of the allergy. Parents, for example, may spend consi derable time moisturising a child with severe atopic dermatitis, undertaking allergen avoidance measures, taking them to medical appointments, or in extra time required to shop or prepare special meals for a child with food allergy. However, in the absence of solid data, no attempt has been made to quantify these costs. 4.3 AIDS AND HOME MODIFICATIONS People with allergies use aids such as dust mite co vers, asthma medication spacers, asthma nebulisers, wet dressings for eczema, special vacuu m cleaners, HEPA filters and allergen avoidance measures. However, in the absence of all ergy-specific studies, cost estimates for aids and home modifications are derived from previo usly estimated average costs for all persons with disabilities. Aids and home modifications are those not captured in formal health sector or disability services costs that include equipment and technolog y in order to assist with daily living. Estimates of aids and modifications costs are based on data from the ABS SDAC for people with allergy as their main condition. These data ar e then compared to utilisation rates of aids and modifications for the rest of the SDAC survey p opulation to estimate the 'excess' aids and modifications used by people with allergy, rela tive to people without allergy. Results from SDAC show that of those who reported a llergy as their main condition: /boxshadowdwn 66.9% used at least one type of self care aid compa red to 48.3% without; /boxshadowdwn 15.8% to 12.8% without; and /boxshadowdwn 11.5% made modifications to their home compared to 10.9% without. Costs for various products are based on prices prov ided by the Independent Living Centre NSW, the Victorian Aids and Equipment Program and p revious studies undertaken by Access Economics, inflated to 2007 prices. While so me equipment and modifications require large outlays but should last a number of years (eg , nebuliser machines), other devices need to be replaced more regularly (eg, plastic spacers crack in dishwashers).. Overall, the cost for aids and equipment for people with all ergy was estimated at around $259.1 million in 2007 - or $64 per person with allergy. As it is not known how much of this cost is subsidi sed by governments, paid for by the person with allergy or their family and friends, or paid for through community programs, the amount is allocated in four equal portions to the F ederal Government, State and Territory governments, family and friends and society/other. 4.4 FUNERAL COSTS The 'additional' cost of funerals borne by family a nd friends of people with allergy is based on the additional likelihood of death associated with allergy (Section 1.4) in the period that the person experiences it. However, some patients (par ticularly older patients) would have died during this time anyway. Eventually everyone must die and thus incur funeral expenses - so The economic impact of allergic disease 58 the true cost is the cost brought forward (adjusted for the likelihood of dying anyway in a given year). The BTRE (2000) calculated a weighted average cost of a funeral across all States and Territories, to estimate an Australian t otal average cost of $3,200 per person for 1996, or $4,154 per person who died in 2007 . The bring forward of funeral costs associated with premature death for people with allergy is estimated at around $2.4 million in 2007. 4.5 DEADWEIGHT LOSSES FROM TRANSFERS 4.5.1 WELFARE AND INCOME SUPPORT PAYMENTS Transfer payments represent a shift of resources fr om one economic entity to another. The act of taxation and redistribution creates distorti ons and inefficiencies in the economy, so transfers also involve real net costs to the econom y. Data regarding the number of people on income suppo rt payments was sourced from Centrelink Australia, specially for this report. I t was difficult to specifically identify individual s on income support due to allergy as this condition is not separately isolated in the Centrelink data. Instead, data from available allergy-related conditions such as asthma and eczema were used and combined with allergy-related attribu table fractions to conservatively estimate the number of income support recipients due to alle rgy. The most commonly received Centrelink work related benefit was the Disability Support Pension (DSP), which Access Economics conservatively estimates 5,726 people liv ing with allergy were receiving due to their allergies in June 2007. There were also an e stimated 1,962 people with allergy receiving Newstart Allowance (NA) and 37 people rec eiving Sickness Allowance (SA), due to their allergies. The value of these payments in 2007 is estimated to be around $89 million 30 . However, some of these people would have ordinarily received welf are payments which must be netted out to estimate the additional welfare payments due to all ergy, using a Melbourne University study (Tseng and Wilkins, 2002) about the 'reliance' of t he general population (aged 15-64 years) on income support of around 12%. Factoring down th e $89 million by this 12% gives a cost of welfare reliance on DSP, NA and SA due to allerg y of around $78 million per annum in 2007 . 4.5.2 DEADWEIGHT LOSSES The welfare payments calculated immediately above a re, like taxation revenue losses, not themselves economic costs but, rather, a financial transfer from taxpayers to the income support recipients. The real resource cost of thes e transfer payments is only the associated DWL. DWLs refer to the costs of administering welfare pe nsions and raising additional taxation revenues. Although invalid and sickness benefits a nd forgone taxation are transfers, not real costs (so should not be included in the estimation of total costs) it is still worthwhile 30 Based on a payment of $446.60 per fortnight for DSP; and $429.80 for NSA and SA. The economic impact of allergic disease 59 estimating them as that helps us understand how the total costs of allergy are shared between the taxpayer, the individual and other fina nciers. There are two sources of lost tax revenue that resu lt from the lower earnings - the potential income tax forgone and the potential indirect (cons umption) tax forgone. The latter is lost because, as income falls, so does consumption of go ods and services. The average personal income tax rate used is 18.3% and the aver age indirect taxation rate used is 15.1%, based on parameters for 2007 from the Access Econom ics macroeconomic model. Transfer payments (Government payments/services and taxes) are not a net cost to society as they represent a shift of consumption power from one group of individuals to another in society. If the act of taxation did not create dis tortions and inefficiencies in the economy, then transfers could be made without a net cost to society. However, through these distortions, taxation does impose a DWL on the econ omy. DWL is the loss of consumer and producer surplus, a s a result of the imposition of a distortion to the equilibrium (society preferred) l evel of output and prices. Taxes alter the price and quantity of goods sold compared to what t hey would be if the market were not distorted, and thus lead to some diminution in the value of trade between buyers and sellers that would otherwise be enjoyed (Figure 4-5). FIGURE 4-2: DWL OF TAXATION Price ($) Output Supply Demand Price plus Tax Price Taxation Revenue Actual Quantity Supplied Potential Quantity Supplied Deadweight Loss (cost of raising taxation revenue) The rate of DWL used in this report is 27.5 cents p er $1 of tax revenue raised plus 1.25 cents per $1 of tax revenue raised for Australian Taxatio n Office administration, based on Productivity Commission (2003) in turn derived from Lattimore (1997), ie, 28.75% overall. The total extra tax dollars required to be collecte d include: /boxshadowdwn the taxation revenue lost as a result of allergy an d its impacts (with $0.5 billion of DWL in the case of allergy); /boxshadowdwn the value of government services provided (includin g the Government-funded component of health system costs, with $0.2 billion of DWL); and The economic impact of allergic disease 60 /boxshadowdwn the additional induced social welfare payments requ ired to be paid (with $22 million of DWL). Thus the DWL for people with allergy in 2007 is est imated at around $0.8 billion. 4.6 SUMMARY OF OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS In total, the non-health related financial costs of allergy p ain are estimated to be around $6.6 billion in 2007 . TABLE 4-2: SUMMARY OF OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS OF ALLERGY , 2007 $ million Productivity costs 5,598.1 Lower productivity 4,192.9 Absenteeism 195.9 Lower employment 1,125.5 Premature death 83.6 Search and hiring costs 0.1 Carer costs 0.0 Aids and modifications 259.1 Funeral costs 2.4 Deadweight loss 782.7 Total other financial costs 6,642.3 The economic impact of allergic disease 61 5. BURDEN OF DISEASE The disability, loss of wellbeing and premature dea th that result from allergic disease are more difficult to measure, but have been analysed i n this chapter in terms of the years of healthy life lost, both quantitatively and qualitat ively, known as the 'burden of disease', with an imputed value of a statistical life year (VSLY) so as to compare these costs with financial costs of allergy. 5.1 METHODOLOGY - VALUING LIFE AND HEALTH Since Schelling's (1968) discussion of the economic s of life saving, the economic literature has properly focused on willingness to pay (willingness to accept) measures of mortality and morbidity risk. Using evidence of market trade -offs between risk and money, including numerous labour market and other studies (such as i nstalling smoke detectors, wearing seatbelts or bike helmets etc), economists have dev eloped estimates of the Value of a 'Statistical' Life (VSL). The willingness to pay approach estimates the value of life in terms of the amounts that individuals are prepared to pay to red uce risks to their lives. It uses stated or revealed preferences to ascertain the val ue people place on reducing risk to life and reflects the value of intangible e lements such as quality of life, health and leisure. While it overcomes the theoret ical difficulties of the human capital approach, it involves more empirical diffic ulties in measurement (BTE, 2000:20-21). Viscusi and Aldy (2002) summarise the extensive lit erature in this field, most of which has used econometric analysis to value mortality risk a nd the 'hedonic wage' by estimating compensating differentials for on-the-job risk expo sure in labour markets, in other words, determining what dollar amount would be accepted by an individual to induce him/her to increase the possibility of death or morbidity by a given percentage. They find the VSL ranges between US$4 million and US$9 million with a median of US$7 million (in year 2000 US dollars), similar but marginally higher than the VSL derived from US product and housing markets, and also marginally higher than non-US stu dies, although all in the same order of magnitude. They also review a parallel literature on the implicit value of the risk of non-fatal injuries. A particular life may be regarded as priceless, yet relatively low implicit values may be assigned to life because of the distinction between identified and anonymous (or 'statistical') lives. When a 'value of life' estimate is derived, it is not any particular person's life that is valued, bu t that of an unknown or statistical individual (Bureau of Transport and Regional Econom ics, 2002:19). Weaknesses in this approach, as with human capital, are that there can be substantial variation between individuals. Extraneous influenc es in labour markets such as imperfect information, income/wealth or power asymmetries can cause difficulty in correctly perceiving the risk or in negotiating an acceptably higher wag e. Viscusi and Aldy (2002) include some Australian stu dies in their meta-analysis, notably Kniesner and Leeth (1991) of the ABS with VSL of US 2000 $4.2 million and Miller et al (1997) of the National Occupational Health and Safe ty Commission (NOHSC) with quite a The economic impact of allergic disease 62 high VSL of US2000$11.3m-19.1 million (Viscusi and Aldy, 2002, Table 4, pp92-93). Since there are relatively few Australian studies, there is also the issue of converting foreign (US) data to Australian dollars using either exchange ra tes or purchasing power parity and choosing a period. Access Economics (2003) presents outcomes of studie s from Yale University (Nordhaus, 1999) - where VSL is estimated as $US2.66m; Univers ity of Chicago (Murphy and Topel, 1999) - US$5m; Cutler and Richardson (1998) - who m odel a common range from US$3m to US$7m, noting a literature range of $US0.6m to $ US13.5m per fatality prevented (1998 US dollars). These eminent researchers apply disco unt rates of 0% and 3% (favouring 3%) to the common range to derive an equivalent of $US 75,000 to $US 150,000 for a year of life gained. 5.1.1 DISABILITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (DALY S) AND QUALITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (QALY S) In an attempt to overcome some of the issues in rel ation to placing a dollar value on a human life, in the last decade an alternative approach to valuing human life has been derived. The approach is non-financial, where allergy, suffering and premature mortality are measured in terms of DALYs, with 0 representing a year of perfe ct health and 1 representing death (the converse of a QALY where 1 represents perfect healt h). This approach was developed by the World Health Organization, the World Bank and H arvard University and provides a comprehensive assessment of mortality and disabilit y from diseases, injuries and risk factors in 1990, projected to 2020 (Murray and Lopez, 1996) . Methods and data sources are detailed further in Murray et al (2001). The DALY approach has been adopted and applied in A ustralia by the AIHW with a separate comprehensive application in Victoria. Mathers et al (1999) from the AIHW estimate the BoD and injury in 1996, including separate identificati on of premature mortality; Years of Life Lost due to Premature Mortality (YLL), and morbidity; Ye ars of Healthy Life Lost due to Disability (YLD) components. In any year, the disability weig ht of a disease (for example, 0.18 for a broken wrist) reflects a relative health state. In this example, 0.18 would represent losing 18% of a year of healthy life because of the inflic ted injury. The DALY approach has been successful in avoiding t he subjectivity of individual valuation and is capable of overcoming the problem of compara bility between individuals and between nations, although nations have subsequently adopted variations in weighting systems. For example, in some countries DALYs are age-weighted f or older people although in Australia the minority approach is adopted - valuing a DALY e qually for people of all ages. The main problem with the DALY approach is that it is not financial and is thus not directly comparable with most other cost measures. In publi c policy making, therefore, there is always the temptation to re-apply a financial measu re conversion to ascertain the cost of an injury or fatality or the value of a preventive hea lth intervention. Such financial conversions tend to utilise 'willingness to pay' or risk-based labour market studies described above. The Department of Health and Ageing (based on work by Applied Economics) adopted a very conservative approach to this issue, placing t he value of a human life year at around A$60,000 per annum, which is lower than most intern ational lower bounds on the estimate. \"In order to convert DALYs into economic benefits, a dollar value per DALY is required. In this study, we follow the standard ap proach in the economics literature and derive the value of a healthy year f rom the value of life. For The economic impact of allergic disease 63 example, if the estimated value of life is A$2 mill ion, the average loss of healthy life is 40 years, and the discount rate is 5% per a nnum, the value of a healthy year would be $118,000. 31 Tolley, Kenkel and Fabian (1994) review the litera ture on valuing life and life years and conclude that a range of US$70,000 to US$175,000 per life year is reasonable. In a major study of the value of health of the US population, Cutler and Richardson (1997) ado pt an average value of US$100,000 in 1990 dollars for a healthy year. Although there is an extensive international litera ture on the value of life (Viscusi, 1993), there is little Australian research on this subject. As the Bureau of Transport Economics (BTE) (in BTE, 2000) notes, int ernational research using willingness to pay values usually places the value of life at somewhere between A$1.8 and A$4.3 million. On the other hand, values of life that reflect the present value of output lost (the human capital approach) a re usually under $1 million. The BTE (2000) adopts estimates of $1 million to $1 .4 million per fatality, reflecting a 7% and 4% discount rate respectively. The higher figure of $1.4 million is made up of loss of workforce productivit y of $540,000, loss of household productivity of $500,000 and loss of qual ity of life of $319,000. This is an unusual approach that combines human capital and willingness to pay concepts and adds household output to workforce out put. For this study, a value of $1 million and an equiva lent value of $60,000 for a healthy year are assumed. 32 In other words, the cost of a DALY is $60,000. Th is represents a conservative valuation of the estimate d willingness to pay values for human life that are used most often in similar stud ies. 33 \" (DoHA, 2003, pp11-12).\" As the citation concludes, the estimate of $60,000 per DALY is very low. The Viscusi (1993) meta-analysis referred to reviewed 24 studies with values of a human life ranging between $US 0.5 million and $US 16m, all in pre-1993 US dol lars. Even the lowest of these converted to 2003 Australian dollars at current exc hange rates, exceeds the estimate adopted ($1m) by nearly 25%. The BTE study tends t o disregard the literature at the higher end and also adopts a range (A$1-$1.4m) below the l ower bound of the international range that it identifies (A$1.8-$4.3m). The rationale for adopting these very low estimates is not provided explicitly. Certainly it is in the interests of fiscal restraint to present as low an estimate as possible. In contrast, the majority of the literature as deta iled above appears to support a higher estimate for VSL, as presented in Table 5-1, which Access Economics believes is important to consider in disease costing applications and dec isions. The US dollar values of the lower bound, midrange and upper bound are shown. The 'av erage' estimate is the average of the range excluding the high NOHSC outlier. Equal weig htings are used for and Aldy meta-analysis summarises $118,000/1.05 + $118 2 + ... + $118,000/(1.05). 40 [Access Economics comment: The actual value should be $116,5 56, not $118,000 even in round numbers.] 32 The equivalent value of $60,000 assumes, in broad terms, 40 years of lost life and a discount rate of 5%. [Access Economics comment: More accurately the figure should be $58,278.] 33 In addition to the cited references in the text, s ee for example Murphy and Topel's study (1999) on t he economic value of medical research. [Access Economics comment. Identical reference to our Murphy and Top el (1999).] The economic impact of allergic disease 64 /boxshadowdwn ABS study is Australian; and /boxshadowdwn Yale and Harvard studies are based on the conclusio ns of eminent researchers in the field after conducting literature analysis. Where there is no low or high US dollar estimate fo r a study, the midrange estimate is used to calculate the average. The midrange estimates a re converted to Australian dollars at purchasing power parity (as this is less volatile t han exchange rates) of USD=0.7281AUD for 2003 as estimated by the OECD. Access Economics concludes the VSL range in Austral ia lies between $3.7m and $9.6m 34 , with a mid-range estimate of $6.5m. These estimates have conservatively not been inflated to 2007 prices, given the uncertainty levels.

Choosing an appropriate discount rate for present v aluations in cost analysis is a subject of some debate, and can vary depending on what type of future income or cost stream is being considered. There is a substantial body of literat ure, which often provides conflicting advice, on the appropriate mechanism by which costs should be discounted over time, properly taking into account risks, inflation, positive time preference and expected productivity gains. The absolute minimum option that one can adopt in d iscounting future income and costs is to set future values in current day dollar terms on th e basis of a risk free assessment about the future (that is, assume the future flows are simila r to the certain flows attaching to a long term Government bond). Wages should be assumed to grow in dollar terms acc ording to best estimates for inflation and productivity growth. In selecting discount rat es for this project, we have thus settled upon the following as the preferred approach. 34 Calculated from the non-indexed studies themselves . Converting the Access Economics average estimates from USD to AUD at purchasing power parity (PPP) would p rovide slightly higher estimates - $3.9 million and $10.2m, with the same midrange estimate. The economic impact of allergic disease 65 /boxshadowdwn Positive time preference : Access Economics uses the long term nominal bond rate of 5.8% pa (from recent history) as the parameter f or this aspect of the discount rate (If there were no positive time preference, people woul d be indifferent between having something now or a long way off in the future, so t his applies to all flows of goods and services). /boxshadowdwn Inflation : The Reserve Bank has a clear mandate to pursue a monetary policy that delivers 2% to 3% inflation over the course of the economic cycle. This is a realistic longer run goal and we therefore use a value of 2.5 % pa for this variable (It is important to allow for inflation in order to derive a real (r ather than nominal) rate). Health inflation over recent years has been somewhat higher, at arou nd 3.2%. /boxshadowdwn Productivity growth : The Commonwealth Government's Intergenerational Report 2007 assumed productivity growth of 1.5% in the decade to 2010 and 1.75% thereafter. We suggest 1.75% for the purposes of t his analysis as many of the productivity costs extend past 2010. There are then three different real discount rates that should be applied: /boxshadowdwn To discount income streams of future earnings, the discount rate is: 5.8 - 2.5 - 1.75 = 1.55%. /boxshadowdwn To discount health costs, the discount rate is: 5.8 - (3.2 - 1.75) - 1.75 = 2.6%. /boxshadowdwn To discount other future streams (healthy life) the discount rate is: 5.8 - 2.5 = 3.3% While there may be sensible debate about whether he alth services (or other costs with a high labour component in their costs) should also deduct productivity growth from their discount rate, we argue that these costs grow in real terms over time significantly as a result of other factors such as new technologies and improved quali ty, and we could reasonably expect this to continue in the future. Discounting the VSL of $3.7m from Table 5-1 by the discount rate of 3.3% over an average 40 years expected life span (the average from the m eta-analysis of wage-risk studies) provides an estimate of the Value of a Statistical Life Year (VSLY) of $162,561. 5.2 BURDEN OF DISEASE DUE TO ALLERGY 5.2.1 DISABILITY WEIGHTS One of the main costs of allergy is the loss of wel lbeing and quality of life that it entails. This can be estimated by initially allocating a disabili ty weight to allergy. The disability 35 weights used in this study are based originally on those available from the AIHW (Mathers et al, 1999). /boxshadowdwn The available disability weight of 0.03 for people with asthma and the disability weight of 0.061 for people with sinusitis were used to con servatively estimate an overall disability weight for people with allergy of 0.037. This (weighted average) estimate was 35 The disability weights used in DALYs are objectivel y assessed by experts, and are preferred over the v arious subjective health utility indexes used in QALYs. QAL Ys also do not incorporate mortality. The economic impact of allergic disease 66 obtained by applying the attributable fractions of asthma and sinusitis to allergy outlined in Section 2.1 to estimate an overall disa bility weight for all allergies. 5.2.2 YEARS OF LIFE LOST DUE TO DISABILITY Based on the disability weight outlined above and t he total number of people experiencing allergy, the YLD for allergy has been calculated by gender (Table 5-2), for the year 2007. In total, YLD for allergy was an estimated 150,313 DALYs in 2007. TABLE 5-2: ESTIMATED YEARS OF HEALTHY LIFE LOST DUE TO DISABILITY (YLD), 2007 (DALY S) Estimated disability weight Prevalence 1,852,455 68,257 Females 0.037 2,226,961 82,056 5.2.3 YEARS OF LIFE DUE TO PREMATURE DEATH Based on the relative risk of mortality due to alle rgy outlined above in Section 1.4, it is estimated that there are around 586 deaths per year due to allergy . The years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) have been estimated fr om the age-gender distribution of deaths by the corresponding YLL for the age of deat h in the Standard Life Expectancy Table (West Level 26) with a discount rate of 3.3% and no age weighting (Table 5-3). In total, YLL for allergy was an estimated 5,831 DA LYs in 2007.

Figure 5-1 illustrates the YLD and YLL components b y age and gender. The greatest impact of allergy is in young adulthood to middle age, ref lecting the physiology of allergy and higher YLD due to the large number of Australians with all ergy in this cohort. /boxshadowdwn 77% of DALYs occur in the 15-64 age group - demonst rating that allergy has a significant impact on the workforce age population. Indicative of the greater prevalence and hence grea ter YLD, it can also be seen that the largest loss of wellbeing due to allergy in Austral ia is among women (54% of total DALYs).

The estimated gross cost of lost wellbeing from all ergy is $25.4 billion in 2007. This reflects the relatively high prevalen ce of allergy in the community and its disability weight of 0.037. 5.2.5 NET VALUE OF A HEALTHY LIFE LOST Bearing in mind that the wage-risk studies underlyi ng the calculation of the VSL take into account all known personal impacts - suffering and premature death, lost wages/income, out-of-pocket personal health costs and so on - the estimate of $25.4 billion should be treated as a 'gross' figure. However, costs specif ic to allergy that are unlikely to have entered into the thinking of people in the source w age/risk studies should not be netted out (eg, publicly financed health spending, care provid ed voluntarily). The results after netting out are presented in Table 5-4.

SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS The economic cost of allergy in 2007 is summarised in Table 6-1. /boxshadowdwn The total cost of allergy was estimated at $29.4 bi llion - or $7,200 per person with allergy. /boxshadowdwn The total financial cost of allergy was $7.8 billio n in 2007. This excludes the burden of disease component (the economic value of disabil ity and premature mortality). /g51/g51 /g51/g51 These are real economic costs that include producti vity losses (72%), health system costs (15%), deadweight (10%), and other indirect costs (3%).

Productivity costs are the next la rgest component, making up 19% and reflecting the relatively high prevalence and produ ctivity impact of allergy among the working age population. Health system costs represent a fu rther 4%, while DWLs and other indirect costs make up the remaining 4% (Figure 6-1).

ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGY SPECIALIST WORKFORCE This chapter examines the distribution of specialis t allergy/immunology services across Australia, including projections for future require ments. An allergy/immunology specialist is defined as a registered medical practitioner with r ecognised specialist qualifications in allergy/immunology whose work is principally concer ned with the discipline of allergy/immunology, including patient consultations , medical research, administration, teaching and medico legal consultations. The posit ions may be based in private practice, or may be salaried hospital or university positions. It does not include other practitioners who are not registered as allergy/immunology specialist s (but who practise in this area as part of their work), nor speciality trainees. The analysis in the chapter is qualitative in natur e, and it is recommended that a more rigorous quantitative analysis is undertaken to mor e thoroughly assess need (demand) and supply for services. Recommended modelling would u tilise Medicare data to assess service utilisation by age and gender of the patient and wo uld project this demand over future years based on different prevalence scenarios. Factors s uch as workplace feminisation impacts and changing work preferences should be incorporate d with sensitivity analysis conducted on these key parameters, to accurately determine ar eas of shortfall and to plan future training and placement needs. However, for the pur poses of this report, some very basic analysis is undertaken here that, nonetheless, reve als a potentially important policy challenge. 7.1 DATA SOURCES AND ASSUMPTIONS A prime data source for the analysis was an interna l anonymous workforce survey of ASCIA members performed in the first quarter of 2007. Th ere were 84 respondents from 112 active clinicians (of a total 130 Australian members) ie, a response rate of 75% of the active workforce. Age of planned retirement and number of retirees were calculated from survey data. Of the replies, 25% were from females, simil ar to the 20% overall female proportion of ASCIA specialist members. The AMWAC/AIHW report Female Participation in the Australian Medical Workforce, reported that the proportion of female specialists (on average) work shorter hours, retire on average at least five year s earlier than male specialists and contribute fewer FTE. However, for the purposes of this chapter, data were not adjusted based on gender, which has the effect of making any projected workforce shortages more conservative than if feminisation impacts were incl uded. Additional data examined included AIHW workforce da ta and data on trainees and recent graduates provided by the Royal Australasian Colleg e of Physicians. Population data were derived from ABS population estimates for 2007 usin g the Access Economics Macroeconomic Model. For each jurisdiction, the nu mber of clinicians known to be practising in a State/Territory was used. Since ACT and NSW c linicians serve an overlapping patient population, ACT and NSW data were pooled. ASCIA is not aware of any qualified allergy/immunology specialists who have not been id entified by this data. For the purposes of discussion, one Full Time Equivalent (FTE) is de fined as a clinician providing 25 hours of clinical patient care per week which, based on the current working hours relative characteristics from the survey (22.7 clinical of 4 3.1 total, Section 7.2), would imply a 47.5- hour full-time week for all activities (ie, includi ng administration, pathology and teaching). Sensitivity analysis would be recommended around th is parameter in more detailed modelling. The economic impact of allergic disease 72 7.2 CURRENT WORKFORCE Number and distribution : There are currently 112 clinically active allerg y/immunology specialists involved in patient care who are ASCIA members practising in six States and Territories; there are currently no allergy/immunol ogy specialists in Tasmania or the Northern Territory. All specialists are based in or near ca pital cities, although some undertake rural clinics. There is approximately one allergy/immuno logy specialist per 185,600 people in Australia, and one FTE allergy/immunology specialis t per 202,200 people in Australia, with significant regional variation. In Queensland ther e are relatively few specialists overall, and no public paediatric allergy/immunology services in Queensland hospitals, although plans to establish such a service in 2008 were announced by the Queensland Health Minister in May 2007. Recent announcements to enhance allergy serv ices in Western Australia were also announced in September 2007.

Note: There is substantial variation in the clinic al hours worked/week in various jurisdictions. Whil e the sample size is too small to assume that these differences are statistically significant, in reality relativel y minor regional variations in clinical hours worked (eg. in states with major research institutes such as WA) may have a major impact on clinical service availability and waiting times that may not be reflected in simple FTE/100, 000 data, as reflected in Table 7.4. Age and Gender : The mean and median age of specialists in the su rvey was 51 and 47 years respectively (range 28-70 years). The larges t ten-year cohort of those surveyed was aged between 61 and 70 years (25%). The proportion of female specialists and trainees was 20% and 57% respectively. Around 25 specialists are expected to retire in the five years following 2007, and 45 in the following ten years ( based on a survey question asking when they expected to retire). The economic impact of allergic disease 73 FIGURE 7-1: AGE DISTRIBUTION OF ALLERGY /IMMUNOLOGY SPECIALISTS , AUSTRALIA (YEAR Age (years) Source: ASCIA survey data. Working hours and characteristics : The mean number of hours worked was found in the survey to be 43.1 per week (median 43.0; range 12-7 0). Approximately 22.7 hours per week are spent in direct patient care of children (36.1% ) and adults (63.9%). Between the ages of 35 and 64 years, most specialists work 40 hours or more per week, while those over the age of 65 years tend to work part time. Other duties i nclude immunopathology (4.3 hours per week) and administration and teaching (15.9 hours/w eek). FIGURE 7-2: HOURS WORKED , CLINICAL PRACTICE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES Clinical (adult) Clinical (Paediatric) Pathology Admin/ Teaching Source: ASCIA survey data Training Arrangements : All training programs are based in large city te aching hospitals, most full time, and last between three to five year s depending on the mixture of immunopathology, clinical, research or combined tra ining programs chosen. Information from Dr M Cook and Dr R Wong from the Joint Immunology a nd Allergy training program run by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and Ro yal College of Pathologists of Australasia estimate that, as of July 2007, there w ere 27 approved allergy/immunology The economic impact of allergic disease 74 training positions and 28 trainees in Australia, wi th four expected to graduate with specialist qualifications by the end of 2007, and around six p er year thereafter. The age of current trainees ranges from 28 to 42 years (median 31.5 ye ars) and 16 of current trainees (57%) are women. In the years 2002 to 2007, the median a ge of graduation with full specialist qualifications was 35 years (range 33 to 47 years). This may increase with the impact of graduate medical programs on the age of entry to sp ecialist training schemes. The training centres are shown in Table 7-2.

Although no single measure ca n provide a definitive assessment, by examining each of the following metrics it is possi ble to gain a qualitative indication of whether the workforce is meeting current demand or if there is a significant shortfall or oversupply: The economic impact of allergic disease 75 /boxshadowdwn regional variations in specialist: population ratio (SPR) and access to care; /boxshadowdwn comparisons with other specialities; /boxshadowdwn waiting times for consultations; and /boxshadowdwn perceptions of allergy/immunology specialists of th e adequacy of the current workforce. Regional variation in allergy/immunology services : The regional variation in SPR suggests that the workforce is inadequate in Tasman ia and the Northern Territory where there are no specialists and in Queensland were the re are relatively few specialists overall and no public hospital paediatric allergy/immunolog y services. Access to services in rural areas is likely to be lower across all jurisdiction s, as almost all services are based in major regional or capital cities. International comparisons : Australia has approximately 0.65 allergy/immunol ogy specialists per 100,000 population (130 Fellows in a population of 20 million) positions, about the same as Canada (213 Fellows in a population of 33 million) and is low compared to the USA (1.05 per 100,000) 38 . Comparable data are not available for Europe (wh ere most allergy/immunology services are provided by a varie ty of non-vocationally trained speciality physicians), nor for the UK (where allergy care is similarly fragmented and in short supply). Comparison with other specialties : Allergy/immunology is a relatively small special ty, comprising only 112 clinically active individuals, which is only 0.65% of an estimated 17,134 practising specialists in Australia (AMWAC, 2004). The number of FTE per population allergy/immunology specialists is substantially les s than that of thoracic medicine, dermatology, ENT surgery and paediatrics, even thou gh allergy/immunology specialists consult in each of these areas as well as specialty -specific conditions such as anaphylaxis, food allergy, autoimmune disease and immunodeficien cy.

The economic impact of allergic disease 76 Consultation waiting times : For non-urgent conditions, mean waiting times fo r initial consultations from the survey are estimated as 13 w eeks in private consulting rooms and 18 weeks for public hospital clinics (where available) , with urgent cases given priority. The waiting time in Queensland for a standard first con sultation is well above the average for both private and public patients. The range of waiting times, however, is much longer; up to 48 weeks in some States and almost double that time in Queensland.

Conclusions : Overall, qualitative indicators suggest potentia l undersupply of allergy/immunology specialists with serious shortag es in some States and in rural areas. Further, specialists working in the field40 report that health care system changes have resulted in public hospitals becoming less willing to resource training positions or provide unfunded outpatient clinical services. This impact s not only on the provision of some essential clinical services that cannot be provided in private practice, but also hampers the training of undergraduates, general practitioners, other specialities and nursing staff. 7.4 PROJECTIONS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND Supply Trends : Based on the retirement intentions of respondent s to the ASCIA survey, a retirement age of 66 years was used for projection purposes. The representation of women in the workforce is currently 20% and it is expecte d that the proportion of women in the workforce will increase, as the number of female tr ainees continues to increase (currently 57%) and the large, predominantly male, cohort of s pecialists aged 55 years and over proceeds through to retirement. Based on recent gr aduates from the program and the number and stage of current trainees, an estimated four specialists will qualify by the end of 2007 and six specialists per year will graduate into the workforce over the next 5-10 years. The entry of these individuals into special ist clinical work may be delayed if they undertake a period of additional research or clinic al training abroad (as many do). It is anticipated that at least 41% of current allergy/im munology specialists will retire in the next ten years (although 55% of respondents indicated th eir plans to do so over the same period). Over the past five years 2002-2007, 14 new allergy/ immunology specialists graduated with specialist qualifications at a median age of 35 yea rs (range 33-47 years). Current retirement projections are shown below. It should be noted th at these are minimum numbers, based on 39 Since the completion of the survey, non-urgent wai ting times in the ACT have increased ACT to 3 month s (private clinics), 6 months (adult public clinics) and 9 months (paediatric public clinics; Dr Carolyn Hawkins, personal communication). Public hospital waiting ti mes in WA are currently 7 weeks (urgent cases) and 22 weeks (non urgent; Dr Richard Loh, personal communication ). ASCIA plans to repeat a more detailed workforce and patient access survey at the end of 2007. 40 R Mullins personal communication 15 October. The economic impact of allergic disease 77 those who responded to the 2007 workforce survey, a nd no data on planned retirements are available from the 28 active members who did not respond to the survey. If additional specialists from this group also retire (as is like ly), then workforce shortages are likely to be substantially greater than the data indicated in Ta ble 7-5 and Table 7-6. Indeed, factoring up by 1/75% to allow for the retirements from this gro up, would suggest the same number of specialists (115) at the end of 2017 as in 2007. T rainees may not ultimately undertake clinical work, in which case specialist numbers may actually contract over the next decade.

Addressing current regional shortfalls : Using a benchmark approach, to bring all jurisdictions into line with the levels of service availability in NSW and the ACT (one The economic impact of allergic disease 78 allergy/immunology specialist per 136,000 populatio n) would require the provision of 41 additional specialists - 21 extra in Queensland, 15 extra in Victoria, 4 in Tasmania and 1 extra in WA, while relocating a SA specialist to th e NT (Table 7-8).

Estimating future growth and needs : Australia's population is estimated to be growin g at a rate of 1.3% per annum net, taking into account b irth and death rates and net migration. Assuming the maintenance of the same SPR, populatio n growth alone of an additional 2.3 million over the next ten years would require a n additional 17 specialists over the same period. These estimates do not take into account t he potential for increased service demand driven by changing epidemiology of allergic disorde rs (allergic rhinitis, food allergy and anaphylaxis in particular) in Australia over the la st ten years. Taking into account extra retirements, the training lag (such that new entrants in 2007 would be graduates at end-2010), feminisation impacts (in creasing the FTE ratio from 1.10 to 1.15) and population growth, to correct the maldistributi on and achieve the NSW/ACT benchmark over the ten-year period in a manner believed to be achievable given training capacity would require increasing the number of graduates from six per year to 12 per year (Table 7-9). There is no allowance for attrition of students, mo rtality of students or specialists, other non- retirement workforce exits or higher allergy preval ence.

Australia would need 178 allergy/immunology special ists by 2017 to correct the maldistribution and achieve the NSW/ACT benchmark o ver the ten-year period. This The economic impact of allergic disease 79 contrasts with the likely 115 specialists who would be available if training places were kept at six per year. The additional 63 specialists could be achieved by training 127 over the period rather than 64, given the simple assumptions of thi s basic modelling. There would not be much impact by 2012, with the SPR only 0.52 compare d to 0.51 in the likely case; however, the benefits would start to emerge from 2013 onward s. 7.5 WORKFORCE CHALLENGES The analysis suggests that there are significant re gional and rural difficulties in accessing specialist care and that the overall supply of alle rgy/immunology specialists may be inadequate to meet growing demand. Not only is the re a current (and anticipated) shortage of trained allergy/immunology specialists, but ther e is little skilled capacity in primary medical care to manage many of these disorders. Contributi ng factors to this have been the relatively limited allergy/immunology content in medical schoo l curricula and privatisation of many hospital-based allergy/immunology services over the last 20 years, which together have constrained clinical exposure to the speciality by medical students and doctors in training, including by other relevant specialities such as pa ediatrics. Low levels of exposure and training can result in poor diagnosis and managemen t of allergic/immune disease that, in turn, can contribute to suboptimal patient outcomes , patient disillusionment with conventional medicine and increased uptake of unproven allergy t esting and therapies (Mullins et al, 2005; MacLennan et al, 2002; Goldrosen and Straus, 2004). Training places : A balance in supply to match a continued minimum growth rate in demand could be achieved by increasing the number of aller gy/immunology training places, in a staged manner (by three extra per year), from 6 in 2008 to 9 in 2009, 12 in 2010 and so on, to reach 33 in 2017. Given the 4-5 year training p rogram, there would be delays in flow on effects to the number of available specialists, but this training trajectory would be achievable in the medium term, with the projected trend in req uirements able to be further monitored and recommended increases in training positions adjuste d if necessary. Ideally, training positions should be increased pro portionately more in the comparatively less well endowed State of Queensland, as well as in Sou th Australia and Victoria, to allow for outreach services or rotations through the Northern Territory and Tasmania, respectively. In the short term it is likely that expanded services in allergy/immunology in under serviced areas will require recruitment of specialists from other areas to establish units and train future specialists. This may initially require outreach p rograms and specialist and trainee rotations to be negotiated across State borders. Given recen t changes in epidemiology, particular emphasis should be given to increasing the number o f paediatric allergy/immunology trainees. Gender issues : With workforce feminisation, each specialist on average is likely to contribute fewer lifetime hours in the future relat ive to the past (females lifetime hours are estimated as around 75% of male hours across all sp ecialties), which needs to be taken into account when considering calculating the number of training places required to meet future needs (AMWAC & AIHW 1996b). More detailed modellin g of the allergy/immunology workforce by age and gender would help improve the projections to more accurately account for feminisation than the approximations utilised h ere. Funding of training places and specialist units : The changes that are occurring in allergy/immunology practice are likely to continue and, as a result, the trend away from public hospital practice may lead to a decline in support for the funding of traditional hospital-based allergy/immunology training positions, normally fun ded by State governments. While opportunities exist for novel methods of training, such as the piloting of private/public training The economic impact of allergic disease 80 facilities in the future, hospital-based allergy/im munology services are essential for the provision of some essential clinical services (such as potentially dangerous drug and food challenges). They can serve as a resource for comm unity education as well as research. The existence of allergy/immunology departments in public hospitals provides a crucial recruitment tool for future specialists and is also an opportunity to increase exposure and skills for those entering primary care or other spe cialties at a later date. A number of current training places in Australia ar e dependent on the availability of funding, which is not always guaranteed. Some are funded on a temporary basis from hospital fellowships, or from a combination of one or more o f university, hospital discretionary and pathology laboratory-derived funds. New allergy/im munology training positions may need to be specifically and fully funded because most aller gy/immunology services (being provided on an outpatient basis) do not attract resources un der the current Commonwealth funding arrangements to hospitals. Consideration to guaran teed funding of current positions is thus also a priority. Changes to the training program are likely to requi re a financial commitment from both the Commonwealth and State/Territory governments, inclu ding funding specifically designated to take into account the funding of registrar position s and either VMO or staff specialist supervisors, together with the ancillary services r equired to maintain a fully functioning hospital-based service. It is recommended that Commonwealth, State and Terr itory health departments undertake negotiations with the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australasian So ciety for Clinical Immunology and Allergy for the establishment of additional training positi ons; with the additional positions to be introduced gradually where suitable support and tra ining programs are available. Introduction of short-term measures to meet localis ed service shortfalls may be required, given that the increased number of graduates will n ot make an effective contribution to the workforce until 2012 at the earliest. Structure of training : The increase in the number of trainees may requi re examination of a number of alternative models of training outside te aching hospitals, including a mix of public and private accredited training facilities. Ancillary education : Shortage of allergy/immunology specialists, regi onal inequality and privatisation of many hospital-based allergy servic es has a flow on effect in a lack of adequate exposure and training for other medical st udents (notably general practitioners) nurses, ancillary health care workers and the publi c. Increased ancillary education in undersupplied areas is also considered a priority, since these staff assist clinicians in patient management, and are involved in community outreach schemes for patient and community education. The economic impact of allergic disease 81 8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE In Australia there is a lack of public and professi onal appreciation of the impact of allergic and immune disorders on quality of life, and even l ess of the economic impact to society and individuals who suffer allergic disease. Raising a wareness of the economic and health impacts is an important factor in facilitating the early recognition and control of allergic disease. Development of a framework of best practice for man agement of allergic disease in Australia will be enhanced by: /boxshadowdwn timely access to specialist allergy/immunology serv ices; /boxshadowdwn access to early and accurate diagnosis; /boxshadowdwn access to affordable and cost-effective therapy and novel therapies; /boxshadowdwn support for community and medical education outside the current paradigm; /boxshadowdwn support for local research to develop interventiona l strategies to reduce the burden of disease in the community; and /boxshadowdwn development of a model of allergy as a chronic dise ase. 8.1 SPECIALIST ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGY SERVICES There is significant regional variability in access to specialist allergy/immunology services within Australia, with some regions such as Tasmani a and the Northern Territory having no access to specialist services. Other States such a s Queensland have no public hospital- based services for dealing with the increasing numb er of children with allergic disorders. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in some cases mini mum standards of care and service provision are not met. It is possible that the sho rtage of mainstream services in Australia has also contributed to the proliferation of dubious al lergy practice in the field of complementary and alternative medicine, where unproven techniques for diagnosis and treatment are used. The analysis in the previous chapter of this report suggests that there may be too few allergy/immunology specialists in Australia (and Ne w Zealand) to meet the growing needs of the population, in terms of delivering direct care in dedicated allergy/immunology centres and in providing training for other specialists, genera l practitioners and practice nurses. It should be possible for milder cases of allergy to be recog nised and treated in primary medical care so that only the most severe or complex cases need referral to specialist services. Management by an allergy specialist is an effective model for patient care, as most patients with allergic disorders have multiple comorbidities , and organ based specialists are poorly equipped to manage disorders falling outside their particular specialty. The community is likely to be best served by a combination of commun ity and hospital-based specialist allergy/immunology services, and a well educated me dical and paramedical community able to deal with more common and less serious issues. The overall supply of allergy/immunology specialist s in Australia is inadequate and there are significant regional and rural difficulties in acce ssing specialist care. Without prompt corrective action, the workforce may move towards a situation of worsening undersupply. The current projected levels of graduate output are unlikely to be sufficient to meet expected future requirements. The economic impact of allergic disease 82 The shortage of services in Australia has been acco mpanied by a proliferation of dubious allergy practice in the field of complementary and alternative medicine, where unproven techniques for diagnosis and treatment are used. T hese result in delayed and ineffective treatment, and at times inappropriate and occasiona lly harmful treatment. This can place an additional burden on the conventional healthcare sy stem, where patients need to be re- educated and re-evaluated regarding the presence or absence of allergic disease, at times when none exists. Access to care is currently impeded by a number of factors including: /boxshadowdwn the rise in prevalence of allergic diseases saturat ing current service capacity; /boxshadowdwn regional inequalities in accessing specialist servi ces in some States, Territories and rural areas; and /boxshadowdwn current and anticipated specialist workforce shorta ges. The provision of additional specialists is currentl y hampered by: /boxshadowdwn the relatively low number of trainees currently; /boxshadowdwn the lack of guaranteed training places in some inst itutions; and /boxshadowdwn health care system changes resulting in public hosp itals becoming less willing to resource training positions or provide unfunded out patient clinical services. The privatisation (or closure) of many hospital-based a llergy/immunology services has impacted not only the provision of some essential c linical services that cannot be provided in private practice, but clinicians report it also hampers the training of undergraduates, general practitioners, other specia lities and nursing staff 41 . Changes in the epidemiology of allergic disease and allergy/immunology practice need to be recognised. With increasing numbers of children be ing evaluated for food allergy comes the need to undertake deliberate food challenges to det ermine whether the child has grown out of a sensitivity, or in other cases, to prove or di sprove clinical allergy in the patient with a positive allergy test. Deliberate challenges with medication are also required under a number of other circumstances, including the evalua tion of patients with possible drug sensitivity, and also in the management of patients with the aspirin triad, characterised by asthma, nasal polyps and aspirin allergy. Such pat ients have frequent sinus infections, require repeat sinus surgery to remove nasal polyps and are high-level consumers of antibiotics. If these patients are shown to be sen sitive to aspirin, desensitisation procedures can improve quality of life, reduce the need for an tibiotics, improve asthma control with less medication and reduce the need for further surgery. Rush desensitisation is a procedure most commonly u sed to treat patients with insect venom allergy. Instead of weekly injections over many mo nths (with the need for time off work, and multiple medical visits and waiting periods after a n injection), the patient can reach maintenance within two half day sessions as an inpa tient or hospital clinic. While this procedure is resource intensive in terms of staff t ime and the need for inpatient facilities, it is likely to be cost effective long term as patients r equire less time off work, with fewer injections in the first few months of treatment, fe wer outpatient visits to doctors (with the cost involved), and patients reach a protective dose qui ckly. Further cost effectiveness analysis would be desirable to validate this in an Australia n context. Similar protocols may have a role to play in the future in the management of pat ients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, 41 R Mullins personal communication 15 October. The economic impact of allergic disease 83 treated with aeroallergen extracts. Since such pro cedures are of their nature potentially risky, they need to be undertaken within hospital-b ased institutions in most cases. Access to care would be enhanced by the following i nitiatives. /boxshadowdwn Guarantees of specific funding for current and addi tional specialist allergy/immunology training places: It is important to note that one FTE specialist i s required per training position for registrars, acco rding to the criteria of the College of Physicians and pathologist criteria. The ability t o undertake training (whether it be for specialist registrar trainees, other specialties or general practitioners), is therefore entirely dependent on infrastructure which includes institutional-based allergy specialists. /boxshadowdwn Support for hospital-based allergy/immunology units to provide both inpatient and outpatient services: Funding of additional academic chairs in allergy/i mmunology is one option to consider, as such institutions att ract those interested in clinical disease as well as research, and would be a focus for the i ntroduction of novel treatments (such as immunotherapy for food allergy). /boxshadowdwn Specific funding for specialist outreach services f or rural and remote areas . /boxshadowdwn Development of funding models (through Medicare Aus tralia) for item numbers to support: /g51/g51 /g51/g51 teleconferencing so that non-allergy specialists ca n access specialist advice, similar to current item numbers (353, 355, 356, 357 and 358) to support teleconsultation for psychiatric patients in remote areas; /g51/g51 /g51/g51 telephone consultations between specialists and pat ients in remote areas where clinically appropriate; and /g51/g51 /g51/g51 changing allergy practice that includes drug and fo od challenges within a hospital environment, and 'rush immunotherapy' procedures Ideally, training positions should be increased pro portionately more in the comparatively less well endowed State of Queensland, as well as in Sou th Australia and Victoria, to allow for outreach services or rotations through the Northern Territory and Tasmania respectively. In the short term it is likely that expanded services in allergy/immunology in under serviced areas such as Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Queensland will require recruitment of specialists from other areas to establish units and train future specialists. This may initially require outreach programs and specialist and traine e rotations to be negotiated across State borders. Given recent changes in epidemiology, par ticular emphasis should be given to increasing the number of paediatric allergy/immunol ogy trainees. 8.2 ACCURATE AND EARLY DIAGNOSIS Access to accurate allergy and immunology testing i s required to identify avoidable allergens, to identify targets for specific immunotherapy, and (at times) to exclude allergy as a potential contributor to symptoms. Much of allergy assessmen t involves correcting misinformation. Access to accurate testing allows patients and thei r carers to undertake measures of proven effectiveness, and reduces the risk that the vacuum will be filled by unproven tests and procedures and ineffective treatments that are comm only promoted in the community. Accurate and early allergy diagnosis requires the r egistration of reagents for SPT, including the availability of positive control solutions such as histamine or codeine, some of which are currently not available or remain unregistered. The economic impact of allergic disease 84 Methods of allergy testing are currently hampered b y the financial bias towards measuring total IgE (a test of limited clinical usefulness) c ompared to measurement of allergen specific IgE. Currently, Medicare rebates to pathology labo ratories are structured so that measurements of more than four allergens during any single episode are not rebated to the requesting laboratory. This encourages inappropria te test ordering by doctors to minimise the out of pocket cost to patients. Unfortunately, this approach often provides confusing, irrelevant and sometimes misleading results. It al so impairs the care of patients who may have co-existent food and aeroallergen sensitivity. Patients with allergic disease often have more than one coexistent problem, and appropriate clinical care involves assessment of all conditions simultaneously. A patient with allergic respiratory disease may have eczema, food allergy, or contact allergic dermatitis. Contact allergic dermatitis is more common in patients with IgE mediated hypersensitivity, and may sometimes be confused by some general practitioners with angioedema/food allergy. The current Medicare schedule does not provide for pati ent rebates for SPT for measurement of allergen specific IgE (relevant to immediate hypers ensitivity to food, aeroallergens or sting or drug allergy), and patch testing (used to assessed contact allergic dermatitis) on the same occasion. The current Medicare structure does not encourage the assessment of coexistent allergy related conditions, and has the potential t o reduce efficiency by encouraging separate visits to assess and test for separate conditions. This is of particular importance when assessing patients from remote areas, where access to specialist medical care is often more difficult. The specialty of allergy and clinical immunology de als with a relatively large number of rare and orphan diseases for which some genetic testing is available. Because these conditions are rare, some tests are performed only occasionall y, usually in the setting of hospital/university laboratories with specialised e xpertise. Many of these low volume tests are labour intensive, cannot be automated, and econ omies from high volume turnover cannot be achieved. Access to accurate and clinically useful diagnostic tests would be enhanced by the following. /boxshadowdwn Access to diagnostic reagents for SPT and immunothe rapy . This would require a collaborative approach between manufacturers, the T herapeutic Goods Administration and the ASCIA to identify key allergens to which ac cess is required. /boxshadowdwn Revision of the Medicare schedule to: /g51/g51 /g51/g51 facilitate measurement of a single allergen specifi c IgE to more than four allergens at a time (where clinically relevant rele vance to the underlying clinical condition) would facilitate patient assessment; and /g51/g51 /g51/g51 allow for simultaneous assessment of immediate (IgE -mediated) and delayed hypersensitivity/contact provide for 'orphan tests' for rare diseases and no vel therapeutic agents. /boxshadowdwn Consider PBS subsidy for reagents such as penicilli n minor determinants which are not affordable for some patients, in the contex t of diagnostic procedures such as intradermal testing for drug sensitivity. 8.3 AFFORDABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MEDICAL THERAPY Allergic disease is not only common, but many patie nts have multiple coexistent disorders, each requiring specific interventions including pre scribed or non-prescribed medication or treatments. The genetic clustering of allergic dis ease often results in multiple individuals within the same family being similarly affected. T he costs of symptomatic treatments are The economic impact of allergic disease 85 significant in patients who require them on a daily basis for substantial proportions of the year, and may be less cost effective long term than interventions such as immunotherapy, the only form of treatment shown to alter the natur al history of disease. The financial burden may also fall more heavily on those with lower inco mes. Further research is required in this area in relation to the equity impacts and incremen tal cost effectiveness of alternatives. This would require a bottom-up cost analysis as previous ly described. The costs involved in care of allergic patients are not collected in official government statistics. With the shift of some lower cost pres cription medications to over the counter status, they are now outside of the PBS and Medicar e safety nets. Medications such as long term antihistamines or nasal steroids are thus avai lable to Veterans Affairs patients, but not to other patients with identical conditions who hav e not served in the military. Out of pocket costs have been shown to influence not only complia nce but also the likelihood of complications of untreated disease - see Australian Centre for Asthma Monitoring (2007). Access to some therapeutic agents is hampered by th e current registration process required for some biological agents (such as allergen specif ic immunotherapy) or the lack of Medicare funded subsidies for novel therapies for rare disea ses. To some extent this is because conventional measures of reliable evidence supporti ng treatments and diagnostic tests can only be obtained for common diseases. The same lev el of evidence is more difficult to obtain for rare diseases unless the therapeutic effect is very substantial. Patient care would be enhanced if consideration wer e given to the following options, with safeguards to minimise the risk of abuse or cost bl owouts. /boxshadowdwn Availability of higher potency nasal steroid sprays prescription for with relapsing nasal polyps; and /g51/g51 /g51/g51 with chronic allergic rhinitis requiring therapy fo r more than six months per year. /boxshadowdwn Availability of relatively nonsedating antihistamin es on authority prescription for those requiring symptomatic treatment for chronic urticar ia for more than three months. /boxshadowdwn Funding of anti-leukotriene therapy on authority pr escription (initial three month approval) restricted to initial prescription by all ergy/immunology specialists or respiratory physicians, in patients with the 'aspir in triad' in whom aspirin desensitisation is contraindicated or not tolerated. /boxshadowdwn Availability of specific allergen immunotherapy on authority prescription (initial six month approval), restricted to initial prescription by allergy/immunology specialists. This would require the development of costing model s that recognise the difference between patient co-contributions for medication pur chased on a monthly basis, from immunotherapy where allergen is manufactured for a specific patient and provided in treatment kits that are used for 6-12 months at a t ime. /g51/g51 /g51/g51 The model used to fund allergen immunotherapy for h oney-bee and wasp venom immunotherapy in patients with anaphylaxis (where t he patient contribution is once for each 6-month supply) is an appropriate one to consider in this context. /boxshadowdwn Ability to add non-prescription items used for the treatment of allergic disorders to the Medicare safety net would make them more affordable . /boxshadowdwn Recognition of allergy as a chronic disease, with d evelopment of a model of care that incorporates recognition of costs of management, an d proposes how the cost burden can be lessened for those on multiple medications, including those currently not on prescription. The economic impact of allergic disease 86 /boxshadowdwn Support for trials of novel therapies (such as newe r immunomodulatory agents and receptor antagonists) in patients with autoimmune a nd auto-inflammatory diseases where there is a rationale for therapy, and where a lternative agents are poorly tolerated or toxic. /boxshadowdwn Development of mechanisms to extend the range of ap proved medications for novel indications, and then to make them more affordable for patients who require access. Medications with orphan indications, will find it d ifficult to obtain sufficient evidence of efficacy from large-scale placebo-controlled trials when the underlying condition itself is rare. There are a number of examples of this inclu ding: the treatment of eosinophilic oesop hagitis which has been proven to be effective, but is currently only approved for the treatment of asthma; and /g51/g51 /g51/g51 Mycophenolate has been approved for treatment of lu pus nephritis, but not for the management of other related conditions. 8.4 COMMUNITY AND MEDICAL EDUCATION OUTSIDE THE CURRENT PARADIGM Allergic disease is so common that even a substanti al increase in the number of specialised allergy services in the community is unlikely to me et demand without increasing the skills base in primary care to deal with more straightforw ard cases. The importance of quality evidence base training is paramount. Poor training results in poorer quality care, undesirable outcomes, and increased uptake of unproven, ineffec tive and sometimes dangerous or expensive, alternative medical practices. Unfortun ately, there are a number of factors that have contributed to an erosion to the skills base i n primary care and exacerbated the relative shortage of specialised services available compared to increasing demand, including: /boxshadowdwn the relative paucity of allergy-related content in current medical courses; /boxshadowdwn the absence of allergy services in some hospitals a nd the privatisation of others, resulting in fewer opportunities for undergraduate and postgraduate education; and /boxshadowdwn the current model of postgraduate medical education in general practice in Australia is built around the provision of sponsored meetings by pharmaceutical companies, resulting in a drug rather than disease-centred foc us. The educational opportunities available may be limited by some sponsors having le ss interest in funding activities for across-the-counter medication (most allergy medicat ions) compared to those requiring a doctor's prescription. This model of postgraduat e education is outmoded and does not serve the medical or wider community well. The care of patients with allergic disease would be enhanced by: /boxshadowdwn working with universities and medical schools to en hance immunology/allergy education, one of the most common disorders that do ctors will encounter in general practice; and /boxshadowdwn increasing the diagnostic and management skills of general practitioners as well as related specialties (eg, paediatrics and respirator y physicians) to deal with relatively straightforward cases. These goals could be achieved (in part) by the foll owing initiatives. /boxshadowdwn Undertake an audit of undergraduate medical curricu la, audit the basic knowledge of trainees emerging from that curricula, identify def icits, and design educational content to rectify deficits. The economic impact of allergic disease 87 /boxshadowdwn Reversing the trend in the last 15 years of privati sation of allergy /immunology clinics. Such clinics are the incubators of future trainees, and are the centres for undergraduate and postgraduate education in allergi c disorders. /boxshadowdwn We need to reform the current model of postgraduate education, which is outdated and does not serve our patients or our community well. This involves ensuring that a component of allergy/immunology is involved in the curricular of training of paediatricians, other related specialist, general p ractitioners and medical students. This may involve liaising with specialist advisory committees the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and other postgraduate bodies involved in training such as the Royal College of General Practitioners or Divisions of General Practice. /boxshadowdwn Funding specific educational initiatives, along the lines of the National Asthma Campaign, to enhance the skills needed to manage al lergic disorders in general practice. This may involve one or more of funding of educational seminars (perhaps through ASCIA or the Divisions of General Practice) . Such activities should concentrate on regional areas that are currently un derserviced, including rural areas, where educational activities are more difficult to access. Teleconferencing and video conferencing may form a useful method of service de livery. /boxshadowdwn The preparation and distribution of printed evidenc e-based educational materials, such as the 'Is it Allergy? ' program initiated by the European Academy of Alle rgy Asthma and Immunology (with a similar program currently un der development by ASCIA) is an important facet of education. Materials on allergy prevention (already developed by ASCIA) require a more widespread distribution to ba by health centres, obstetric services and maternity hospitals. /boxshadowdwn Upskilling of medical practitioners (GPs as well as selected specialties) can also be achieved by establishment of teaching clinics withi n public hospitals, as is currently being trialled at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. Teaching clinics require restructuring of currently operating service clinic s for clinical service purposes rather than for teaching purposes. Expansion of current c linics and restructuring to meet a service as well as teaching role would require a ro llback of privatisation of public hospital clinics, and funding of new clinics where none exist. /boxshadowdwn Development of partnerships between specialty servi ces and GPs, nursing, community health centres, other specialties, midwives and pha rmacists to increase the general evidence-based knowledge of these health profession als, and counter widespread disinformation about allergic disorders in the comm unity. 8.5 LOCAL RESEARCH There is a need for locally based research on the e pidemiology and identification of risk factors for development of allergic disease, to ass ist in the development of intervention studies that have proven successful in other disord ers such as cardiovascular disease and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Public health care planning and workforce planning is also underpinned by an accurate estimate of the prevalence of some disorders in Aus tralia, and changing prevalence, as noted most recently for food allergy in young child ren. Furthermore, development of collaborative research programs within major hospit al and university centres of excellence may facilitate the introduction of novel therapies (such as immunotherapy for food allergy) that may one day alter the natural history of disea se and reduce burden of chronic disease. Support for uniquely Australian problems (such as J ack Jumper ant anaphylaxis research programs and studies of the aerobiology and clinica l significance of potential native The economic impact of allergic disease 88 Australian triggers of respiratory allergic disease ) should be made a priority, as such problems will not be addressed by private funding o r overseas interests. Special consideration might be given to commissioni ng the AIHW or a similar organisation to undertake a top-down study of the health system cos ts of allergic disease in Australia. 8.6 DEVELOPMENT OF A MODEL OF ALLERGY AS A CHRONIC DISEASE Organ based specialties are poorly equipped and tra ined to handle disorders lying outside their particular specialty. This can result in ina ppropriate review by multiple organ specific specialties, a practice that is time and cost-ineff icient and may result in suboptimal care. By contrast, management of allergic disorders by aller gy specialists has been shown to be cost effective and reduce hospitalisation and cost of ca re in patients with asthma, chronic sinusitis and food allergy/anaphylaxis. Education of patient s to self-manage their condition has shown similar results. The cost effective management of patients with alle rgic disorders would be enhanced by: /boxshadowdwn Recognition of allergy as a chronic disease. This w ill facilitate development of a model of care that incorporates the management of coexist ent disorders in the same individual in a cost-effective manner. /boxshadowdwn Development of models of care that incorporates ser vice provision by specialists, GPs, pharmacists and other health professionals to provi de care and evidence-based information in a timely manner. This model will be underpinned by an educational model as outlined above. /boxshadowdwn An examination of how the cost burden can be lessen ed for those on multiple medications, including those currently not on presc ription. This may require a re- examination of provisions of the current Medicare s afety net and Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. The economic impact of allergic disease 89 APPENDIX A - RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR ALLERGY SERVICES An overlap exists between clinical immunology and a llergy, and other organ specialties. Most Australian and New Zealand Allergy and Clinica l Immunology specialists have been trained in allergy and clinical immunology, and inv olved in the assessment and management of a variety of common disorders (eg. allergic resp iratory disease, eczema, hives/urticaria, food, sting or drug allergy) as well as less common conditions (eg. vasculitis, immune deficiency, some autoimmune disorders). The role of hospital-based Allergy and Clinical Imm unology services While many patients are managed in the community by general practitioners or allergy/immunology specialists in private practice, hospital based units are required not only to provide consultative services for hospital inpat ients, but provide an essential infrastructure for services that cannot always be delivered in the community, including: /boxshadowdwn testing for some drug allergies; /boxshadowdwn drug or food challenges where reactions may be seri ous. The role of hospital-based tertiary referral units will be increasingly more i mportant given the increasing number of children evaluated for possible food allergy; /boxshadowdwn provide \"rush\" desensitisation protocols to switch off serious allergic reactions to venomous insects (like bee or wasp) that either can not be delivered in the community setting, are performed because routine immunotherap y is poorly tolerated, or for rural patients for logistic and safety reasons; /boxshadowdwn provision of ancillary services such as dietetic ad vice; /boxshadowdwn multi-disciplinary services and teams that may be r equired in some cases for example: /g51/g51 /g51/g51 young children who may require the services of alle rgy specialists, paediatricians, dietitians and psychological services; /g51/g51 immunodeficiency a nd multi-organ system disease; /boxshadowdwn the care of patients with rare diseases; /boxshadowdwn serve as a focus for research; and /boxshadowdwn are the locations where novel therapies (such as de sensitisation to food) will first be trialled. Hospital-based services also play an important role in training of: /boxshadowdwn New specialists; /boxshadowdwn Medical students; /boxshadowdwn Hospital residents (some of whom will ultimately wo rk in primary care/general practice); /boxshadowdwn Related speciality trainees (such as paediatricians , dermatologists, respiratory physicians, Ear Nose Throat surgeons) who may also assess patients with allergy- related disorders; and /boxshadowdwn The general medical and paramedical community (eg. GP's, nurses, dietitians) The economic impact of allergic disease 90 Given the epidemiology, age distribution and nature of allergic disease in the community, provision for inpatient and outpatient facilities f or the assessment and management of adults and children is required, as well as appropriately trained staff. Medical staff Most units will require the services of at least tw o specialists in Clinical immunology and Allergy. Since the natural history and prognosis of some allergies in children differs from that in adults (eg. food and insect venom allergy), expe rtise in paediatrics relevant to the problems under evaluation is essential. This may be provided by one or more of specialist paediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology speciali sts, the input of paediatricians with an interest and expertise in Allergy and Clinical Immu nology, or adult-trained Allergy and Clinical Immunology specialists with experience in assessing and managing children. Many patients present with complex and multisystem problems, and may need to be assessed and managed within the context of a multi-disciplinary team. Units will require at least one registrar (either v ocationally training in the speciality or rotating from another service in internal medicine), and one resident medical officer for training and for supervision of inpatients (including food or dr ug challenges). Nursing staff The support of a specialist allergy clinic nurse is mandatory. Nurses have an important role in: /boxshadowdwn undertaking some allergy testing (skin prick testin g, spirometry); /boxshadowdwn administering immunotherapy; /boxshadowdwn education of patients and the parents of young chil dren in allergen avoidance, spirometry and inhaler technique and EpiPen supervising of some challenge procedures; in community outreach programmes (eg. school anaphy laxis training programmes). Ancillary services Qualified adult and paediatric dietitians are requi red to give detailed advice to patients (and their care-givers) with food allergy, to assess the nutritional status of patients who have restricted their diets (either with medical advice or at their own instigation), to advise on how best to manage patients with multiple documented fo od allergy, and to advise patients with \"food intolerance\" how best to manage their diets t o minimise symptoms without compromising nutrition. This is particularly import ant when managing young children, where restricted diets are more likely to impact on nutri tion and growth. Physiotherapists have an important role to play in patients with immunodefic iency. As in any patients with chronic disease impacting on physical, psychological health and finances, access to social workers and psychology/psychiatric services is also importa nt. Outpatient facilities Facilities should be available for: /boxshadowdwn skin allergy testing (skin prick and intradermal); /boxshadowdwn measurement of lung function (including supervising a patient's /boxshadowdwn fibreoptic rhinoscopy of the upper airways le); The economic impact of allergic disease 91 /boxshadowdwn patch testing for contact allergic dermatitis (or p erformed in association with dermatology services); /boxshadowdwn providing patient and parent education (including i nstructing on self administration of adrenaline); /boxshadowdwn administering allergen immunotherapy (desensitisati on) with an appropriate observation area; /boxshadowdwn challenge facilities (eg. medication) for lower ris k procedures; and /boxshadowdwn should have access to resuscitative facilities in c ase of adverse reaction to a challenge or an immunotherapy injection. Staff should be trai ned in resuscitative techniques. Inpatient facilities Inpatient facilities will be required for the inves tigation and management of patients with some disorders (eg. immune deficiency and systemic autoimmune disorders) and to provide challenge facilities in patients considered at high er risk of an adverse reaction. This may require facilities for day-stay and overnight stay for patients with suspected food allergy to prove or disprove sensitivity and allow liberalisat ion of diet if negative. These facilities cannot be easily provided in community-based allergy/immun ology services. Facilities should be available for open as well as double blind, placebo controlled tests to identify or disprove food intolerance by giving suspected foods in disgu ised forms. For this purpose some pharmacies at specialist centres stock foodstuffs c ontained in special capsules, with placebo controls of similar appearance.
