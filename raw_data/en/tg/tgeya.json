People are considered moderately or severely immunocompromised if they have: Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system Received a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome) Advanced or untreated HIV infection Active treatment with high- dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress their immune response US CDC: COVID -19 Vaccines for Moderately 6months, refer toTable 1below. onthetotality data available withrepeat dosing. Evusheld access in the State of Maine Patients who currently qualify for treatment, or who have questions about eligibility or whether to get this drug, should contact their primary care provider. Patients who do not have a primary care provider should contact a healthcare facility for further information on how to access EVUSHELD at that healthcare facility. Maine CDC is NOT able to coordinate treatment for individual patients. Healthcare providers can contact any of the healthcare systems or facilities in Maine that have Evusheld to refer their patient(s) for Evusheld treatment. Healthcare systems/healthcare facilities that would like to start getting their own Evusheld supply should contact Kristen McAuley ( kristen.m.mcauley@maine.gov ) at Maine CDC to request details on how to get an allocation.Healthcare System/Facility Location(s) Cary Medical Center Caribou Central Maine Medical Center Lewiston Eastern Maine/Northern Light Hospital Bangor MaineGeneral Augusta MaineHealth /Maine Medical Center Portland Mount Desert Island Hospital Bar Harbor N.E. Cancer Specialists Multiple Redington Fairview Hospital Skowhegan Saint Joseph Health Bangor York Hospital York For more information, go to Maine CDC: COVID- 19 Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis: Considerations for Evusheld EVUSHELD is a new combination monoclonal antibody administered as two concomitant IM injections in the gluteal muscle. Maine is experiencing extreme scarcity of blood products to support patients should they have a bleed or hematoma from a deep muscle injection. Thus, strong considerations and judicious clinical discretion is advised for those patients who may be at risk for bleeding from a deep muscle injection. Contraindications for administration in patients who otherwise meet the eligibility per EUA criteria include: Clinically significant heritable bleeding disorder or bleeding diathesis despite a normal platelet count. Platelet count <20,000/uL . drug(s), or heparin agents,unless they can be safely held in advance. Dual antiplatelet therapy for stent or other considerations. As experience with this drug expands and as stress on the blood supply lessens, these parameters will be re -evaluated.Overview of COVID -19 Outpatient Therapy Class Oral Intravenous Antivirals Paxlovid prescription best practices Essential elements of a Paxlovid prescription Numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID Dispense -by date (i.e., within 5 days of symptom onset) Optional: Renal function Optional: Medication list reviewed/reconciled Prescribers writing prescriptions for Paxlovid should include the dispense -by date (i.e., within 5 days of the symptom onset date) and are encouraged to include information about the patient's renal function and a statement that the patient's medication list has been reviewed/reconciled.

Providers should check for drug -drug interactions and make medication changes that can be accomplished safely. Renal dosing adjustment is needed for patients with GFR between 30 -60; Paxlovid cannot be used for GFR <30. Veklury(remdesivir) (IV) Intravenous (once -daily therapy for 3 days) Start within 0 -7 days after COVID -19 symptoms beginIndividuals 28 days old and older at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19 2 nd-line treatment option per NIH treatment guidelines . This is the best option for patients who cannot take Paxlovid due to drug -drug interactions. Requires insurance coverage and multiple days of IV infusion. Currently only available at a few facilities, and primarily for outpatients under 12 years old. Consider for eligible patients who are hospitalized for a non -COVID -19 cause if Paxlovid is not available in inpatient formulary or oral access is unavailable. Bebtelovimab(IV) Intravenous (1 dose) Start within 0 -7 days after COVID -19 symptoms beginIndividuals 12 years old and older at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19 Best pick for patients presenting between 6 -7 days after symptom onset (outside the Paxlovid treatment window) or who cannot take oral drugs for any reason. Also the best pick for patients unable to get Paxlovid due to drug -drug interaction that can't be addressed safely, severe kidney or liver disease, or concerns about the patient's ability to complete 5 days of outpatient therapy. Lagevrio(molnupiravir) (PO) Oral (5 days) Start within 0 -5 days after COVID -19 symptoms beginIndividuals 18 years old and older at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19 Best pick for patients who cannot get Paxlovid due to drug -drug interaction or severe kidney or liver disease, and who do NOT have access to IV therapy. Lower effectiveness than the other three therapies.

Healthcare providers canconsider these factors when evaluating Outpatient Treatment *Notes : Unvaccinated: a person who has not received 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine or 1 dose of the J&J vaccine. Vaccinated: a person who has received 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine or 1 dose of the J&J vaccine. Vaccinated persons who have not received a booster dose are at higher risk for severe disease than those who are boosted. Clinical risk factors: some of the most important Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with High Risk for Severe COVID -19 (US CDC) include age, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions or receipt or immunosuppressive medications, obesity (BMI 30), pregnancy, and sickle cell disease. Immunocompromising conditions: Moderately or Severely Immunocompromised People (US CDC) include people who have been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood, received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system, received a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or taking medicine to suppress the immune system, moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome), advanced or untreated HIV infection, or active treatment with high- dose corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress the immune response. Pregnant: COVID -19 patients who are pregnant and unvaccinated are at higher risk for severe disease than those who are vaccinated. Women in their postpartum period, and those who are vaccinated and have additional risk factors, are also at elevated risk. Congregate facility: Includes persons living in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, jails prisons, and homeless shelters who do not meet hi gher -level criteria.Category Groups* High Risk for Severe DiseaseAll persons age 50 years and older All persons who are unvaccinated People with 1+ clinical risk factors placing them at higher risk for severe COVID -19 disease Higher Risk for Severe DiseaseUnvaccinated, 65+ years Vaccinated, 65+ years, 1+ clinical risk factors Unvaccinated or Vaccinated, 2+ risk factors Residing in a congregate facility Highest Risk for Severe DiseaseModerately/Severely Immunocompromised Unvaccinated or Vaccinated, 75+ years Unvaccinated, 50+ years, 1+ clinical risk factors Unvaccinated, PregnantJuly 12, 2022 Maine Center for Disease Control and PreventionAccessing Outpatient Treatment MaineProvider information: COVID -19 treatment https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious toTreat sitelocator launched 3/30 Identifies allTest bystate/territorial also available: 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489 inEnglish, Spanish, 150other languages -8am to 12 midnight ET,7days aweek Disability Information andAccess Line (DIAL) also available tospec ifically help those withdisabilities access services. -treatment.shtml Maine CDC: COVID -19 Treatment in https://www.maine.gov/covid19/treatment Maine CDC: Health Advisories https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/newhan.shtml NIH: Coronavirus -19 Therapeutics https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID -19/TherapeuticsLong- Term Care Pharmacy Partners Program Continuing partnership withpharmacies serving long- term care facilities (LTCFs) fordirect receipt of oral antivirals uptospecific threshold atlocations that provide direct access ofproduct toLTC community Uses separate federal cache that does not impact allocations to states/territories Aids states byidentifying long- term care supporting pharmacies (LTCPs) within their jurisdictions Identified LTCPs have ability toopen order withguard rails, closely tiedtoutilization Ensures maximum visibility bystates andterritories on product supplies inLTCPs andLTCFs Ensures equitable distribution Provides efficient andflexible logistical anddistribution structure tomeet current andfuture demand for therapeutics when and where neededWhy are patients still dying from COVID -19? Key messages for healthcare providers: Become familiar with COVID -19 treatments for outpatients Talk to your high- risk patients about the value of treatment Encourage high- risk patients to have a plan to get tested and treated before they get sick Key messages for high -risk patients: COVID -19 treatments are safe and effective and drastically reduce the risk of severe disease Treatment must be started within the first few days after symptom onset to be effective Have a plan to get tested, evaluated, and treated if you develop symptoms of COVID -19Recommendations for healthcare providers Continue to encourage COVID -19 vaccination in everyone age 5 years or older, including booster vaccination in everyone age 12 years or older. Encourage high-risk patients to get vaccinated and get a booster. Immunocompromised patients should receive an additional vaccine dose and are eligible to receive pre - exposure prophylaxis Communicate with your high -risk patients that treatment for COVID -19 is available in Maine and needs to be started soon after symptom onset. Encourage high -risk patients to have a plan to get promptly tested, evaluated, and treated if they get sick.
