It's great to hear that technology developed in Wales is being used for research undertaken by MIT which certainly helps put Wales on the international map. \" Edwina Hart AM The Minister for Economy, Science and Transport, Welsh GovernmentSmall remote-controlled unmanned air systems developed in Wales are to be used in a research programme by the world renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The remote controlled systems - developed by Cardiff based BCB International can land on water with a 'fly and dip' system - will be used in a research programme by MIT's SENSEable City Lab to collect water samples for analysis. The linkup between BCB and MIT came through Welsh Government's membership of MIT's International Liaison Programme as BCB was one of the businesses on the Welsh Government's April mission to MIT. Discussions were initiated with the SENSEable City Lab which is developing new uses for unmanned systems. Measuring a metre across, The BCB systems are made from a superlight and super strong carbon fibre and weighing just 430 grammes, they were originally developed to carry canisters containing essential survival equipment that could be dropped in the ocean to help survivors of shipping disasters. BCB has had three systems developed specifically for the SENSEable City Lab research group which are now en route to Boston. Barry Davies BEM, Robotics Director with BCB International, said:\" BCB prides itself on its own R&D programme and continually reinvests profits into research and this is an amazing opportunity to be involved with such a prestigious institution. \"The unmanned system we have designed and developed - which was built by a Formula 1 racing car manufacturer - is the only one we know of that can land on water which was what interested SENSEable City Lab. \"Our vision of the future is to design and develop in Wales a range of unmanned systems with the support of Welsh Government and this link opens up a raft of exciting potential opportunities and I hope it marks the start of a long term relationship with MIT.\"\u00a334m boost for 'made in Wales' anti-cancer medicines pathways that limit the efficacy of so many of today's anti-cancer drugs. This represents the largest healthcare investment by a European private biotech company in over a year and the funds will be used to advance and expand the clinical programme for NuCana's lead product, Acelarin, which has shown exceptional results in patients with a broad range of advanced and progressive cancers that were resistant to all conventional therapies. Acelarin will be developed initially for patients with pancreatic, biliary, lung and ovarian cancers. In addition, the funding means the company plans to bring a second ProTide (NUC-3373) into the clinic later this year, with two further ProTides scheduled for 2015. NuCana has exclusive worldwide rights to the pioneering ProTide technology in cancer. This technology creates compounds that bypass key resistance mechanisms associated with anti-cancer drugs. \"It is very exciting to watch a new medicine emerge, from a theoretical idea, through chemical synthesis in our laboratory here in Cardiff and now as a new treatment for patients with cancer, \" according to Professor McGuigan, who developed the ProTide technology. Professor Chris McGuigan , Cardiff University School of PharmacyThe prospect of four new 'made in Wales' cancer medicines becoming a reality for patients has taken a huge step forward with the announcement that Edinburgh based biopharmaceutical company, NuCana, has made a new \u00a334m investment to develop its portfolio of anti-cancer medicines based on ProTide technology. ProTides is a platform developed by Professor Chris McGuigan and his team at Cardiff University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and it is specifically designed to bypass key cancer cell resistance \"This \u00a334m investment is extremely satisfying and an endorsement of our work with NuCana. Over the last decade this represents the 14th largest private biotech round globally and the largest ever in the UK,\" he added. www.cardiff.ac.uk/phrmy/ www.bcbin.com advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014NEWS NEWS 3 Contents & Editorial COVER IMAGE An artist's impression of the new GB Pound coin.

Lucinda Dargavel, Editor Receive free copies of Advances Wales10Cardiff leads new \u00a316m dementia fightMetformin helps diabetics to live longer than non-diabetics The Medical Research Council's new UK Dementias Research Platform (UKDP) is to be headed by Dr John Gallacher from Cardiff University's School of Medicine. This \u00a316 million public- private partnership has been set up to speed up research into dementias and its new approach will explore not only what is going wrong in the brain, but look at the brain in the context of the whole body. The UKDP brings together industry expertise and investigator teams from eight UK universities and teaming them with what will be the world's largest group of participants in dementias research (more than two million people). The Platform's combination of skills and resources, and its focus on looking at the whole body in order to understand neurodegenerative disease, aims to unearth completely new approaches for intervention, including new drug treatments. The Platform will investigate the causes of dementia across a range of A large-scale study involving over 180,000 people has shown that patients treated with a drug widely prescribed for type 2 diabetes can live longer than people without the condition. Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 6% of the UK population and the findings indicate that a drug known as metformin, used to control glucose levels in the body and already known to exhibit anticancer properties, could offer prognostic and prophylactic benefits to people without diabetes. Published in a leading diabetes journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism by scientists from Cardiff University, the study compared the survival of diabetes patients prescribed with metformin with patients prescribed with another common diabetes drug called sulphonylurea. Importantly, the life expectancy of these cohorts was also compared against non-diabetics who were matched based on criteria that included age, gender, same general practice, smoking status and clinical status. \"What we found was illuminating,\" said lead author Professor Craig Currie from Cardiff University's School of Medicine. The results showed that the patients treated with metformin had a small but statistically significant improvement in survival compared with the cohort of non-diabetics, whereas those treated with sulphonylureas had a consistently reduced survival compared with non-diabetic patients. \"Surprisingly, the findings indicate that this cheap and widely prescribed diabetic drug may have beneficial effects not only on patients with diabetes but also for people without, and interestingly, people with type 1 diabetes. Metformin has been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-cardiovascular disease benefits. It can also reduce pre-diabetics' chances of developing the disease by a third. This does not mean that people with type 2 diabetes get off Scott free. Their disease will progress and they will be typically switched to more aggressive treatments. People lose on average around eight years from their life expectancy after developing diabetes. The best way to avoid the condition altogether is by keeping moderately lean and taking some regular light exercise.\" In the next phase of the research, Professor Currie plans to investigate how patients prescribed with metformin as a first line therapy can best be treated thereafter to ensure that their life expectancy can be brought closer in line with the national average. \"By looking at the links between development of the disease and other factors - such as diet or illness - we hope to unearth targets for new drugs or new uses for existing drugs. \" Dr John Gallacher, Cardiff University School of Medicine and Director of the UKDPdifferent neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor Science Minister David Willetts said: \"This new \u00a316 million UK Dementia Platform will create the world's largest ever study group for research into dementia, ensuring that data is freely available to support the work of international scientists in this very important area. \"The collaborative approach demonstrated by the Medical Research Council and its business partners through this platform is critical in helping us to achieve our target of doubling dementia research funding and making the UK the best place in the world to do life sciences.\" \"By looking at the links between development of the disease and other factors - such as diet or illness - we hope to unearth targets for new drugs or new uses for existing drugs. \"www.medicine.cf.ac.uk 4 advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014NEWS NEWS4 www.swansea.ac.uk/scienceAberystwyth technology captures invaluable data www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs www.swansea.ac.uk/engineeringAn Aberystwyth University scientist has helped to capture images of Greenland glaciers that will assist with building digital elevation maps and gathering glaciology data for research. Dr Neal Snooke, a lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, has been working on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, commonly known as drones, for the past three years and in June, six of these new UAVs were sent to Greenland. The drones were fully equipped with Sony Alpha 14 megapixel cameras to capture high quality photographic data of Store and Lille glacier, which flows into the sea off Greenland. Dr Snooke explains, \"The mission was a great success. We were able to capture thousands of high quality digital images that can be processed to produce high resolution 3D models of the glacier. The images showed and monitored the movement and calving of the glacier on a frequent basis. \"The idea came in the spring of 2013 when talking to Professor Alun Hubbard from the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences to use inexpensive UAV technology hardware to capture high quality digital images for research purposes.\"The aim was to create an autonomous UAV that could fly 7 kilometres along a glacier front and a couple of kilometres from the launch site. A typical mission would last about an hour and would cover a distance of around 60km, travelling at 55kph and carrying 700g worth of camera equipment. Called the Skywalker X8, the drone has a 2 meter wingspan, weighs around than 2.5Kg, and is constructed from expanded polypropylene foam, making the frame quite robust and easy to repair. Improvements were made to the UAVs which went to Greenland and these included electric brushless motors, software improvements and modifications to the airframes to reduce the potential for damage caused by the need to land on rough terrain or ice. Additional sensors such as a pyranometer are now being integrated by Dr Snooke and his team to enhance the scientific value of the data capture and in the future, they will look to increase mission endurance as this will provide a number of opportunities to routinely collect data from more inaccessible areas. \"We have long held that the future of our cities will require operating at the intersection of people, planet, profit and peta-data. This program demonstrates yet another step on our journey towards city-scale resource management. \" Chandrakant Patel HP Senior Fellow and Chief Engineer HP LabsHP and Swansea University build sustainable cities Hewlett Packard (HP) has announced a three-year collaboration program with Swansea University to explore the development of sustainable next-generation cities, communities and campuses using HP technology. Taking advantage of sensor data management technology built at HPLabs and HP's Smart Grid Solutions for transforming utility infrastructure, the project will leverage technology such as smart metering, intelligent cities, situational awareness, data analytics and security threat detection. \"Working with global enterprises like HP as well as academia and local small and medium businesses is a fundamental part of ensuring a sustainable community,\" says Professor Javier Bonet, head of Swansea University's College of Engineering, and the program's strategic director. \"This program will have direct economic benefits for Wales in terms of knowledge creation, innovation and exploitation, as well as the development of a highly-skilled work force\". The first phase of the project will address the Welsh Government's objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent before 2050. As part of this, a testbed will be established to ultimately contribute to the creation of a permanent environment for the development of next-generation digital economy products and services. The initial proof of concept at Swansea University's existing campus will be followed by an expansion into the new 65 acre Bay Campus, a \u00a3500m project and one of the top five knowledge economy-based projects in Europe. Construction alone will generate approximately 4,000 direct as well as indirect jobs. With the first phase due to be fully operational by September 2015, the campus will eventually be used by around 5,000 students and up to 900 staff, with facilities for use by local subject matter experts and new start-ups. \"In the future, the UAV technology should allow investigation of the effects of large calving events, sub-glacial lake drainage or ice m\u00e9lange breakup on the Store and Lille glacier. \" Dr Neal Snooke Department of Computer Science, Aberystwyth University 5 advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014NEWS NEWS5 Life science hub launched in Cardiff Bay A new Life Science Hub for Wales has recently been opened in Cardiff Bay, South Wales. The nerve centre at No 3 Assembly Square will be at the heart of all activity within the sector in Wales and is expected to inject \u00a31bn into the economy by 2022. Together with a \u00a3100m Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund, it is hoped that the hub will boost the life sciences sector in Wales by at least \u00a31bn by 2022. In Wales, this sector currently employs 10,000 people working for 350 companies, with a combined annual turnover in the region of \u00a32bn a year. The hub, in Cardiff Bay, was officially unveiled by Economy Minister Edwina Hart, life sciences serial entrepreneur and investor Sir Chris Evans and Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis. The hub's chairman Professor Chris McGuigan said it will act as a central resource for the whole of the sector in Wales, including academia, business, clinical and funding organisations. Prof McGuigan, who at Cardiff University has overseen the development of pioneering drugs, said the hub was the ideal location. \"The hub will connect and concentrate life sciences in Wales and it has been designed to ensure that people collide into each other to fertilise good ideas. There really isn't anything like this anywhere in the world. \" Professor Chris McGuigan, Chairman, Life Science Hub for Wales As well as housing the team of Arthurian Life Sciences, which manages on a discretionary basis the \u00a3100m Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund, Prof McGuigan said the plan was for other investors to also have a presence in the hub, so allowing companies to pitch for finance in an environment which he described as being the \"true Dragon's Den.\" business.wales.gov.uk/lifescienceshubwales/homeA state-of-the-art centre bringing the design and testing of medical equipment and the training of tomorrow's doctors together under one roof for the benefit of patients has been opened in South Wales. The Bill Mapleson Centre is a partnership between Cardiff University and the global medical products company Flexicare and will help train doctors and dentists, acting as a focus for undergraduate and post-graduate teaching and continuous professional development. The Centre, in Mountain Ash, is named in honour of Professor William ('Bill') Mapleson, who has worked in academic anaesthesia at Cardiff University for over 60 years. The Health Minister Mark Drakeford was joined by Bill Mapleson to officially open the Centre earlier this year and he said, \"The new state of the art laboratory at The Bill Mapleson Centre at Flexicare will not only offer a cutting-edge focus for equipment development and testing, but will also offer Cardiff University students the opportunity to develop and refresh their skills using simulators in a clinical environment. This forward-looking approach to innovation fits in with Welsh Government's aims of developing new ideas and innovation as specified in our Science for Wales strategy.\" Professor Judith Hall, from Cardiff University School of Medicine, added \"It will help the medical community and industry for years to come - a fitting tribute to the work of Bill Mapleson.\" Famous for writing a paper describing breathing systems in 1954, Professor Bill Mapleson said: \"It's really quite something to have a Centre named after you.

On 21 June, scientists from over 150 research organisations across the globe took samples of seawater on mid- summer's day to form the biggest marine research initiative ever to take place on a single day and Professor Peter Golyshin's team at the School of Biological Sciences sampled the Menai Strait in North Wales. The precious data bank gathered from the collection of samples will allow future generations of marine scientists to understand and benchmark changes in the marine environment. 80% of all life on Earth comes from the World Ocean which covers more than 70% of the Earth surface. Marine microorganisms are responsible for a smooth functioning of global elements' cycles, however less than 1% of them are known.set in the world which can be used by generations to follow. Samples will also be sent to the world famous Smithsonian's Institution Natural History Museum in Washington DC, USA which will keep up to 10,000 samples, collected every 21st June, in a time-capsule so that they can be used as a clear indicator of change. As part of a large pan-European project \"MicroB3\" Bangor University's research team will also be using these samples to analyse the DNA contained within the microbes to demonstrate the microbial biodiversity of the oceans and therefore their potential for biotechnology. Bangor University's role is to reveal those genes in microbial communities which could be developed into novel enzymes which may be of industrial importance. The sample taken from the Menai Strait will, along with all other samples, be sent to the lead research partner Professor Frank Oliver Gloeckner at the Jacobs University in Bremen (Germany). Bulk microbial DNA will be extracted from all samples, sequenced and analysed, forming the biggest standardised reference data www.bangor.ac.uk/biologySwansea University academics have received two of only seven prestigious fellowships awarded this year by The Royal Society, the UK's national academy of science. Both the College of Science Professor Tavi Murray and Dr Sophie Schirmer have been awarded Royal Society Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellowships. The fellowships scheme allows scientists to make major progress in their area of study by undertaking full-time research. Professor Murray received her fellowship to research the interactions between ice and ocean at the margins of glaciers in southeast Greenland and Dr Schirmer is researching new paradigms for magnetic resonance molecular imaging via quantum control. Professor Murray said, \"I am really excited to be able to concentrate on research for the coming year: I'm going to be working on iceberg calving especially in south-east Greenland. Glaciers that calve icebergs are a primary control on how much water the Greenland ice sheet contributes to global sea level rise. It is a key time to work on this area - our group has just shown a new calving process operates in Greenland which isn't included in models as yet. I'm particularly excited to be collaborating with oceanographers for this project.\" In response to receiving the Fellowship, Dr Schirmer said, \"I'm very excited to be able to devote myself fully to applying my expertise in quantum control to my recently acquired interest in magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. This is a field with many potential applications including in the early detection of biomarkers for diseases from cancer to dementia, and I hope that this fellowship will enable myself and our medical imaging team to make a significant contribution to this field.\" , 7 advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014NEWS NEWS7 Ultravision is the People's Choice A ground-breaking invention, as featured in Advances 71, which clears smoke created during keyhole surgery won the inaugural 'People's Choice' Award at this year's Cardiff University Innovation and Impact Awards. Voted for by the public, the win makes up a hat trick of honours for Ultravision in 2014, including the Royal College of Surgeons Cutlers' Surgical Prize and a Business Impact (Aspiring) award from PraxisUnico - a UK network that drives the commercialisation of academic and public sector research. Edwina Hart AM, Minister for Economy, Science and Transport, presented the People's Choice Award to Dr Neil Warren, Chief Technology Officer at Asalus Medical Instruments - the spin-out company behind Ultravision.\"We are delighted Ultravision has been recognised as an excellent example of collaborative commercialisation.

SPECIFIC is led by Swansea University in collaboration with a number of Welsh and UK based academic and industrial partners, including Imperial College London, Bangor, Cardiff, Glyndwr, Bath and Sheffield Universities, and multi-nationals including Tata Steel, BASF, and NSG Pilkington. The centre is working to speed up the commercialisation of innovative, energy generating, industrial coatings within the construction industry through its pilot production facility. These coatings will revolutionise building construction and make a major contribution to renewable energy targets. \"There isn't another place in the world where you can coat sheet, coil, plastic, steel and glass all under one roof.\" The generation of high technology jobs and the creation of wealth in the green manufacturing sector as well as the staged development and release of new technology means that there is a constant buzz at the innovation centre. There is always something new on the cards, an appetite for discovery and the commitment to carry ideas through. Here is where concepts are transferred from the scientist's notebook to the real world; where true innovation is inspired, and where it begins to make its mark. www.specific.eu.comSPECIFIC is channelling natural energy, to change the way we power our lives and effectively turn buildings into power stations. This will be achieved by accelerating the industrial scale up of academic concepts to develop practical, economic coating technologies to capture, store and release solar energy at the point of use, for both new and retrofit buildings. advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014special FEATURE special FEATURE \"I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy ... I hope we don't have to wait til oil and coal run out before we tackle that.\" Thomas A. Edison As part of SPECIFIC's unique pilot production facility, Project SUPER seeks to accelerate the scale up of functional coatings by creating a new engineering resource that is dedicated to demonstrating and improving manufacturing techniques. It incorporates a technical laboratory, a re-engineered reel to reel line, which can process flexible steel materials up to 300mm wide and 2km long, and an open innovation space that helps to broaden the industrial engagement needed to develop commercialisation outputs. This enhanced facility is set to deliver manufacturable solutions to industry partners, create new products and services to benefit supply chains in Wales and generate valuable IP . The benefits from the additional capability and industry engagement resulting from Project SUPER will be commercially developed through a range of exploitation routes contributing to economic growth in sectors such as Energy and Environment, Construction and a range of Advanced Manufacturing and Materials segments.Project SUPER 11advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014special FEATURE special FEATURE Imagine if the buildings in every town and city, in every country across the World, could capture that solar energy for us to use in our daily lives. The commercial exploitation of innovation and knowledge is a key enabler for sustained economic growth and wealth creation and to make that vision a reality, SPECIFIC is developing ground-breaking coatings for building materials that can be manufactured on an industrial scale in the UK. Once developed, these glass and steel- based products will be fitted to the roofs, walls and windows of new and existing buildings to generate, store and release safe, clean, renewable energy. The concept is simple. When sunlight interacts with a coated roof or window, energy is generated and that energy can then be transferred to the National Grid or stored within the building as electricity or heat. There are over 4 billion square metres of roofs and facades in the UK alone and transforming buildings into power stations could create a new one-billion pound industry by 2020 - one which could generate thousands of jobs, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute towards a diverse energy mix to help achieve energy security which can be released as required, for heating, lighting or cooling. A range of applications are in development and SPECIFIC's partners are working with architects, designers, developers, building owners and occupiers to ensure that they meet the specific low-carbon energy requirements. It is an ambitious vision, but the partners in this unique collaboration are committed to making 'buildings as power stations' a commercial reality by developing the next generation of cost-effective renewable energy products and creating this new one-billion pound industry that will generate jobs, cut carbon and contribute towards the security of the UK's energy supply. From lab bench to factory floor At SPECIFIC, innovative ideas are taken from the lab bench to the factory floor and from the factory floor to the built environment. At the centre, this has been achieved with investment in state-of-the-art equipment and the co-location of a collaborative multidisciplinary and multi-functional team. Key to SPECIFIC's success is the identification of emerging and applied technologies and the sourcing of non-toxic earth- abundant materials which can be manufactured cost-effectively at industrial scale.The speed of this transfer is especially important in the area of photovoltaics and the centre works with the most promising photovoltaic technologies to find ways to manufacture them at scale. These include Perovskites, CZTS (Copper, Zinc, Tin, Sulphur), Organic Photovoltaics and Dye Sensitised Solar Cells. Learning by doing SPECIFIC's ethos is one of 'learning by doing'. For example, the centre's scientists and technologists use tailor-made equipment designed 'in-house' to assess product concept, performance, marketability and scale. Similarly, if new technologies are required, they are developed and assessed in the laboratories, then tested further using the modular pilot manufacturing line. CASE STUDY Large-scale adoption of the technologies being developed at SPECIFIC is expected to begin in the next 10 to 15 years. In the meantime, the team is busy mixing and matching its deliverables, producing smaller-scale advancements which deliver value to its industrial partners as well as progressing the longer-term projects. SPECIFIC's first spinout company, BIPVCo, has just launched with a range of integrated photovoltaic roof panels and the commercialisation of other SPECIFIC products will follow. www.specific.eu.comSmart coatings for a sustainable future Every day we get enough energy from the sun to power our planet for 27 years. Yet nearly all of that energy goes to waste. \"a discovery is said to be an accident meeting a prepared mind.\" Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi\"As a market leader in premium pre-painted steel products that go on the roofs and walls of buildings, tata is interested in extending that position by incorporating smart coated products into smart building components. Mr Mark Collinson Former Head of Strategy Building Envelope Sector, Tata Steel Europe SPECIFIC is an exemplar of how co-location, collaboration and open innovation allow universities to work with industry to develop and commercialise pioneering research into emerging technologies. 12For more information please circle 7301 on the reader reply cardadvances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014special FEATURE special FEATURE The centre also designs and builds small-scale 'proof-of-concept' demonstrators at an early stage in the research. These help to stimulate conversations with people around the many ways in which ideas can deliver value. One of these is of SPECIFIC's heated coating function. Heated Coating Additionally, to enable the rapid commercialisation of each concept, these demonstrators can be quickly converted into functionally-coated sheets or panels. These are then made into product prototypes and retrofitted to buildings. Throughout the pilot production process, scientists and technologists work within a controlled 'filtered air' room. This allows the team to determine the degree to which pollutants could impact on the applied technologies. This experimental environment is crucial to the success of SPECIFIC. It allows for the development and refining of processes as well as ensuring that all products can be manufactured at industrial scale in atmospheric conditions. It is this end-to-end R&D capability, combined with the commercial expertise of the collaboration partners, which gives SPECIFIC a competitive edge. Revolutionary and affordable SPECIFIC is currently building a portfolio of affordable products, based on integrated renewable technologies, which can be easily adopted by a number of energy users and will generate more than one third of the UK's renewable energy requirement by the end of the 2020s. \"BASF, as the worlds' largest chemical company, has long established relationships with both Swansea University and Tata and welcomes the opportunity to work collaboratively, under one roof, on the development of sustainable coated products for the construction sector. Dr Nick Brown Commercial Director BASF Coatings SPECIFIC's heated coating functions according to the long-established principle of resistive electrical heating, in which electrical energy is converted into heat energy. It has been designed for the smart buildings of the future, powered by a DC supply such as that from photovoltaics, but it can also be powered by a standard AC supply. One of its many applications is zoned temperature control which is perfect for shared office spaces where individuals' ideal room temperatures vary and the range of products based on this technology include a heated floor tile, a foot warmer and heated wall components. These revolutionary products will be suitable for both new and existing buildings - including retail outlets, warehouses and corporate offices - where metal and glass predominate the structure. By drawing on combined experience and expertise in both traditional and emerging industries, including plastic electronics, SPECIFIC ensures the adoption of tried and tested methodologies as well as the pioneering of new production methods. The centre works with multiple substrates - including glass, steel and plastic polymers - to develop its innovative product concepts. Printing and coating techniques are combined for product optimisation and the development of low-cost manufacturing processes. Through collective strengths in each of these areas, the centre is able to develop commercially-viable products within a short amount of time, by working closely with Swansea University's Welsh Centre for Printing and Coating (WCPC), and other research and development centres, to further accelerate progress by gaining a deeper understanding of the many challenges faced by businesses in this dynamic and growing market. 13\"Gold has been a subject of human fascination for millennia, largely because of its resistance to corrosion and its resulting sustained beauty. However, when broken down into nanoparticles, which contain just a few hundred atoms, it not only changes colour; it also becomes incredibly reactive, so contrary to the old adage; not even all that is gold glitters. Our research into the effect of gold nanoparticles on chemical and biological processes shows that in its nanoparticle form, gold's reactions are faster, easier and energetically more efficient than many other catalysts. \" Professor Graham Hutchings FRS Director of the Cardiff Catalysis Institute (CCI)SScientists discover gold's hidden value its long lifetime, unusually high reactivity and high specificity to the desired product. Catalysis is an enabling technology that underpins an estimated 80-90% of all manufactured goods. The phenomenon involves a material, which is not one of the reactants, speeding up a desired chemical reaction without the need for an increase in temperature. Commonly used catalysts such as those containing mercury have proven wasteful, environmentally hazardous and even harmful to human health. Gold, scientists have discovered, is not only a viable alternative catalyst but sometimes, the best possible catalyst. Professor Hutchings believes that gold has the potential to save lives, improve human health and clean up the environment: \"Too many processes create too much waste and not enough product. By introducing a gold catalyst we can reduce the amount of waste and increase the productivity for the benefit of a number of processes. The more we learn about this precious metal, the more I feel that society is ascribing the wrong kind of value to gold.\" He adds: \"One of the initial discoveries we made is that gold is the best catalyst for the formation of vinyl chloride, the main ingredient for the production of PVC and has the potential to replace an environmentally harmful mercury catalyst, this would be a major benefit to society. Gold is also used as a catalyst to oxidise carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. This has potential to be used in natural disasters where people are trapped in an enclosed space, such as mine shafts, and poisonous carbon monoxide (CO) needs to be removed from the air - but also in domestic settings where people live alongside equipment that has a risk of CO production from incomplete combustion e.g. gas heaters, cookers, petrol engines.\" Catalysts are under continual development to achieve new levels of activity and selectivity to society's desired chemical products. Using gold in catalysis could enable society to make better use of precious raw materials and to exploit new, greener sources by generating fuels, plastics and other chemicals from renewables such as corn starch, glycerol and recycled waste. Smarter use of catalysis will also lower our energy consumption and help in the decentralisation of activities such as water purification and small scale electrical power generation. Research at Cardiff Catalysis Institute (CCI) is currently exploring the possibility of using gold as a \"cold start\" catalyst in car exhaust systems to reduce carbon emissions. The current catalysts depend on the heat of the exhaust to become active. This means that the first few minutes of any journey produce the most emissions of CO and NOx (nitrogen oxide). As gold can work at lower temperatures than conventional catalysts, it could be used in this early stage.cientists from Cardiff are discovering new and unexpected uses for gold - a noble metal traditionally regarded as being chemically uninteresting due to its poor ability to react with other substances. Researchers at the School of Chemistry are pioneering new ways to exploit the revolutionary potential of gold to accelerate and optimise chemical processes in a range of industries from producing the plastics that modern life depends on to environmentally friendly energy production.

Profile Product Disease defence mechanism Applications Prevention of CMV Contact Dr Ian Humphreys Cardiff Institute of Infection & Immunity, Henry Wellcome Building, Heath 7303 on the reader reply cardProfileNew vaccine hope for leading viral cause of birth defects Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects, with 1 in 750 babies in the UK being born with permanent disabilities - these include blindness, deafness and brain damage - as a result of infection within the womb. These Cardiff scientists have uncovered a novel defence mechanism to control this disease, using the most common form of white blood cell - neutrophils. Although it has long been known that neutrophils are important in killing bacterial infections, it was largely thought that they were specifically designed for this cause; the fact that they can also fight a viral attack is a major breakthrough according to Dr Ian Humphreys from the University's School of Medicine: \"Our study shows that neutrophils protect our organs from CMV by producing a protein called TRAIL that can directly kill virus-infected cells. Our body attracts the neutrophils to where the virus is replicating by producing the protein IL-22, which acts as a homing signal. \"Disease may actually be prevented if we can teach the immune system to quickly send antiviral neutrophils to the first site of infection. We are now developing a vaccine that may protect the body against CMV. Our findings may also have implications for other destructive viruses such as flu, hepatitis and even HIV.\" Currently there is no known treatment for CMV. Given that the virus spreads via bodily secretions such as urine, saliva and breast milk, scientists at Cardiff sought to understand how to protect mucosal sites from infection, and how to prevent the virus taking its grip in other important organs such as the liver. The virus is also a major reason behind life-threatening diseases in bone marrow and organ transplant recipients and is known to have a major impact on the immune system of even the healthiest of adults. The research was conducted as part of a collaboration between Cardiff University, The Wellcome Trust, Sanger Institute (Cambridge), the University of Oxford and La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology in California. The paper was recently published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe. \"Neutrophils are the rapid-response arm of the immune system's war against infection. The discovery of a new molecular mechanism for neutrophil mobilization and execution in the fight against CMV is very exciting, and provides key insights for developing more effective vaccines and therapies to combat this little-known viral pathogen. \" Dr Chris Benedict La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (San Diego, California) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) virionIllustration of a white blood celladvances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014MEDICINE MEDICINE 16 White blood cell is key to protection For more information please circle 7304 on the reader reply cardIn its undiluted form, honey has the effect of killing off bacteria, which researchers believe could be linked to enzymes in the bees themselves or present in pollen.Welsh study serves up sweet solution Bees set to help combat hospital superbugs major piece of research led by Professor Rose Cooper, Professor of Microbiology at Cardiff School of Health Sciences (CSHS) based at Cardiff Metropolitan University in South Wales has demonstrated that honey can be used as a natural remedy to hospital infection \"superbugs\" which are resistant to strong antibiotics. A Medical grade honey became licensed on prescription in the UK in 2004 and approved in Canada and the USA since 2007. It is available in many forms, including tubes and as medicinal dressings or in ribbons, which are useful for inserting into a wound. Manuka honey, which is predominantly produced in New Zealand and Australia, has the benefits of being antimicrobial, deodorising, anti-inflammatory and an antioxidant and is effective in treating traumatic wounds, surgical incision sites, burns, sloughy wounds, and pressure ulcers. Professor Cooper, who was the first in the UK to work with manuka honey, said: \"The majority of chronic wounds have bacteria in a biofilm, which makes them much less susceptible to antibiotics, and therefore, much more difficult to treat. Manuka honey can inhibit the growth of these biofilms in the laboratory, giving it the potential to control superbug infections such as MRSA. It will inhibit MRSA by stopping cells from dividing, which makes it such an interesting product to work with.\" Her research, which investigated the effects of honey on gene expression in MRSA and its effects on other bacteria that cause wound infection, won the Infection and Biofilm Award at the prestigious Journal of Wound Care (JWC) Awards 2014. Over two years, tests were conducted on bacteria gathered from infected patients and from hospitals, which proved highly resistant to antibiotics. Working with the University of Waikato in New Zealand, the research team from Cardiff Metropolitan University discovered that honey's high sugar content actually slowed bacterial growth and its syrupy texture acted as a seal against outside infection of wounds and provided a natural barrier to bacteria. This discovery would not have been news to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who were aware of honey's health-giving properties however, with the emergence of antibiotics in the 1950s as a means of killing off infection, centuries of knowledge were overridden by the need for modern drugs to tackle infections.

Welsh created GB Pound gives counterfeiters the slip George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, revealed that HM Treasury believes there is a strong case for introducing a new \u00a31 coin to help reduce counterfeiting and ensure the integrity of the UK's currency. The Royal Mint's prototype coin utilises multiple layers of cutting-edge technology and will allow the UK to reduce the rate of counterfeit coins entering general circulation, making it the most secure coin in the world, whilst costs will be reduced by replacing homogeneous metal with a more affordable full-plated option. This innovative technology will be made available around the world and will revolutionise global coin security, whilst reducing costs for Governments and Central Banks. The Royal Mint - which delivers more than two billion coins and blanks, tooling and other services to 50-60 countries around the world each year - is working closely with key industry stakeholders in order to understand the potential impact, whilst a public consultation will be completed before a final decision is made on the precise specification of the new coin. A public design competition will produce the design for the reverse, or 'tails', of the coin which will be introduced in 2017 the design of which will be 'distinctly British'. The new \u00a31 coin will have a twelve-sided shape which evokes memories of the pre-decimalisation threepenny bit. It will be constructed from two different coloured metals and contain a special security feature - a revolutionary new high security coinage currency system developed by The Royal Mint - which will not wear off over time and will generate lifetime cost savings through unmatched durability, lasting up to 30 times longer than an equivalent value banknote. Known as 'Integrated Secure Identification Systems', it enables not just coins but the whole cash cycle to be more secure, protecting the public, vending machine operators, retailers, and the wider banking system. This project is the work of The Royal Mint's in-house technical team and involves the application of an existing security technology that has been proven over decades in banknotes. It is the first time that this feature has been successfully embedded into coins, bringing with it forensic level security. The incorporation of the feature throughout The Royal Mint's industry leading aRMour\u00ae plating process ensures no loss of validity throughout the lifetime of the coin, making it as secure after 25 years as it was on release. The Royal Mint has also worked with key partners to develop high speed, sophisticated optical detectors for the feature which enables it to be detected at industry standard speeds of up to 4,000 coins per minute. This detection capability ensures all levels of the cash cycle can be secured with no loss in performance.After thirty years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current \u00a31 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. With advances in technology making high value coins like the \u00a31 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

Sports such as swimming, athletics and shooting will use the jackets at the Commonwealth Games and Jackie Webb, Business Development Manager, commented, \"We have made many bespoke products for the athletes to meet their individual requirements and sports. \"The Reflexcell TM material in the product for the Welsh athletes was originally designed and used as survival bags by climbers and walkers, and it has developed over the years to be widely used by the US and British military for the treatment of hypothermia in trauma casualties. It is now used extensively by the emergency services, including fire and rescue, ambulance, search and rescue and air ambulances. \"We know a high muscle temperature is vital to allow the athlete to produce high levels of power. In addition, a high muscle temperature helps minimise the risk of injury. This product allows the athletes to maintain muscle temperature during these potential heat loss windows. \" Dr Liam Kilduff Swansea University Special jackets made in Wales helped keep Welsh athletes stay warm when the competition heated up in Glasgow recently W While a warm-up is a staple part of an athlete's routine, the time before an event starts can see a significant loss of heat and Blizzard's jacket is the solution to that problem.

Now service providers can park the trucks and drive quality. \" Jon Curley CEO, EpitiroBreakthrough for Wi-Fi services Welsh developed StreetwiseTM gives remote view of Wi-Fi quality Profile Product Wi-Fi solution Applications Remote monitoring Contact Iain Wood Company Director Epitiro Ltd, Epitiro House, 10/11 Raleigh measurement solutions, has launched its world-leading Streetwise TM software which allows for the remote monitoring of Wi-Fi network performance and improves a user's quality of experience (QoE). Streetwise is a Wi-Fi Service Assurance Solution which uses discreet, on-site test probes to measure service beyond the user's own access point. It successfully bridges the gap between centralised network management information and actual subscriber experience by delivering cloud-hosted, real-time analytics to quality stakeholders. This remote monitoring system also significantly reduces the number of vehicles and specialists on the road i.e. it reduces 'truck roll.' Issues that affect subscriber quality, like service accessibility, local interference and app performance can now be monitored and managed centrally. Consumers only need to download Epitiro's software which will then independently test speeds and the other technical measurements that affect consumer experience of broadband services. All of the test results will be forwarded to Epitiro's data centre for cumulative analysis while each participant will be able to view their own test results online. \"The challenge for Wi-Fi service providers is to meet quality expectations without wasting resources.\" said Jon Curley, CEO, Epitiro. \"The ROI (Return on Investment) for Streetwise is very clear - it saves time and money by automatically reporting issues that erode subscriber confidence and, more significantly, reduces truck roll by confirming when systems are in fact working to specification.\" Streetwise 4150 probes behave just like consumers, logging on via WPA/WAP2 and/or captive portal splash screen and testing apps such as YouTube, Facebook, Spotify, Twitter and others. Network metrics include throughput, latency, local RF Cquality and channel interference to provide comprehensive quality of service (QoS) and QoE insight. To make the system even more accessible, Epitiro has also launched an app version of the core software which enables field testing from smartphones on trains and airplanes, and wherever crowds gather - airports, concerts and sporting events. Epitiro has undertaken projects for Ofcom and telecoms regulators in Ireland, Singapore, New Zealand, Tunisia, Bahrain and other countries. The BBC previously partnered with Epitiro to map 3G mobile coverage across the UK. Mr Curley said: \"Government regulators around the globe require the analysis technology and expertise Epitiro has uniquely developed. \"As the expected demand grows we'll continue with our strategy to recruit locally but think globally.\" Their solution features include: l Remote, on-line views of real-time Wi-Fi analytics l QoE metrics: App, Access, Network Performance l Low cost, easy-to-install data probes l Cloud-hosted model for fast trials and deployment Co-founder and chief executive of Epitiro, John Curley, said, \"The solution we've designed is certainly world-leading and we're proud that it has been fully developed with Welsh talent.\"The Streetwise Wi-Fi Service Assurance solution scales commercially to thousands of probes for regional or national deployments. These probes are easily installed by non-technical personnel and auto-configure so that they can be up and running in minutes. advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 23iStaying switched on with iViTi ON Innovative Welsh lighting company develops safety product ViTi Lighting from South Wales has incorporated technology developed by a Mid Wales company (Litonics Ltd) to create three new ground-breaking products. Set to revolutionise the lighting industry, the first of these new products to be launched is called iViTi ON. Profile Product Safety lighting Applications Emergency lighting Contact Bill Welch Managing Director iViTi Lighting Ltd. Floor 4, 10 The Crescent Conway Road, a collaboration between design partners One Nine Design, and manufacturing partners Samsung and The Sony UK Technology Centre, in South Wales, iViTi ON represents the very highest standards of design, quality and practicality. The product's automatic switching ensures that users are not left in the dark should the electricity supply fail and initially \"iViTi Lighting Limited has taken a highly responsible approach to entry into the LED market by fully testing all their products in our accredited test laboratory before placing them on the market. The introduction of their new iViTi ON range is a hugely exciting development and we have been working closely with Litonics and iViTi over the past 2 years on the project. Peter Hunt Chief Operating Officer, Lighting Industry Associationthe iViTi ON technology will be introduced into a domestic GLS lamp, which is fully interchangeable. The patented iViTi ON Automatic Switching Safety Lamp operates like any standard LED GLS (General Lighting Service) lamp until the lamp detects that the power has been cut. When this occurs, instantly, and undetectably, the lamp will switch to battery operation. This safety lamp can differentiate between a break in its power supply caused by manual switching and being extinguished due to a power cut. Whilst operating under battery power the lamp functions as a normal GLS and can be switched on and off as required and when fully charged, the battery supplies enough power to keep the light on for up to 3 hours. As soon as the electricity supply is reconnected, the lamp returns to 'normal' operation and the battery is re- charged. The uniquely designed 9.5w Automatic Switching iViTi ON GLS LED Lamp will deliver 850 lumens; with 2700k warm white colour temperature designed for the home and hospitality markets. This innovative new product is set to take its place among other 'standard' safety products within the home such as smoke detectors, CO detectors and intruder alarms. Bill Welch, Managing Director of iViTi Lighting said, \"We are very excited about the massive opportunities offered by the iViTi ON technology and are delighted to partner Litonics in its development. In addition, the experience and technical expertise of For more information please circle 7309 on the reader reply cardSamsung and The Sony UK Technology Centre at Pencoed within the semiconductor, LED and battery sectors, give us complete confidence in the technology and integrity of the product range. Placing this product within the most vulnerable locations within the home provides security, safety and could save lives. The added benefits of this lamp are that being LED, it is far cheaper to run as well as being environmentally friendly.\" advances advances advances wales Issue 73 / Autumn 2014ELECTRONICS ELECTRONICS 24For more information please circle 7310 on the reader reply card Profile Product Microscopy technique Applications Cell imaging through vibration Contact Professor Wolfgang Langbein School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University The Parade, Welsh researchers find a new way to capture the quantitative chemical structure of cells ardiff researchers have developed a new microscopy technique to image the chemical composition of transparent structures such as cells with three-dimensional sub-micron (less than one millionth of a metre) resolution. The development was delivered by an interdisciplinary team including researchers from the Schools of Physics and Astronomy, Biosciences, Dentistry and Medicine studying stem cell differentiation and related imaging techniques. This breakthrough will enable researchers to create an image from living cells very quickly. C The technique is based on the nonlinear optical effect of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), which uses the high-frequency vibrations of the molecules making up the material. These vibrations have a period of about 10 femtoseconds which is one hundred billion times faster than audible sound. The vibrations consist of the individual atoms in the molecules swinging against each other, with a frequency increasing with the decreasing mass of the atoms, and also with the increasing strength of the molecular bond. A hydrogen atom for example is about 12 times lighter than a carbon atom, and so it vibrates much faster. The resulting 'sound' of the molecules reflects their chemical structure, and can be used to identify them. To hear this sound, the molecules are 'pushed' using light which is modulated at the vibration frequency, and the researchers then listen to the resulting light scattering which changes in colour towards the blue- having a frequency up-shifted by the vibration. To do this, very short light pulses are used with a duration similar to the decay time of the molecular vibration. Without this push, molecules vibrate only due to thermal excitation which means that the resulting light scattering is much weaker because the molecules are not synchronised. This is similar to the difference between the effect of the precipitation of many random snowflakes and that of a single large hailstone. This technique allows the researchers to \"hear\" the vibrations much faster, and it create images more rapidly which means that an image of living cells can be taken in a matter of seconds. In order to determine the chemical composition of the material in a quantitative way from the scattered light, Cardiff researchers have developed an unsupervised analysis using both the causality of the vibration response (i.e. how it oscillates after it is hit) and the positive values of the concentrations. It extracts from these images taken for many different vibration frequencies, the chemical components, their 'sound' and their absolute concentration. The workflow of the method is given in Fig.1 and an example of such an analysis on cells is shown in Fig.2, clearly identifying the different components of water, lipid droplets, as well as cytosol and nucleus. Prof Wolfgang Langbein who headed the research said \"This development is a milestone in the applicability of CARS microscopy. The quantitative nature of the imaging afforded by the method can be used to model and understand processes in biology and material sciences, for example lipid metabolism important for obesity research, and reaction kinetics in fluids important for microfluidic chemical synthesis.\" The results were recently published in Analytical Chemistry - Dr Francesco Masia who acquired the data and co-developed and implemented the method said \"The development and implementation of the algorithm took a few months but it was definitely worth it. I was impressed how the method was able to distinguish even subtle differences in the chemical composition of different subcellular structures, which could not be revealed by looking at the raw data.\" Figure 1 Figure 2advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014BIOTECHNOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY 25BioMonde has it in the bag BioMonde's BioBag carries maggots for Larval Debridement Therapy nitially formed as a spin out company from the NHS in 2005, BioMonde in South Wales specialises in 'Larval Debridement Therapy' (LDT) and has developed and patented BioBag. I The term 'Larval Debridement Therapy' (LDT) describes the use of maggots, precisely the larvae of the green bottle blowfly Lucilia sericata, for the removal of dead tissue and slough from the wound surface (debridement). The maggots inject salivary enzymes onto rotting tissue to break it down and then suck it back up in a piston-like action. In addition, maggots feed on the bacteria that cause wound infection and, as they are photophobic, they naturally migrate to the dark depths of a wound, the area that is most difficult for surgeons to reach. It is this 'double whammy' of beneficial effects that accounts for the speed and effectiveness of maggot therapy. Effective debridement is a key step in the wound healing process and because of its selectivity for dead tissue, it is also known as biosurgery. Larval debridement therapy is shown to have a direct effect on at least three elements of the wound healing process: it removes non-viable tissue effectively, it helps combat infection by reducing the bio- burden, and it helps normalise the wound closure by facilitating the remodelling process. An indirect effect of LDT is that moisture balance may also be normalised. Too much or the \"wrong\" wound fluid is often caused by infection, slough and dead tissue on the wound surface, and inflammation.Debridement is achieved by the action of proteolytic enzymes, which are secreted by larvae. These enzymes liquefy proteinaceous material on the wound surface, which is subsequently ingested by the larvae as nutrition. The action of larval enzymes is restricted to dead tissue and Larvae of this species have been used since ancient times, and more recently during the 1920's to clean chronic, non-healing wounds in an attempt to start the healing process. Today, LDT is increasingly used in response to the rising challenges posed by multi-resistant bacteria, which may be present in chronic wounds which are a significant drain on the resources of healthcare systems. 26advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014BIOTECHNOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY 26Profile Product BioBag- bagged larvae Applications Larval please circle 7311 on the reader reply cardProfileliving tissue in the wound bed, including granulation tissue, is left unaffected. This selective process is one of the major advantages of LDT as it spares the healthy tissue necessary for healing. The bacteria contained in this material are taken up at the same time by larvae, meaning the bio-burden is reduced and the antibacterial effect of LDT is further enhanced by the secretion of bactericidal factors, which consist of small, heat-stable peptides. In addition, larval secretions can prevent the formation of and reduce preformed biofilms which can be another barrier to effective wound healing. The unique patented technology of BioBag uses larvae contained in a pouch-like device for ease of application and removal of the larvae by the clinician and acceptability to the patient. Larvae are placed in BioBags of different sizes, which consist of a polyester net and a cube of PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol) foam that acts as a spacer. Larval secretions penetrate through the net and liquefied, proteinaceous material is taken back by the larvae. BioBags are placed on the wound areas that need to be debrided and covered with an appropriate secondary dressing. These BioBags can be left on the wound for up to four days and investigations have demonstrated that free and bagged larvae are equally efficacious in terms of debriding the wound. BioBag is available as BB50, denotes the minimum larvae per bag at a dose rate 5-7 larvae per sq. cm found to be the optimum. Frequently, only one or two treatments, each lasting 2-3 days, are required. In contrast, with conventional treatments, it can take months to achieve a successful outcome. This makes maggots a very cost-effective alternative to conventional therapies, substantially reducing hospitalisation costs. Often, maggot therapy is the only alternative to continuing pain, disfigurement, repeated surgery or even amputation. A number of clinical trials have already been completed and BioMonde has active scientific research partnerships with both Swansea University and the University of Nottingham. A recent report commissioned from Swansea University's department of Health economics found that LDT was the most cost effective debridement method in terms of being both less expensive and more clinically effective to achieve the outcome of a successful debridement. BioMonde is the only provider of bagged larvae in Europe and BioMonde LDT products have been used to treat over 18,000 patients across Europe, primarily in the UK and Germany. Following recent approval in the US, the company is in the process of establishing a manufacturing and distribution base in Gainesville Florida and will begin supplying the therapy to customers in the US later this year. advances advances advances wales issue 73 / Autumn 2014BIOTECHNOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY 2728 ISSUE 73 G AUTUMN 2014 advances WALESTHE JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGYAdvances Wales publishes news and features in the following areas Advances Wales contact To receive a regular free copy of Advances Wales, change contact details or to obtain free back issues please complete and return the reader reply card or contact Alyson Pasch, Welsh Government, QED, 6044 Information regarding the international offices of the Welsh Government can be obtained by telephoning +44 (0)3000 6 03000 from the UK or online at www.expertisewales.com/advances Advances Wales is also available online at: www.wales.com/advancesadvances WALES Sterling security New secure GB Pound designed and produced in WalesTHE JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MATERIALS AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENT ENERGYFOODENGINEERING MANUFACTURING EARTH SCIENCESELECTRONICSCOMMUNICATIONSINFORMATION TECHNOLOGYOPTO-ELECTRONICSPHYSICSCHEMISTRYMEDICINEBIOTECHNOLOGY The previous issue - Advances Wales 72 Organisations featured in this issue BioMonde 26 Blizzard Protection Systems Ltd 20 DecTek Ltd 22 Epitiro Ltd 23 iViTi Lighting Ltd 24 Royal Mint Ltd 18 SPECIFIC (Sustainable Product Engineering Centre for Innovative 10 Functional Industrial Coatings) and Swansea University Cardiff Metropolitan University: Cardiff School of Health Sciences 17 Cardiff University: Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry 14 Cardiff Institute of Infection & Immunity, School of Medicine 16School of Physics and Astronomy 25 Anglesey's standing stones take a leap into the digital age 4 BioWales 2014 puts Wales on international stage 3 Dezrez's desirable software 21 Digital thinking 10 Edukey key to success 20 Exploring influences on the development of Alzheimer's 6 Green Light for greener packaging 17 James Bond studio secures licence to thrill in Cardiff 7 Moneypenny calls on Penelope 22 New genetic mutations shed light on schizophrenia 26 New solar cell technology taking off in North Wales 14 OpenIQE initiative boosts regional supply chains 6 Operators set to get faster networks 25 Paying it safe with myPinPad 18 Pioneering 3D printing reshapes patient's face in Wales 8 S\u00ear Cymru appoints new director 5 Swansea hosts EuroVis 2014 9 Swansea research findings may help the fight against cancer 27 Swansea research helping to fight the rise of the app attackers 3Usable clinical data in a Clix 24 Welsh clean up for Indian water 5 Welsh fridge keeps its cool 16 Welsh research base punches above its weight 7 Wikimedia Foundation collaborates with Bangor "}
