Abdominal migraine, though, is less common and poorly understood. Most often diagnosed in children, this condition, characterized by stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting, can lead to absences from school, emotional distress, and a disruption in normal activities. The cause of abdominal migraine remains a mystery, as does the condition's relationship to migraine headaches. Children with abdominal migraine often have a family or personal history of migraine headaches, find relief with migraine medications, and share similar triggers and symptoms. Evidence also suggests that as children with abdominal migraine age, their conditions evolve into migraine headaches. How is abdominal migraine similar to a migraine (or migraine headache)? Abdominal migraine and migraine share similar triggers, such as stress, skipping meals, exposure to bright light, and poor sleep. Foods containing chocolate, caffeine, and monosodium glutamate (MSG) are also triggers. Because there are so few studies on medications used to treat this condition, patients with the condition are often treated with medications shown to be effective on a migraine. What causes abdominal migraine? The cause of abdominal migraine is unknown. \"We don't know the exact connection between an abdominal migraine and a classic migraine, but we do know there's a connection between the gut and the brain,\" says Deena Kuruvilla, MD, a neurologist and specialist in facial and headache pain at Yale Medicine. \"Many of the drugs we use to treat depression, for example, are effective in treating an abdominal migraine.\" Who is at risk for abdominal migraine? Abdominal migraines mostly affect children, with the first episode occurring between 3 and 10 years old. Most children seem to outgrow the condition, though abdominal migraines in adulthood are just starting to be studied. A child with a family or personal history of migraine headache has an increased chance of developing abdominal migraine. What are the symptoms of abdominal migraine? The main symptom of abdominal migraine are recurrent episodes of moderate to severe stomach pain that lasts for between 1 and 72 hours. Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and pale appearance. (These symptoms rarely occur between episodes.) How is abdominal migraine diagnosed? There is currently no test to confirm abdominal migraine. Your doctor will make a diagnosis based on specific criteria that details the type, frequency, and severity of symptoms associated with abdominal migraine. The diagnosis will typically be made only after all other causes of abdominal pain have been ruled out. How is abdominal migraine treated? Once a child is diagnosed with abdominal migraine, treatment generally falls into two categories: relieving symptoms during an episode and preventing future episodes. While there are few studies on the treatment and management of abdominal migraine, doctors may prescribe the following medications, based on their usefulness in treating migraines: - NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) or acetaminophen to relieve the pain. - Triptans. This family of drugs is commonly used to treat migraine headaches and, if taken as soon as a migraine starts, can prevent symptoms from progressing. - Anti-nausea medication. Anti-nausea drugs act by blocking chemicals in the brain that trigger vomiting. Some studies have shown evidence to support the use of the following medications in preventing abdominal migraine: - Pizotifen, a benzocycloheptene-based drug. - Flunarazine, agent. - Cyproheptadine, an anti-histamine. - Propranolol, a beta blocker with potentially serious side effects, including depression and hypotension. As with migraine headaches, one of the main ways to prevent future abdominal migraines is to avoid triggers. Parents, children, and doctors can work together to identify specific triggers and devise strategies to help children avoid them. What is unique about how Yale Medicine treats abdominal migraine?
