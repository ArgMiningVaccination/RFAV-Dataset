(\"Apple\") complains and alleges as follow s against Defendant s Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Samsung Electronics America, Inc., and Samsung Telecommunications America, LLC (collectively \"Samsung\"). THE NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. Apple revolutionized the telecommunications industry in 2007 when it introduced the wildly popular iPhone, a product that dramatically changed the way people view mobile phones. Reviewers, analysts and consumers immediately recognized the iPhone as a \"game changer.\" Before the iPhone, cell phones were utilitarian devices with key pads for dialin g and small, passive display screens that did not allow for touch control. The iPhone was radically different. In one small and lightweight handheld device , it offered sophisticated mobile phone functions, a multi-touch screen that allows users to contro l the phone with their fingers, music storage and playback, a mobile computing platform for handheld applications, and full access to the Internet. These features were combined in an elegantly designed product with a distinctive user interface, icons , and eye-catching displays that gave the iPhone an unmistakable look. 2. Those design features were carried over to the iPod touch, another product that Apple introduced in 2007. The iPod touch has a product configuration and physical appearance that is virtua lly identical to the iPhone. Moreover, the iPod touch utilizes the same user interface icons and screen layout as the iPhone, displaying the unmistakable iPhone appearance . 3. Apple introduced another revolutionary product, the iPad, in 2010. The iPad is an elegantly designed computer tablet with a color touch screen, a user interface reminiscent of the iPhone's user interface, and robust functionality that spans both mobile computing and media storage and playback. Because of its innovative technology and distinctive design, the iPad achieved instant success . 4. Apple's creative achievements have resulted in broad intellectual property protection for Apple's innovations, including utility and design patents, trademarks, and trade dress protection. Nevertheless, Apple's innovations have been the subject of widespread emulation by its competitors, who have attempted to capitalize on Apple's success by imitating Apple's innovative technology, distinctive user interfaces , and elegant and distinctive product 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 2 design. One of the principal imitators is Samsung, which recently introduced the Galaxy line of mobile phones and Galaxy Tab computer tablet, all of which use the Google Android operating system, to compete with the iPhone and iPad. Instead of pursuing indepen dent product development, Samsung has chosen to slavishly copy Apple's innovative technology, distinctive user interfaces, and elegant and distinctive product and packaging design, in violation of Apple's valuable intellectual property rights. As alleged below in detail, Samsung has made its Galaxy phones and computer tablet work and look like Apple's products through widespread patent and trade dress infringement. Samsung has even misappropriated Apple's distinctive product packaging. 5. By this action, Ap ple seeks to put a stop to Samsung's illegal conduct and obtain compensation for the violations that have occurred thus far. THE PARTIES 6.

Apple is a leading designer and manufacturer of mobile communication devices, personal computers, and portable digital media players. As a result of its significant investment in research and development, Apple has developed innovative technologies that have changed the face of the computer and telecommunications industries. One such pioneering technology is Apple's Multi -Touch user interface, which allows users to navigate their iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad devices by tapping and swiping their fingers on the screen. 14. In 2007, Apple revolutionized the telecommunications industry when it introduced the iPhone. The iPhone combine d in one small and lightweight handheld device sophisticated mobile phone functions , media storage and playback, a tactile user interface that allows users to control the phone with their fingers, mobile computing power to run diverse pre -installed and downloadable applications, and functionality to gain full access to the Internet. These features were combined in an elegant glass and stainless steel case with a distinctive user interface that gave the iPhone an immediately recognizable look. 15. As a direct result of its innovative and distinctive design and its cutting edge technological features , the iPhone was an instant success, and it immediately became uniquely associated with Apple as its source. Reviewers and analysts universally praised the iPhone for its \"game changing\" features. Time Magazine listed the iPhone number one on its List of Top Ten Gadgets for 2007, noting that \"[t]he iPhone changed the way we think about how mobile media devices should look, feel and perform.\" The New York Times called it \"revolutionary.\" As of March 2011, more than 108 million iPhones had been sold worldwide. 16. Also in 2007, Apple launched the iPod touch, a digital music player. The iPod touch incorporated the distinct style of the iPhone and also became an immediate success. By March 2011, Apple had sold over 60 million units. 17. After introducing the iPhone, Apple continued to innovate and achieve success with a series of pioneering designs \u2014more sophisticated, advanced versions of the iPhone , and then, in 2010, the iPad. The iPad is a computer tablet with a color 9.7 -inch touch screen that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 5 allows user s to manipulate icons and data with their fingers in the same fashion as the iPhone and iPod touch screens. R eviewers and analysts immediately recognized the iPad as a revolutionary product, describing it as a \"winner\" and a \"new category of device\" that would \"replace laptops for many people.\" 18. No computer product that preceded the iPad looked like the iPad , but its design did resemble other Apple products \u2014namely, the iPhone and the iPod touch, thereby extending the unique and innovative Apple design and trade dress to a new product\u2014 tablet computers. In its first 80 days on the market , Apple sold 3 million iPad units. By March 2011, Apple sold over 19 million iPads. 19. Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod touch products have been extensively advertised throughout the United States in virtually every media outlet, including network and syndicated television, the Internet, billboards, magazines and newspapers \u2014with the vast major ity of the advertisements featuring photographs of the distinctive design of these products . Apple's advertising expenditures for these products for fiscal years 2007 -2010 were in excess of $2 billion. 20. In addition, Apple's iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad pr oducts have received unsolicited comment and attention in print and broadcast media throughout the world. Each new generation of these Apple products is the subject of positive commentary and receive s unsolicited praise from independent media commentators. Frequently, these unsolicited commentaries are accompanied by images of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch products , including their unique packaging. 21. The Apple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad product design has come to represent and symbolize the superb qua lity of Apple's products and enjoys substantial goodwill among consumers. The iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch have garnered widespread acclaim for their unique product design and outstanding performance.

The style carries over within the box\u2014with the iPhone cradled within a specially designed black display so that the iPhone, and nothing else, is immediately visible when the box is opened. The accessories and instructional materials are hidden from view underneath the iPhone tray\u2014emphasizing the accessible nature of the iPhone itself. The design entices purchasers to pick up the iPhone and try it out, without worrying th at it is complicated. 30. As with the product configuration itself, e ach of these elements of the iPhone packaging is distinctive and serves to identify Apple as the source of the iPhone products. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 10 Moreover, none of these elements is functional\u2014 and there are a plethora of alternative packaging options available to Apple's competitors . iPod touch Trade Dress 31.

Samsung has imported into or sold in the United States the following products, each of which infringes one or more of Apple's Intellectual Property Rights: the Samsung Captivate, Continuu m, Vibrant, Galaxy S 4G, Epic 4G, Indulge, Mesmerize, Showcase, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 17 Fascinate, Nexus S, Gem, Transform, Intercept, and Acclaim smart phones and the Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet. 55. Rather than innovate and develop its own technology and a unique Samsung style for its smart phone products and computer table ts, Samsung chose to copy Apple's technology, user interface and innovative style in these infringing products. 56. Samsung's Galaxy family of mobile products , introduced in 2010 , is exemplary. The copying is so perv asive, that the Samsung Galaxy products appear to be actual Apple products\u2014 with the same rectangular shape with rounded corners, silver edging, a flat surface face with substantial top and bottom black borders, gently curving edges on the back, and a displ ay of colorful square icons with rounded co rners. When a Samsung Galaxy phone is used in public, there can be little doubt that it would be viewed as an Apple product based upon the design alone. 57. Samsung had many options in developing its smart phones . Indeed, earlier versions of Samsung smart phones did not embody the same combination of elements of Apple's trade dress. Even the icons in earlier versions of the Samsung smart phones looked different because they had a variety of shapes \u2014and did not appear as a field of square icons with rounded corners. 58. Samsung it chose to infringe Apple's patents, trade dress, and trademark rights through the design, packaging and promotion of its Galaxy mobile phones and the Galaxy Tab computer tablet, and similar produc ts, and it did so willfully to trade upon the goodwill that Apple has developed in connection with its Apple family of mobile products. Infringement of Apple's Patents 59. Samsung's infringement of the Apple utility patents identified in this Complaint provides Samsung with unique functionality for its products that was the result of Apple's innovation, not Samsung's. Samsung has not obtained permission from Apple to use its inventions in the identified utility patents. 60. Moreover, a s the side-by- side comparis ons shown below reveal, Samsung has misappropriated Apple's patented mobile phone design in the accused products, including the Samsung Galaxy mobile phone depicted below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 18 'D677 Patent 'D790 Patent 'D016 Patent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 19 Infringement of Apple's Tr ade Dress 61. Samsung announced its Galaxy line of Android -based smart phones in March of 2010 in South Korea. The original model, Galaxy S i9000, is shown below side by side with an iPhone 3GS. 62. Each of Samsung's Galaxy ph ones embodies a combination of several elements of the Apple Product Configuration Trade Dress identified above, namely, a product configuration with Apple iPhone 3GS Galaxy S i9000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 20 a rectangular product shape with all four corners uniformly rounded; the front surface of the product dominated by a screen surface with black borders; substantial black borders above and below the screen having roughly equal width and narrower black borders on either side of the screen having roughly equal width; a metallic surround framing the perim eter of the top surface; a display of a grid of colorful square icons with uniformly rounded corners ; and a bottom row of icons set off from the other icons and that do not change as the other pages of the user interface are viewed. 63. Samsung also imitated Apple's Product Packaging Trade Dress: Samsung's packaging includes: a rectangular box with metallic silver lettering and a large front- view picture of the product prominently on the top surface of the box; a two-piece box wherein the bott om piece is completely nested in the top piece; and use of a design that cradles products to make them immediately visible upon opening the box. 64. As shown below, Samsung's Galaxy Tab computer tablet also slavishly copies a combination of several elements of the Apple Product Configuration T rade Dress. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 21 Samsung Tab Specifically, t he Samsung computer tablet has : rectangular product shape with all four corners uniformly rounded; front surface of the product dominated by a screen surface with black bor ders; substantial black borders on all sides being roughly equal in width; and a display of a grid of colorful square icons with uniformly rounded corners. 65. Samsung's Galaxy Tab computer tablet packaging also features key elements of the Apple Product Packaging Trade Dress for Apple's iPad products. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 22 The following Apple Product P ackaging T rade Dress is incorporated in the Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet computer products: a rectangular box with metallic silver lettering and a large front- view picture of the product prominently on the top surface of the box; a two-piece box wherein the bottom piece is completely nested in the top piece; and use of a design that cradles products to make them immediately visible upon opening the box. Infringement of Apple's Trademarks 66. In addition to copying Apple's Product Trade Dress , Samsung has also copied numerous application icons in which Apple had valid trademark rights, as shown below: Apple Icons Samsung Icons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 23 Apple Icons Samsung Icons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 24 67. Moreover, the icon that Samsung uses for its music application is virtually identical to the iTunes \"Eighth Note and CD\" logo that Apple has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office: 68. Samsung's adoption of a trade dress that slavishly copies the Apple Product T rade Dress and its use of various icons that infringe Apple's trademark rights is likely to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive consumers , purchasers, and others into thinking that Samsung products are Apple products, or that they are sponsored by or affiliated with Apple, when they are not. The copying is particularly problematic because the Samsung Galaxy products are the type of products that will be used in public \u2014on the bus, in cafes, in store s, or at school, where third parties, who were no t present when the products were purchased, will associate them with Apple because they have the unmistakable Apple look that is created from the various elements of the Apple Trade Dress. 69. Of significant con cern for Apple is that Apple devotes a tremendous amount of resources\u2014technical research and development and design resources \u2014to develop its cutting edge products. Part of the cachet of Apple products is the very fact that they consistently stand -out from all of the other products on the market. Apple's goodwill among consumers is closely tied to its position as an outlier in technology and communications products, which causes each release of a new product to be highly anticipated among consumers who want to be among the early adopte rs of the newest Apple product. Samsung's flagrant and relentless copying of Apple's intellectual property rights in its Galaxy family of products not only allows Samsung to Apple Icon Samsung Icon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 25 reap benefits from Apple's investment, it also thre atens to diminish the very important goodwill that Apple has cultivated with its products. 70. On information and belief Samsung's marketing has played up the similarities between its Galaxy family of phones and the Apple iPhone . On information and belief, Samsung's mobile phones were marketed as the phone that is the closest to the iPhone\u2014for consumers who wanted a product with the distinctive Apple look , but who did not want to pay for the real product . 71. Apple's e fforts to address Samsung's pervasive copying of Apple's innovations and intellectual property directly with Samsung have been unsuccessful. Apple is left with no choice but to file this lawsuit in order to protect one of its most valuable assets \u2014the technology used in and the designs of the iPhone, iPod touch, and the iPad. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Trade Dress Infringement) (Lanham Act Section 43(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)) 72. Apple incorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 71 of this Complaint. 73. Apple is the owner of all right and title to the distinc tive iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad trade dress. The Apple Product Configuration Trade Dress , as embodied in the Apple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad products, has acquired secondary meaning, and is not functional. In addition, the Apple Product Packaging Trade Dress, embodied in the packaging for the Apple iPhone and iPad devices, is inherently distinctive and not functional. 74. In addition, based on extensive and consistent advertising, promotion and sales throughout the United States, the Apple Product Trade Dress has acquired distinctiveness and enjoys secondary meaning among consumers, identifying Apple as the source of these products. 75. Apple's extensive promotion of the distinctive Apple Product Trade Dress has resulted in Apple's acquisition of valuable, l egally protected rights in the Apple Product Trade Dress as well as considerable customer goodwill. 76. The Samsung Galaxy line of products ha s misappropriated the Apple Product Trade Dress by mimicking a combination of several elements of that trade dress. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 26 77. Samsung's manufacture and distribution of the Samsung Galaxy products with packaging, product design , and product user interface features that mimic a combination of several elements of the Apple Product Trade Dress is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive the consumer as to the affiliation, connection or association of Samsung with Apple, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval by Apple of Samsung's goods, services or commercial activities. 78. Samsung's manufacture and distribution of the Samsung Galaxy line of products with packaging, product design and product user interface features that mimic a combination of several elements of the Apple Product Trade Dress enables Samsung to benefit unfairly from Apple's reputation and success , thereby giving Samsung's infringing products sales and commercial value they would not have otherwise. 79. Samsung's actions constitute unfair competition and false designation or origin in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a71125(a). 80. Samsung knew of Apple's Product Trade Dress when it designed its Galaxy line of products, and has refused to change its product or packaging design in response to Apple's repeated objections. Accordingly, Samsung's infringement has been and continues to b e intentional, willful and without regard to Apple's Product Trade Dress. 81. Apple has been and will continue to be irreparably harmed and damaged by Samsung's conduct, and Apple lacks an adequate remedy at law to compensate for this harm and damage. 82. Apple is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Samsung has gained profits by virtue of its infringement of the Apple Product Trade Dress. 83. Apple also has sustained damages as a direct and proximate result of Samsung's infringement of the Apple Product Trade Dress in an amount to be proven at trial. 84. Because Samsung's actions have been willful, Apple is entitled to treble its actual damages or Samsung's profits, whichever is greater, and to an award of costs, and, this being an exceptional case, rea sonable attorney s' fees pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 APPLE INC.'S COMPLAINT sf-2981926 27 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Federal Trade Dress Infringement) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114) 85. Apple incorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 84 of this Complaint. 86. Apple owns three registrations for the design and configuration of the iPhone. 87.

U.S. Registration No. 3,475,327 is for a rectangular handheld mobile digital electronic device with a gray rectangular portion in t he center, a black band above and below the gray rectangle and on the curved corners, and a silver outer border and side. 90. The Samsung Galaxy line of products copy and infringe these three trade dress registrations (collectively, \"Apple's Registered Trade Dress\"). 91. Samsung's manufacture and distribution of the Samsung Galaxy products with packaging, product design, and product user interface features that copy a combination of several elements of Apple's Registered Trade Dress is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive the consumer as to the affiliation, connection or association of Samsung with Apple, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval by Apple of Samsung's goods, services or commercial activities. 92. Samsung's manufacture and distribution of the Samsung Galaxy line of products with packaging, product design and product user interface features that cop y a combination of several elements of Apple's Registered Trade Dress enables Samsung to benefit unfairly from Apple's reputation and success, thereby giving Samsung's infringing products sales and commercial value they would not have otherwise. 93.

Samsung's unauthorized use of a trade dress for its Galaxy product line that infringes Apple's Registered Trade Dress is likely, if not certain, to deceive or to cause confusion or mistake among consumers as to the origin, sponsorship or approval of the Samsung Galaxy line of products and/or to cause confusion or mistake as to any affiliatio n, connection or association between Apple and Samsung, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(a). 95.

Apple has no adequate remedy at law to compensate it for the loss of business reputation, customers, market position, confusion of potential customers and good will flowing from the Samsung's infringing activities. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116, Apple is entitled to an injunction against Samsung's continuing infringement of Apple's Registered Trade Dress. Unless enjoined, Samsung will co ntinue its infringing conduct. 98.
