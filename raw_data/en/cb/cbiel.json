Rudolf Steiner (1861 - 1925), son of an Austrian railroad stationmaster, experienced natural clairvoyance from childhood. He distinguished between what was \"seen\" with the senses in common with others, and the \"unseen\" world, which was more vivid and saturated with meaning as the creative truth within and behind the physical world. He longed to build a bridge between these two aspects of the world. This led him to study science at the prestigious Vienna Technical College, to earn a PhD in philosophy, to become the editor of Goethe's scientific writings, an author, and an adult educator. Having established the philosophical foundation for a worldview that encompasses the human capacity to know ourselves and the world in a way that includes the spiritual dimension, in 1900 Rudolf Steiner began for the first time to speak directly about the content of his spiritual insights. He also described inner disciplines and exercises that constituted a Western path, based on thinking, which could lead to knowledge of higher worlds. This work he called spiritual science, or anthroposophy. Over time, practitioners of various vocations asked his advice for renewing their fields of endeavor. His capacity to see deeply into the essential nature of phenomena led to such fruitful impulses as Waldorf pedagogy for children; anthroposophic architecture, medicine and therapies; the art of eurythmy; social renewal, and biodynamic agriculture. These and many other impulses continue to be a source of health-giving inspiration. Rudolf Steiner's discoveries required the capacities of a spiritual researcher, but because he was committed to the appropriateness in our time of absolute inner freedom rather than blind faith, he translated his experiences into clear thoughts that could be understood by anyone with an open mind. Through the Anthroposophical Society people who are interested in anthroposophy can find one another and learn more about it. SteinerBooks publishes Rudolf Steiner's books and lectures.
