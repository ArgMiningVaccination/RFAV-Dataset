About the events' healing facilitators & Vendors: - Tara Jo Schmeling of Idol Hands Healing: With extensive experience in the medical field as a nurse, she felt that something was missing. Tara discovered the healing power of Reiki, gemstones and much more. Now, she brings her many talents including her handmade healing gemstone jewelry, yoga, Reiki and more to the community. - Teresa DeMasi discovered sound healing through her yoga program at the Southwest Institute of Healing Arts (SWIHA). She is passionate about helping others heal themselves through a holistic approach. The vibration of the Gong can be a powerful source of healing for many. Her mission is to educate, empower, and guide others in their journey in finding balance through a combination of yoga, meditation, and sound healing. - Phillip Waddell has been a drum circle facilitator for the past 6 years and a sound healer. Sound healing and drum circles, both, raise the energetic vibration of the body; they help reduce stress and anxiety for improved wellness; and they create a deeper connection to source and to the inner self. He has witnessed the power of this work through his own self healing; and now it's his turn to offer this medicine to the community. - Deep AZ Henna: My name is Bhavdeep, owner of Deep Veda Spa & Henna Boutique. I'm an ICNHA (International Certified Natural Henna Artist) and I make each handcrafted batch of henna with love. I am driven by unique creativity and believe that every guest deserves the best quality and custom designs specially for them.
