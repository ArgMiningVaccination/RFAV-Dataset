According to Ayurvedic philosophy, everyone is born with a particular constitution called prakruti, which determines their physical and psychological characteristics. This is influenced by various internal and external factors like day and night, the seasons, and lifestyle choices, which Ayurveda attempts to balance to achieve good health. Prakruti contains three doshas\u2014energies that have a specific impact on your body. These doshas are vata, pitta, and kapha, and they each relate to particular elements of the earth: As one of the oldest health practices in the world, Ayurveda has produced a variety of techniques to promote holistic healing.
