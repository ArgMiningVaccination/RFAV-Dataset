(Terry Byrne, ) Summaries Of The News: [ Vaccine Advisers Vote To Update And Simplify Future Covid Vaccines ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/vaccine-advisers-vote-to-update-and-simplify-future-covid-vaccines/) By a 21-0 vote, members of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee recommended that U.S. covid vaccine strategy move toward a single covid shot. All manufacturers would update their formulas to match, making primary and booster shots interchangeable. The panel also supported the plan for annual vaccines, like the flu shot. [ NPR: An FDA Committee Votes To Roll Out A New COVID Vaccination Strategy ](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/01/26/1151810765/fda-committee-votes-to-roll-out-new-covid-vaccination-strategy) A committee of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously on a proposal to simplify the nation's strategy for vaccinating people against COVID-19. The recommendation is that future COVID-19 vaccines should be interchangeable: no matter whether you're getting your first dose or a booster, the vaccines would all have the same formulation targeting the same viral strain or strains, regardless of the manufacturer. The vote was unanimous: 21-0. (Hensley, 1/26) [ Stat: FDA Advisers Recommend Updating Covid Vaccines ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/01/26/fda-advisers-recommend-updating-covid-vaccines/) The panel voted 21-to-0 to direct vaccine manufacturers Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax to \"harmonize\" the primary series of their vaccines \u2014 the first doses that people receive \u2014 with the new booster shots that contain both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a new Omicron strain. Members of the panel were also supportive of the FDA's plan to move to a single annual vaccine dose for most Americans, which will be matched annually to circulating strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (Herper and Branswell, 1/26) [ The New York Times: Covid Vaccines Targeting Omicron Should Be Standard, Panel Says ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/health/covid-vaccines-boosters.html) Among their proposals was adopting a streamlined dosing schedule for all Covid vaccines, one that would apply to Americans based on their age and health risks. Under that proposal, most adults and children with previous vaccines could receive a single extra Covid shot each fall, while older adults, people with weakened immune systems and unvaccinated children could be given more than one additional dose. The expert advisers did not vote on that proposal. But they offered an outline for how they wanted federal health officials to consider making the Covid vaccination program more routine, pressing them on how to time boosters for greatest protection and formulate them to best defend against new variants. (Mueller and LaFraniere, 1/26) [ CNBC: FDA Advisors Recommend Using Covid Omicron Shots For All Doses ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/26/fda-advisors-recommend-using-covid-omicron-shots-for-all-doses.html) The FDA has proposed moving to a system that resembles how the agency updates and rolls out flu shots every year. The agency would select a Covid vaccine formulation in June to target the variant that is expected to dominate in the fall and winter. That formulation would be used by all manufacturers for all doses. Under the proposal, most people who have been exposed to the Covid spike protein twice, either through vaccination or infection, would only receive one Covid shot a year moving forward. Older adults and people with compromised immune systems may need two shots because they don't mount as strong of an immune response.

Any changes in vaccine policy will need to be ratified by the FDA commissioner. Implementation of the strategy requires a meeting of a second advisory panel and approval by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Weintraub, 1/26) [ KHN: FDA Experts Are Still Puzzled Over Who Should Get Which Covid Shots And When ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/fda-future-covid-vaccine-strategy-impact/) At a meeting to simplify the nation's covid vaccination policy, the FDA's panel of experts could agree on only one thing: Information is woefully lacking about how often different groups of Americans need to be vaccinated. That data gap has contributed to widespread skepticism, undervaccination, and ultimately unnecessary deaths from covid-19. The committee voted unanimously Thursday to support the FDA's proposal for all vaccine-makers to adopt the same strain of the virus when making changes in their vaccines, and suggested they might meet in May or June to select a strain for the vaccines that would be rolled out this fall.

In an advisory meeting convened earlier today, the FDA signaled its intention to start doling out COVID vaccines just like flu shots: once a year in autumn, for just about everyone, ad infinitum.

If those variants subside, approval could be reconsidered the FDA said. [ Bloomberg: AstraZeneca's Covid Drug Loses US Authorization Due To Variants ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-26/astrazeneca-s-covid-drug-no-longer-authorized-for-use-in-the-us) AstraZeneca Plc's Covid antibody drug is no longer authorized for use in the US, regulators said Thursday, as it's unlikely to work against strains of the virus that are now dominant across the country. Astra's drug, called Evusheld, was authorized in December 2021 to prevent Covid infection in high-risk people, but has been rendered less effective by the virus' mutations.

Taken together with XBB.1.5, versions of Covid that are resistant to Evusheld now represent nearly 93% of new cases in the U.S. \"Today's action to limit the use of Evusheld prevents exposing patients to possible side effects of Evusheld such as allergic reactions, which can be potentially serious, at a time when fewer than 10% of circulating variants in the U.S. causing infection are susceptible to the product,\" the FDA said in a statement Thursday. (Kimball, 1/26) [ Stat: FDA Pulls Evusheld Authorization As Coronavirus Evolution Quashes Another Therapy ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/01/26/fda-evusheld/) In a statement, AstraZeneca said it has started trials of another antibody that, in lab studies so far, has been able to neutralize all variants. The therapy, which would similarly be given as a pre-exposure prophylaxis to immunocompromised people, could be available later this year if trials are successful, the company said. The company's statement also noted that Evusheld remains authorized in other countries, including the European Union and Japan.

The $21.6 million in funding, which includes a $6.6 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will help NYSDOH launch new pilot programs through its Wastewater Surveillance Network to test for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis A, norovirus, and antimicrobial-resistance genes.
