Chiropractic was the most common therapy used, being cited by 36% of respondents, followed by relaxation techniques and massage at 23%. Prayer was cited by 21% of respondents. [Figure 1](#F1) Exactly half reported using at least one alternative therapy in the previous 12 months, but within this group only 44% discussed this fact with their physician. More than half of these respondents (53%) felt it was unimportant for their doctor to know and 39% thought that it was none of their doctor's business. Some (22%) thought their doctors would not approve and 21% felt their physician would discourage them from seeking alternative care. Most (72%) believed that using alternative medicine in combination with conventional medicine is better than using either alone. Canadians spend an estimated $3.8 billion on alternative medicine every year. This includes provider fees ($1.8 billion), books, medical equipment, herbs, vitamins and special diet programs; $3.8 billion accounts for more than 16% of all private health care expenditures in 1995. By way of comparison, total annual capital expenditures in Canada's hospitals stood at $2.1 billion in 1995. Most respondents (60%) felt that alternative medicine should not be covered by provincial health plans but should remain a private expense.
