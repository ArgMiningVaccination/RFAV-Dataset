In an effort to reduce the high infant morbidity and mortality, Arizona applied for and received a federal demonstration grant. The grant was designed to reduce infant death s by transporting critically ill newborns born in rural hospitals to intensive car e centers . As a result, there was a dramatic decrease in neonatal mortality. In 1972, the State Legislature provided state funding for the program, which eventually became the Newborn Intensive Care Program (NICP). The system provided care to those infan ts transported to metropolitan hospitals (Level III's) and expanded to include infants born in Level II or Level III hospitals. Comprehensive and periodic developmental assessments were an additional component of the follow -up services provided in specific areas of the state. In 1975, ADHS received a Robert Wood Johnson Grant to develop regionalized perinatal care with a focus on the maternal transport system. Under this grant, the Maternal Transport Program (MTP), the Arizona Perinatal Program (APP), the Arizona Medical Association (AMA) and the University of Arizona began to develop guidelines for Level I, II, and III perinatal hospital services, a perinatal data system and the system of maternal transport. In 1977, it was demonstrated that babies did ve ry well if transported to hospitals closer to their homes following the acute phase of their illness. Therefore, back transport was added as a component of the NICP. In the late 1980 s, the need for home -based community health nursing services for those infants who may not have been critically ill at birth but were diagnosed with problems at a later date was identified . Part C of the Public Law for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), provided incentive for the development of a system of early intervention services which could provide a comprehensive, culturally appropriate, multi- disciplinary, family centered approach to all families. In 1993, ADHS awarded contracts to developmental clinics to determine eligibility for the Arizona Early I ntervention Program (A zEIP). In 2002, funding for the developmental clinic component was eliminated. Arizona physicians and therapists then had few options for the evaluation of their developmentally delayed patients. Physicians began working closely with the Arizona legislature to restore funding for this much needed service. In FY 2007 the legislature partially restored funding to allow the HRPP/NICP to provide developmental assessments to program enrollees who do not meet Arizona Early Intervention (AzE IP) eligibility criteria and are uninsured or underinsured. The Community Health Nursing component works with families to improve their infant's developmental outcomes. Services may be provided through a child's third birthday. Research has demonstrated that the health of the mother before she becomes pregnant plays a significant role in the wellbeing of the newborn. To address those issues the CHN also incorporates post - partum wellness assessment and guidance about inter -conception wellness into her fami ly centered care. During FY 2009, the state experienced a severe budget downfall. As the result of budget reductions, and in an effort to serve the sickest infants, the Program changed eligibility to infants who have spent at least 5 days in the NICU and restricted back transports to families who live over 30 miles from the NICU. The developmental services component was eliminated at that time also as a result of underutilization. 2 | Page 2 High Risk Perinatal Program (HRPP) 2.1 Philosophy HRPP depends on par tnerships with families, medical communities, funding sources, and policy makers to provide risk appropriate transport, newborn hospital care, and community health nursing for high risk pregnant women and critically ill newborns. These services should be accessible to all critically ill newborns and their families in Arizona regardless of geographic location and ability to pay; in order to protect families from catastrophic costs. 2.2 Mission Statement The mission of HRPP is to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality through a regionalized statewide system of coordinated care that includes consultation, transportation, hospital care and community health nursing. 2.3 Goals Transport : Medical consultation and transport for high risk mothers and infants to the most appropriate level of medical care . Hospital : Medical treatment, education and developmentally appropriate care for high risk infants . Working with perinatal partners to reduce the impact of catastrophic medical costs on families with high risk infants through reduced fees and financial support. Community Health Nursing : Monitor the health and development of high risk infants through in-home follow -up providing family support, edu cation, and resources . 2.4 Overview The High Risk Perinatal Program consists of main 3 components: A. Transport Services B. Hospital Services C. Community Health Nursing Services A. Transport Services Transport Services consist of: a. Medical Consultation and Case Management The ADHS contracts with neonatology and maternal fetal medicine groups throughout the state to provide free 24/7 medical consultation regarding the treatment, stabilization and, if needed, approval of coordination of inter- facility neonatal and maternal transport. b. Information and Referral The ADHS provides access to a toll free telephone service that serves as the crucial link between referring health care providers and consulting maternal fetal medicine (MFM) specialists and neonatologists. If, at the time of consult, a transport is deemed necessary, the contracted neonatologist or MFM will make transport arrangements with a contracted transport company. 1-800-552-5252 3 | Page c. Medical Transportation Families benefit from the Transport Services by having a coordinated system in place to ensure appropriate inter- facility transport and admission to high risk perinatal centers. The services are initiated without prior authorization or verification of payment source to prevent delays in service deliver y. The ADHS contracts with medical transport companies to provide air and ground transport, as well as team services, for high risk pregnant women and neonates. The HRPP transport providers must obtain prior authorization and direction from a board certified MFM or neonatologist licensed and practicing in Arizona and contracted with the ADHS. The transport providers must be accompanied by a program contracted transport team. B. Hospital Services Hospital services consist of: a. Hospital Care The ADHS contrac ts with all Level II, Level IIE (Enhanced ), Level III, and Level IV perinatal centers (see glossary) that are certified by the A rizona Perinatal Trust (APT) to provide the appropriate level of hospital care to Program babies and their families. Contracts are in place with neonatology groups to provide appropriate medical care to program infants during the newborn intensive, intermediate or continuing care hospitalization. In addition, the Program contracts with all Level IIE , Level III, and Level IV cente rs to support the implementation of developmental care practices in their newborn intensive care unit. b. Financial Assistance to Families As a payor of last resort, HRPP Hospital Services provides limited financial ass istance for families who enroll . Financial assistance includes inpatient physician services and forward or back transport (if needed). It is provided to families only after they have applied for all other possible benefits. These benefits may include 3rd party private insurance, AHCCCS, county and other government programs ; and these benefits must be billed first. If the newborn is not added , enrolled , and maintained on the family's insurance, HRPP will deny payment and the family will be solely responsible. Families are not protected fr om costs with providers who do not contract with ADHS . The program does not pay for any services provided at non -contract ed facilities prior to transport to a contracted hospital. Health care costs related to the mother are not included coverages and will be denied. Hospitals, using the ADHS formulas, establish the liability for each family requesting financial assistance. All contracted hospital and physicians agree not to bill the family more than their established family liability Family liability is based on one amount per family rather than per child in the event of a multiple birth delivery. The liability is established once to cover all associated inpatient costs for the infant(s). At any time, HRPP may request documentation demonstrating tha t a family's liability has been met. The HRPP Claims Coordinator works with the family and the providers to track the distribution of family liability payments . The family's liability is the total amount that the family must pay to contracted providers b efore a bill is considered for payment by HRPP. The family liability is generally applied to hospital and physician bills accordingly: 75% to hospitals and 25% to specialty services. When a hospital does not require the entire 75%, the remaining liability is applied to physicians in the NICU, or 4 | Page transport. Conversely, if the specialty services do not require the 25%, the remainder will be applied to the hospital bill. The family will be responsible for the entire established family liability. C. Community He alth Nursing Community Health Nursing delivers a statewide, coordinated system of specialized nursing services to infants who are enrolled in the Program. The Community Health Nurse (CHN) provides support to families during the transition of the infant to home; conducts physical, developmental, psychosocial and environmental assessment and screening of the discharged infant. The CHN administers a post - partum depression screening and scoring of the mother and provides education about inter - conception health. The CHN connects mothers and infants to community resources. The CHN collaborates with the mothers on issues related to their own wellbeing in an effort to improve their ability to meet the needs of the enrolled infants and decrease the likelihood of a po or birth outcome with subsequent pregnancies. This program collaborates with the Office for Children with Special Health Care Needs (OCSHCN) to provide services to children who have a chronic medical condition and whose families express a desire for information, support, and/or coordination with multiple service providers and resources. The CHNs also assists with blood spot collections for the Newborn Screening (NBS) program as needed . 5 | Page Baby born outside of HRPP contracted hospital and needs risk appropriate NICU care Baby inborn at HRPP contracted hospital and needs higher level of care than can be provided at birth hospital MATERNAL TRANSPORT High-risk pregnant women who need risk appropriate care 1-800 STATE TRANSPORT LINE Link between referring health care providers and consulting maternal fetal medicine specialists and neonatologists Mother arrives at hospital End of Maternal Services End of Progr am HOSPITAL STAY >120 hour s stay at Arizona Perinatal Trust (APT) certified Level II, IIE , III, IV HRPP contracted hospital s BACK OR FORWARD TRANSPORT Infant can be transported to APT certified hospital within family's community *Back or forward to non- APT certified hospitals with program approval OUT -OF-STATE NICU Graduate Arizona Resident HRPP NICU Graduate Child identified with special health care need after discharge or during home visit COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSING Home visit(s) for high risk HRPP infant s or OCSHCN infants, toddlers, and children COMMUNITY (DDD, AzEIP, OCSHCN, WIC, AHCCCS, etc.) CONSULTA TION & CASE MANAGEMENT Neonatology and maternal fetal medicine groups provide medical consultation regarding the treatment, stabilization and, if needed, approval and coordination of inter -facility neonatal and maternal transport.

Home visiting services are based on health, development, environment and relationship risk. Peri odic monitoring of the child's medical and developmental needs identifies infants who would benefit from referral to other early intervention programs. The service planning process must be flexible, coordinated and culturally sensitive. Immediate needs an d concerns must be explored with the family as well as long term and future goals. Through these home visits, families receive support and education as well as referral to appropriate community resources. 5.2 Eligibility Requirements A. The primary caregiver/pare nt of the in fant must: a. Reside in Arizona when eligibility is determined and throug hout period of service delivery . b. A residential street address . P.O. Box address is not acceptable; AND, B. The infant (s) must meet one or more of the criteria below in order to be eligible for the program: a. Infants who require 120 hours or more of continuous care in a NICU or SCN beginning within 96 hours of birth. (Example: infant is discharged 24 hours after birth and is readmitted to NICU at 4 days of age with a neonatal condition that was present but not detected at birth) ; b. Infants approved for admission or t ransported to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a Level III or IV hospital due to cardiac conditions for w hich the NICU is not equipped; c. Infants who require d NICU or SCN care and who subsequently expire after medical intervention occurred ; d. Infants with special health needs other than the above may be authorized for enrollment upon the request of a neonatologis t and at the discretion of the contracted agency . The neonatologist name and reason fo r the request must be included. e. Any infant who was in a NICU in another state whose parents now reside in Arizona qualify for CHN follow -up services . C. Infants who do not meet the established criteria for HRPP may be eligible for Community Health Nursing services for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN ). See Section 8 Visit Guidelines for Special Populations for more information. 5.3 Enrollment A. By Hospital ADHS contracted hospitals enroll an infant meeting the eligibility criteria. Each contracted hospital shall have designated and trained personnel available to explain the Program to eligible families and assist them with enrollment. HRPP requires that hospital personnel be responsible for completion of all forms required for enrollment. a. Enrollment in the HRPP occurs when the following touchpoints are completed by a hospital in the Efforts to Outcome (ETO) database: Enrollment Form - Demographics Enrollment Form - Signature Page HRPP Discharge Summary b. The birth hospital is usually considered the enrolling hospital, provided that the infant spends 120 hours in their NICU or SCN. The enrolling hospital is required to complete and distribute ALL HRPP forms and enter into ETO. I. If the infant is transported within the first 120 hours, the contracted receiving hospital will be considered the enrolling hospital, and is required to distribute, complete, and enter all 11 | Page forms into ETO . II. If the infant is transported after the first 120 hours, the contracted birth hospital is required to distribute, complete, and enter into ETO all of the forms. B. By Community Health Nurse An infant meeting the HRPP eligibility criteria may be enrolled by a CHN only when : a. the family qualified but was not offe red the program at the hospital b. the family initially declined services but changed their mind within 30 days of birth c. the infant spent 120 hours in a NICU out of state but resides in Arizona d. a special request was made by a neonatologist or pediatrician e. sibling of eligible infant (twin) f. a child does not meet HRPP eligibility criteria but would qualify under CYSHCN (see below ). Enrollment in the HRP P or CYSHCN occurs when the following data is entered by a CHN in ETO : Enrollment Form - Demographics Enrollment Form - Signature Page 5.4 Program Participation When enrolling at the hospital, families will be offered two options to choose from; full or pa rtial. A. Full Participation a. Full participation provides the fam ily with the opportunity for developmental follow -up visits from a community health nurse, and possible financial support for, hospital inpatient services, and transport to/from another hos pital if needed. When full participation is selected, families must enroll their infant on their third party and/or AHCCCS plan, if eligible, within insurance guidelines to cover the infant's medical bills. Failure to do so may result in HRPP/NICP financial assistance being denied and family will be responsible for all hospital, physician, and transport charges. B. Partial Participation a. Partial participation may be requested if the family does not wish to disclose their financial information, they do not have insurance or they are sure their insurance company will pay all hospital inpatient costs for the baby. Partial participation provides the family with community nursing follow -up services only. b. Families will not receive any financial assistance for transpo rt, back transport , or physician services. C. Late Enrollment Enrollment in the program, which occur s beyond 30 days of the infant's birth, is accepted at the discretion of the CHN contracting agency based on capacity and risk . a. Reasons for a Late Enrollment: Enrollment Hospital never offered program Parent originally declined participation Child from an out of state NICU Referred by provider for neonatal follow up as a child or youth with special health care needs Sibling of eligible infant (twin) CYSHCN enrollment b. To complete a late enrollment, use the Enrollment Form c. Notify the HRPP Program Manager of any denied requests by the Contractor to accept a late enrollment . 12 | Page D. Adoption and Foster Care Infants are entitled to the same HRPP services when placed into foster care or adopted. It is the responsibility of the hospital personnel to notify and inform the responsible agency and/or family regarding the array of services available. 13 | Page 6 Visit Guid elines 6.1 Introduction The service planning process must be flexible, coordinated and culturally responsive to accommodate changes that occur within the family over time. Long term and future goals must be explored with the family as well as immediate needs or concerns. Home visiting services are based on health, development, environment and relationship risk. 6.2 Protocols A. CHN Contractors are expected to: a. Contact the family within one week of receiving the enrollment forms. b. Attempt to v isit a new family w ithin two ( 2) weeks of initial contact . B. CHN Contractor s will receive all referrals through ETO. C. If the parent does not wish to participate in the program, the CHN will dismiss the participant from the program in ETO selecting the appropriate reason for dismissal. A CHN Visit Form should be completed if the decision was made during a visit. 6.3 Documentation A. CHNs are required to complete the following documentation in ETO. Please see the CHN ETO Procedure Manual for guidance. A chart is provided in appendix with timelines and purpose for each document. B. If CHN p rograms maintain paper charts, they may be requested at the time of site visit for review. C. Charts will be reviewed in ETO at minimum one time per year. 6.4 Referrals Referrals must be recorded from each visit in the External Service Referral touchpoint within seven (7) days of the visit date. They are categorized by priority level. Priority level of the referral determines the estimated time period for next follow- up with the client regarding the referral outcome. Follow -up notes should also be record ed in ETO. A. Level 1 - low priority referral for services that do not need follow -up. This would include information on community resources or educational resources for the client/family but not an immediate health or behavioral health concern/need that re quires action. No required follow -up. B. Level 2 - high priority referral for services that need follow -up verification. This would be immediate health, behavioral health, child developmental needs, and food scarcity , etc. Recommended follow - up at next vis it. C. Level 3 - emergency priority referral for services that need follow -up verification. This would be emergency situations where the health, behavioral health and/or safety of the family may be at risk. Immidiate action taken at visit, follow up with family as necessary . 6.5 Case Dismissal Guidelines A. Dismissal Reasons a. Goals Met/Service Complete - Infants 12 months or greater adjusted age and have no medical or developmental problems b. Moved Out of S tate c. Lost to Follow -Up - When several attempts have been made to reach a family, such as a letter, phone call, or home visit and there is no response. d. Declined Nursing Follow -Up - Prior to home visits being established, the CHN makes contact with the family and they verbally refuse nurse home visitation. 14 | Page e. Voluntary Withdrawal -Parent declines s ervices after initially receiving services . f. In Other Services - Infant has been enrolled in other services that fulfill similar needs or target - specific needs (i.e., DDD, AzEIP, Healthy Families, etc.) g. Low Risk h. Child Death i. Transferr ed j. Transferred to IHS B. Dismissal Procedures for Eligible, Non -Responsive Families When a family cannot be contacted , i.e., moved with no forwarding address or ability to be contacted by phone, they are considered \"Lost to follow -up\". The following are guidelines for documentation of closure to community nursing services. a. CHN must make a t least 2 contact attempts . Initial contact must be by phone, followed up with a text message. b. CHN will use clinical judgm ent to determine whether a drop -in home visit needs to be made prior to closure. c. No response - send letter via mail. d. No response from letter , close in 30 days. C. Transferring Cases When a family is moving out of one service area into another HRPP service area the CHN should ask the family if they are interested in continuing services in their new community. If so, the CHN should refer the family to the new CHN contractor through ETO . Upload into ETO all forms and documents to the most recent CHN Visit Form touchpoint . 15 | Page 7 Visit Guidelines for Special Populations 7.1 Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) A. Introduction The Office for Children with Special Health Care Needs (OCSHCN) partners with HRPP by contracting with specially trained community health nurses (CHNs) throughout Arizona to provide a culturally appropriate, multi- disciplinary, family centered approach for children with chronic medical conditions or a demonstrated risk for developmental delay. The community health nurse provides support from hospital to home, conducts physical and developmental assessments, provides anticipatory guidance, and makes referrals to other community resources as appropriate (AzEIP, DDD, WIC, etc.). Children with special health care needs are defined as; \"Those with a physical, developmental, beh avioral or emotional condition that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or longer ; who require health or related services that children in general do not. \" This definition is very broad and goes well beyond developmental conditions, to include any condition requiring specialized care or services that most children do not need or use. B. Eligibility Requirements Infants and/or children should meet the following eligibility criteria: Eligible individuals shall reside in Arizon a, ages birth - 19 years old and one of the following: Former HRPP clients ages 3 -19. Infants not eligible for HRPP but referred by neonatologist. Siblings of a HRPP infant and other children living in the home referred by a family member or provider . Children age 0 - 19 who are referred by a provider. The criteria above is defined as: Infants previously enrolled in HRPP who also meet the definition of special health care needs, but are no longer eligible for HRPP. Infants with special health care needs, who do not meet the criteria of a NICU/SCN stay of 120 hours, may be enrolled upon submission of a request from a pediatrician to a local contracting agency . Siblings and/or other children ages birth - 19 years, not enrolled in HRPP and living in the home, who have a special health care need and whose families demonstrate or desire a need for information, support, and/or coordination with multiple service providers and resources OR whose pro vider expresses a concern related to the child's health or need for family supports and resources . Children ages birth - 19 years not enrolled in HRPP who have a special health care need and whose provider expresses a concern related to the child's health or need for family supports and resources . C. CYSHCN Enrollment Procedures Infants and children meeting the above eligibility requireme nts may be enrolled as a child or a youth with special health care needs (C YSHCN) and be referred for Community Health Nursing. A community health nursing program may enroll an eligible child by completing the following steps: a. The Enrollment Form should be signed and dated by the parent at the initial CHN visit. It is required to include a brief reason for the enrollment . b. Complete the Enrollment Form touchpoint and u pload t he Enrollment Form into ETO within seven 16 | Page (7) days of the signature date. Outside agencies or community organization can inquire about enrollment by contacting the ADHS Program Manager. The provider will complete the Enrollment Form and submit via email, or at minimum complete the Demographics Form . The Program Manager will refer the infant to the appropriate CHN agency via ETO data management system. D. Home Visitation Guidelines Infants, toddlers and children may be seen for up to 6 months under the C YSHCN CHN services. Home visits beyond this period require prior approval from OCSHCN via email request to the HRPP Program Manager. The Community Health Nurse should refer families as appropriate. CHN contractors should have a network of providers, programs and services for families. Information within this manual also applies to children enrolled as a C YSHCN client. 7.2 Newborn Screenings A. Introduction HRPP partners with the Office of Newborn Screening to provide follow up newborn blood spot collections. These visits include the coordination and referral to community services for infants identified as needing repeat bloodspot as needed. B. Eligibility Require ments Infants and/or children should meet the following eligibility criteria: a. Shall reside in AZ, with an concurrent birth within the state; AND b. Received a previous abnormal or incomplete result for bloodspot The contractor should collect and verify demographic information on the baby such as DOB, birth hospital and mother's name and DOB. C. Enrollment Procedures a. Infants will be enrolled into the HRPP program in the ETO Data management system. b. The Newborn Blood Spot Collection Touchpoint will be completed to demonstrate that collection/visit was completed. D. Home Visitation Guidelines Upon notification from the ADHS Office of Newborn Screening, contractors will provide assistance in locating families and facilitating the collection and submission of another newborn screening test for infants with a previously abnormal test result. The CHN will make a home visit and provide education about Newborn Screening and a follow up blood test. All procedures in the Newborn Screening Guidelines are to be f ollowed. The blood spot collection will be sent to the Arizona State Laboratory to be analyzed. The Arizona Newborn Screening Provider Guideline s details the specifics for ordering collection kits, techniques for specimen collection, shipping and handling practices. There are also best practice recommendations for meeting hearing screening, diagnoses, and early intervention milestones . The guidelines can be located here: https://azdhs.gov/preparedness/state -laboratory/newborn - screening/index.php#healthcare -providers -education The website www.aznewborn.com provides free brochures in English and Spanish for dissemination to families as well as links to other clinical references, including the core panel of disorders screened 17 | Page for in Arizona. Once visit is c omplete, CHN will provide ADHS Office of Newborn Screening status of case as well as Community Nursing Visit form which outlines areas discussed. CHN may off er CYSHCN enrollment based on the needs of the infant and family . 18 | Page 8 Visit Procedures and Tools 8.1 Visit Protocols The Olds model for home visitation of HRPP infants recommends a frequent schedule of home visits. Once a week for the first six weeks, every other week until 21 months, and once a month from months 21 -24. (David Olds, PH.D. Prenatal and Infancy Home Visitation By Nurses, 1998). Budget constraints prevent HRPP from following that model. Contractors are required to evaluate their allocated funding each fiscal year and prioritize visitation to ensure the infants are seen as appropriate according to their risk. HRPP recommends a minimum of four visits the first year, however a visiting schedule needs to be discussed with the family to determine frequency. Some families may choose to opt out after the first visit; some may require support until 3 years of age. Nursing impression and family concerns determine what visits are needed until the child turns 3 years of age. All visits must be documented. Optimal minimum visit schedule for moderate to high risk infants not receiving services fro m any other provider would be : Initial visit 2 month 4 month 6 month 8 or 9 months 12 month visit 8.2 Educational Tools A main component to the CHN Visit is providing education to the parent related to infant health and development. Educational Packets are as follows : Initial Packet - First V isit Second Packet - 4-6 months Third Packet - 8-12 months List of ADHS approved educational materials are listed in the appendix. 8.3 Community Healthy Nursing (CHN) Visit Form The CHN Visit Form is an ETO touchpoint to be filled out by the home visitor after each visit. This form contains the required information for payment of services and must be completed for all HRPP and CYSHCN visits. It does not need to be completed for a Newborn Blood Spot Coll ection visit. The CHN shall ensure: A. All home visits must be entered into Efforts to Outcome (ETO) database B. A copy of the CHN Visit Form is filed in the client's chart according to agency protocols (if applicable) C. Demographics are updated as needed using the following guidelines: a. First name : The name that the infant is given at birth and is called by the parents. b. Last name and/or Family Name: This should match the infant's last name as designated by the parents upon enrollment, if different than the hospital label. c. Alias last name : This should match the name given on the hospital label. 19 | Page Health Status \"Good\" when infants have normal growth and development parameters: Consistent growth, height, weight and head circumference as indicated on the growth charts and the other assessment information collected by the CHNs using WHO standards No trips to the ER, OTC medications needed except vitamins, normal physical exam and no family or CHN concerns \"Fair\" when infant s have normal childhood illnesses such as ear infection or: A chronic condition exists that does not require frequent trips to the doctor or hospitalizations. Feeding problems exist but the child's growth parameters are still on the growth chart. Some equipment, such as apnea monitor and/ prescription medications are taken such as those for seizures, etc. \"Poor\" when infants have conditions that may be considered \"life threatening\" or need frequent hospitalizations or surgeries. d. Medical Home Mark \"Yes\" if the family has a consisten t source of medical care such as: A physician or practitioner they can call if their child is sick anytime within a 24 -hour period of time. A place they can take their child for care other than an emergency room, i.e., Doctor's Office, clinic, community health center, etc. e. Purpose of CHN Visit This field should be utilized to provide additional detail regarding the purpose of the visit and is particularly important when there is a need for multiple visits within a short period of time. Using as few words as is possible . The home visitor should describe the ongoing situation (i.e., postpartum depression, nutritional follow -up/weight check, resources , and referral, etc. ) If following regular visiting schedule, use initial visit for first visit and developme ntal follow up when using ASQ screening. 8.4 Family Service Plans (FSP) The purpose of the FSP is to identify family resources, priorities, and concerns and is developed by the home visitor in conjunction with the family . The FSP is usually initiated o n the first visit with the family and includes assessment planning. The FSP is fluid and used as a guiding tool on subsequent visits. This is not duplicating data collected elsewhere, only data important to the family and outcome goals identified. Infant/ child, maternal and family strengths and needs are identified, i.e., \"What is the family most proud of with their child and what are they the most concerned about?\" \"How does mother view her own health in relationship to possible subsequent pregnancies?\" A. A FSP is required to be completed at each home visit B. The FSP can: Identify child and family desired outcomes. Explore the family's natural helping network, such as extended family members, friends or neighbors. Explore child and family health insurance benefits and provide information about services available in the community. 20 | Page Identify other agencies or services for which the child may be eligible, facilitate referrals, and enrollment. Assist the family in identifying needed services as appropriate. Iden tify outcomes to meet infant, child, maternal, and/or familial needs. This can include potential or actual dates. C. It should be signed by the caregiver at each visit and included in the client's file. D. The FSP is not a legal document, which means that services identified as needed are not required to be provided by the CHN program. Efforts shall be taken, however, to facilitate the referral of families to appropriate service providers and encourage enrollment. E. Guidelines for using the FSP: Infants and toddlers are uniquely dependent on their families for their survival and nurturing. This dependence necessitates a family -centered approach to early intervention. Each family has its own structure, values, roles, beliefs and coping styles. Resp ect and acceptance of this diversity is essential to family -centered early intervention. Early intervention systems and strategies must reflect a respect for racial, ethnic and cultural diversity of families. Respect for family, autonomy, independence and decision making means that families must be able to choose the level and nature of early intervention involvement. Family/professional collaboration and partnership is the key to family - centered early intervention and successful implementation of the plan ning process. No one agency or discipline can meet the diverse and complex needs of infants and toddlers with special needs and their families. Therefore, a team approach to planning and implementing the FSP is recommended . A family need or concern is only a need if the family perceives it to be relevant. Any information the family does not want to be on the plan must not be included and must remain confidential. The FSP is a \"working\" document. The process must lead to outcomes that assist the family in achieving their goals for themselves and their child. 8.5 Infant Screening Tools A. Ages and Stages Questionnaire The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ -3) should be used to as sess the child's performance on various age -appropriate tasks. This tool is valuable in screening children for possible problems, confirming suspicions with an objective measure, and in monitoring children at risk for developmental problems, such as those who have experienced perinatal difficulties. It is designed to compare a given child's performance on a variety of tasks to performance of other children the same age. The ASQ:SE - 2 is designed to measure a child's social and emotional developmental needs. At minimum, a child should receive at least one ASQ screening within the first year of the program. The Ages and Sta ges Questionnaires include a series of questionnaires designed to identify infants and young children who show potential developmental pr oblems. Each questionnaire features 30 developmental items that are written in simple, straightforward language. The items are divided into five areas: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal- social. An overall section address es general parental concerns. Children are identified as needing further testing and possible referral to early intervention services when their ASQ scores fall below designed cutoff points. The ASQ materials consist of reproducible master questionnaires, age - appropriate scoring and data summary sheets, and the User's Guide which also contains activity sheets for parents that correspond 21 | Page to the ASQ age intervals. A Spanish translation master s et of questionnaires is also available. B. Nursing Neonatal and Pediatric Assessment All \"regular\" home visits by the Community Health Nurse should include an assessment of the infant/child's physical, developmental, environmental, and family relationship st atus. The assessment form should be used to describe any Concerns of the parent or home visitor, to describe the home visitor's Impressions , and to document the Plan for follow up. The level of risk should also be recorded here. C. Children's Health Survey As a collaboration with the Office for Children with Special Health Care Needs, t he Children 's Health Survey will be implemented as resource for identifying a child with special health care needs. It can be administered as early as one year of age. The c hild or infant should be screened : After turning 1 year of calendar age Age greater than 1 at entry into the program Or a Re -screen can be completed if there is a significant medical consequence 8.6 Maternal Assessment Tools & Support A. Postpartum Mood Disorder Postpartum Mood Disorders affect millions of women worldwide, regardless of race, age, culture, or socioeconomic status. Symptoms of Postpartum Mood Disorders vary and may include feelings of sadness, anger, frustration and confusion. A mother experiencing a Postpartum Mood Disorder may feel alone and ashamed of her symptoms. Fathers are also impacted by Postpartum Mood Disorders and have their own experience that may be very different from the mother. These differences place an enormous amount o f stress on the couple's relationship and it can prove a difficult time for the entire family. Postpartum Support International (PSI) ( http://www.postpartum.net/lear n-more/pregnancy - postpartum -mental -health/) provide s information and resources to mothers and fathers on Postpartum Mood Disorders. The resources there are intended to provide couples, families, and professionals with information and tools to help mothers and families heal from Postpartum Mood Disorders. *Information taken from PSI (http://www.postpartum.net /) B. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) The EPDS was developed for screening postpartum women in outpatient, home visiting settings, or at the 6 -8 week postpartum examination. It has been utilized among numerous populations including U.S. women and Spanish speaking women in other countries. The EPDS consists of 10 questions. The test can usually be completed in less than 5 minutes. Responses are scored 0,1, 2, or 3 according to increased severity of the symptom. Items marked with an asterisk (*) are reverse scored (i.e., 3, 2, 1, and 0). The total score is determined by adding together the scores for each of the 10 items. Validation studies have utilized various threshold scores in determining which women were positive and in need of referral. Cut -off scores ranged from 9 to 13 points. Therefore, to err on safety's side, a woman scoring 9 or more points or indicating any suicidal ideation (that is she scores 1 or higher on question #10 ) should be immediately referred for follow -up. Even if a woman scores less than 9, if the clinician feels the client is suffering from depression, an appropriate referral should be made. The EPDS is only a screening tool. It does not diagnose depression - that is done by appropriately licensed 22 | Page health care personnel. Users may reproduce the scale without permission providing the copyright is respected by quoting the names of the authors, title and the source of the pap er in all reproduced copies. *Information taken from the American Academy of Pediatrics EPDS is to be completed at each first home visit of HRPP enrolled children (foster/adoptive excluded). Any score equal to or higher tha n 9 must be referred for follow up care. A referral may include PPMD support, primary care physician, crisis line, and/or other appropriate referral. The referral must be noted on the FSP and in the External Referral touchpoint in ETO. Once the screenin g has been completed the CHN will educate the mom on postpartum depression, how to score and together review the results. The screening tool will be left with the mother for future use. Every mother in the program should be provided information on the PSI Helpline . The PSI Helpline can be reached at 1 -800-944-4773. C. Maternal Wellness Assessment/Preconception Care \"Preconception care is defined as a set of interventions that aim to identify and modify biomedical, behavioral, and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy outcome through prevention and management.\" Recommendations to Improve Preconception Health and Health Care -United states, A Report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care. MMWR 2006; 55 (No.RR -6):3-4. The Community Health Nurse, by virtue of following HRPP enrolled infants, is in the unique position of being in the home and working with the mother of a premature infant or infant with a less than optimal birth outcome. The mother who has had a preterm infant is at a statistically higher risk of having another preterm infant. The goal of this aspect of the CHN follow up visit is reduction of risk factors that can lead to preterm delivery in a subsequent pregnancy. To this end, the CHN wil l use appropriate screening tools to screen and then provide education to the mother of the infant about: reproductive awareness; environmental toxins and teratogens; nutrition and folic acid; genetics; substance use including tobacco and alcohol; medical conditions and medications; infectious diseases and vaccination; and psychosocial condition s. The CHN helps to link her to community services when appropriate. Additional information can be found on the ADHS Women' s Health website ( 8.7 Environmental Screening Assessment During the Neonatal & Pediatric Assessment, the CHN will observe the home for safety concerns. The CHN will document concerns observed or reported by caregiver and provide education and/or resources to address the concerns. All families will receive education on home safety d uring initial and subsequent visits by the CHN. 8.8 Determining Level of Risk All enrolled infants are identified upon discharge from the hospital as \"high risk\" or \"at risk\" for developmental delay. Families who have a child that is considered to be in t he \"high risk\" 23 | Page category should be strongly encouraged to receive follow -up services through the Community Nursing Services component of the program. Infants who have an established condition at the time of discharge should be referred, by the discharging h ospital, directly to the Arizona Department of Economic Security's Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD), or the Arizona Early Intervention Program (AzEIP). The CHN will use the Nursing Neonatal and Pediatric Assessment (NNPA) at each regular visit until one year of age . At this time, the CHN will determine the risk of the infant . Level of risk on the Neonatal & Pediatric Assessment should be determined as follows: High Risk: Two or more areas of concern in two or more categories Moderate Risk: O ne area of concern in two categories or two areas of concerns in one category Low Risk: One area of concern in one category Nursing judgement and the infant's medical assessment at the time of discharge from the hospital should be considered during the risk assessment. 24 | Page 9 Community Collaboration An essential component of community nursing services is the collaboration with hospitals, primary care providers, and other agencies to assist infants, children and their families in accessing appropriate services. Community Nursing providers are expected to: Learn about the community. Know what resources are available and how to connet families to needed services. Attend hospital discharge planning meetings at Level IIE , III and IV hospitals within the service area. It is encouraged to introduce yourself to parents nearing discharge if the opportunity is available. A. Share information to the home visitor responsible for visiting those families discharged into their service area B. Meet with hospital personne l to: a. Develop a collaborative relationship b. Receive discharge information c. Provide feedback to hospital personnel d. Provide training on HRPP and other community resources C. Attend multi -disciplinary staffing meetings in person or via phone as requested by agenc ies and/or families. These may include hospital discharge rounds, staffings with the DCS, AzEIP, DES, DDD, or others as appropriate. 25 | Page 10 Personnel & Training 10.1 Roles and Qualifications A. Community Health Nurse Arizona Licensed Registered Nurses with Basic Life Support Certification, experienced in maternal and child health, pediatrics and/or NICU and a BSN Degree. B.

EIs shall have a minim um of a Bachelor's degree in early childhood, early childhood special education, speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, hearing, nutrition or a closely related field. A CHN may request the a ccompaniment of an early interventionist . This should be used only when an infant does not qualify for AzEIP or DDD and a family has identified concerned that require additional support . *Social Workers and Early Interventionists should only conduct visits with the CHN and with prior approval from the ADHS Program Manager. 10.2 Staff Educatio n Opportunities and Requirements Maintain records of education completed on the provided HRPP log. HRPP provides educational opportunities for designate d HRPP staff. Currently, bi- annual CHN trainings and an A nnual HRPP conference are offered. Continuation of these opportunities is based on funding. The educational requirements for designated HRPP staff are as follows: A. Complete program orientation prior to being assigned a case load. B. HRPP requires a minimum of 6 CEUs a nnually. 1 CEU in PM AD, 1 CEU in NAS, 1 CEU in ACES and 3 additional in program related education. The required topic are subject to change based on trending topics and needs. Contractors will be notified annually of any changes. Attendance o ver and above the CEU requirements is based on the availability of funding. 10.3 Orientation The Orientation is intended to give the CHN an overview of the program requirements and their role and job responsibilities. The orientation program provides basic information on several critical areas of the Community Nursing Program. Through this initial orientatio n process, community nurses demonstrate that they possess sufficient knowledge about the program, and that they have mastered the necessary skills to begin conducting client contact activities safely and competently. 26 | Page A. Program Introduction and Training HRPP CHN Policy & Procedure Manual* All CHN must complete a comprehensive review of the Policy and Procudure manual with the supervisor, documenting on the Education log dates of completion.

Must be completed within 60 days of hire Shadowing visit s for a nurse in training shall be billable, up to five visits. The other areas should be completed within six months, but the CHN should have general knowledge before completing visits independently. The information in these areas must, at minimum, address the learning objectives of the orientation training which conforms to ADHS Communit y Nursing Policy and Procedure Manual. Training must also include relevant information from the Contractor's specific community to allow community nurses to successfully work within that community. 27 | Page 10.4 Continuing Education All continuing education should be designed to strengthen the skills, provide updated information and support the activities of the community health nurse. A continuing education plan should be developed annually for all workers that include the training needs identified through t he Education Log. A copy of the continuing education log will be available to the ADHS Site Review Team for review during a formal site visit. HRPP requires a minimum of 6 CEUs annually. 1 CEU in PMAD, 1 CEU in NAS, 1 CEU in ACES and 3 additional in pro gram related education. The required topic are subject to change based on trending topics and needs. Contractors will be notified annually of any changes. Community Health N urses are strongly encouraged to attend conferences and works hops for continuing education. Attendance for training is based on availability of funds. 10.5 Education Log The Education Log is found in the appendix. It is required that all con tractors use this form to track the following by all CHNs and other professionals c onducting visits as part of HRPP services to be reviewed at annual site visit. A. Orientation B. Continuing E ducation 10.6 Tailoring Education Orientation experiences shall be designed to meet the needs and experiences of each new CHN , i.e., nurses who have worked in the NICU would be best served by more exposure to the public health nursing role whereas, nurses experienced in the public health role would benefit most from spending time observing care offered to the critically ill infant in the NICU. A new CHN would benefit from spending time observing infant evaluations by a developmental specialist. Specific questions regarding the assessment of the neuromotor development of the infant can be addressed during these opportunities. Encourage new CHNs to attend AzEIP evaluations when possible. A new CHN would also benefit from the mentoring experience of following a very experienced nurse or practitioner making home visits. The amount and duration of the supervised home visits depend on the needs and experience of each CHN . 10.7 Supervision Contracted agencies are required to have standard procedures in place to evaluate the quality of services and skills of home visitors which may include annual employee evaluations, skills assessments, and client satisfaction surveillance. 28 | Page 11 Reporting All forms and reports are used by the Community Nursing Program to collect information for program planning, development and evaluation. Information gathered, both at the ADHS and Contractor level is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Program. In this chapter, d ata collection forms will be fully explained. 11.1 Notice of Implementation or Change A.

Contractors must develop a systematic process for continuous monitoring of the quality of patient/client services. This doc ument provides guidelines for the development and/or ongoing implementation of a continuous quality management and improvement program. Quality management and improvement is an ongoing process to monitor and improve health services.

Performance goals identify the organization's target for the result of a process or system. Performance goals measure the compliance of the organization or its providers in relation to its processes or systems. Effectiveness goals, on the other hand, measure a change in health, patient/client performance, or patient/client satisfaction as a result of the performance of the organization or its providers. Performance goals may be drawn from a variety of sources including various regulations and st andards governing health care practice, organizational policy and procedures or contractual requirements. 12.4 Responsibility The person identified to be in charge of documenting the plan, collecting the data, reporting results, developing and documenting strategies and results.
