Sgarlat, DO In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Clinical Research and Translational Science TUFTS UNIVERSITY Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences May 2011 Adviser: Susan K. Parsons, MD, MRP ii Abstract Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is defined as a group of diverse medical health care systems and practices, including natural products, mind-body medicine, manipulative body-based practices, practices of energy therapy , and whole medicinal systems. Studies suggest that CAM therapy in the adult population has increased in recent decades. Information about the extent of CAM usage among chil dren and adolescents with chronic rheumatologic disorders, although anecdotally suspect ed, is not routinely collected. Objective: The purpose of this exploratory study was to solicit information on CAM usage from parents seeking care for their children in a pe diatric rheumatology sub-specialty clinic. Methods: A previously field-tested survey of CAM usage was adapted for the pediatric rheumatology clinic population. The survey cons isted of general demographic questions and specific questions on CAM use. Parents or caregivers of patients followed in the Pediatric Rheumatology Division at a n academic medical center were invited to complete the survey during the recruiting per iod, which extended from June to October 2010. Results: 202 of 203 parents invited to participate in the survey completed it with the majority being mothers (88%) and Caucasian (91% ) with a mean age of 42 years. Their children were predominantly female (67%) with a mean age 12.8 years. 63% of patients had juvenile idiopathic arthritis, although children with several other chronic conditions were also included. Overall, 50% of patients we re CAM users. Of the CAM modalities, 69% of patients reported use of high-dose vitamin, mineral, or supplements. Of the CAM users, 42% had a parent or immediate family member with a history of CAM use, compared with 15% of non-CAM users. 80% of CAM users had a parent with some degree of college education, compared with 67% of non-users. Multivariate logistic regression revealed an adjusted OR of 3.8 (CI 1.8- 8.1, p<0.001) for CAM use if a family member had used CAM. Conclusions: CAM use was common among patients followed in a pediatric rheumatology clinic (50%). Famil y use of CAM was strongly associated with patient CAM use. Very little is known about t he benefits or potential harms of CAM despite its widespread use. It is important f or physicians to understand factors that influence decisions to use CAM in children a nd what benefits parents seek with CAM use. iii Acknowledgements I am deeply grateful to my thesis committee members including Dr. Susan Parsons, Dr. Laurie Miller, and Robin Ruthazer, for their involvement and support, only by which this thesis project was possible.

Proportion of CAM Use with Positive Response 1 Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Pediatric Rheumatology Background Pediatric Rheumatology comprises a broad range of chronic diseases, principal ly involving the musculoskeletal system. The nature of these diseases affects the emotional, physical, and social status of patients. Anecdotal clinical experience su ggests that a substantial proportion of pediatric rheumatology patients use complementary and alternative therapies to treat their underlying diseases. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) as a group of dive rse medical health care systems and practices that are not considered conventional modalities of medical treatment (1). CAM modalities are often grouped into five broad cate gories: natural products including high-dose vitamins, minerals and dietary supplementati on; mind-body medicine, including yoga, tai chi and acupuncture; manipulative body-bas ed practices, such as chiropractics; practices of various forms of energy the rapy, including Reiki and magnet therapy; and whole medicinal systems, such as naturopathy and homeopathy (1). Several studies have shown that up to one-third of the general healthy adult population use at least one CAM therapy (2, 3). The use of CAM modalities by adult patients has increased by 45% between 1990 and 1997, with further increases between 2002-07 (2, 3). Between 42 and 73% of adults with rheumatologic disorders have reported CAM use (4, 5), rates much higher than the general adult population. As part of the 2007 National Health Interview Survey reported by NCCAM and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), children were survey ed for CAM use 2 with findings of 12% of children using some form of CAM (2). Other studies have shown that CAM use in the general pediatric population ranges between 20 and 40% (6, 7), while between 50-72% of children with chronic diseases (such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease) use these remedies (8, 9). Only a limited number of studies have addressed CAM use in children with rheumatologic diseases, yielding striki ngly different results. In an unpublished survey of CAM use in pediatric rheumatology conducted approximately a decade ago, approximately one quarter of children (22%) w as found to be using CAM (Miller, personal communication). In contrast, a 2003 report described CAM use in a similar population at 66% (10). Most of these estimates we re derived from parent-reported surveys. CAM use is not routinely discussed in clinical practice. Clinicians may negle ct to specifically inquire about these modalities. Parents and patients may forget to include this information when asked about medication use or may be reluctant to share this information, fearing that the clinicians may not approve. The specific reasons f or non- disclosure of CAM use have been poorly studied (11-13). Our understanding of the factors that influence the decisions to use CAM in chronic diseases is incomplete. Disease duration and side effects of conventiona l medications (14-19) have been cited as contributing reasons. CAM use in children with chronic conditions has been related to certain parental characteristics, incl uding higher education levels and incomes (2, 20-23), as well as personal and familial use of the se remedies (24-27). Details of these reasons have not been studied in a pediatric rheumatologic clinic population. It is important to understand what benefits parents are 3 seeking with CAM use. Understanding these factors is important for parent-doc tor communication as well as treatment decisions. Similarly, despite the widespread use of CAM, very little is known about the benefits of the different therapies or the potential harms due to side effects, medication interactions, and altered medication adherence of other prescribed medications in this population (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressive treat ments, and biologic agents). The increased use of CAM in the general population as well as among patients with chronic diseases raises the question as to whether this trend has also occur red among pediatric rheumatology patients. The characteristics of pediatric rheum atology CAM users and their caregivers are largely unknown, as are the types of CAM being us ed and factors that influence their use. Therefore, based on emerging evidence of increased use of CAM among patients with chronic diseases, we investigated CAM use in a ter tiary pediatric rheumatology clinic (1) to characterize use patterns by CAM m odality, (2) to assess factors associated with CAM use, and (3) to describe the prevalence of non - disclosure of CAM use to physicians. Methods Study Measure The study consisted of an anonymous cross-sectional survey. A literature search was done to identify existing survey instruments on the subject of CAM. Several surveys that included CAM use in patients with rheumatologic conditions were identif ied that contained some of the desired elements such as, specific modalities, disea se duration, 4 and demographics (2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13), although none of these captured all of the desired elements to address our research questions. Largely missing from ot her surveys were reasons for CAM use, disclosure to the physician, reasons for non-disclos ure, and effect of the CAM therapies in a pediatric population followed in a pediatric rheumatology clinic. Although no standardized instruments are in widespread use, one survey was identified that captured the desired range of topics. This instrument, entitled the Pediatric Complementary Therapy Survey, was originally developed by Fernandez et al. (1998) and subsequently modified by Recklitis et al. (28, 29) for use in a pediatric oncology patient population. While the survey had been reviewed extensively prior to field testing by experts in survey design, patient and family education, and CA M, the psychometric properties of this survey have not been reported. The survey authors we re contacted regarding further adaptation and use of the survey, and permission was obtained. This survey was then adapted for a population of patients followed in a pediatric rheumatology clinic to make it disease-specific with regard t o diagnoses and specific medications. The adapted survey consisted of 32 items in two sections ( Appendix i ). The first section consisted of questions on patient and family demographics, while the second section consisted of questions on CAM (sources of information, factors influencing use , benefits, and side effects). Although the survey contained separate items on r ace and ethnicity, the variables were combined to form a single variable for analyt ic purposes, using standard categories. CAM use was defined as the current or previous use of listed CAM therapies for the condition which the patient was being followed for in the pedia tric 5 rheumatology clinic. Prior to study administration, the survey was pilot test ed in a pediatric rheumatology clinic population (n=7) to ensure relevance and clarit y of the survey items. Survey Participants Patient charts were reviewed one week prior to the scheduled clinic appointment to determine preliminary eligibility. The inclusion criteria consiste d of English-speaking parents or caregivers of patients aged 3-19 years followed in the Pediatric R heumatology Division at the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center for a rheumatologic disease or condition. Eligible participants were approached for recruitment and enrolled in the cli nic setting at the time of their child's presentation to the clinic for a scheduled follow-up appointment. Participants (parents and caregivers of patients) were enroll ed in the study only once, even if the child had more than one visit during the recruiting period, which extended for a five-month time period from June through October 2010. Once the surveys were completed by the participants, anonymity was maintained by i nstructing participants to not include names or other identifiers on the survey and to return the survey to the closed receptacle at the clinic desk. This study was approved by t he Tufts University Health Science Campus Investigation Review Board and was conducte d in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Analysis Descriptive statistics were performed to summarize demographics a nd clinical factors. Distributions of continuous variables were examined to determine the appropriateness of mean (standard deviation) versus median (25 th to 75 th percentile) to 6 summarize these variables. CAM use was calculated and its 95% confidence inter val estimated. Prevalence of use by CAM modality was also described. In additi on, reasons for CAM use and frequency of disclosure of this information to the physician were summarized. The correlation between age and disease duration was checked to investigate collinearity. Log transformation of duration of disease was used for analysis because of the large range and skewed distribution. Age, which was normally distributed, was considered as a dichotomous variable of younger (less than 10 years ) vs. older (10 years and older) children because of nonlinearity with CAM use for the anal ysis (Appendix ii ). Univariate analyses were performed with CAM use as the outcome and the variables that were found to be statistically different between the two gr oups (p< 0.10). Demographic factors about the child and parent, as well as clinical factors about the child were compared using t-tests for the continuous variables and \u00b2 tests for categorical variables. A priori determined clinically important factors, such as age, gender, and duration of disease, were also analyzed as we considered them candidate vari ables for inclusion in a multivariate model. A multivariate logistic regression model w as then constructed with these variables to look at adjusted associations of significant f actors with CAM use. The performance of our model was checked with an ROC curve and a calibration plot ( Appendix ii ). Results A sample of 202 parents of patients agreed to participate from among the 203 eligible consecutive parents or caregivers approached about the study. One parent declined invitation because of time constraints. Demographics are listed in Ta ble 1. The 7 majority of the parents were mothers (88%), responding on behalf of their childr en. The children were predominantly female (66%) and Caucasian/Non-Hispanic (86%) wit h a mean age of 12.8 years. Interestingly, more than half (71%) of those parents who reported to be Hispanic or Latino also reported that the categories of race didn' t fit them or they preferred not to state race. The predominant diagnosis of study patients w as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (63%), although children with several other chronic conditions were also included. The median duration of illness was 29 months (25 th to 75 th percentile of 8-69 months). Ninety percent of study participants completed all survey items, and missing data were only identified in two variables. Specifica lly, family income was missing in 9% of the sample, and race/ethnicity was missing in <1% of the sample (see Table 1). Of note, there was no missing data regarding CAM use. Overall, 50% of patients were CAM users. CAM users were found to be older, have shorter disease duration, and have parents who had completed a higher level of education and who more frequently used CAM therapies for themselves or immediate family members (See Table 2). There was a significant difference in C AM users versus non-users by level of parental education. When compared with parents of non-users, a higher percentage of parents of CAM users had completed some college or graduate school (80% vs. 67%, p=0.04). More CAM-users than non-CAM users had a parent or immediate family member with a history of CAM use (41% vs. 15%, p<0.001). Unadjusted odds ratios describing the relationship of these variables with CAM use are presented in Table 3. Results of the multivariable model are shown in Table 4. Although the unadjusted odds ratios for age, disease duration, and gender were non- significant in the univariate analysis, they were retained in the model because of clinical 8 importance. After adjusting for age, disease duration, and gender, parental education w as no longer significant, whereas familial CAM use remained significant wi th an adjusted odds ratio of 3.8 (CI,1.8-8.1; p<0.001 ). CAM use was more prevalent among children ages 10 years and older compared to younger children with an unadjusted p-value of p=0.08. In the final model age was found to be significant with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.0 (CI, 1.0-3.9; p=0.05) of CAM use for older patients. Specifically, for children ages 10 years and older, the odds of CAM use versus non-CAM use was found to be 2 times higher compared with younger children. The c statistic of our model was found to be 0.68 indicating our model was acceptable for our data and the calibration plot showed agreement of observed and predicted CAM use. Modalities of CAM use were diverse (Table 5). The most reported used CAM modalities were natural products (69% of CAM users). Other frequently used therapi es included mind-body medicines, such as yoga, acupuncture and tai chi (55%), and manipulative body-based practices, such as chiropractic therapy (40%). Reasons for CAM use varied (Table 6). The most commonly endorsed reasons were to do everything possible to fight the child's disease (39%), to make the chil d healthier in order to fight the disease process (35%), and to boost the child's immune system (25%). Many parents endorsed more than one response. Many CAM users (49%) agreed with the statement that CAM therapies impr oved their child's disease state, with the proportion of positive response varying by moda lity (Table 7). Of note, 66% of CAM users reported non-disclosure of CAM use specifica lly 9 to their child's pediatric rheumatologist, although 43% of CAM users reported discl osing CAM use to other providers including pediatricians, pediatric nurses, social wor kers, psychologists, and complementary medicine providers. Of those parents who did discus s CAM use with a provider, 60% reported that they felt that their provider approved of CAM use, while 28% thought the provider had no opinion and 12% felt they disapproved of CAM use. Among those who brought up CAM use with a provider, 82% of these parents felt comfortable with disclosing this information to the provider, while the remaining 18% felt uncomfortable disclosing CAM use. Many parents (78%) of CAM users also reported discussing their child's CAM use with family, friends , and other parents. Discussion We found that CAM use was extensive (50%) by patients with pediatric rheumatologic diseases, followed in a subspecialty clinic. This rate is comp arable to reported rates of CAM use by pediatric patients with other chronic disease s, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (8, 9). The extent of CAM use among children with chronic disease is striking, particularly given the paucity of informati on about the benefits or potential harms (e.g., side effects, medication interactions, and adhe rence of prescribed medications) of these practices. The significant association between familial CAM use and patient CAM use highlights how parents and parental beliefs in CAM therapies influence pati ent care. We also found that older children and adolescents were more likely to be CAM users, although this was not explained by increased disease duration. Thus, it remains uncle ar if 10 the association of increased CAM use in older children is a function of parental choice or greater request by the older children and adolescents themselves. Overall our findings are comparable to the NCCAM and NCHS 2007 National Health Interview Survey, which included a nationwide sample of more than 9,000 children. While the national survey reported a lower rate of overall CAM use (12%) across all children than we found in our study, three of the top four reported reasons for CAM use were found in children with back pain, musculoskeletal problems, and joint pain, all of which could be problems of patients followed in a rheumatologic clinic. The NCHS survey also found a higher rate of CAM use among children whose parents used CAM (23.9%), among children whose parents had a higher level of education (14.7% in children with parents having completed some education after high school), and among adolescents compared with children (16.4%), all of which trend with our findings odds of increased CAM use in children with familial CAM use, higher education, and older age (2). Also, the reported modalities of CAM use in the NCHS survey are similar to our findings. Specifically, they, too, found that most used product s were natural products including dietary supplements (2). This is of concern becaus e the safety and efficacy of such remedies remain unproven. These therapies have not been widely studied and remain uncontrolled by the FDA. Many risks of such treatments remain unstudied, with potential for adverse side effects and/or interactions with conventional treatments. Moreover, the use of manipulative body-based practices , including chiropractic treatment, which were reported in our survey, may be undesir able in patients with underlying joint and musculoskeletal diseases, though there have been 11 reports of benefits with certain body-based practices such as tai chi in adult pat ients with rheumatologic diseases (30, 31). Unlike our survey, the national survey did not address all other factors including disease duration, disclosure of CAM use to health care providers, and reasons for non- disclosure. In this regard, our survey yielded interesting findings. In part icular, the finding that 66% of parents did not disclose CAM use to the pediatric rheumatologist revealed an unexpected gap in communication between parents and physician. Interestingly, 50% of parents who gave their children CAM use because of problems with conventional therapies did not disclose this practice to the pediatric rheumatologist . Our findings of 12% of parents who did discuss CAM use with a provider felt the provider disapproved, as well as 18% of parents feeling uncomfortable discussing CAM use a lso signals uninvestigated parent-doctor communication problems, and suggests the need for additional research on this topic. Alternatively, parents may be reluctant to offe r information about CAM use when the provider does not directly inquire about this. Reasons for non-disclosure were not collected in our survey, a deficiency that should be addressed in future studies. In general, CAM users were happy with the results of these treatments, with nearly half (49%) attributing improvements in their child's condition to these rem edies. It is unclear if this perceived improvement translates to clinical improvement s, but parental perception of clinical progress may even translate to better outcome s. This relationship warrants further investigation. We acknowledge the limitations of our study. This was a cross-sectional study , thus longitudinal data on CAM use was not collected. Anonymity of the survey 12 prevented follow up or clarification, for example to evaluate in more detail if clinical improvement or deterioration related to CAM treatment. Non-English speaking pa rents were excluded from our survey; it is not known if the findings from our study would be applicable across other linguistic and cultural groups. The use of this survey in othe r populations, which may vary with respect to parental education and racial/ethnic mi x, may require further evaluation with formal cognitive testing. Finally , while our model successfully identify some factors associated with CAM use, future studie s are needed to identify other potential factors influencing CAM use in this population, as indicat ed by the precision of our model. From the reasons given by the parents surveyed for using CAM in their childre n (e.g., \"to do everything possible\", \"to make the child healthier to fight disea se\", \"to boost immunity\") we can conclude that these parents are highly motivated to help the ir children. Future studies and programs within this population should consider how to best channel this heightened parental motivation to further benefit the children. Other s tudies in adult with rheumatologic disease have demonstrated that specific modalitie s of CAM appear to benefit this population, such as mind-body medicine, resulting in positive outcomes (30, 31). This is the first study investigating CAM use in a pediatric rheumatology clinic that includes information about reasons for CAM use and parental disclosure to the hea lth providers. Future research could address parental beliefs about the benefits and advers e effects of CAM therapies, reasons for use in their children, and rationale for non - disclosure to pediatric rheumatologists. 13 Table 1: Demographics (N=202 Participants) All Patients N (%) Patient Characteristics Mean Age (s.d.) 12.8 yrs (4.6) Sex, female 136 (67) Race/Ethnicity White Hispanic or Latino Asian African American Categories don't fit/Prefer not to state Missing 174 14 6 4 16 2 (86) (7) (3) (2) (8) (<1) Diagnosis Established: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Mixed Connective Tissue Disease Other rheumatologic diseases a Pain syndrome Other/Diagnosis not yet established 128 6 3 11 10 44 (63) (3) (1) (5) (5) (22) Median Duration of Illness (25th-75 th percentile) Child CAM use Family/Parent Characteristics Annual Household Income ($) <20,000 20-40,000 40-60,000 60-80,000 >80,000 Missing 29 months 8 -69 months 101 13 22 32 25 92 18 (50) (7) (12) (17) (13) (49) (9) Parental Education Completed Grade School Completed High School College/Graduate School 6 47 149 (3) (23) (74) Familial CAM use 58 (29) phenomenon, Eosinophilic Esophagitis, Antiphospholipid Antibodies, Lymphedema 14 Table 2: Characteristics of CAM User vs. Non-user CAM user N (%) CAM nonuser N(%) P-value Mean Age (s.d.) 13.3 yrs (4.1) 12.4 yrs (4.9) 0.16 Sex, female 73 (72) 63 (62) 0.13 Parental Education College or Graduate School 81 (80) 68 (67) 0.04 Median Duration of Illness 25 th -75 th percentiles 29 months 7-69 months 26.5 months 8-73 months 0.70 Familial CAM use 42 (42) 15 (15) <0.001 15 Table 3: Results of Unadjusted Logistic Regression Models for Associat ions with CAM Use Factors Coefficient P OR CI Age ( 10yrs) 0.53 0.08 1.7 0.9-3.1 Sex (f) 0.45 0.13 1.6 0.9-2.8 Disease duration a -0.023 0.85 1.0 0.8-1.2 Education > college 0.68 0.04 2.0 1.03-3.7 Parental CAM use 1.4 <0.001 4.1 2.1-8.0 aLog duration of months of illness used 16 Table 4: Multivariate Associations with CAM Use (N=202 Participants) Factors Coefficient P Adjusted OR CI Age ( 10 yrs) 0.69 0.05 2.0 1.0-3.9 Sex (f) 1.6 0.8-3.1 duration\u00aa -0.01 1.0 0.8-1.3 Education > college 0.46 0.23 0.7-3.4 Parental CAM use 1.3 <0.001 3.8 1.8-8.1 aLog duration of months of illness used 17 Table 5: CAM Modalities a CAM Modalities Percentage of 101 CAM Users Reporting use of Modality (%) Natural products High dose vits/minerals Dietary Supplements Specific diets Fish oil Glucosamine chondroitin Herbal supplements Enzyme supplements Essiac Tea Chinese supplements Lactobacillus Subtotal Mind/body medicine Spiritual healing/prayer Yoga Meditation Relaxation techniques/guided imagery Acupressure Biofeedback therapy Hypnosis Tai chi Subtotal Manipulative body-based practices Chiropractic therapy Massage therapy techniques Subtotal Practices of energy therapy Therapeutic touch Healer/healing touch Aromatherapy Magnetic therapy Ozone therapy Subtotal Whole medicinal systems Homeopathy Subtotal 44 37 24 24 11 9 6 5 4 3 69 22 21 13 13 11 7 6 5 5 55 25 23 40 10 7 7 3 3 24 7 7 aParticipants could endorse more than one modality w ithin or across categories.

From our estimation that we would find 50% prevalence of CAM use, we calculated a power of 81% using a detection rate of 20% difference between variable proportions between CAM users vs. non-users. Therefore, with a sample of 200 survey participants with 100 CAM users vs. 100 non-CAM users, a difference in a variable such as parental CAM use of 60% compared with 40% could be detected with 81% power. Age In the univariate analysis as well as in the multivariate analysis age w as not used as a continuous linear variable, but as a dichotomous variable of younger aged children (age less than 10 years) and older children and adolescents (age 10 years and older ). We initially investigated age for linearity by dividing age into 3 year inte rvals and looking at associations with CAM use. Without adjusting for any other variables we found age not to be linear, with % CAM use lowest at younger ages with a peak around age 10 to 12 and then slightly lowering in adolescents. We also found this non-linear relationship after adjusting for the other variables included in our multivariate model. In orde r to include the most appropriate from of age for our model, we looked at different models using age as (1) a continuous (linear) variable, (2) a continuous variable with both a ge and age\u00b2 in the model to allow for a quadratic relationship, and (3) age as a dichotomous variable with the cut-off of 10 years derived from the initial investigati on of whether fitting age as a linear term was best capturing the relationship of age and CAM use. After comparing the \u00b2 values of each model accounting for degrees of freedom, the best 31 model, based on the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic and AIC was with age include d as a dichotomous variable. Model Distributions of all variables of interest were checked for normality. Dise ase duration was also transformed into log of duration for the univariate and multivariate analysis because of the extensive range and skewed distribution of this measur e. The correlation between the disease duration and age was also investigated before putting both variables into the multivariable model out of concern of possible collinearity of these two variables, which we did not find. Univariate analyses were done using t-tests for the continuous variables age, disease duration, and \u00b2 tests were used for categorical variables gender, parental education completion, and familial CAM use. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for disease duration as disease duration. Age, after investigated for li nearity, was used as a dichotomous variable ( vs. >10) because of an observed non-linear relationship with CAM use, and also for ease of interpretation of the odds ratios in the logistic regression models. A multivariate logistic regression model was then constructed to look at adjuste d associations of significant factors with CAM use. 202 patients were included i n our final model. All factors found to be significantly different for users vs. nonusers at an unadjusted p-value of < 0.10, as well as the a priori identified important clinical factors of age, gender, and disease duration, were included into the multivariate logi stic regression model. We included these factors, though we found them to be not significant , because of reported significance in other studies of CAM use, as well as the pos sibility 32 that these clinical factors may be significant in other populations. Some inte ractions were checked, as this analysis was exploratory in nature, including two-f actor interactions between age and gender, age and disease duration, gender and disease duration, and parental education with parental CAM use, although none of these interactions were found to be significant and thus were not included in our final model . These interactions were checked by adding them each individually as a sixth var iable along with the five variables included in the final model (age, gender, disease dur ation, parental education, and parental CAM use). We checked our model fit with the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and found our model statistic to be 3.54 with a non-significant p-value. Thus, this measure supported our model's adequacy for these data. We also checked the overall fi t of our model with Pearson and deviance \u00b2 residuals, and used index plots to identify any large residuals indicating outliers, and to access for patterns of variation, though none of these were found. We checked the performance of our model with an ROC curve and computing the corresponding area under the curve and also creating a calibration chart to see how well our model's predicted CAM use, based on the variables we used for our multivariate model, compared to the observed CAM use and also to check where our model fit best. The c statistic, or area under the ROC curve, of our model was found to be 0.68. We divided our predicted probabilities are divided into quintiles for our calibration chart a nd calculated mean observed and predicted probabilities, which show agreement, though it can be graphically seen that at the lowest as well as highest predicted prob abilities, our model is slightly under-predicting CAM use. 33 34 35 References 1.
