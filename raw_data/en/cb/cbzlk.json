Pesticides, heavy metals, solvents, plastics, mold and industrial chemicals are ubiquitous and chronic exposure affects our health by depleting antioxidants and progressively damaging DNA, cells and tissues. Toxin exposure does not necessarily mean you have been exposed to a large dose of toxin that is obvious. In fact, it is the low-level daily toxicant exposure that we are all exposed to that is a common underlying root cause of chronic illnesses. Chronic toxin exposure has been linked to the following chronic illnesses: Chronic fatigue syndrome Cancer Dementia Heart disease Diabetes / Insulin resistance Fibromyalgia Liver disease Kidney disease Asthma & Allergies Hypothyroidism Infertility PCOS & endometriosis Mood disorders Parkinson's Autoimmunity such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Grave's and Hashimoto's Behavioral concerns in children Understanding your exposure risk, both past and present, helps to identify what toxins may be contributing to your health concerns. Silver fillings, high seafood consumption, well water, living on or near a farm, previous and current occupation, the age of your home and understanding your local watershed are just some of the aspects we investigate in your health history. Testing your bodily burden of toxins through blood tests and functional testing may also be recommended to understand your toxin load. Treatment focuses on reducing exposures and the use of targeted therapies to provide the nutrients and supports to enhance your body's ability to detoxify and eliminate the toxins. Understanding your unique physiology and ability to detoxify toxins is important for understanding both chronic disease risk and your personalized treatment. What is Live Blood Cell Analysis? Live cell analysis is a tool that allows the naturopathic doctor and patient to view blood at a cellular level. This method allows the detection of health concerns, often before they even present symptoms. Collectively our cells are the buildings blocks to tissues and organs. If cells are not optimally fuelled with the necessary nutrients to function, then certain blood samples can display B12/iron/essential fatty acid deficiencies, dehydration, fungal activity, liver congestion, adrenal gland stress and much more. With continual nutrient deficiencies and organ dysfunction many health concerns either progress to chronic diseases or develop into a long journey of healing. What are the benefits of Live Blood Cell Microscopy? Both the practitioner and client are able to view the live blood together to discuss what is seen and then immediately determine what may be the root cause of specific health concerns. This testing can show where health weaknesses may be arising from and how they may have developed over time. This is a great tool that can provide a lot of information for supporting Naturopathic Doctors. These test reports provide referring practitioners a detailed summary to the findings of what was seen in the blood. The health of the red blood cells, the white blood cell activity, presence of invading pathogens, liver congestion, heavy metal toxicity and multiple other deficiencies or concerns can be seen with Live Blood Cell Microscopy. With such information, better personalized treatment plans can be created for each patient. How long does the test take? Each initial visit includes live blood cell analysis. Follow up live cell analysis is approximately 30 minutes long. A tiny, finger-prick sample of blood is placed on a glass slide and viewed under a dark-field microscope. From its inception in China more than 2,500 years ago, acupuncture has been used traditionally to prevent, diagnose and treat disease, as well as to improve general health. The traditional explanation for acupuncture's effectiveness is that it modifies the flow of energy (known as qi or chi) throughout the body by placing thin needles in specific points of the body. Because the goal of acupuncture is to promote and restore the balance of energy, which flows throughout the body, the benefits of acupuncture can extend to a wide variety of conditions, from emotional disorders (anxiety, depression) to digestive complaints (nausea, vomiting, irritable bowel syndrome). It can be beneficial for pain syndromes due to an injury or associated with chronic degenerative diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be helpful in treating neurological problems like migraines or Parkinson's disease, or as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals who suffered a stroke. Respiratory conditions, including sinusitis and asthma have been relieved with acupuncture, as have many gynecologic disorders and infertility. Acupuncture has also proved beneficial for reducing fatigue and addictions, and for promoting overall well-being. Sessions typically last 30-45 minutes. Cupping is the term applied to a technique that uses small glass/plastic cups or bamboo jars as suction devices that are placed on the ski to disperse and break up stagnation and congestion by drawing congested blood, energy or other humors to the surface. In dry cupping, the practitioner will simply place the suction cups on the skin, either dragging the cups over areas of the body or leaving them stationary for minutes. Cupping therapy can be great for addressing immune boosting, congestion, musculoskeletal pain, digestive concerns and more. The side effects of cupping are fairly mild. Bruising should be expected, but skin should return to looking normal within 4-7 days. Sessions typically incorporate cupping and acupuncture together. Facial rejuvenation acupuncture is a great, natural technique to slow the signs of aging in the face and skin. Very thin needles are placed on the face (and body) to address boosting natural collagen production, decreasing fine lines and puffy eyes, increasing blood circulation and overall youthfulness and vitality. Facial acupuncture is a wonderful alternative to chemical and surgical cosmetic procedures. Sessions typically last 45 minutes and most benefits of facial acupuncture can be seen after 6-10 sessions. Facial cupping uses gentle techniques to the face and neck to stimulate lymphatic flushing, increased blood flow to the face and collagen production. Treatments are beneficial for facial muscle relaxation, jaw and facial nerve pain, sinus congestion, lymphatic flow, reducing fine lines and wrinkles, and supporting rejuvenation. Naturopathic doctors are able to order labs including serum (blood), saliva and urinary tests which assist in diagnosing health concerns and when creating personalized treatment plans. Requisitions or testing kits are given to the patient to either bring to their nearest blood lab for collection or to do in the comfort of their own home (ie. salivary hormone testing). Because naturopathic doctors are not OHIP covered, all labs are an out-of-pocket expense for patients. Many health insurance plans have personal spending accounts/extended health allowance which can be used to cover labs done with naturopathic doctors. Be sure to check your plan for specific coverage. Testing offered: Food sensitivity, Heavy metals, female/male hormones plus cortisol, Hair mineral analysis, Comprehensive hormones, Full Thyroid panel, Organic acids, Genetic. Please inquire as we offer a wide variety of diagnostic testing. Nutrition is key when addressing one's health. \"You are what you eat and you are what you digest.\" Nutritional modifications to one's lifestyle is always a challenge, especially for those who may not be comfortable around a kitchen or grocery store. We provide all the resources and help you may need when changing your dietary lifestyle to one that would be more beneficial to your health and wellness goals. We work with you to find easy ways to implement changes that will not only create positive effects, but changes that can be long lasting and practical to maintain. One's nutritional status can reflect overall health, which is why we believe in addressing nutrition to ensure optimal gut health and cellular function. Intial visits are between 1 to 1.5 hrs where physical exams are conducted as required. Follow up visits are 15-60 minutes depending on the type of appointment and complexity of your health concern. A detailed and thorough case history is taken. With the guidance of your naturopathic doctor, a therapeutic protocol is formulated keeping the patients' overall vitality and goals in mind. The protocol is commonly discussed during the first follow up visit. Costs of supplements, tinctures, etc are not included in the appointment fee. NDs obtain comprehensive and rigorous training in an educational structure similar to that of medical doctors. Naturopathic Doctors are highly educated primary care providers who integrate standard medical diagnostics with a broad range of natural therapies. NDs require three years of pre-med postsecondary education, plus four years of full-time study at an approved college of Naturopathic Medicine. There are two accredited Naturopathic Colleges in Canada. The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in Toronto, Ontario and the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine in New Westminster, British Columbia. The four-year program incorporates over 4,500 hours of classroom training in basic medical science courses, clinical sciences and naturopathic therapies, as well as 1500 hours of supervised clinical experience. Graduates from an accredited naturopathic college receive the designation Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND). Following the completion of their program, NDs must successfully complete the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX) in order to qualify for licensing in Ontario. NPLEX is the standard examination used by all regulated provinces and states across North America. NDs are also required to earn continuing education credits on an ongoing basis to maintain their registration and good standing with the regulatory body. The Ontario Association of Naturopathic Doctors provides high quality continuing education that awards these necessary credits frequently throughout each calendar year. Naturopathic visits are not covered by OHIP. Many health insurance policies do cover naturopathic visits. Ask your insurance company about your naturopathic coverage. "}
