The infusion is more comfortable than an ordinary blood draw. Depending on the infusion, you may experience the local warmth and either an increase in energy or a relaxation effect. An improved sense of calm and well-being accompanies many infusions, especially vitamin C or magnesium infusions. And many people report subsequently improved sleep. The length of treatment depends on the nutrient mix and concentration being infused. Plan at least one hour for most formulas. \"Drips,\" like High Dose Vitamin C, may take up to four hours. We have a dedicated infusion room that is relaxing and peaceful. You may read, watch TV, listen to music, or take a nap. Although you will be sitting most of the time, you may get up and use the restroom if necessary. It is best to eat before having an IV infusion as some infusions affect blood sugar. If you have diabetes, you should monitor your insulin dosage and bring snacks with you to your appointment. Please come well hydrated and let our staff know if you have any allergies. "}
