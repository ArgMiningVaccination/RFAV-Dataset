Furthermore, no party to a treaty or international agreement subject to registration which has not been registered may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly, by resolution 97 (1), established regulations to give effect to Article 102 of the Charter (see text of the regulations, vol. 859, p.,Vlll). The terms \"treaty\" and \"international agreement\" have not been defined either in the Charter or in the regu- lations, and the Secretariat follows the principle that it acts in accordance with the position of the Member State submitting an instrument for registration that so far as that party is concerned the instrument is a treaty or an in- ternational agreement within the meaning of Article 102. Registration of an instrument submitted by a Member State, therefore, does not imply a judgement by the Secretariat on the nature of the instrument, the status of a party or any similar question. It is the understanding of the Secretariat that its action does not confer on the instrument the status of a treaty or an international agreement if it does not already have that status and does not confer on a party a status which it would not otherwise have. Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of the original texts of treaties, etc., published in this Series have been made by the Secretariat of the United Nations.

The Memorandum of Understanding and Agreed Minutes between the Minister of Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands and the Minister of State for Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia, signed on February 11, 2002; Parties decided that: On the content of the co-operation: Both Parties will promote that this institutional co-operation between Indonesia and the Netherlands will be continued and strengthened. Also the strengthening of relations be- tween education and research on the one hand and trade and industry on the other hand will be promoted. The Indonesian Party acknowledges the DELTA scholarship programme that has been launched by the Netherlands Party at the beginning of February 2001. This programme is meant for international co-operation in the field of higher education and some priority countries, among which Indonesia. In this programme students from Indonesia will have the opportunity to be trained in The Netherlands. The Netherlands Organisation for Inter- national Co-operation in Higher Education (NUFFIC) has been assigned with the respon- sibility for set up, implementation and administration of all aspects of the DELTA scholarship programme. Through the NUFFIC the Dutch institutions of higher education are able to provide scholarships to individual students preferably in the framework of insti- tutional co-operation. Both Parties acknowledge the role of the Netherlands Education Centre in Jakarta (NEC) in supporting and facilitating the institutional co-operation in university educatioa higher professional education, and vocational education and training between both coun- tries. The activities of NEC will among others be focused on information services to Indo- nesian students concerning higher and vocational education in the Netherlands, information on selection procedures of the scholarship programmes and assistance with the preparation of the enrolment and selection of students. Furthermore, the NEC office will also facilitate and stimulate institutional co-operation and exchange of information between educational institutions, relevant government institutions and other organisations in Indonesia and the Netherlands. Through the opportunities provided by any means of financial support from third par- ties under the spirit of this Memorandum of Understanding of February 11 th 2002, a dif- ferent form of co-operation between education in Indonesia and in the Netherlands is being Volume 2262, 1-40282 established, that will involve more institutions and new networks will be created for their mutual benefit. It is the intention of both Parties: -to further extend this co-operation where necessary in a regional approach which should be directed towards the development of solid relations between education and re- gional trade and industry; -to explore ways for education to support and answer to the demands of the labour market, to be formulated by the regional social partners, which is an issue of the utmost im- portance in both countries. On the Joint Working Group: Activities of personnel engaged in the activities under the Memorandum of Under- standing, the Agreed Minutes, the Joint Committee or the (sub) contracts will not involve and/or interfere in the internal affairs nor will they conduct commercial ventures or activi- ties in Indonesia or the Netherlands outside the program of cooperation without prior ap- proval of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government of the Netherlands. On new initiatives as an example some new initiatives are announced at the occasion of this visit: -- Mutual learning The linkages between higher and vocational institutions are a topic of utmost impor- tance because they are at the basis of pathways for students in the education system. These so called educational pathways for professional education enable students to reach their highest level of competence and/or education. With regard to this the linkage and co-op- eration of the educational institutions and enterprises also contributes substantially. Indonesian representatives from educational institutions and enterprises will be invited to the Netherlands for a fact-finding mission on educational pathways for professional ed- ucation.

The Netherlands is willing to assist the network in achieving its goals. -- Polytechnic Education and Higher Professional Education To stimulate further co-operation in the sphere of polytechnic education and higher professional education the Netherlands Party has created a desk which is developing a con- crete plan of action to support institutions on request during the course of the different projects and to help them achieve their goals, thus contributing towards the relevance and sustainability of the projects and the co-operation. The activities of this desk will also en- deavour to extend to other fields such as health care, seamanship training and fishing. -- Co-operation with the world of business In order to strengthen the relationships between the business world and the world of education a new initiative is being considered to develop courses by mutual cooperation. These courses will have the character of demand driven short courses that will serve the regional and local needs of both worlds. In this respect the provision of internships will be considered. New initiatives will further be elaborated by the Joint Working Group in the follow up of this visit.

The Contracting Par- ties shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry or operators who have their prin- cipal place of business or permanent residence in their territory and the operators of airports in their territory act in conformity with such aviation security provisions. 5. Each Contracting Party agrees to observe the security provisions required by the oth- er Contracting Party for entry into the territory of that other Contracting Party and to take adequate measures to inspect passengers, crew, their carry-on items as well as cargo prior to boarding or loading. Each Contracting Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from the other Contracting Party for special security measures for its aircraft or pas- sengers to meet a particular threat. 6. When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of aircraft or other un- lawful acts against the safety of passengers, crew, aircraft, airports and air navigation facil- ities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof. Volume 2262, 1-40295 7.

Any amendment or modification of the Annex to this Agreement shall be agreed upon in writing between the aeronautical authorities and shall take effect on a date to be determined by the aeronautical authorities. Article 18. Settlement of Disputes 1. If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation between themselves. 2. If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, the dispute may at the request of either Contracting Party be submitted for decision to a tribunal of three ar- bitrators (hereinafter referred to as the \"Tribunal\"), one to be appointed by each Contracting Party and the third to be agreed upon by the two arbitrators so appointed, provided that such third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party. Each of the Contracting Parties shall designate its arbitrator within a period of sixty days from the date of receipt by either Contracting Party from the other Contracting Party of a diplomatic note requesting arbitration of the dispute and the third arbitrator shall be agreed upon within a further period of sixty days. If either of the Contracting Parties fails to designate its own arbitrator within the period of sixty days or if the third arbitrator is not agreed upon within the period indi- cated, the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation may be requested by either Contracting Party to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators. 3. The Tribunal shall determine its own procedure. 4. Subject to the final decision of the Tribunal, the Contracting Parties shall bear in equal proportion the initial costs of arbitration. Volume 2262, 1-40295 5. The Contracting Parties shall comply with any provisional ruling and the final decision of the Tribunal. 6. If, and so long as, one of the Contracting Parties fails to comply with a decision of the Tribunal given under this Article, the other Contracting Party may limit, withhold or revoke any rights or privileges which it has granted by virtue of the present Agreement to the Contracting Party in default. Article 19. Termination ofAgreement Either Contracting Party may at any time give notice to the other Contracting Party of its intention to terminate this Agreement. Such notice shall be simultaneously communicat- ed to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. In such case this Agreement shall ter- minate twelve (12) months after the date on which the notice was received by the other Contracting Party unless the notice to terminate is withdrawn by agreement before the ex- piry of this period. In the absence of acknowledgement of receipt by the other Contracting Party, the notice shall be deemed to have been received fourteen (14) days after the receipt of the notice by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Article 20. Registration ofAgreement and Amendments This Agreement and any subsequent amendments thereto shall be registered with the International Civil Aviation Organisation by the Contracting Parties. Article 21. Applicability of Multilateral Agreements 1. The provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Conven- tion. 2. If a multilateral agreement concerning any matter covered by this Agreement, ac- cepted by both Parties, enters into force, the relevant provisions of that agreement shall su- persede the relevant provisions of the present Agreement. Article 22. Applicability As regards the Kingdom of the Netherlands, this Agreement shall apply to the King- dom in Europe only. Article 23. Entry into Force This Agreement shall enter into force on the day on which the Contracting Parties have informed each other in writing that the formalities constitutionally required therefor in their respective countries have been complied with.

Brussels, 10 April 2001 Volume 2262, 1-40296 ANNEX A. MOVABLE AND IMMOVABLE PROPERTY Article I (1) In order to achieve an equitable solution, the movable and immovable State prop- erty of the federation constituted as the SFRY (\"State property\") shall pass to the successor States in accordance with the provisions of the following Articles of this Annex. (2) Other proprietary rights and interests of the SFRY are covered by Annex F to this Agreement. (3) Private property and acquired rights of citizens and other legal persons of the SFRY are covered by Annex G to this Agreement. Article 2 (1) Immovable State property of the SFRY which was located within the territory of the SFRY shall pass to the successor State on whose territory that property is situated. (2) The successor States shall use their best endeavours to assist each other with the exercise of their diplomatic and consular activities by the provision of suitable proper- ties in their respective territories. Article 3 (1) Tangible movable State property of the SFRY which was located within the terri- tory of the SFRY shall pass to the successor State on whose territory that property was sit- uated on the date on which it proclaimed independence. (2) Paragraph (1) of this Article does not apply to tangible movable State property of great importance to the cultural heritage of one of the successor States and which originated from the territory of that State, such as: works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest to that State; and scientific collections and important collections of books or archives which shall pass to that State. Such property shall be identified by the successor State concerned as soon as possible, but not later than 2 years after the entry into force of this Agreement. (3) If SFRY State tangible movable property (other than military property) which has passed to one of the successor States in accordance with paragraph (1) of this Article, has been removed without authorisation from its territory by another successor State, the latter state shall ensure its return as soon as possible or pay full compensation for such removal. Article 4 (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of Article 3 of this Annex, tangible movable State property of the SFRY which formed part of the military property of that State shall be the subject of special arrangements to be agreed among the successor States concerned. Volume 2262, 1-40296 (2) In relation to tangible movable and immovable property of the former Yugoslav National Army used for civilian purposes the arrangements referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article will acknowledge the relevance of Articles 2 (1) and 3 (1) of this Annex. Article 5 (1) A Joint Committee on Succession to Movable and Immovable Property shall be es- tablished by the successor States, which shall ensure the proper implementation of the pro- visions of this Annex applicable to tangible movable and immovable property (other than military property) and the resolution of any problems which might arise in the course of their application. (2) The Joint Committee shall commence its work within 3 months of the signature of this Agreement. Article 6 It shall be for the successor State on whose territory immovable and tangible movable property is situated to determine, for the purposes of this Annex, whether that property was State property of the SFRY in accordance with international law. Article 7 Where pursuant to this Annex property passes to one of the successor States, its title to and rights in respect of that property shall be treated as having arisen on the date on which it proclaimed independence, and any other successor State's title to and rights in respect of the property shall be treated as extinguished from that date. Article 8 (1) Where tangible movable and immovable State property of the SFRY passes to a successor State in accordance with Articles I to 3 of this Annex, that property shall not be subject to valuation for the purposes of this Agreement, and no compensation shall be pay- able in respect of the passing of that property to the successor State in question. (2) However, should any successor State consider that the application of Articles I to 3 of this Annex result in a significantly unequal distribution of SFRY State property (other than military property) among the successor States, that State may raise the matter in the Joint Committee established pursuant to Article 5 of this Annex. The Joint Commit- tee, acting unanimously, may take such action as it considers appropriate in the circum- stances. Article 9 The provisions of this Annex are without prejudice to the provisions of Annexes B and D concerning diplomatic and consular properties, and archives. Volume 2262, 1-40296 ANNEX B. DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROPERTIES Article I (1) As an interim and partial distribution of SFRY diplomatic and consular properties, the successor States have selected the following properties for allocation to each of them: Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia Macedonia Slovenia Federal Republic of YougoslaviaLondon (Embassy) Paris (Embassy) Paris (Consulate General) Washington (Embassy) Paris (Residence) (2) Any action which may be necessary to enable each successor State to enter into possession of the property allocated to it shall be completed within six months of the date of signature of this Agreement. Article 2 (1) SFRY diplomatic and consular properties shall be distributed in kind (i.e. as prop- erties) rather than by way of monetary payments. (2) In that distribution, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia, are receiving a great- er share than they would receive under the IMF key, or any other more favourable criterion for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia for the distribution of such properties. Article 3 Diplomatic and consular properties other than those acquired by States in accordance with Article 1 of this Annex shall be distributed in such a way that the total and final dis- tribution in kind of diplomatic and consular properties (including those acquired in accor- dance with Article 1) reflects as closely as possible the following proportions by value for each State: Volume 2262, 1-40296 Bosnia and Herzegovia 15 % Croatia 23.5 % Macedonia 8 % Slovenia 14% Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 39.5% Article 4 (1) SFRY diplomatic and consular properties are set out in the list appended to this An- nex. That list groups properties according to their geographical regions. Each successor State shall, within each geographical region, be entitled to its proportionate share as set out in Article 3. (2) The distribution of properties shall be by agreement between the 5 States. To the extent that agreement on the distribution of properties cannot be reached, the successor States shall adopt a procedure whereby any property selected by only one State will be ac- quired by that State, and where two or more States have selected the same property, those States will consult together as to which of them will acquire that property. (3) The basis for the proportionate distribution of properties is the valuation in the \"Re- port dated 31 December 1992 on the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the former So- cialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as at 31 December 1990.\" (4) Movable State property of the SFRY which forms part of the contents of diplo- matic or consular properties shall pass to whichever successor State acquires the diplomat- ic or consular properties in question. (5) Movable State property of the SFRY which forms part of the contents of diplomat- ic and consular properties and which is of great importance to the cultural heritage of one of the successor States shall pass to that State. Article 5 The successor States shall establish a Joint Committee composed of an equal number of representatives from each State to ensure the effective implementation of Articles 3 and 4 of this Annex. The functions of the Joint Committee shall include: (a) verifying and as necessary amending the List referred to in Article 4(1); (b) assessing the legal status of each property, its physical condition, and any financial liabilities attaching to it; and (c) considering the valuation of property as the need arises. Volume 2262, 1-40296 Article 6 The Joint Committee shah commence its work on a provisional basis within 3 months of the date of signature of this Agreement. Article 7 Whichever successor State is in a position to maintain and keep under repair any Dip- lomatic or consular properties of the SFRY shall take the necessary steps to that end, bear- ing in mind in particular (a) the principle that it must at ail times take the necessary measures to prevent loss or damage to or destruction of such properties, and (b) the requirement to pay compensation for any loss, damage or destruction resulting from failure to take such action.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Article I The SFRY's financial assets comprised all financial assets of the SFRY (such as cash, gold and other precious metals, deposit accounts, and securities) , including in particular - (a) accounts and other financial assets in the name of the SFRY Federal Govern- ment Departments and Agencies; (b) accounts and other financial assets in the name of the National Bank of Yugosla- via; (c) foreign currency assets, including holdings of gold and other precious metals, of the SFRY or the National Bank of Yugoslavia; (d) sums due to the National Bank of Yugoslavia from banks in other countries result- ing from uncompleted inter-bank clearing arrangements; such countries include, but are not limited to, those listed in Appendix 2 of this Annex. (e) financial quotas and drawing rights of the SFRY, the National Bank of Yugoslavia or other federal organs or institutions in international financial organisations, as well as fi- nancial assets held with such organisations. (f) other assets of the SFRY, including amounts due to the National Bank of Yugosla- via or the SFRY from obligors other than those included in (a) -(e) above. Article 2 (1)(a) The SFRY's financial liabilities comprised (subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article) the debts of the SFRY, debts guaranteed by the SFRY and financial claims against the SFRY, and consisted principally of- (i) the external debt of the SFRY to official creditors and the International Financial Institutions; (ii) the external debt of the SFRY to commercial creditors; (iii) sums payable by the National Bank of Yugoslavia to banks in other countries re- sulting from uncompleted inter-bank clearing arrangements. Such countries include, but are not limited to, those listed in Appendix 2 to this Annex; (iv) external debt of the SFRY to creditors other than those listed in (i) -(iii), above. (b) External debt in (i) -(iv) above is described as allocated debt if the final beneficiary of the debt is located on the territory of a specific successor State or group of successor States. Allocated debt is not subject to succession and shall be accepted by the successor State on the territory of which the final beneficiary is located. (c) Liabilities of the SFRY, National Bank of Yugoslavia or other federal institutions towards international financial organisations are included under the external debt of the SFRY. Volume 2262, 1-40296 (2) The financial liabilities to be taken into account pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article do not include the financial liabilities of the SFRY under the Agreement concluded between the SFRY and Italy on 18 February 1983 on the Final Settlement of Reciprocal Obligations. (3) Other financial liabilities include: (a) guarantees by the SFRY or its National Bank of Yugoslavia of hard currency sav- ings deposited in a commercial bank and any of its branches in any successor State before the date on which it proclaimed independence; and (b) guarantees by the SFRY of savings deposited before certain dates with the Post Of- fice Savings Bank at its branches in any of the Republics of the SFRY. Article 3 (1) A major portion of the assets and liabilities of the SFRY have already in practice been distributed on the basis of agreements between the successor States or agreements be- tween them individually and the institutions concerned, namely: (a) the SFRY's share of the assets and liabilities of the International Monetary Fund; (b) shares of the World Bank and its affiliated institutions held by the SFRY; (c) liabilities of the SFRY to the World Bank; (d) shares of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the African De- velopment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank held by the SFRY; (e) the SFRY's debts to the European Investment Bank; (f) the gold and other reserves and shares of the Bank for International Settlements, Basle held by the SFRY; (g) guarantees by the SFRY of savings deposited before certain dates with the Post Office Savings Bank and its branches; (h) that part of the SFRY's external official debt to members of the so-called \"Paris Club\" which has been assumed by certain of the successor States in proportions fixed in agreements between each of them and \"Paris Club\" members; (i) that part of the SFRY's external commercial debt to banks (the so-called \"London Club\") under the New Financial Agreement 1988 which has been assumed by certain of the successor States in proportions fixed in agreements between each of them and the \"London Club\" members. (2) In regard to sub-paragraph (h) and (i) of paragraph (1) above, four of the five suc- cessor States have concluded agreements with the \"Paris Club\" and \"London Club\" credi- tors. The remaining successor State, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will assume responsibility for all of its allocated debt to \"Paris Club\" and \"London Club\" creditors and its share of the unallocated debt to such creditors. This is expected to resolve the remaining \"Paris Club\" and \"London Club\" claims against the SFRY. It is impossible to predict the outcome of this resolution at the present time, but the resolution of\"Paris Club\" and \"Lon- don Club\" claims by the FRY will, as between the successor States, conclude the resolution of their obligations to the \"Paris Club\" and the \"London Club\". The successor States shall Volume 2262, 1-40296 terminate any existing legal proceedings or financial claims against each other in relation to \"Paris Club\" and \"London Club\" obligations upon the signature of this Agreement, and shall not institute any other such legal proceedings or financial claims in the future, what- ever the outcome of the resolution by the FRY of\"Paris Club\" and \"London Club\" claims. (3) The distributions referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article are final and shall not be reopened by any of the successor States in the context of succession issues. Article 4 Distributions of assets on a net basis include: (a) the SFRY's ownership of a 27% share of the capital of the Yugoslav Bank for In- ternational Economic Cooperation, as it existed prior to its conversion to a commercial bank, which shall be distributed among the States according to the proportions agreed to in Article 5(2); and (b) the net amount due to the National Bank of Yugoslavia from banks in other coun- tries resulting from uncompleted inter-bank clearing arrangements, which shall be tabulat- ed and distributed according to the proportions agreed to in Article 5(2) .Such countries include, but are not limited to, those listed in Appendix 2 to this Annex. Article 5 (1) Foreign financial assets (such as cash, gold and other precious metals, deposit ac- counts and securities), whether held by the SFRY or the National Bank of Yugoslavia di- rectly or with foreign banks, Yugoslav joint venture banks and agencies of Yugoslav banks abroad include the following: (i) monetary gold (271,642.769 oz.) valued on 31 March 2001 at $70.18 million; (ii) foreign exchange accounts held at foreign commercial banks and valued on 31 March 2001 at $307.61 million; (iii) foreign exchange accounts held at SFRY joint venture banks abroad and valued on 31 March 2001 at $ 645.55 million; and (iv) gold (1209.78 oz.) formerly held by the France-UK-USA Gold Commission, val- ued on 22 May 2001 at $343.76 thousand. (2) The available foreign financial assets identified in paragraph (1) of this Article shall be distributed according to the following proportions, which shall be applied to items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) separately: Volume 2262, 1-40296 Bosnia and Herzegovia 15.50% Croatia 23.00% 7.50% Slovenia 16.00 % Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 38.00 % (3) If currently unknown foreign financial assets are found to exist within five years, they shall be distributed as soon as possible on the proportionate basis set out in paragraph (2) of this Article, and using the mechanism described in Article 6. Article 6 Each successor State shall appoint a representative of the Central Bank or an other au- thorised representative to form a Committee, which shall meet within 30 days of the signa- ture of this Agreement to arrange the modalities for the initial distributions identified in Article 5 of this Annex. Their objective will be to effect any distributions of assets as quick- ly as possible. In addition they will arrange jointly to verify, settle and effect distributions under Article 4 of this Annex. They will also make arrangements to distribute to the extent possible assets under Article (f) and liabilities under Article 2(l)(a)(iv) of this Annex ac- cording to the proportions agreed to in Article 5(2). The Committee will also prepare a de- finitive list of all SFRY external debt. Article 7 Guarantees by the SFRY or its NBY of hard currency savings deposited in a commer- cial bank and any of its branches in any successor State before the date on which it pro- claimed its independence shall be negotiated without delay taking into account in particular the necessity of protecting the hard currency savings of individuals. This negotiation shall take place under the auspices of The Bank for International Settlements. Article 8 (1) The return to successor States of their contributions to the Federal Fund for devel- opment of the less developed Republics and Kosovo, the payment of outstanding contri- butions due by successor States to the Fund, and the repayment of credits given to those States by the Fund, are cancelled. (2) The financial liabilities of the SFRY under the Agreement concluded between the SFRY and Italy on February 18, 1983 on the Final Settlement of Reciprocal Obligations shall be distributed to the successor States that are beneficiaries of this Agreement. Pursu- ant to the Agreement with Italy, concluded in 1955 between SFRY and the Republic of It- Volume 2262, 1-40296 aly, about local commerce between areas Gorizia-Udine and Sezana-Nova Gorica-Tolmin (Gorica Agreement) as well as between SFRY and the Republic of Italy for the border areas of Trieste on one side and Buje, Koper, Sezana on the other side (Trieste Agreement) , to- gether with the related payment arrangements, are excluded from the provisions of this paragraph. The issues related to the Trieste Agreement will be dealt with by Croatia and Slovenia. The issues related to the Gorica Agreement will be dealt with by the Republic of Slovenia only. Article 9 In connection with the distributions agreed in the preceding Articles of this Annex the successor States have concluded the Disclosure Authorisation appended to this Annex, and shall to the extent that they have not already done so: (a) allow free access to and provide copies of such records and data requested by any successor State as are in its possession and relate to the SFRY's financial assets and liabil- ities. Accounts of the National Bank of Yugoslavia opened after the date on which UN sanctions were first imposed are not subject to this disclosure requirement. (b) exchange information on those accounts and financial assets held by banks in third States and belonging to connected persons (as defined by the authorities which in those States regulate the banking business). Article 10 Each successor State has introduced a new currency and established its monetary in- dependence. As such, no successor State shall pursue financial claims or legal proceedings against any other successor State related to the introduction of its new currency or the es- tablishment of its monetary independence. Volume 2262, 1-40296 Appendix I to Annex C Disclosure Authorisation to Central Banks and/or responsible ministries regarding data on financial and other assets of the SFRY held by third country central banks and/or other fi- nancial institutions The five Delegations participating in the discussions and negotiations to resolve issues of succession arising upon the break-up of the SFRY, and working toward the prompt distribution of the assets of the SFRY among the successor States within the framework of the agreement concluded between them in Vienna on May 25, 2001, have agreed that data on bank deposits, holdings of securities, or other types of financial assets of the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), as well as other assets of the SFRY referred to in UN Security Council Resolution No. 1022 (collectively, the Frozen Accounts), held by foreign banks, foreign financial institutions or other foreign entities as they stood on 31 May 2001 should be made available to each of the successor States. To that end they hereby authorize Central Banks, responsible Ministries and/or other financial institutions to provide financial data in regard to Frozen Accounts to the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance of each successor state upon receipt of a request for such data made by the Central Bank of any successor State. Such data may include, but is not limited to, details regarding the composition and value of Frozen Deposit accounts in banks, financial institutions, and other entities on their territory or subject to their regulation, control, or administration. In addition to supplying information for 31 May 2001, banks are requested to comply with subsequent requests for information on SFRY Frozen Accounts from any of the un- dersigned successor States. If necessary to secure release of financial data in regard to Frozen Accounts, the Na- tional Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) shall issue the authorizations necessary to permit disclo- sure of this information to the Central Banks and Ministries of Finance of the successor States. If required, such authorization shall include the name and address of the foreign bank, the account number, and any other information needed to identify the account. No legal proceedings will be commenced by any successor State on the basis of finan- cial data disclosed as a result of the foregoing arrangements. This authorization takes effect on today's date, and is witnessed by the Special Nego- tiator for Succession Issues of the SFRY in the Office of the High Representative, Sir Arthur Watts.

ARCHIVES Article 1 (a) For the purposes of this Annex, \"SFRY State archives\" means all documents, of whatever date or kind and wherever located, which were produced or received by the SFRY (or by any previous constitutional structure of the Yugoslav State since 1 December 1918) in the exercise of its functions and which, on 30 June 1991, belonged to the SFRY in accordance with its internal law and were, pursuant to the federal law on the regulation of federal archives, preserved by it directly or under its control as archives for whatever pur- pose. (b) For the purposes of this Annex, \"Republic or other archives\" refers to the archives of any of the States in their former capacities as constituent Republics of the SFRY, or of their territorial or administrative units, and means all documents, of whatever date or kind and wherever located, which were produced or received by any of those Republics or ter- ritorial or administrative units in the exercise of their functions and which, on 30 June 1991, belonged to them in accordance with the applicable law and were, pursuant to the law on the regulation of archives of each of the Republics, preserved by them directly or under their control as archives for whatever purpose. (c) \"Documents\" in the preceding sub-paragraphs includes film, audio and video tapes and other recordings, as well as any form of computerised records, and includes doc- uments which constitute cultural property. Article 2 If Republic or other archives were displaced from the Republic to which they be- longed, or if SFRY State archives were displaced from their proper location, they shall, subject to the provisions of this Annex and in accordance with international principles of provenance, be restored respectively to the Republic to which they belonged or their proper location as soon as possible by the State which currently has control of them. Article 3 The part of the SFRY State archives (administrative, current and archival records) nec- essary for the normal administration of the territory of one or more of the States shall, in accordance with the principle of functional pertinence, pass to those States, irrespective of where those archives are actually located. Article 4 (a) The part of the SFRY State archives which constitutes a group which (i) relates directly to the territory of one or more of the States, or (ii) was produced or received in the territory of one or more of the States, or Volume 2262, 1-40296 (iii) consists of treaties of which the SFRY was the depository and which relates only to matters concerning the territory of, or to institutions having their headquarters in the ter- ritory of, one or more of the States, shall pass to those states, irrespective of where those archives are actually located. (b) Pending the apportionment of SFRY State archives under this Article, (i) the original of the Treaty on Water Economy Problems between the SFRY and Greece signed in 1959 (Official Gazette of the SFRY No. 20 of 4 June 1960) and of the Treaty on the Preservation and Renewal of Frontier Signs on the Yugoslav-Greece Frontier for the Protection, Prevention and the Solution on Frontier Incidents (Official Gazette of the SFRY No. 20 of 26 February 1959) shall be transferred forthwith to the Republic of Macedonia. (ii) the original text or certified copies of the Treaty of Osimo and the Osimo Agree- ment of 1975, and any related agreements, archives and travaux prdparatoires concerning their negotiation and implementation, shall be made available forthwith to Croatia and Slo- venia in order to enable them, in full possession of the relevant material, to negotiate with Italy over the consequences of those treaties for their respective States. Article 5 If pursuant to Articles 3 or 4 archives are to pass to more than one State, those States shall agree which of them will receive the original and enable the others to make copies. Article 6 (a) In relation to SFRY State archives other than those referred to in Articles 3 and 4, the States shall, by agreement to be reached within 6 months of the entry into force of this Agreement, determine their equitable distribution among themselves or their retention as common heritage of the States which shall have free and unhindered access to them. If no such agreement is reached, the archives shall become common heritage. In either event, each State may make copies of the archives in question on an equitable cost-sharing basis. (b) The agreement referred to in paragraph (a) shall take account of all relevant circum- stances which include the observance as far as possible of the principle of respect for the integrity of groups of SFRY State archives so as to facilitate full access to and research in those groups of archives. Respect for the integrity of groups of archives is without prejudice to the question where any particular group of archives should be preserved. The Minis- tries or Departments responsible for archives in each of the States shall within 24 months of the date on which this Agreement enters into force identify, and circulate to each other, lists of groups of archives to which this principle should apply, and shall thereafter seek to agree on a single such list within a further period of 3 months. They shall also identify, and circulate to each other, within 24 months of the date on which this Agreement enters into force, lists of archives to which Articles 3 and 4 apply. Volume 2262, 1-40296 Article 7 Pending implementation of this Agreement there shall be immediate free and unhin- dered access by representatives of the interested States to SFRY State archives dated on or before 30 June 1991. This access also applies to Republic and other archives (other than current archives) now held in the States concerned. Article 8 Republic or other archives are the property of the corresponding State and are not sub- ject to the provisions of this Annex, other than Articles 1, 2 and 7. Article 9 Private archives are not subject to the other provisions of this Article. Those which were taken from their owners after 1 December 1918 shall be returned to where they had been produced or to their owners, according to international principles of provenance, with- out any compensation or other conditions. Article 10 Where SFRY bilateral treaties concerning the restitution of archives were in force on 30 June 1991 and those treaties have not yet been fully performed, the States with an inter- est in those archives are ready to assume the rights and obligations formerly held by the SFRY in relation to the performance of those treaties. Article 11 (a) The current possessor of the original of any archive which is to be transferred pur- suant to this Annex may make copies thereof. (b) The cost of making copies pursuant to Articles 5 and 11 (a) above shall be subject to further agreement between the States concerned. (c) The cost of transporting archives which pass pursuant to this Annex shall be borne by the recipient. (d) The current possessor of archives which are to be transported or which may be cop- ied pursuant to this Annex shall assist in reducing the related costs as far as possible.

(f) The State in possession of original documents forming part of the SFRY State Ar- chives shall provide access to them for purposes of obtaining a certified copy for use as ev- idence upon the request of the interested user, should the copy available in another State not be usable for his legitimate needs. Volume 2262, 1-40296 Article 12 Within 3 months of the date on which this Agreement enters into force, representatives of the Ministries or Departments responsible for archives in each of the States shall meet together to give effect to this Annex, and to take such immediate action as may be possible. Arrangements for that meeting, and for the initial general supervision of the implementa- tion of this Annex, shall be made by the Standing Joint Committee established under Arti- cle 4 of this Agreement. Volume 2262, 1-40296 ANNEX E. PENSIONS Article 1 Each State shall assume responsibility for and regularly pay legally grounded pensions funded by that State in its former capacity as a constituent Republic of the SFRY, irrespec- tive of the nationality, citizenship, residence or domicile of the beneficiary. Article 2 Each State shall assume responsibility for and regularly pay pensions which are due to its citizens who were civil or military servants of the SFRY irrespective of where they are resident or domiciled, if those pensions were funded from the federal budget or other fed- eral resources of the SFRY; provided that in the case of a person who is a citizen of more than one State - (i) if that person is domiciled in one of those States, payment of the pension shall be made by that State; and (ii) if that person is not domiciled in any State of which such person is a citizen, pay- ment of the pension shall be made by the State in the territory of which that person was res- ident on 1 June 1991. Article 3 The States shall, if necessary, conclude bilateral arrangements for ensuring the pay- ment of pensions pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 above to persons located in a State other than that which is paying the pensions of those persons, for transferring the necessary funds to ensure payment of those pensions, and for the payment of pensions proportionally to the payment of contributions. Where appropriate, the conclusion of such definitive bilateral ar- rangements may be preceded by the conclusion of interim arrangements for ensuring the payment of pensions pursuant to Article 2. Any bilateral agreements concluded between any two of the States shall prevail over the provisions of this Annex and shall resolve the issue of mutual claims between the pension funds of the States relating to payments of pen- sions made before such agreements entered into force. Volume 2262, 1-40296 ANNEX F. OTHER RIGHTS, INTERESTS AND LIABILITIES Article I All rights and interests which belonged to the SFRY and which are not otherwise cov- ered by this Agreement (including, but not limited to, patents, trade marks, copyrights, roy- alties, and claims of and debts due to the SFRY) shall be shared among the successor States, taking into account the proportion for division of SFRY financial assets in Annex C of this Agreement. The division of such rights and interests shall proceed under the direction of the Standing Joint Committee established under Article 4 of this Agreement. Article 2 All claims against the SFRY which are not otherwise covered by this Agreement shall be considered by the Standing Joint Committee established under Article 4 of this Agree- ment. The successor States shall inform one another of all such claims against the SFRY. Volume 2262, 1-40296 ANNEX G. PRIVATE PROPERTY AND ACQUIRED RIGHTS Article I Private property and acquired rights of citizens and other legal persons of the SFRY shall be protected by successor States in accordance with the provisions of this Annex. Article 2 (1) (a) The rights to movable and immovable property located in a successor State and to which citizens or other legal persons of the SFRY were entitled on 31 December 1990 shall be recognised, and protected and restored by that State in accordance with established standards and norms of international law and irrespective of the nationality, citizenship, residence or domicile of those persons. This shall include persons who, after 31 December 1990, acquired the citizenship of or established domicile or residence in a State other than a successor State. Persons unable to realize such rights shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with civil and international legal norms. (b) Any purported transfer of rights to movable or immovable property made after 31 December 1990 and concluded under duress or contrary to sub-paragraph (a) of this Article shall be null and void. (2) All contracts concluded by citizens or other legal persons of the SFRY as of 31 De- cember 1990, including those concluded by public enterprises, shall be respected on a non- discriminatory basis. The successor States shall provide for the carrying out of obligations under such contracts, where the performance of such contracts was prevented by the break- up of the SFRY. Article 3 The successor States shall respect and protect rights of all natural and juridical persons of the SFRY to intellectual property, including patents, trade marks, copyrights, and other allied rights (e.g., royalties) and shall comply with international conventions in that regard. Article 4 The successor States shall take such action as may be required by general principles of law and otherwise appropriate to ensure the effective application of the principles set out in this Annex, such as concluding bilateral agreements and notifying their courts and other competent authorities. Article 5 Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Annex shall derogate from the provisions of bilateral agreements concluded on the same matter between successor States which, in particular areas, may be conclusive as between those States. Volume 2262, 1-40296 Article 6 Domestic legislation of each successor State concerning dwelling rights (\"stanarsko pravo/stanovanjska pravica cTaHapcko npaBo\") shall be applied equally to persons who were citizens of the SFRY and who had such rights, without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status. Article 7 All natural and legal persons from each successor State shall, on the basis of reciproc- ity, have the same right of access to the courts, administrative tribunals and agencies, of that State and of the other successor States for the purpose of realising the protection of their rights. Article 8 The foregoing provisions of this Annex are without prejudice to any guarantees of non- discrimination related to private property and acquired rights that exist in the domestic leg- islation of the successor States.

B. The Parties shall ensure adequate and effective protection for intellectual property created or furnished under this Agreement. II. Copyrights The Parties shall take appropriate steps to secure copyright to works created under this Agreement in accordance with their respective national laws, except as otherwise specifi- cally agreed. The following provisions shall apply to copyright protection for works created under this Agreement: 1. Except as otherwise agreed, each Party is entitled to a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license under a copyright, secured in accordance with the national laws of ei- ther Party, to translate, reproduce, publish, and distribute published scientific, technical, and medical works in its own territory, with the right to grant sublicenses in its territory in accordance with this Party's laws and practices. Any such copyrighted work shall indicate the names of all persons who participated in the joint work. Either Party is entitled to a li- cense in third countries upon request. 2. Rights to other copyrighted works (such as computer software) shall be allocated in the same manner as for inventions, as set forth in Article 111, Paragraphs B -E of this Annex. A Party receiving rights pursuant to this provision to copyrighted works which embody business-confidential information shall protect such information in accordance with Article IV of this Annex. III. Inventions A. For purposes of this Annex, \"invention\" means any invention made in the course of cooperation under this Agreement which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under the laws of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or any third country. An invention \"made\" means one conceived or for which an application for patent or other title of protection has been filed or which has otherwise been reduced to practice. B. Between a Party and its nationals, the ownership of rights and interests in inventions will be determined in accordance with that Party's national laws and practices. Volume 2262, 1-40299 C. As between the parties, unless otherwise specifically agreed, the Parties shall take appropriate steps to implement the following: 1. If the invention is made in the course of a program of cooperative activity that in- volves only the transfer or exchange of information between the Parties, such as by joint meetings, seminars, or the exchange of technical reports or papers, unless otherwise specif- ically agreed: a. The Party whose personnel make the invention (\"the Inventing Party\") has the right to obtain all rights and interests in the invention in all countries in accordance with applicable national laws of such countries; b. In any country where the Inventing Party decides not to obtain such rights and inter- ests, the other Party has the right to do so. 2. If the invention is made by personnel of one Party (\"the Assigning Party\") while as- signed to the other Party (\"the Receiving Party\") in the course of a program of cooperative activity that involves only the visit or exchange of scientific and technical personnel: a. The Receiving Party has the right to obtain all rights and interests in the invention in all countries in accordance with applicable national laws of such countries; b. In any country where the Receiving Party decides not to obtain such rights and in- terests, the Assigning Party has the right to do so. D. For other forms of cooperation, such as joint research projects with an agreed scope of work, each Party has the right to obtain all rights and interests in its own country in any invention made as a result of such cooperation, whereas the Party in whose country the in- vention was made has first option to secure legal protection of that invention in third coun- tries, as well as the right to license or transfer such rights and interests in third countries.

E. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an invention is of a type for which exclusive rights are available under the laws of the Party but not of the other Party, the Party whose laws provide for exclusive rights shall be entitled to all rights in all countries which provide rights to such invention. The Parties may agree, however, to a different allocation of rights to such invention. F. The Parties shall disclose to one another inventions made in the course of programs of cooperative activities and furnish to one another any documentation and information necessary to enable them to secure any rights to which they may be entitled. The Parties may ask one another in writing to delay publication or public disclosure of such documen- tation or information for the purpose of protecting their respective rights related to inven- tions. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, such restriction shall not exceed a period of six months from the date of communication of such information. Communication shall be through the Executive Agents. Volume 2262, 1-40299 IV. Business-confidential information A. The Parties do not expect to furnish to one another or create business-confidential information in the course of cooperation under this Agreement.

C. Any information to be protected as \"business-confidential information\" shall be ap- propriately identified by the Party furnishing such information or asserting that it is to be protected, except as otherwise provided in the Parties' laws, regulations, and administrative practices. Subject to the aforesaid laws, regulations and administrative practices, unidenti- fied information will be assumed not to be information to be protected, except that a Party to the cooperative activity may notify the other Party in writing, within a reasonable period of time after furnishing or transferring such information, that such information is business- confidential under the laws, regulations, and administrative practices of its country. Such information will thereafter be protected in accordance with paragraph A above. V. Other types of intellectual property \"Other types of intellectual property\" means any intellectual property protectable in ac- cordance with the laws, regulations and administrative practices of either Party or any third country other than those described in Articles II and III above and includes, for example, scientific discoveries, maskworks and trademarks. Rights to other types of intellectual property shall be determined in the same manner as for inventions, as set forth in Article III, Paragraphs B -D of this Annex. If an intellectual property is one for which protection is available under the laws of one Party but not of the other Party, the Party whose laws provide such protection shall be entitled to all rights in all countries which protect such in- tellectual property.

I have the honor to propose that our Governments consider further restrictions on Pacific salmon fishing in our respective zones if such re- strictions are deemed appropriate. I have the honor to propose that the above-mentioned ban not apply to scientific re- search vessels conducting surveys under national and international scientific research pro- grams, or to vessels flying the flag of the United States of America or the Russian Federation conducting salmon scouting in the U.S. and Russian zones, respectively, for the specific purpose of monitoring the abundance and the migration of Pacific salmon originat- ing in the waters of the United States of America and the Russian Federation. I propose fur- ther that our Governments exchange information regarding the number of research and scouting vessels operating in accordance with their respective national research programs, as well as the amount of salmon caught by such vessels. Volume 2262, 1-40301 I have the honor to propose that our Governments establish a joint scientific program on anadromous stocks which would facilitate, among other things, exchanges of biological samples and information on salmon fishing catch and effort, stock abundance, escapement and migration by stock, the status of feeding areas and prey species, salmon enhancement programs, fishery regulation, conservation and management plans, and other data that may be mutually agreed upon. The objective of the joint program would be to assess possible interceptions of North American and Russian origin salmon. I wish to further propose that the joint program also study the effect of artificially produced salmon on the ecosystem of the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. The joint program would arrange for exchanges of scientific personnel. I have the honor to propose that meetings of our respective specialists be held annually in the United States of America and the Russian Federation, alternately, in order to coordi- nate efforts and monitor the implementation of this agreement. If these proposals are acceptable to your Government, I have the further honor to pro- pose that this note and Your Excellency's note in reply shall constitute an agreement be- tween our two Governments, which shall enter into force on the date of Your Excellency's note in reply. Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. For the Acting Secretary of State: DAVID A. COLSON His Excellency Vladimir P.

Recognizing that this developmental objective can be promoted through investment insurance (including reinsurance), loans and guaranties which are backed in whole or in part by the credit or public monies of the United States of America and administered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (\"OPIC\"), an agency of the United States of America, (or pursuant to arrangements between OPIC and private companies), the parties signatory hereto agree as follows: Article 1 As used in this Agreement, the term \"Coverage\" shall refer to any investment insur- ance, reinsurance or guaranty which is issued in accordance with this Agreement by OPIC, by any successor agency of the United States of America or by any other entity or group of entities, pursuant to arrangements with OPIC or any successor agency. In this Agreement, the term \"Issuer\" shall refer to OPIC and any such successor agency, entity or group of en- tities to the extent of their interest as insurer, reinsurer, or guarantor in any Coverage, whether as a party or successor to a contract providing Coverage or as an agent for the ad- ministration of Coverage. Article 2 The procedures set forth in this Agreement shall apply only with respect to Coverage relating to projects or activities registered with or otherwise approved by the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria. In the case of Coverage relating to projects with respect to which the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria, or any agency or political subdivision thereof, has entered into a contract involving the provision of goods or services or invited tenders on such a contract, the required registration or approval shall be conclusively pre- sumed to exist. Article 3 (a) If the Issuer makes payment to any party under Coverage, the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria shall, subject to the provisions of Article 4 hereof, recognize the trans- fer to the Issuer of any currency, credits, assets, or investment on account of which payment under such Coverage is made as well as the succession of the Issuer to any right, title, claim, privilege, or cause of action existing, or which may arise, in connection there with. Volume 2262, 1-40304 (b) The Issuer shall assert no greater rights than those of the transferring party under Coverage with respect to any interests transferred or succeeded to under this Article. Noth- ing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the Government of the United States of Amer- ica, distinct from any rights it may have as Issuer, or the right of the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria to assert a claim under international law in their sovereign capacities. (c) The Issuer shall not be subject to regulation under the laws of the Republic of Bul- garia applicable to insurance or financial organizations; provided, that, in the event the Is- suer is not an agency of the Government of the United States of America or another public international financial institution, (i) the activities are directly related to the implementation of this Agreement; and (ii) such activities are not performed through branches located in the Republic of Bul- garia of privately owned entities or groups of entities. (d) Interest and fees on loans made or guaranteed by the Issuer shall be exempt from tax in the Republic of Bulgaria. The Issuer shall not be subject to tax in the Republic of Bul- garia for any transfer or succession which occurs pursuant to Article 3(a) hereof. Tax treat- ment of other transactions conducted by the Issuer in the Republic of Bulgaria shall be determined by applicable law or specific agreement between the Issuer and appropriate fis- cal authorities of the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria. Article 4 To the extent that the laws of the Republic of Bulgaria partially or wholly invalidate or prohibit the acquisition from a party under Coverage of any interest in any property within the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria by the Issuer, the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria shall permit such party and the Issuer to make appropriate arrangements pursuant to which such interests are transferred to an entity permitted to own such interest under the laws of the Republic of Bulgaria. Article 5 (a) Amounts in the lawful currency of the Republic of Bulgaria, including credits thereof, acquired by the Issuer by virtue of such Coverage shall be accorded treatment by the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria no less favorable as to use and conversion than the treatment to which such funds would be entitled in the hands of the party under Cover- age. (b) Such amounts and credits may be transferred by the Issuer to any person or eco- nomic, government, intergovernmental or other entity and upon such transfer shall be free- ly available for use by such person or entity in the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria; provided, however, that a transfer to such person or entity is not prohibited ordinarily by Bulgarian law. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, the provisions of this Article 5 also shall apply to any amounts and credits in the lawful currency of the Republic of Bulgaria which may be accepted by the Issuer in settlement of obligations with respect to loans made by the Issuer for projects in the Republic of Bulgaria. Volume 2262, 1-40304 Article 6 (a) Any dispute between the Government of the United States of America and the Gov- ernment of the Republic of Bulgaria regarding the interpretation of this Agreement or which, in the opinion of one of the Governments, involves a question of public international law arising out of any project or activity for which Coverage has been issued shall be resolved, insofar as possible, through negotiations between the two Governments. If, at the end of six months following the request for negotiations, the two Governments have not resolved the dispute by agreement, the dispute, including the question of whether such dis- pute presents a question of public international law, shall be submitted, at the ini- tiative of either Government, to an arbitral tribunal for resolution in accordance with Article 6(b). (b) The arbitral tribunal for resolution of disputes pursuant to Article 6(a) shall be es- tablished and function as follows: (i) Each Government shall appoint one arbitrator; these two arbitrators shall designate a president by common agreement who shall be a citizen of a third state and whose appoint- ment shall be subject to acceptance by the two Governments. The arbitrators shall be ap- pointed within three months and the president within six months of the dates of receipt of either Government's request for arbitration. If the appointments are not made within the foregoing time limits, either Government may, in the absence of any other agreement, re- quest the Secretary-General of the International Center for the Settlement of Disputes to make the necessary appointment or appointments, and both Governments agree to accept such appointment or appointments. (ii) The arbitral tribunal shall base its decision on the applicable principles and rules of public international law. The arbitral tribunal shall decide by majority vote. Its decision shall be final and binding. (iii) During the proceedings, each of the Governments shall pay the expense of its ar- bitrator and of its representation in the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal shall be paid in equal parts by the two Governments. In its award, the arbitral tribunal may, in its discre- tion, reallocate expenses and costs between the two Governments. (iv) In all other matters, the arbitral tribunal shall regulate its own procedures. Article 7 This Agreement shall continue in force until terminated by either party hereto. Either party may terminate the Agreement at any time after 10 years from the date on which it en- ters into force; provided that at least six months's prior notice of termination has been given through diplomatic channels. In such event, the provisions of the Agreement with respect to Coverage issued while the Agreement was in force shall remain in force for the duration of such Coverage, but in no case longer than twenty years after the termination of the Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date on which the Government of the Re- public of Bulgaria communicates to the Government of the United States of America that Volume 2262, 1-40304 its constitutional or other legal requirements with regard to this Agreement have been ful- filled. In witness whereof, the undersigned, duly authorized thereto by their respective Gov- ernments, have signed this Agreement.

In the course of these discussions, attention was drawn to past misunderstandings in regard to the enforcement of Italian fiscal regulations, the amenability to taxation of the earnings of the aforesaid employees, as well as to the possible applicability of the NATO Agreement on the Status of Forces and other NATO agreements. Your government has also pointed out that on the basis of Italian legislation it is pos- sible to solve the problem of satisfaction of the arrearages which should have been levied before 1 January 1982 on the subject earnings directly with the Government of the United States of America and that it is also possible to devise suitable procedures to effect such satisfaction. Moreover, your government has indicated that it is disposed to exclude from consider- ation as taxable personal income salaries paid by the U.S. Navy in Italy to the above em- ployees from 1974 through 1981 and that it shall give instructions that all enforcement actions pending against said employees be dropped once suitable financial arrangements are devised. This being said, and in order to obviate the difficult situation of the workers, in recog- nition of the vital importance of NATO activities in Italy, and in order to ensure better con- ditions for Italo-American relations in defense matters, I have the honor to propose the following, without any prejudice to the rights and the position of my government in regard to the present situation: 1) The Government of the United States of America agrees to contribute to the solution of the problem in the manner set out in this agreement. 2) The Government of the United States of America agrees to waive present or future amounts owed by the Italian Government for \"residual value\" up to an amount of U.S. dol- lars 7,377,301. 3) If, after ten years from the date this agreement enters into force, the amounts waived as mentioned in paragraph 2) do not amount to U.S. dollars 7,377,301, the U.S. and Italian governments-upon the request of either government-will mutually agree on the procedure for satisfaction by the Government of the United States of America of any eventual residual amount due at that time. Volume 2262, 1-40308 4) In consideration of the commitment undertaken by the Government of the United States of America, the Italian Government accepts the aforementioned U.S. Government commitment and considers it as satisfying the obligations regarding the taxes referred to in this agreement and agrees immediately to drop all assessment or collection procedures re- lated to these taxes. 5) Upon the request of either government, the countries concerned, through their respective offices, will from time to time establish the implementation procedures for the provisions set out in paragraphs 2) and 3) of this agreement. 6) The parties expressly agree that this agreement will be provisionally applied with reference to the commitment undertaken by the Italian Government in paragraph 4). To this effect the Italian Government on the date of the exchange of notes will immediately drop all activities related to collection procedures pending at the same date in regard to the afore- mentioned taxes. If the foregoing is acceptable to your government, I have the honor to propose that this note, written in English, and your note in reply, written in Italian, shall constitute an agree- ment between our two governments that will enter into force when the parties have notified each other that their respective necessary internal procedures have been completed' and will be retroactively effective as of 1 January 1982. Further, I have the honor to propose that this agreement remain in effect until both governments decide that it should be terminated. Kindly accept the renewed expression of my highest esteem.

Liner Cargo Carriage Forecasting and Review a. The Designated Representatives shall meet annually to determine the anticipated carriage by U.S.-flag carriers in the bilateral liner trade. Such forecasting shall be predicat- ed upon an empirical determination of the availability of U.S.-flag carriers at competitive prices, terms, and conditions and the expected performance of U.S. carriers in an open, competitive environment. b. A review of the preceding year's forecast shall be held annually to compare actual carriage of liner cargo with the anticipated carriage. If, during the period covered by the forecast, U.S. flag participation falls below the forecast level, the two Parties shall consult to determine the barriers and/or impediments or other factors that explain the difference. The two Parties shall seek to identify means to remove any identified barriers or impedi- ments. c. Both Parties shall regularly review practices associated with the government control of cargo in the bilateral trade and seek means of measuring such control. d. The Designated Representatives shall make available all information or data neces- sary to determine whether the carriage of bilateral cargo was consistent with the forecast and provide any information necessary in examining alleged discriminatory practices. 3. Bulk Cargo Any Soviet Government controlled bulk cargoes moving in the bilateral trade shall be chartered at world market rates, terms and conditions. Any available U.S.-flag vessel meet- ing such rates, terms and conditions shall be chartered. 4. Cross-trading The vessels of each party shall be permitted to use the ports of the other Party subject to Articles 2 and 3 of this Agreement, to participate in ocean transportation between such ports of the other Party and third countries (cross-trading), subject to the following condi- tions: a. Each party shall encourage or, if permitted by its laws, require its vessel operators to offer ocean transportation services solely on commercial terms and conditions including rates, frequency, availability, and other conditions of service, and shall similarly encourage Volume 2262, 1-40310 participation in relevant intercarrier agreements so as to afford the operators of the other Party adequate opportunity, in accordance with customary business practice, to compete for participation in the trade at a reasonable profit. b. Each Party shall notify the other Party of the initiation of, and any subsequent sub- stantial change in, the participation of its liner vessels in any cross-trade of the other, espe- cially changes in capacity and service levels. c. A Party that believes that its interests are being adversely affected by the cross-trad- ing activities of the vessels of the other Party, in either its liner or bulk cross-trades, or in its access to the trades of the other Party may request consultations in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement. If resolution of the dispute cannot be reached, that Party may impose limitations upon the cross-trading activities of the other Party. 5. Implementation a. Each Party shall designate a representative for implementation of the principles and rules of this Annex, the representative of the United States being the Maritime Adminis- tration. Department of Transportation, and the representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics being the Ministry of Merchant Marine. Each Party shall authorize its representative to take action under its laws and procedures, and in consultation with the Designated Representative of the other Party, to implement this Annex. b. The Parties further agree that the Designated Representatives shall: (i) Meet at least annually for a comprehensive review of the movement of bilateral car- go, including the formulation of forecasts; and for such other purposes related to the Agree- ment as may be desirable, including consulting with a view to improving the ability of carriers of either Party to conduct maritime and related business in the territory of the other party; (ii) Engage in such consultations, exchange such information and take such action as may be necessary to ensure effective implementation of this Agreement; (iii) Resolve any other problems in the implementation of this Agreement. 6. Commercial Arrangements a. The Parties recognize that, pursuant to their respective laws or policies, carriers un- der their flags may enter into commercial arrangements for the service and stabilization of the trade between them which shall not unduly prejudice the rights of third-flag carriers to compete for the carriage of cargo between the territories of both Parties. b. Such commercial arrangements shall not relieve the Parties of their obligations un- der this Agreement. c. Both Parties recognize the desirability of their national flag carriers entering into co- operative working arrangements in accord with the laws and regulations of each Party.

Article L Higher education 1. The Parties will annually exchange from each side: a. For long-term advanced research: At least 40 advanced researchers, instructors and professors for study and scholarly research in the arts, humanities and the social, natural and technical sciences for periods from one semester to one academic year. The Parties will strive for an increase in the number of exchange participants to 100 in 1989 and to 200 in 1990-1991. For the purposes of accounting, two stays of one semester shall be equivalent to one stay of one academic year. b. For short term advanced research: At least ten professors, instructors and advanced researchers to conduct scholarly research in the humanities and the social, natural and tech- nical sciences for periods between two and five months. The Parties will strive for an in- crease in the number of exchange participants to 50 in 1989 and to 100 in 1990-1991. c. At least 30 language teachers and two leaders from universities and other institutions of higher learning to participate in summer courses of two months to improve their compe- tence in the language of the receiving side. The Parties will strive for an increase in the number of exchange participants to 50. d. Parallel to the exchanges specified under paragraphs a and b above, the Parties note and encourage the exchange of scholars between the American Council of Learned Societ- ies and the Academy of Sciences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which involves advanced research for up to 60 person-months from each side each academic year. e. The Parties affirm the reciprocal nature of these programs in which the sending side chooses, at its own discretion, candidates for participation in the exchanges, and the receiv- ing side, at its discretion, agrees to the placement of these candidates. In this connection, the Parties note that, in the carrying out of the exchanges specified under paragraphs la, b and d above, and following the existing practice of mutually accept- able participation in the exchanges of representatives in the humanities, social sciences, and natural and technical sciences, they will strive, as in the past, for such mutually acceptable participation of scholars in the above-mentioned fields. f. In the practical implementation of these programs, the Parties will mutually strive to broaden exchanges in areas of mutual interest and to not diminish currently achieved levels. Volume 2262, 1-40311 2. In accordance with the wishes of the sending and receiving sides, the Parties will exchange annually at least 25 professors and specialists from universities or other institu- tions of higher learning from each side. Both sides will include at least 8 lecturers in the fields of language and literature, history, culture, economics, and/or the social sci- ences. Exchanges will be for periods of one to ten months, normally corresponding to the receiving side's academic calendar, to lecture and, as time permits, to teach and conduct re- search at universities and other institutions of higher learning. The Parties note that this exchange has involved lecturers from a broad range of fields, corresponding to the needs of both sending and receiving sides. In this connection, the Par- ties will strive to maintain this mutually beneficial exchange in the various fields of the nat- ural and technical sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. 3. The Parties will exchange during the period of this Program at least three delegations of specialists in the field of higher, secondary and primary education consisting of up to five persons from each side for periods of two to three weeks each, including two to three days of seminars with specialists of the other country. The subjects of the seminars and itinerar- ies of the visits will be agreed upon with the appropriate organizations of the two Parties. 4. The Parties will encourage the conclusion of arrangements for direct ex- changes between universities and other institutions of higher learning of the two countries for the purpose of study, research, lecturing, and participating in seminars. These exchang- es would take place outside the exchange quotas mentioned in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 above. They will be the subject of direct separate agreements concluded between the universities or institutes concerned, and the conditions for the exchanges listed above will not necessar- ily apply to them. The Parties will assist development of exchange of students for short-term travel (2-3 weeks) for the purpose of familiarization and discussions among young people. The Parties encourage the expansion of these exchanges into broader academic cooperation between the paired universities. 5. The Parties will facilitate the exchange of Soviet and American undergraduates for study in the institutes of higher education of both countries for a period from one academic semester to one academic year for the study of disciplines in selected specializations and improvement of language skills. In this connection, the Parties note that, in the carrying out of these exchanges, and following the existing practice of mutually acceptable participation in the exchanges of representatives in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, they will strive, as in the past, for such mutually acceptable participation of students in the above-mentioned fields. The Parties will strive to exchange up to 100 undergraduates from each country in 1989 in such exchanges and in 1990-1991 at least 150 undergraduates from each country. The Parties will receive, together with each group of undergraduates, a leader from the sending side under conditions agreed upon in specific agreements. 6. The Parties agree that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America will continue the practice of studying the English language in the Union of So- viet Socialist Republics and Russian in the United States of America. In order to realize these goals, the Parties will encourage the expansion of exchange programs for language Volume 2262, 1-40311 and area studies, whereby at least 50 Soviet and 50 American undergraduates can study the English and Russian languages respectively, obtaining academic credits for the study. Sponsoring organizations will provide written certification to the participants for the cours- es they have taken during the exchange. The Parties will conduct other agreed upon measures for the encouragement of lan- guage study. 7.
