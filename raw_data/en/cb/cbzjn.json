Let's find out the reasons behind this condition. What Causes Broken Capillaries Or Blood Vessels On Your Face? The exact cause of broken capillaries or telangiectasia is unclear. However, several factors may cause broken capillaries. They include: - Aging (blood vessels are weakened with age) - Skin trauma (inflammation or bruises may cause broken capillaries) - Genetic factors [Excessive exposure to the sun](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-to-protect-your-skin-from-sun-damage/)and wind (damages the blood vessels and bring them close to the surface) - Side effects of medicines (may enlarge the venules) - Side effects of topical or oral corticosteroidsi [X]A class of anti-inflammatory medicines used to provide relief from rashes, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and other conditions. (result in skin thinning and broken capillaries) - Pregnancy (increased pressure on venules) - Surgery - Acne - Excessive alcohol consumption (affects blood flow and causes liver issues) During pregnancy, your chances of getting broken capillaries increase. The growing fetus puts excessive pressure on the blood vessels, breaking them. Hormonal therapy or taking birth control pills may also cause broken capillaries on the face. You may also inherit the condition. It is called Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). Five genes are suspected to cause this issue, and only three out of five could be identified. Only 1% of people inherit this condition. Apart from these causes, telangiectasia or broken capillaries can be a symptom of underlying health conditions. These include: - Bloom Syndrome (a rare genetic condition. Broken capillaries are one of its symptoms.) - Liver disease - Nevus Flammeus or Port-Wine Stain (large patch of skin discoloration caused by capillary malformation) - Ataxia Telangiectasia (a rare inherited condition of body systems) - Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome or Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia - Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome (a condition combining Port-Wine Syndrome and varicose veins) - Rosacea (a chronic skin condition) - Xeroderma Pigmentosum (a rare condition that increases UV sensitivity of the skin and eyes) - Spider Angioma (the blood vessels get collected closer to the skin surface) - Sturge-Weber syndrome (a disorder affecting the nervous system) Conditions that affect your connective tissues may also cause broken capillaries. They include lupusi [X]A chronic, autoimmune medical disorder that leads to a hyperactive immune system that attacks healthy tissues and organs. , dermatomyositisi [X]A rare long-term inflammatory medical condition marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive violet or dusky red skin rash. , and sclerodermai [X]A rare chronic autoimmune disease that involves hardening and tightening of the skin and other body tissues. .
