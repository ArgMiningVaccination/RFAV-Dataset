This interest includes pharmacological studies to assess the efficacy and benefits of lipid-lowering drug therapy including trials that examine the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on cardiovascular disease events and the progression of atherosclerosis. As the director of The Maria and Alando J. Ballantyne, M.D., Atherosclerosis Clinical Research Laboratory, which serves as the core laboratory for the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, Dr. Ballantyne is studying whether genetic variants in combination with novel biomarkers might be useful in identifying individuals at high risk for cardiometabolic disease and diabetes. Genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are being used to identify novel molecules that are increased with atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, and cardiometabolic disease. In addition, his group is studying new approaches to the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases with the goal of developing personalized diet, lifestyle, and pharmacotherapy based on the genetic profile and clinical phenotype assessed by proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging.
