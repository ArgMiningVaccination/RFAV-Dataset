INTRODUCTION Aerospace Mediciue arrd Biologj, is a continuing bibliography which, by means of peri- odic supplements, serves as a current abstracting and announcement medium for references on this subject. The publication is compiled through the cooperative efforts of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and NASA Scientific and Technical Infor- mation Facility. It assembles, within the covers of a single bibliographic announcement, groups of references that were formerly announced in separate journals, and provides a con- venient compilation for medical and biological scientists. Additional background details for this publication can be found in the first issue, NASA SP-7011, which was published in July, 1964. Supplements are identified by the same number followed by two additional digits in parentheses. In its subject coverage, Aerospace Medicine and Biology concentrates on the biological, physiological, psychological, and environmental effects to which man is subjected during and following simulated or actual flight in the earth's atmosphere or in interplanetary space. References describing similar effects on biological organisms of lower order are also in- cluded. Such related topics as sanitary problems, pharmacology, toxicology, safety and survival, life support systems, exobiology, and personnel factors receive appropriate atfen- tion. In general, emphasis will be placed on applied research, but references to fundamen- tal studies and theoretical principles related-to experimental development also qualify for inclusion. Each entry consists of a standard citation accompanied by its abstract in the following order: a. NASA entries identified by their STAR accession numbers(N70-10000 series), and b. AIAA entries identified by their IAA accession numbers (A70-10000 series). The abstracts have been reproduced from those appearing in STAR and IAA. This pro- cedure, adopted in the interests of economy and speed, has introduced some variation in size, style, and intensity of type.

These systems have been designed to provide information related to the following: The velocity of the erythrocytes as they cross the alveolar capillary net to determine contact time between oxygen and hemoglobin: The orientation of the erythrocytes in the capillaries to determine the intracapillary diffusion distance of molecular oxygen: The site of action of the hypoxic vasopressor response; and The quantitation of the oxyhemoglobin gradient along the microcirculation to determine (a) the boundaries of the oxygen uptake process. (b) the shape of the uptake curve, and (c) how the curve and boundaries are affected by stress. e.g. hypoxemia or exercise. Author (TAB) N70-15545# Dunlap and Associates. Inc.. Santa Monica. Calif.

Houlihan 17 Sep. 1969 the research on the effects of hyperbaric medicine completed at the Pennsylvania State University. The progression of this research involved studies on renal function, blood flow. adrenocortical and sympatho-adreno-medullary (SAM) activity. The blood flow alterations indicated increased adrenocortical function. The adrenocortical function reaches its highest level just prior to death from oxygen poisoning. The excretion of catecholamine indicated an altered metabolism of epinephrine. It is noted that oxygen at high pressure results in the production of adrenochrome, adrenolutin and derivatives. These compounds are highly reactive and can account for the manifestations of oxygen toxicity. Author (TAB) N70-15568*# Naval Aerospace Medical Inst.. Pensacola, Fla. OFF-VERTICAL ROTATION: A CONVENIENT PRECISE MEANS OF EXPOSING THE PASSIVE HUMAN SUWECTTO A ROTATING LINEAR ACCELERATION VECTOR Ashton Graybiel and Earl F. Miller, 11 17 Oct. 1969 14 p refs (NASA Order R-93: NASA Order T-81633) (NASA-CR-107622; CSCLO6S The study of disturbances of vestibular origin comprising the clinical picture of motion sickness and resulting from exposure to a rotating linear acceleration vector was carried out with 'a rotating chair modified to permit tilting up to 20 deg away from the upright. While rotating at constant velocity at a given angle of tilt, the subject was thus exposed to a continual change with reference to the gravitational upright. Stepwise increases in the level of stress were effected through automatic programming of the chair's angular velocity. Subjects were exposed until either they experienced mild motion sickness (the predetermined endpoint), or the cut-off point, a terminal velocity of 25 rpm at 10 deg tilt. was reached. Of the group of 100 healthy men, 88 reached the predetermined endpoint; all but 5 of the remainder reached it only when the angle of tilt was increased to 20 deg. Thus, the scores ranked 95 subjects in terms of their susceptibility 70 this unusual gravitoinertial force environment and demonstrated that 5 were highly insusceptible. The accuracy and flexibility of the method should prove it to be useful, not only as a provocative test of susceptibility to motion sickness but also a means of studying the symptomatology and underlying mechanisms.

ADAPTATION TO CORlOLlS ACCELERATIONS: ITS TRANSFER TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF ROTATION AS A FUNCTION OF INTERVENING ACTIVITY AT ZERO VELOCITY James T. Reason and Ashton Graybiel 5 Aug. 1969 21 p to Coriolis accelerations, acquired through controlled head movements in a room rotating in one direction, transfers to the opposite direction as a consequence of the stimulus mode during an intervening period at zero velocity. Under one experimental condition the subjects continued to make the same head movements during this period as those used to acquire perrotational adaptation, thus evoking postrotational responses opposite in sign but similar in quality to those experienced during the initial period of rotation. Under the other condition mechanical restraints were applied to the head and torso for an equivalent period of time. Subjects who performed head motions during the intervening static period were able to adapt more rapidly to the second (opposite) direction of rotation than to the first. In addition, the intervening activity appeared to confer some immunity to motion sickness during the second direction of rotation. Postrotational effects following the second direction of rotation were less severe and of shorter duration than those experienced following the initial period of rotation. The opposite findings were obtained for those subjects who remained immobilized during the intervening period at zero velocity. Author N70-15635*# National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Sullivan Dec. 1969 36 p refs (Contract NAS9-9188) (NASA-CR-102076) Avail: CFSTI CSCL O6R Numerous reports attest to the fact that humans experience a prodromal response following exposure to ionizing radiation, either as a result of radiation-therapy treatments or as a consequence of accidental exposure. It is entirely possible that the magnitude of the doses which in some cases cause this response would be encountered during space missions, whether of an intra- or an extra-vehicular nature. Although such a response is uncomfortable and distressing in our normal environment, it could conceivably result in death in a hostile environment. While being merely temporarily incapacitating on earth, in a high performance and reliability situation such incapacitation, however temporary. might lead to an aborted, an incompleted, or even a fatal mission. Furthermore, the consequences of the vomit reflex in a weightless environment are not yet known. It may be that the consequences of such vomiting would be longer than of a temporary nature, such that the performance of the individual might be seriously reduced or terminated altogether.

Joseph Ulehla and Joseph Halpern Oct. 1969 29 concerned with information integration has led to conflicting results with respect to the predictions of the integration model of the theory of signal detectability. One difference between auditory or conceptual tasks and visual involves the presence or absence of within-trial stimulus variability. The present experiment employed stimuli in motion which were non-redundant. The results were similar to those obtained with the more static. redundant visual stimuli. It was suggested that the integration model might be invalid in that it predicts integration superior to what Ss are capable of and that the frequent good fit of data to theory is an artifact based on orienting properties of the first stimulus presentation.

Beat-by-beat pulse rate curves and certain vectocardiographs were also obtained from the stored recorded data. Blood pressure readings (cuff) obtained approximately 30 seconds after termination of each vibration are shown on the pulse rate curves. Inspection of the orthogonal scaler electrocardiograms considered together shows them to be generally acceptable for clinical evaluation. No evidence of extrasystoles was detected in the recordings. Changes in the subjects' electrocardiograms which occurred during vibration did not persist after vibration nor did the changes suggest undue stress or any other than normal physiological variations. There seems to be no consistent pattern of pulse rate change for either subject when vibrated. Author N70-15797*# Pittsburgh Univ.. Pa. I<nowledge Avatlabillty Systems Center.

An attempt was made to determine the mechanism underlying changes in altitude tolerance of animals. Experiments were carried out on 143 albino rats in a heat and pressure chamber. Animal tolerance to rapidly increasing hypoxia was increased in a helium-oxygen atmosphere at 21 C. This is associated with an increased cooling effect of a helium-oxygen mixture due to the higher thermal conductivity of helium in comparison with nitrogen. In an argon-oxygen environment the animal tolerance to rapidly increasing hypoxia remained unaffected in comparison with that in a sea level atmosphere.

A mathematical model was formulated which adequately reproduces changes in oxygen tension in cerebral tissues of animals in response to variations in atmospheric oxygen content. The linear part of the model is a third order differential equation. The nonlinear part takes into account a marked change of p02 in cerebral tissues during ascent of the animals to altitudes greater than 8.000 m. The model was used in studying p02 variations during a rapid ascent of animals to simulated altitudes of 2.000, 4.000. 6.000. 8,000. 10,000, 14.000 and 16.000 m.

The pattern of variations in the reaction remained unaltered when the animals were given aminazin (chlorpromazine), although it developed at a lower level. Administration of scopolamine greatly inhibited the reaction beginning at altitudes of 3,000 to 4.000 m. Throughout the exposure to hypoxia up to an altitude of 6.000 m, the avoidance reaction was alleviated and arrested at an altitude of 7.000 m, Injection of scopolamine alleviated the reaction to a greater extent whereas an aminazin injection slightly reduced it. particularly at altitudes greater than 6.000 m.

Radiations of 180 keV X rays and Cp60 gamma rays were used as standards. Analysis of the data revealed that an exposure of animal organisms and microorganisms to high energy protons does not result in the appearance of essentially new qualitative radiobiological effects typical only of proton radiations. However. reactions have also been recorded in which known symptoms of radiation disease develop in different quantitative proportions. Study of the quantitative characteristics of the proton effect on biological objects has indicated that the coefficients of relative biological effectiveness of protons differ insignificantly. their energy changing by more than one order of magnitude (from 650 to 50 MeVO, amounting to 1 within this energy range. The coefficients of relative biological effectiveness increase slightly if the proton energy falls below 50 MeV.

The number of antibody producing cells in the spleen and hemolysin titers of test animals was dependent on exposure time. For example, two and nine day exposures of rats prior to ~mmunization resulted in an inhibition of antibody formation. that is, a decrease in cellular and humoral indices: a 45 day exposure improved ihe antibody producing function. A longer exposure (90 days) caused repeated inhibition of antibody production. Author N70-36090# Joint Publications Research Service. Washington, D.C.

Their electrocardiograms were recorded, phases of systole of the left ventricle were determined and vector analysis of the ECG in the frontal plane was performed. The prolonged bedrest led to orthostatic intolerance of the test subjects which involved intolerance in an erect position, tachycardia. symptoms of ischemia in the subendo- and subepicardiac layers of the myocardium and a decrease in myocardial contractability. Vector analysis of the ECG demonstrated that ECG changes occurred due to a reduction of the blood supply to the myocardium, which when aggravated by altered coronary vessels. may bring about organic disturbances of the myocardiunl.

Exhaled air was collected in a Douglas bag at rest and during the fifth-tenth minute of orthostasis. In the statistical analysis of the results all the subjects were divided into two groups: first, individuals for whom the tolerance to tests before and after immersion was good; second, individuals for whom symptoms of orthostatic collapse were noted in one of the preceding or current experiments. Two experimental subgroups were defined in each of the groups: (a) prior to immersion and b) after IMMERSION' The 02 utilization factor. the ratio of 02 consumption (in ml/min) to the minute volume of ventilation (in liters/min), was computed as an index of lung ventilation efficiency.

Johnson Jun. 1969 48 p report is the third in a series on the electronic analog simulation of the human temperature regulation system. The objectives of the present work were (1) to redesign the original computer circuit to improve reliability; (2) to extend the computer capability to enable simulation of response to solar (or other point source) incident heat load; (3) to compute human survival time for a subject confronted with high heat loads and high ambient humidity. The first objective was realized by substituting electronic for mechanical elements in the computer. Equations relating body heat load to incident solar radiation were developed and the simulating circuits designed and constructed to realize the second objective. The third objective, simulation of hot, humid environments. resulted in the recommerdation that exposure to high temperature (45-50C) should be limited to 0.5 hours, with progressively greater exposure time permissible at lower environmental temperatures.

Padmos and D. van Norren 1969 refs Submitted for publication (IZF-1969-19: TDCK-54370) Avail: CFSTl The human ERG response to 40 Hz stimulus was measured using a synchronous detection technique. Thus it was possible to record spectral sens~tivity quickly and easily. Experiments are reported to demonstrate that only the cones contributed to the total response. Adaptation to a red background of 3.7 x 10 to the 4th power troland and a blue background of 2.2 x 10 to the 4th power troland caused selective depression of spectral sensitivity. Neither green nor white adaptation altered the spectral sensitivity. The results of parallel experiments on a protanope indicated that no change in spectral sensitivity took place during exposure to intense colored backgrounds. Measurements of the influence of chromatic adaptation were also performed using a psychophysical threshold criterion for sensitivity. The results are in close agreement with the ERG data. A study of the recovery of the.response after exposure to colored backgrounds indicated that the site of chromatic adaptation is not confined to the receptors' pigments.

Avail: CFSTl CSCL 6/19 Despite recent scientific and technological gains in realizing the goal of manned underwater stations. there has been a singular lack of research data on defining the sleep requirements of man-in-the-sea. Behaviorally, sleep loss and sleep disturbances produce lapses in performance and impairment of short-term memory. wither of which may endanger the mission or the life of the entire crew of an ocean floor habitat. Interpersonal difficulties may also arise as a result of undesirable personality changes caused by sleep disturbances, thereby weakening the very root of the miniature society of the ocean floor habitat. Research efforts must be spurred on to learn: (1) whether man as an aquanaut may develop new kinds of sleep requirements which differ from those of land based man, (2) whether man may also develop serious sleep disturbances, whether we can speciiy the optimal physical and psychological conditions for mans recuperation from fatigue by adequate sleep in the underwater habitat. TEKTITE I, a nitrogen saturation diving experiment is used to ilhstrate an attempt to obtain the data necessary to define sleep requirements of man-in-the-sea.

Research in this area is reviewed. Most contemporary models of time evaluation incorporate a-specific pulse counter mechanisms to account for the internal clock by which tlme is measured subjectively. The rate of this internal clock is thought to be influenced by the information processed by the subject. In this paper an alternative formulation is defended: time evaluation is a cognitive reconstruction of contents of the interval. The latter formulation avoids the unnecessary assumtpion of the former. It explains the same phenomena equally well, while moreover it can handle various matters that offer difficulties to models stated in terms of clock mechanisms.

Excessive presence of needed elements produces stmilar, effects. Adapted plants can concentrate chemical elements to different extents as a result of natural selection based on physiological variability of the plants without apparent morpho~ogical changes.

A method for interpretation of audiometric data is presented. An explanation of the various audiometric contours is given. followed by a step-by-step procedure for analyzing the pure-tone audiogram. In addition, recommendations are made concerning the handling of patients whose audiograms are not within normal limits.

Concentrated spent medium appeared to have no effect on the gas consumption by the organism. Concentrated spent medium was found to be nontoxic to cells of H. eutropha. It was also discovered that these cells were unable to utilize concentrated spent medium as a substrate. Other experiments showed that resting cells were affected by a change in pH.

EFFECTS OF HIGH-ALTITUDE ACCLIMATIZATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ISOLATED RAT VENTRICULAR STRIP James Joseph Mc Grath acclimatization to the hypoxia of high altitude was demonstrated using the isolated right ventricular strip preparation. Male, albino rats were acclimatized in a barometric chamber for 15 days. The chamber was programmed for 20 hours per day at a simulated altitude of 22,500 feet and 4 hours per day at sea level. At the end of the acclimatization period, strips of myocardium were removed from the right ventricle and immersed in a buffered Ringer's solution which was aerated with an aerobic gas mixture. The strips were stimulated electrically, and developed and resting tensions were continuously recorded. The tissue level adaptatiion investigated in these experiments is explained as an increased capacity for anaerobic glycolysis induced by chronic exposure to the hypoxia of high altitude. Evidence supporting this viewpoint is seen in the increased anoxic tolerance of the preparations in the presence of glucose as well as in the change in performance of the high-altitude preparatiions after iodacetate treatment.

This dissertation proposes such a learning machine. The basic learning situation is specified by a set of six postulates and the machine MAXINE is developed to learn in this situation. MAXINE is designed to have some of the qualities of human decision making: while being able to change its mind in the face of new evidence. it is reluctant to alter firmly held opinions. The learning ability of this machine is tested by placing it in situations of varying degrees of complexity, including those which are deterministic and stochastic. Convergence of the proposed learning algorithm for the deterministic case is proved. Author (TAB) N70-16486*# Aztec School of Languages. Inc.. Maynard. Mass. Research Translation Div.

The skull is modeled as a closed, thin elastic shell fllled with a homogeneous, elastic fluid. Attention is restricted to impacts having a long duration relative to the traverse time of a stress or pressure wave. For collision with both blunt and pointed objects, parameter studies demonstrate the behavior of the pressure distribution when changes are made in fluid and shell density and elastic modulus in five different shell shapes. Negative gage pressures are found to be of larger magnitude in cases of a pointed collision-surface than in blunt impacts, in frontal collision models than in side-on models. in rigid shells than in shells of less rigid materials, and in denser contents than in those less dense.

Transferrin is an iron chelating protein which, in higher animals and man, is important in the transport of iron in blood serum. Mossbauer spectroscopy offers a sensitive way to examine the chemical environment of the Fe-57 in iron containing compounds. The micelle of ferritin was the object of Mossbauer investigation. The Mossbauer spectra of ferritin and four crystalline modifications of FeOOH indicate that the Fe-57 nucleus of these compounds interacts with a magnetic field and simultaneously with an electric field gradient tensor (efg), when these compounds are below their Neel temperature.

Objectives of present research are to determine the particular retinal layers and cellular elements whose functions are altered or activated by low dose pulses of ionizing rays to account for the fact that people can see X-rays on their product. A second goal was the application of ionizing rsys to the measurement of retinal scotomata. Athird goal was to test the effectiveness of physiologically equated X-ray and visual stimuli in a simple eye. It was then proposed that findings from the above objections would be incorporated into a generalized theoretical structure which would account for visual excitation by ionizing rays and would also shed knowledge on the excitability of central nervous tissue by ionizing rays using the retina as a model tissue. Progress towards these goals consisted of development of tools for identification of those retinal cells that are excited by X-rays. NSA N70-16862# Texas Univ., Austin. Electronics Research Center.

Vogt 9 Sep. 1969 is the purpose of this paper to present an evaluation of a method of QRS discrimination by defining the accuracy in terms of variation of time error. Indication of reliability of detection may be determined by observing the number of false detections and missed beats. Time error in noisy electrocardiograms is determined by adding noise electronically to an essentially noise-free electrocardiogram which serves as reference for timing of events. The results indicate that electrical activity of the heart may be detected visually under noise-free condirions with an accuracy approximating plus or minus 1 millisecond. With the addition of excessive noise. time variance in the order of 15 milliseconds is observed. False recognitions and missed beats also occur.

Results. and Evaluations 1969 p 1 - of the electrical activity of the brain and the development of electroencephalography (EEG) in Europe and the United States are briefly reviewed. It is emphasized that still little is known about the source, nature, and regulation of alpha and other spontaneous rhythms, and that careful attention should be paid to identifying the basic problems and goals in these areas as progress continues into the field of average evoked potentials (AEP) and other slow potential shifts. Important factors related to the locus, variability and components of the AEP are touched upon, as well as the possible source of the potentials (generators) and the condition that modify and control them (modulators and regulators). Finally, mention is made of the spatio-temporal distribution of potentials. the relationship between attention and AEP, specific and nonspecific sensory systems, and central and peripheral factors.

Ames Res. Center Average Evoked Potentials: Methods. Results, and Evaluations 1969 p potentials (ERP) are identified as the general class of potentials that display stable time relationships to a definable reference event. Five classes of ERP are treated: (1) sensory (evoked) potentials; (2) motor potentials; (3) long latency potentials related to complex psychological variables; (4) steady potential shifts; and (5) extracra~ial potentials. In many experimental situations, more than one class of ERP is present concurrently, and the investigator must distinguish between them in analyzing the electrophysiological correlations of specific psychological variables. Althouge characterization of specific ERP is aided by the temporal. spatial, and morphological features related to experimental handling of these variables, complete understanding of the effects of psychological manipulations or the descriptive aspects of the ERP has not yet been achieved. This discussion therefore represents a tentative treatment of the highly complex phenomena, including some approaches to defining the underlying brain processes and their psycnological counterparts.

Of particular interest was identification of homologous components among modalities and differentiation between modality specific components and nonspecific components. Problems encountered in the experlnients are treated in detail, including those tnvolved with recording techniques, choice of stimulus intensity, and data analysis procedures. Use of bipolar recording is suggested, and a common nonscalp reference location is indicated. Requirements for uniformity of measurement and component nomenclature are also emphasized. The problem of sources of variability in AEQ's is treated, with the conclusion that this is intimately related to contamination of scalp-recorded AEP's by extracerebral generators. On the basis of homogeneity in focus and distribution between subjects, AEP components that appear to be of cerebral neurogenic origin are designated, and electrode locations for the three modalities that are likely to record them without serlous distortions are suggested.

Phenomena with a latency of 200 to 300 milliseconds and a duration of 0.5 second or mole are included. Research reveals that CNV develops in human subjects as the electrical response of the brain to a conditional signal that an operant response is to be made after a delay. A wide variety of stlmulus and response paradigms result in the CNV, even when verbal or Ideational responses are made instead of overt motor aFThe CNV varies in amplitude, shape, latency, consistency, and distribution over the head in different subjects. Evidence that eye movements do not account for the CNV is conclusive, it is similar when iecorded from surface or intracranial electrodes, has a different spatial distribution than the eye field; and has been reported in a subject with eye glasses when no electroocular fleld was present. Finally, mention is made of the generator for motor potential as another possible internal brain source for the CNV. A.C.R. N70-16881*# National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Results, and Evaluations 1969 p analysis techniques used most often in AEP research, based on direct measurement from X-Y plots, are identified as: (1) visual inspection of the AEP records to detect similarities and differences; and (2) measurement of peak-to-peak amplitudes and latencies of various evoked response components. Drawbacks inherent in using visual inspection as an analysis technique are treated, and the advantages of having the necessary information made directly available from a computer are indicated. It is further suggested that cost factors indicate that most laboratories will be equipped with general-purpose computers, in place of specialpurpose averagers, in the near future, and that these will allow extremely detailed analysis of AEP data matrices. In this connection, spec~fic problems encountered in applying statistical analysis to such matrices are reviewed and some recently proposed technioues described. A.C.R.

Center Average Evoked Potentials: Methods, Results. and Evaluations 1969 p 237 Some problems in the psychological domain of particular relevance to evoked potential experiments that have been completed or are presently in progress are outlined. The importance of obtaining data in the same set of trials for all three domains-those in the area of stimuli and physiology as well as the psychological factors is emphasized. An example of contributions made by this approach to interpreting uncertainty experiments is given, and problems that arise in attempts to compare psychological and physiological data are treated. Additional difficulties encountered by the requirement to repeat stimuli in the averaging method are also mentioned. It is suggested that the spatial averaging which is a byproduct of scalp recording makes it highly desirable that the behavioral design of experiments be as simple as possible. Finally, the need for a more systematic approach to specifying and defining the terms and constructs involved in reporting evoked potential correlates is stressed. A.C.R.

Results. and Evaluations 1969 p 299 diagnostic procedures based on averated evoked potential (AEP) 1s discussed. and it is emphasized that such methods are primarily useful in cases where verbal communication is not possible or practical. Three such situations are identified: (1) When neurological factors, such as lesions or lack ~f maturity. block verbal exchange. (2) When psychological factors, such as cultural difference or mendacity, interfere. (3) When the state being tested is not accessible to introspective report. and its behavioral consequences are most inexpensively tapped by evoked potential measures. Specific application of AEP methods to sensory, neurological disease. and intelligence testing is treated, as well as usefulness in psychiatric diagnosis. It is concluded that except for diagnosis of deafness in infants. AEP still remains primarily a research technique. although promise of its clinical utility is increasing steadily. A.C.R.

The stimulus intensity and stimulus pitch were presented from the same randomized presentation schedules during both studies, and with equal presentation probabilities for all four stimuli in each schedule. The most consistent differences in evoked potentials were found in experiments where both efforts were difficult; they appeared most reliably at delays of 200 to 500 msec after stimulus presentation. in the latency range preceding the motor acts used for reporting the required decisions. They could not, however, be accounted for by potentials time-locked to the.response acts themselves. Furthermore, the differences appeared in data that were averaged among subjects and across sessions. It is suggested that the differences recorded during loudness discrimination tests and those recorded from the same stimuli during pitch discriminations tests may hold clues to task-related variations in late steps of underlying physiological mechanisms, by which the stimuli are evaluated and the required decisions made.

Center Average Evoked Potentials: Methods. Results, and Evaluations 1969 p were used to show that trial-to-trial fluctuations in contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude are correlated with the correctness of observer's responses and therefore, with his sensitivity. Computer-averaged CNV's and evoked potentials were plotted from 10 trials of four possible types for each observer. The averaged CNV amplitude was larger on those trials where signals were detected correctly (yes/signal) than when the signals were missed (no/signal). The waveshape of the CNV following the signal also depended upon the stimulus-response outcome. An electrophysiological correlate of signal detection. more striking than the CNV, was a long-latency positlve wave (labelled P300) in the potential evoked at the vertex by the signal. The findings support the contention that CNV's can appear during purely sensory tasks, as well as in preparation for motor activity. It is emphasized that the results are preliminary. and further study into the CNV and P300 behav~or phenomena is recommended. A.C.R. N70-16887*# California Univ.. Los Angeles. Dept. of Psychiatry.

DYNAMICS OF VERTEX EVOKED POTENTIALS: THE RM BRAIN FUNCTION Manfred Clynes In NASA. Ames Res. Center Average Evoked Potentials: Methods, Results, and Evaluations 1969 p vertex evoked potentials were studied with primary emphasis on testing the ability of the central nervous system to differentiate between states of sensory rest and motion. Evidence is provided that the nonspecific, vertex evoked potentials function in a manner based on rein control which allows the organism to distinguish between a state of motion and one of rest for various sensory variables. This response occurs predominantly when a sensory variable leaves the state of rest and enters the state of motion; this is defined as the rest-motion (R-M) function. Once in the state of motion, further changes within this state do not generally elicit another R-M reaction. The R-M function is non-linear and may be represented dynamically by two unidirectiona rate-sensitive channels added in a full wave rectification manner, followed by a low level saturating element that triggers the response through another differentiation and rectification.

The phenomena are probably a reflection of trace processes in the visual analyzer induced by intensive photic st~muli. Author (TAB) N70-17199# Aerospace Medical Div. Aeromedical Research Lab.

Hanly Oct. 20 p refs (AD-696103: ARL-TR-69-12) Avail: CFSTI Pargyline-HCI is of interest a possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of decaborane intoxication. Oecaborane in low doses is known to have severe disruptive effects upon instrumental behavior. Pargyline, in order to qualify as a therapeutic agent. must not itself lead to severe behavioral disruption. In this study each of five monkeys was given a single intraperitoneal injection of buffered suspension of pargyline. the dosage being equivalent to 45 mg pargyline-HCl/kg of body weight. Their behavior was evaluated for four days following injection on a concurrent free-operant avoidance schedule with two superimposed discriminated avoidance tasks. In no cases were pargyline-induced changes in behavior of sufficient magnitude to affect the efficiency of shock avoidance. It is concluded that the effect of pargyline on these behaviors is quantitatively slight in comparison to the effects of decaborane recorded in the literature, and that behavioral disruption from pargyline itself need not be the major consideration in decisions relevant to the therapeutic use of pargyline-HCI for decaborane induced behavioral intoxication.

MINIMUM THRESHOLDS FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO FLOW OF ALTERNATING ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH THE HUMAN BODY AT POWER-TRANSMISSION FREQUENCIES Interim Report John C. Keesey and Frank S. Letcher 3 Sep CFSTl CSCL 6/19 A survey was made of all available information about electric shock to humans. including children, at power-transmission frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz. Reliable quantitative data at these frequencies are available for three measurable physiological responses to electrical stimulation: (1 ) the perception of electric current flow. (2) uncontrollable muscular contraction. and (3) death. Relevant threshold conditions for response to minimum currents include the size and resistance of the body and the duration and pathway of current flow. One percent of the general populace can perceive from 0.1 to 0.5 mA of 50-60 Hz current, depending upon the type of hand contact made with an electrically-energized circuit. A safety threshold of 5 mA, recommended for the general population including children, is based upon the conclusion that any 50-60 Hz current in excess of the release threshold of an individual should be regarded as hazardous and potentially lethal. Ninety-nine percent of adult male workers should be able to release 9 mA of 50-60 Hz current. Voltages calculated from reliable experimental data on effective currents and expected resistances are lower than voltages generally recommended to be safe. Author (TAB) N70-17308*# Sandia Corp..

AN ANALYTICAL BASIS FOR ASSAYING BURIED BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATION Interim Report Robert C. Kline and Phillip L. Randolph Jan. 1969 36 p a procedure for assaying biological contamination buried or embedded in spacecraft materials, is presented. The procedure required the controlled fracture of representative samples of a material whose buried loading is of interest. Each sample is tested for biological contamination on the totality of surfaces exposed as a result of the fracturing process. The basic datum or observation consists of the proportion of samples which yield contamination upon culturing. Conventional statistical techniques, combined with an assumed relation between the mean concentration of organisms buried within the material and the observed datum. produce an upper bound estimate for the unknown mean concentration. expressed to any prescribed level of confidence. In principle. the \"conservativeness\" of the resulting estimate is directly related to the sample size and the amount of surface area exposed by fracture: as the sample size and/or exposed area increasek) the difference between the estimate and the unknown mean load tends to decrease.

Two hypotheses relating (a) personality factors to the difficulty of the discrimination task and (b) cognitive factors to the complexity of the test situation were put forward. Both hypotheses receive some confirmation from the experimental data although the effect of these psychological factors is small. From the results of factor analysis it appears that each colour test in this population is measuring an attribute spe- cific to itself, from which it can be inferred that no one test can be regarded as a substitute for another.

EFFECTS OF ADAPTATION ON VISUAL DETECTION Hienz Albert Gaylord (Ph.D. Thesis) 1968 75 HC $4.00/Microfilm $3.00 Order No 69-61 45 Some of the relevant factors which influence visual detection during partial dark adaptation were investigated using a ten-category rating procedure. Following partial dark adaptation each of the three human observers were light adapted with a 200 ms exposure to a 5.4 X 10 to the 6th power Td. circular 25 deg flash subsequent to which a 20 ms circular 5 deg test flash was randomly presented at successive six second Intervals over a four minute period of dark adaptation. Analysis of the data showed that a rating procedure within a signal detection context provided a sensitive measure of the changes in visual sensitivity that occurred during dark adaptation and permitted the construction of dark adaptation curves for multiple detection criteria. The first minute of daik adaptation was found to be mediated primarily by cone mechanisms on the basis of the steep slopes and breaks noted in the 50% and 60% curves as well as the fact that the positive afterimage had a chromatic appearance during this tlme period.

The influence of leakage on oxygen generation is most complex, because hydrogen obtained from decomposition of oxygen or nitrogen-containing chem~cals may be used in a reactor for carbon dloxlde reduction. This necessitates expand~ng the scope of the AILSS oxygen generation tradeoff to include generation of oxygen and nitrogen for leakage makeup. Because oxygen generation is the only AILSS area where leakage rate has a drastic impact on concept selection, it is considered at greater length than other topics in this discussion. This subject is also of particular interest. because some of the alternatives described may form the basis for earlier life support systems. Conclusions regarding subsystem selection are indicated in figures which show the influence of leakage rate on AILSS concept selections. Here and throughout this report, \"leakage rate\" denotes total vehicle leakage to spate, including both oxygen and nitrogen. In general, the leakage range considered is sufficient to determine the equivalent weight impact for any reasonable leakage rate. Author N70-17919# Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson AFB.

Massof Aug 1969 energy levels of ruby laser radiat~on on electrophysrological, psychophys~cal and anatomrcal measures were examined. Spectral sensrtivity tests, using an ERG analysis, demonstrated prolonged laser effects on rhesus and mangabey monkeys. At 15-months post-exposure for the rhesus monkey (0.8Jlsq cm), the amplitude of the b wave was depressed at all wavelengths except 420 nm. At one-year post-laser exposure for the mangabey monkey (0.2J/sq cm), the amplitude of the b wave was depressed at all wavelengths and the amplitude of the b wave as a function of intensity at 570 nm was depressed by about 20 percent at high intensity and not affected at low intensity. Also. the thlrd oscillatory potential remained absent. An ERG analysis of the Rayleigh match demonstrated that rhesus monkeys have normal color visron (A.Q. = 1.01, that squirrel monkeys are protanomalous (A.Q. = 0.305), and that owl monkeys are monochromatic (A.Q. = infinity). Following laser exposure of two rhesus monkeys the match was unbalanced in favor of the green component. indicating a protanomalous response. Behavioral studies of two rhesus monkeys, one laser exposed at 1.8J/sq cm and one exposed at O.lBJ/sq cm, demonstrated a reduction in sensitivity at all but two spectral points for the monkey exposed at 1.8J/sq cm and no significant change in the sensitivity of the monkey exposed at 0.18J/sq cm. The latter monkey did, however, show a marked change in the shape of the function indicating an anomalous finding. Author (TAB) N70-18001 National Lending Library for Science and Technology.

These structural changes are divided into two groups. To one group belong those changes which are directly connected with the regenerative cycle of the generation of the action potential, and to the other group are assigned the slow changes which accumulate from impulse to impulse associated with metabolic changes. It is concluded that during the generation of the action potential, a reversible decrease occurs in the llght flow which passed through the nerve fiber and the crossed polarizer and analyzer, and the decrease of the light flow occurs simultaneously with the action potential and repeats its shape. This phenomenon is related to the change of the parameters of the axon under the action of an electrical field. F.O.S. N70-18211# Defence Research Board. Ottawa (Ontario).

Two theories that explain the disorders produced under these circumstances are explained and their validity analyzed on the basis of test data. The first theory, that of nitrogen narcosis. states that nitrogen has a depressive action on the central nervous system sufficient to cause the symptoms. The second hypothesis is based on the fact that compression of the respiratory mixture increases its specific gravity to a hypoventilation. The hypercapnia resulting from this causes the effects that have been noted. From the test data, the conclusion is reached that depth intoxication is not caused by retention of carbon dioxide, although any hypercapnia occurring during the dive will aggravate the disorders It is thought instead that the intoxication is caused as a result of some yet unknown mechanism triggered by breathing neutral gas under pressure. Strong conclusions were reached that no narcosis is involved. A C.R. N70-18226 Pittsburgh Univ., Pa. EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL LIGHTING ON PARADOXICAL SLEEP IN THE ALBINO RAT Ross Fishman 1968 99 Avail: Univ. Microfilms: HC $5.00/Microfilm $3.00 Order No. 69-6396 The possible effects of changes in environmenial lighting conditions on sleep states were studied in adult male albino rats. EEG records were used to determlne time spent in pardoxical sleep (PS) and slow-wave sleep ISWS). In a pilot study the effects of continuous darkness and continuous light were determined. Following exposure to a L-12, D-12 light cycle (baseline), rats were exposed to either three weeks of continuous darkness or continuous light. The results indicated that rats in continuous darkness showed increases in minutes of PS and SWS and of PS as a percentage of total sleep (%PS). Rats in continuous light showed decrease. in PS and %PS with little overall change in SWS. These results lend support to the proposition that under appropriate cond~tlonr* \"llghts-ofi\" fac~lttates the appearance of PS while paradoxccal sleep appearance D~ssert Institutes Bethesda. Md.

Young pigs aged 3 to 4 months were observed for more than 20 complete 24-hour cycles resulting in data on the electrical activity of the cortex and the states of sleep, a comparative study of hypnogranis and actograms, and observations of somato-vegetative manifestations during sleep. Two states of sleep are demonstrated in the growing pig: (1) Rapid sleep phases are characterized by rapid ocular movements wlth facial clonus and rapid cortical activity (8 to 10%) and comprise about 20% of total sleep time, approximating the values In man. (2) Slow sleep phases are accompanied by slow cortical waves and splndles (45% of the 24 hours). The organization of the phases of rest and activity and of alternations of wakefulness and sleep occur in relation to meals The polygraphic study reveals an extreme complexity in the evolution of spontaneous niotillty. cardiac frequency, and respiratory rhythm durlng a 24-hour period.

Recordings involved three parameters: ocular movements. electroencephalography, and muscle state. Analysis of the tracings indicates: (1) At the onset of their illness, schizophrenics do not show any major quantitative abnormality of rapid eye movements. (2) The schizophrenics were insensitive to the first night effect which did play a role in the sleep of the control subjects. (3) Dormition was more variable in the schizophrenics than in the normal subjects and its mean value was higher in the shizophrenics. (4) The time of appearance of the first rapid eye movements was hlgher, and the mean duration longer. In the normal subjects. (5) In the chronic hallucinatory psychosis subjects (all insomniacs), there was less rapid eye movement suggesting a relationship between insomnia, the poverty of rapid eye movernents, and the symptomatic richness of the illness.

The resistance of microorganisms placed in a metegrite was investigated during proton irradiation of 600 MeV. The experiments show that even such radiation resistant microorganisms as Micrococcus radiodurans perish under the effect of the radiation dosage used. If it is assumed that microorganisms may have been found in portions near the surface of bodies ancestral to meteors, they could not have survived due to high energy cosmic and solar radiation. These conclusions are confirmed by the total absence of microorganisms in the lunar rocks and soil brought back to earth by the Apollo 11 missions. R.B.

Discussion of various methods of evaluating heat exchanges between man and his environment, which may occur owing to incidents or accidents in the course of operation of airct-aft and may involve decompt-ession or immersion. Heat exchange may take place by evaporation, radiation, conduction, and convection. The measure- ment of the combined coefficient of thermal transfer by two ot- more of these methods by direct calorimetry is considered, as well as measurement of this coefficient by fractional calorimetry. It is considered that the heat transfer coefficient for the combined effects of radiation and convection can be utilized in numerous practical situations and makes it possible to calculate the thermal load imposed on a man. However, it must be remembered that the coefficient describes temperature changes, without taking account of the important action of the vapol- pressure of ambient water on the efficacity of sudation.

Consideration of the factors which form and organize the professional personality of an aviator. Motivation arises in infancy, even though it may not be consciously thought of in adolescence. Among the origins of motivation is the Icarus complex; in adoles- cence this is transfortned into the desire to pilot. Factors al-ising during the training period, such as identification with the instructor, are important in shaping the professional personality. Thet-e appears to be an impel-ceptible transition toward professional maturity which does not depend on administrative limitations. An aviator is considered to be essentially a !realist, more intel-ested in technique than in abstractions. Success in the business is not possible unless, coupled to the strong motivation, there is a rigorous cotitrol of the entire emotional life. F.R.L.

A70.16045 * COMPUTER STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF SMALL NON- LlNEARlTlES IN THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. V. C. Rideout and J. B. Sims (Wisconsin, University, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Madison, Wis.). Mathematical Biosciences, vol. 4, 1969, p. 41 1-426. 7 refs. Grant No. NGR-50-002-083. Application of a mathematical approach based on perturbation techniques to show that a two-circuit scheme can be used to represent separately linear events and distortion products in a slightly nonlinear system. When this scheme is applied to a nonlinear transmission line with slight quadratic nonlinearities in its series inductance and shunt capacitance, it can be shown that cancellation of nonlinear harmonic production is possible for certain combina- tions of the nonlinear L and C. It can also be shown that the amplitude of harmonics produced by nonlinearities distributed along the line may increase with distance along the line away from the sinusoidal input. The second of these results suggested that some of the distal pressure peaking observed in the arterial system may be related to this result. The perturbation, or two-circuit, scheme was therefore used as a basis for a hybrid computer simulation study of the effects of small nonlinearities in the human arterial system.This study shows that the rather small nonlinearities in arterial wall compliances can contribute to the pressure peaking in the smaller arteries by an amount comparable to that resulting from character- istic impedance tapering effects in the purely linear case.

Research supported by the U.S. Social and Rehabilitation Service and NSF. Time delays between ocular movement and retinal input have been studied by yoking a visual target to eye movement by experimental programming methods and a laboratory real-time computer system. The subject's task was to manipulate this eye movement-yoked target cursor to perform either compensatory or pursuit eye tracking. The computer thereafter was programmed to store input eye-movement signals and read them out after a delay interval to control the yoked visual target cursor controlled by the eye m'ovements. Delay time constants of 0.1 sec significantly affected tracking. Eye movement-retinal feedback delays appeared to have an even more marked effect on positive pursuit eye tracking.

Research supported by the Michigan Heart Association, the American Medical Association, and the Detroit General Hospital Research Corp.; PHs Grant No. HE-05043. Glucagon, 300 micrograms per minute, was infused intra- venously over 15 min in 27 subjects. The patients were divided into three groups-patients without heart disease, patients with artel-io- sclerotic heart disease, and patients with congestive heart failure. Hemodynamic measurements included observations on myocardial blood flow using bolus injections of Rb-84 and a coincidence counting technique. I\\ilyocarclial oxygen consumption was determined after coronary sinus intubation in nine of the 27 patients. Significant increases were noted in heart rate, mean al-tel-ial pressure, tension-time indexltninute, and left ventricular work. Myocal-dial bloocl flow incl-eased significantly while ~nyocarclial oxygen extraction remained constant suggesting that the augmenta- tion in blood flow was sufficient to meet the increased myocardial demands for oxygen. The effects of ylucagon on the coronary circi~lation resemble that of isopl-oierenol rather than norepinephrine without, however, leading to the production of arrhythmias seen with these catecholamines.

His bundle electrograms were recorded, and the interval from the pacing impulse to the His bundle electrogram (P-H interval) was used as a measure of A-V conduction and the interval from the His bundle electrogram to the S wave (H-S interval) was used as a measure of intraventric~llar conduction. Propranolol significantly prolonged the P-H interval in every patient at all paced heart rates, and it had no effect on the H-S interval. G.R.

St~tdy of the localization of the site of myocardial scarring in 130 subjects who has one or more sets of high-frequency, orthogonal ECG (XYZ) leads and direct-writing standard ECG leads recorded ante mortem. In each case careful clissection of the heart was performed. Correlations were made between the site of infraction and the occut-rence of notching in specific high-frequency ECG leads. Postero-inferior infarctions tended to express themselves with a predominance of increased notching in the Y lead, while anterior infarction manifested dominantly in the X lead. This was true in intramural as well as transmural lesions. G.R. A70-16105 ON-LINE ANALYSIS OF THE EXERCISE ELECTROCARDIO- GRAM. L. T. Sheffield, J. H. Holt, F. M. Lester, D. V. Conroy, and T. J.

We have introduced a new measurement of the ECG, the negative ST (-ST) integral, which, while unfamiliar to the eye, is readily performed by computer. A -ST integral value of 7.5 microvolt-sec during exercise served to separate a normal group from a group with angina pectoris. Strenuous exercise was often necessary to elicit positive responses in diseased subjects, and the graded exercise test was found well-suited for this purpose. Use of a computer program as an investigative instrument in its own right, rather than as a means of duplicating classical human measurements, shows promise for improving the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. (Author) OPEN-LOOP PORTABLE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM LIGHTENS CREW LOAD. Danlel L. Curtis (Litton Systems, Inc., Space Sclences Center). Space/Aeronautics, vol. 52, Dec. 1969, p. 68, 69,71. Description of an open-loop portable life support system which contains a \"breathing vest\" that is worn within the space suit. Weighing slightly over 8 oz, the breathing vest is responsible for reducing by a factor of four the amount of oxygen required to flow to the helmet. The new life-support system promises to perform fully as well as a more conventional, closed-loop system, although welghing only half as much and occupying only half as much space. G R.

Space/Aeronautics, vol. 52, Dec. 1969, p. 71-73. Description of a fluid thermal actuator that is the temperature sensor and prime mover for an active thermal controller in a spacecraft. The device consists of three major components: the drive system, including bellows and associated hardware to transform fluid expansion to linear motion; the adjustment system; and the reservoir. The design uses silicon fluid, because of its constancy of expansion coefficient and low vapor pressure. G.R. A70-16126 * CONCURRENT RESPONDING WlTH FIXED RELATIVE RATE OF REINFORCEMENT. D. Alan Stubbs (New York University, New York, N.Y.) and Stanley S. Pliskoff (Maine, University, Orono, Me.).

Study of the response of pigeons to concurrent variable-interval reinforcement schedules. Responding by pigeons on one key of a two-ltey chamber alternated the color of the second key, on which responding produced food according to a variable-interval schedule of reinforcement. It is found that relative overall rates of !responding and relative times in the presence of a key color approximated the proportions of reinforcements obtained in the presence of that color, while relative local rates of responding changed little. Changeover rate is found to decrease as the proportions diverged from 0.50, and also to decrease as the delay 01- fixed ratio was increased. M.M. A70-16127 REINFORCEMENT OF EYE MOVEMENT WlTH CONCURRENT SCHEDULES. Stephen R. Schroeder (North Carolina, University, Chapel Hill, N.C.) and James G. Holland (Pittsburgh, University, Pittsburgh, Pa.). Journal of t/~e Experimel~tal Analysis of Behavior, vol. 12, Nov. 1969, p. 897-903. 18 refs. Experimental investigation in which human macrosaccadic eye movements to two areas of a four-dial display were conditioned by concurrent variable-interval schedules of signals. Reinforcers were delivered to the two right-hand dials on one schecule and to the two left-hand dials on another, independent schedule. The results obtained suggest that for stimuli whose critical components are arranged spatially, conditioned eye movements play an important part in selective stimulus control. M.M. A70-16128 * EFFECTS OF d-AMPHETAMINE ON OBSERVING BEHAVIOR IN THE SQUIRREL MONKEY. Fogle C. Clark (North Carolina, University, Chapel Hill, N.C.). Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, vol. 12, Nov. 1969, p. 977-987.21 refs. NIH Grants No. 1 R03 MH-14401; No. MH-05863; Grant No. NGR-15-002-001. Experimental investigation in which four squirrel monkeys were trained to press a lever, which produced stimuli indicating availability or nonavailability of reinforcement for pushing a key. Food reinforcements were available for the key response at random intervals with an average rate of 1 per min. The results obtained are discussed in relation to previous findings regarding effects of amphetamines on operant behavior and on observing and monitoring performance. M.M. A70-16129 THE SENSE OF TIME: AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY OF ITS MECHANISMS IN MAN. Josef Holubir. (Translation of Casovq Smysl, Prague, State Medical Publishing House, 1961 J Cambridqe, Mass., MIT Press, 1969. 134 p. 343 refs. $5.95. Experimental studies of the psychological and physiological aspects of the sense of time are reviewed. The existence of a special sense of time is demonstrated by examples of temporally con- ditioned reflexes and the navigation of birds. A brief review of the psychological literature on the sense of time is presented, taking into account the methods of investigation, principal concepts, significance of the different factors, and the basis of the sense of time. The working hypothesis based on the biological and brain rhythms is formulated, and its experimental verification is discussed. The effect of flicker or photic stimulation on the EEG (i.e., photic driving or photic entrainment) in combination with temporal conditioning is studied in 29 human subjects. It is found that the intervals of temporally conditioned galvanic skin responses can be specifically altered by flicker in a manner that is determined by the relation between the rates of flicker and the frequency of the alpha rhythm.

Marianne Frankenhaeuser, Birgitta Post, Bo Nordheden, and Hans Sjoeberg (Stockholm, University, Psychological Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, Apr. 1969, p. 343-349.14 refs. Research supported by the Swedisch Medical Research Council and Swedish Council for Social Science Research. Catecholamine excretion, cardiovascular functions, and sub- jective effort were studied in ten healthy male subjects in a control condition and in three experimental sessions. In each session, five successive 6-min tests of either 150, 450, or 750 kpmlmin were - performed on a bicycle ergometer. Catecholamine-excretion rates remained close to control levels at the lower work loads, while the highest load induced a significant increase in both adrenaline and noradrenaline output. Heart rate, systolic pressure, and subjective effort increased consistently with increasing work load. (Author) A70-16142 DISPLACEMENT OF APPARENT STRAIGHT AHEAD AS AN AFTEREFFECT OF DEVIATION OF THE EYES FROM NORMAL POSITION. John N. Park (George Washington University, Human Resources Research Office, Washington, D.C.). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, Apr. 1969, p. 591 -597. 15 refs. Army-supported research. Testing of Helmholtz's proprioceptive theory of apparent visual direction which predicts a displacement of egocentric straight ahead as an aftereffect of deviation of the eyes from normal frontal position. The 91 subjects selected from a line of lighted disks the one which appeared to be straight ahead; they fixated the eyes for 30 sec on a point in the line of disks which was either 30 deg from frontal position or at the most extreme position attainable. The subjects then returned the eyes to what seemed to be frontal position and selected the disk which appeared to 'be straight ahead. Ocular deviation produced as an aftereffect a displacement of apparent straight ahead which had a mean value of 3.12 deg and occurred in the same meridian and in the same direction as the eyes had been deviated. The amount of displacement was not significantly affected by the degrees of prior ocular deviation or by the orientation of the line of disks. M.M. A70-16143 EFFECT OF REMOVING ACCELERATION CUES ON SENSING VEHICULAR VELOCITY. Santo Salvatore (U. S. Public Health Service, Injury Control Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, Apr. 1969, p. 615-622. 9 refs. Study of the effect of varying the sensory input (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, tactile and vestibular cues) on the perception of traveled velocity. A movie technique was developed to remove the effects of acceleration and to present controlled frontal and peripheral visual cues. The range of velocities was extended to 100 mph. It is concluded that the removal of the force sense feedback mechanism acts to reduce the ratio of the estimated to the presented or actual range of velocities. There is direct variation of the absolute error with velocity as the range is extended to include high speeds. Sensing of velocity based on peripheral visual stimulation appears to be more resistant to experimental artifacts, such as monotonous environment, fatigue, and the beta effect-apparent movement produced by an increase of illumination of part of the field-than frontal visual stimulation.

IN: DISPLAYS FOR COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS; NATO, AGARD, SYMPOSIUM, MUNICH, WEST GERMANY, NOVEMBER 11-14,1966, PROCEEDINGS. (A70-16176 05-1 1 ) Edited by I. J. Services (AGARD Conference Proceedings No. 23); Pelham, N.Y., Circa Publications, Inc., 1969, p. 1-13; Discussion, S. Sherr, p. 12, 13. 12 refs. Description of command cohtrol systems in a way which characterizes them as problem-solving information processing systems. Systematic methods of identifying information require- ments during the evolutionary development of a command control system are presented. Emphasis is placed on the necessity of specifying information requirements prior to the design of man-dis- play partnerships. Five questions relating to display justification in command control are discussed within functional analysis and design techniques as they have been successfully applied to command control system development. The conclusion is reached that an orderly process of identifying data-display requirements facilitates the meaningful introduction of man-display partnerships into on- going control activities.

Safe Engineering, vol. 3, Nov. 1969, p. 13-16. Evaluation of some life-support systems and equipment items exposed to the combat environment. The combat use of aircrew life-support systems and equipment items in Southeast Asia during 1967 and 1968 is reviewed on the basis of data reported from 131 combat ejections. The distribution of combat ejections with respect to altitude, indicated airspeed, kind of landing terrain, survival duration time, and primary and secondary rescue aid is tabulated and discussed, as well as data on injury severity, causes of fatalities, causes of major injuries, difficulties encountered during and after ejection, helmet loss or retention, and kinds of survival equipment failure. The analysis is intended to provide the all-important basis for systems improvement programs. M.V.E. A70-16325 USE OF HELICOPTERS IN THE CARE OF EMERGENCY PATIENTS (DER ElNSATZ VON HUBSCHRAUBERN BE1 DER VERSORGUNG VON Abteilung fur Anasthesiologie, Ulm, West Germany). Wehrmedizinische Monatsschrift, vol. 13, Dec. 1969, p. 329-334. In German. From August 1967 to January 1969, the usefulness of heli- copters in rescue service was studied by test flights. The results of these tests are presented. An extension and reorganization of the rescue car system (i.e., the right vehicles with the correct crew at the right location) is postulated. The second step is the formation of rescue centers with the possibility of a coordinated use of heli- copters. It is suggested that further investigation and planning concerning the rescue service with helicopters be coordinated in a federal ministry. (Author) A70.16379 ROD AND CONE CONTRIBUTIONS TO S-POTENTIALS FROM THE CAT RETINA. Roy H. Steinberg (US. Naval Aerospace Medical Center, Aerospace Medical institute, Pensacola, Fla.). Vision Research, vol. 9, Nov. 1969, p. 1319-1329. 41 refs. Study of the problem of whether the rods contribute to S-potentials in the intact eye of the cat. S-potentials from luminosity units (L-units) were evoked by small spots of relatively mono- chromatic light in dark- and light-adapted retinae. The spectral sensitivity curve for dark-adapted S-potentials had its maximum at 500 nm and the form of dark-adapted responses also suggested that rods were excited. The spectral sensitivity curve for light-adapted S-potentials had its maximum at 560 nm and response latencies even at threshold were much faster than in dark-adaptation. Individual S-potentials exhibited Purkinje shifts. It is concluded that rhodopsin rods contribute to S-potentials (L-type) in the cat and that cones contribute to the same responses. (Author) A70016380 RODXONE INTERACTION IN S.POTENTlALS FROM THE CAT RETINA. Roy H. Steinberg (US. Naval Aerospace Medical Center, Aerospace Medical Institute, Pensacola, Fla.). Vision Research, vol. 9, Nov. 1969, p. 1331-1344. 16 refs. Study of rod-cone interaction in cat S-potentials by analyzing the effect of wavelength and intensity upon the form of dark- adapted responses. Flashes of white light and relatively mono- chromatic flashes produced responses that seemed to originate from the excitation of both receptor types. The rod response changed as a function of intensity, peaking at about 2.5 log above threshold and increasing in duration at 3.0 log above threshold. The cone response seemed in some way to add to the changing rod response. Voltage-log current curves showed that the rod responses reached a ceiling (initial peak voltage) at 3.5 log above threshold while the maintained voltage leveled off at a lower intensity. Both ceilings were obscured by the apparent addition of the cone contribution. Cone and rod responses to brief orange and blue lights of moderate intensity, separated in time, added together across a complete range of intervals. (Author) A70-16381 THE ROD AFTER-EFFECT IN S-POTENTIALS FROM THE CAT RETINA. Roy H. Steinberg (U.S. Naval Aerospace Medical Center, Aerospace Medical Institute, Pensacola, Fla.). Vision Research, vol. 9, Nov. 1969, p. 1345-1355. 17 refs. The relation of the rod after-effect to per cent rhodopsin bleached was studied in S-potentials from cat retina. At threshold, flashes that produced the rod after-effect bleached only very small quantities of rhodopsin, and at a fixed flash duration, the duration of the after-effect increased as a function of log intensity. The after-effect's threshold occurred at about the intensity which saturated the maintained voltage. With flash intensity fixed and flash duration increased, the duration of the after-effect was a linear function of exposure time. The duration continued to increase after an exposure of 16 sec, even though at least 99 per cent of the rhodopsin had been bleached. It is concluded that the after-effect originates from something that accumulates after the maintained voltage in rod pathways reaches a ceiling. The accumulation can continue at a fixed rate irrespective of the bleaching rate. (Author) A70.16382 HUMAN CORTICAL CORRELATES OF COLOR WITH MONOCU- LAR, BINOCULAR AND DlCHOPTlC VISION. Nathan W. Perry, Donald G. Childers, and William W. Dawson (Florida, University, Visual Sciences Laboratory, Gainesville, Fla.). Vision Research, vol. 9, Nov. 1969, p. 1357-1366. 30 refs. PHs Grants No. NB-06654; No. NB-06875; No. NB-06635. Five subjects (three normals, one amblyope and one deutera- nope) were presented red (630 nm), yellow (577 nm), green (520 nm), and achromatic stimuli twice in all possible monocular and binocular combinations. Four averaged visual evoked responses (VERs) were simultaneously recorded over four scalp areas to reach stimulus condition, giving 224 VERs for each subject. Color coding was found in all normal subjects over a large scalp area above the occipital cortex and was questionable with the deuteranope. Most marked color coding (changes in waveshape of the VER produced by the different wavelengths) occurred late in the VER (more than 215 msec). It was possible to examine the contribution of each eye to the cortical response during binocular stimulation.

Investigation of the changes in mean arterial pressure and suprarenal blood flow in anesthetized dogs, manifested under basal conditions or elicited by stimuli applied upon both afferent and efferent nerves. The approximate transfer functions of the tested section of the circulatory system have been determined on an analog model. Properties of \"useful\" and \"noise\" components of the signals have been estimated. Stochastic methods were found to be very efficient in studies of the dynamic properties of the circulatory system. M.V.E. DIMENSIONS OF THE APPARENT PUPIL WHEN VIEWED AT OBLIQUE ANGLES. Richard F. Haines (NASA, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.). American Journal of Ophthalmology, vol. 68, Oct. 1969, p. 649-656. 10 refs. Calculation of the correction factors required for estimating the influence of a reduction in entrance pup11 area on the level of retinal illumination. The dimens~ons of the apparent pupil under conditions which produce extremes in its size are determined. It is shown that it is relatively inaccurate to use the cos 0 curve to predict the ratio of apparent horizontal to apparent vertical dimension when the eye is viewed at oblique angles. V.P.

Review of recent studies of the human controller both in psychology and in control engineering. Theoretical and technological problems in the study of skilled behavior are discussed, and the desirable constraints upon any \"model\" are outlined. The founda- tions of linear continuous modelling of the human controller and experimental data on the validity and utility of linear models are reviewed. The evidence for nonlinear and discontinuous behavior in the human controller is outlined, and studies of nonlinear models based on modern optimal and sampled-data control theory are presented.

Determination of the ventilation value at which transition is made from exclusively nasal breathing to oronasal breathing, and investigation of the effect of nasal breathing on gaseous exchanges. It was found that the difference in ventilation between nasal and oronasal breathing is 14.5 per cent and is significant. Assuming an increase in ventilation of dead space of 1 literlmin on transition to oronasal breathing, the difference in alveolar ventilation between nasal and oronasal breathing can be calculated at 5.8 literlmin.

A70-16496 # UNIFORMITY OF INTRAPULMONARY DISTRIBUTION OF IN. HALED AIR STUDIED WITH vol. 32, July-Sept. 1969, p. 376-395. 12 refs. In Italian. Investigation of the uniformity of intrapulmonary distribution of inhaled gases with the single-breath technique proposed by Comroe and Fowler (1951) in 32 subjects between 14 and 64 years of age. The increase in nitrogen concentration in the alveolar air breathed out throughout the expiration phase was used as an index of the nonuniformity of the ventilation distribution, in addition to the index suggested by Comroe et al. (1967). In healthy subjects the value of the index did not exceed 4 per cent following Comroe's method, and 20 per cent following the method proposed by the author. In the patients examined, the values yielded by the two methods were always above the ones indicated. These values are proposed by the author as limits between normal and pathological subjects. M.M.

Brief survey of some medicolegal problems in the field of aviation, specifically those connected with flight accidents. Aspects of the investigation, of the examination of victims, and of the human factor, which are basic in all investigations of flight accidents, are discussed. M.M. A70-16574 MICROBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF THE VACUUM PROBE SURFACE SAMPLER. Norman J. Petersen and Walter W. Bond (National Communicable Disease Center, Phoenix, Ariz.). Applied Microbiology, vol. 18, Dec. 1969, p. 1002-1006. 5 refs. Microbiological evaluation of a slightly modified version of the vacuum probe, a new device for surface sampling. The probe proved to be an effective sampling device, removing 98 per cent and recovering 88 per cent of surface contaminants resulting from the accumulation of airborne microorganisms. The probe was decidedly less effective in removing and recovering handling contamination than fallout contamination. There was also evidence that certain microorganisms could not survive prolonged exposure to airflow in the probe. However, the vacuum probe procedure recovered twice as many microorganisms as did the swab-rinse technique when com- pared directly. (Author) A70-16624 NONSPECIFIC INFLUENCES ON NEURONAL FIRING IN THE CENTRAL VISUAL PATHWAY. V. G. Skrebitskii (Akademiia Meditsinskikh Nauk SSSR, Moscow, USSR). Experimental Brain Research, vol. 9, no. 4, 1969, p. 269-283. 42 refs. A microelectrode investigation of 287 units in the visual cortex (VC) of chronic, semirestrained rabbits shows that about 40 per cent of the neurons react to different arousing nonvisual stimuli (acoustic, electrocutaneous, and reticular). These reactions are nonspecific, they become extinguished by stimulus repetition, and bear a certain relation to the electrocortical arousal reaction. The nonspecific inhibitory influence is more common in the VC during sensory or reticular arousal. In approximately 75 per cent of the neurons, spontaneous activity and photically evoked discharges are inhibited, whereas in approximately 25 per cent they are facilitated. In the lateral geniculate body, facilitation of spontaneous and photically evoked neuronal discharges prevails during sensory arousal. The mechanisms and the functional role of these nonspecific influences are discussed. (Author) A70-16625 IMPAIRED DISCRIMINATION FOLLOWING POLARISATION OF THE STRIATE CORTEX. Roger Ward and Lawrence Weiskrantz (Cambridge University, Cambridge, England). Experimental Brain Research, vol. 9, no. 4, 1969, p. 346-356. 31 refs. Two rhesils monkeys were trained to solve a problem involving the recognition of tachistoscopically presented objects. Performance at this task was impaired by the passage of surface-positive polarizing currents through the striate cortex: the impairment persisted after current was turned off, decaying in a reasonably exponential manner with a time constant of about 20 min. The magnitude of the impairment varied both with the intensity of the applied current and with the duration of application. (Author) A70-16632 MAN IN SPACE. D. H. Howle (RCA, Princeton, N.J.).

Discussion of the requirements of manned space flight. Factors which are either essential or desirable in maintaining man alive, healthy, and able to carry out the tasks required of him during journeys in space are considered. The basic requirements connected with the provision of a cabin atmosphere suitable both in com- position and pressure to maintain life are examined, together with the matter of food and water supplies and the disposal of waste products. Other aspects of environmental conditioning for space, such as temperature control, energy supply, and protection against radiation, are treated. M.M.

In German. Discussion of a model which represents the principles of regulation of the human organism, including the effects of daylight on this regulation, taking into account a self-excited single diurnal oscillation of the vegetative system. The model is based on concepts developed by Klinker (1968). The existence of two cycles which control human regulation is assumed. Diurnal and seasonal variations of mortality are examined to verify the predictions of the model. G.R. A70-16668 SOME METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF SYSTEMATIC CATEGORIZATION OF BEHAVIOR. Guillermo F. Mascaro (Florida, University, Gainesville, Fla.). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, June 1969, p. 779-784. 12 refs. Analysis of some of the research problems arising from studies using observational methods, including recommendations of pro- cedures that might be used for effective solutions. A number of categorization systems are described, and problems of estimating validity and reliability of coding are discussed. M.M. A70.16669 EFFECT OF HEAD MOVEMENT IN VISUAL-KINESTHETIC LOCALIZATION. A. V. Churchill (Defence Research Establishment, Toronto, Canada). Perceptual and Motor Sk~lls, vol. 28, June 1969, p. 785, 786. The results of a previous experiment showed that visual estimates of kinesthetic localization and kinesthetic estimates of visual localization were equally accurate, but with errors in opposite directions, when the subject was free to move his head. The present experiment was designed to measure the contribution of head movement to the accuracy of visual and kinesthetic localization. Results indicate that performance is equivalent under the free-head and fixed-head conditions. (Author) A70-16670 PREFERENCE FOR CONSISTENT AND INCONSISTENT IN- FORMATION IN IMPRESSION FORMATION. Clyde Hendrick (Kent State University, Kent, Ohio). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, June 1969, p. 877, 878. Attempt to extend Dustin and Baldwin's (1966) model of impression formation to sets of six traits. Subjects rated the probability that three undesirable traits (U) would describe a person, given that he possessed three desirable traits (Dl. Subjects then rated their liking for the person, assuming that he actually did possess all six traits. The results showed a curvilinear relationship between probability ratings and liking ratings, thus only partially supporting the model. When the perceived relation between D and U traits was relatively improbable, the greater the improbability, the greater the liking. When the perceived relation was relatively probable, the greater the probability, the greater the liking. The results supported both a need for novelty and a need for consistency. (Author) A70-16671 A NEW THEORY OF POST-REST UPSWING OR \"WARM-UP\" IN MOTOR LEARNING. H. J. Eysenck (Institute of Psychiatry, London, England). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, June 1969, p. 992-994. 16 refs. Research supported by the Maudsley and Bethlem Royal Research Fund. Postrest upswing in motor learning is traditionally explained in psychological terms-i.e., either as a regaining of \"set\" or as extinction of conditioned inhibition. It is suggested that physio- logical evidence points to an alternative, namely a true \"warming-up\" of the muscles involved in the work under consideration. The hypothesis is shown to explain certain otherwise puzzling features of \"warm-up\" in pursuit rotor performance. (Author) A70.16672 HYPOXIA AND SELF-PACED WORK. Martin J. Gerben and Joyce L. House (U.S. Army, Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, Mass.). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, June 1969, p. 995-1002. 15 refs. Nine soldiers were required to perform a fixed amount of work on a bicycle ergometer during each of 18 sessions. Subjects were allowed to determine their own schedulesof work and rest. Subjects breathed air during the first nine sessions (training). During the second nine sessions (experimental), subjects breathed 21, 14, or 12 per cent oxygen. Results indicated that subjects paced themselves by stopping rather than changing their rate of pedaling. Training reduced the number of stops per session, while hypoxia had the opposite effect. (Author) A70-16673 EFFECT OF PERSPECTIVE ON TWO TRAPEZOID ILLUSIONS. Robert Zenhausern (Fordham University, New York, N.Y.). Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 28, June 1969, p. 1003-1009. 9 refs. A new perceptual illusion, the perception of rotation with an oscillating trapezoid, was compared with an older, similar illusion, the perception of oscillation with a rotating trapezoid. Perspective was found to have a differential effect on the two phenomena. In addition, a negative correlation was found between the magnitudes of the two illusions.

Reindell (University Hospital, Freiburg im Breisgau, West Germany). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 27, Dec. 1969, p. 840-847. 20 refs. Study of the effects of a standardized ergometer training program at sea level and at simulated altitudes of 2250 and 3450 m, respectively. Eighteen students were trained daily on a bicycle ergometer six times a week, for a period of four weeks. Derived individual training heart rate was established: heart rate at rest, plus 70 per cent of the difference between the heart rate at rest and that achieved during maximum exercise. The results obtained are inter- preted as further evidence of the fact that hypoxia plays a potentiating role in the effects of physical training on the human organism. G.R. A70-16675 h/ ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC CHANGES DURING POSITIVE AC- CELERATION. George H. Cohen and William K. Brown (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 27, Oec. 1969, p. 858-862. 27 refs. Ten normal volunteers were exposed to positive headward accelerations under control conditions, after breathing of 100 per cent oxygen, and after administration of propranolol, a beta- adrenergic blocking agent. All subjects were monitored with an electrocardiographic system capable of recording six simultaneous leads. A consistent pattern of increased p-wave amplitude in 11, 111, and AVF and T-wave flattening or inversion in 11, Ill, AVF, and V4-V, were noted. These changes could not be prevented by having the subjects breathe 100 per cent oxygen. Administration of propranolol completely normalized the electrocardiogram during prolonged positive headward acceleration. The observations support the conclusion that the electrocardiographic changes noted are a reflection of increased sympathetic tone similar to that noted during orthostasis. No evidence is noted supporting the presence of myocardial ischemia during prolonged positive headward accelera- tion. (Author) A70.16702 * IMMEDIATE AND FUTURE CHALLENGES TO CONTAMINA.

Discussion of challenges to biological contamination control of spacecraft intended for planetary exploration missions. It is emphasized that most of the immediate challenges seem to be in the area of better equipment or procedures, and that one of the major future challenges is to learn to apply the technology to a broader base. The need for better particulate monitoring equipment and for better cleaning procedures is stressed. M.M.

Description of a device which may be used to monitor surfaces for particle contamination. The device which has been developed is known as a vacuum probe and is designed for use on surfaces within clean environments, such as clean rooms and clean benches. The vacuum probe is capable of removing particles down to one micron size'at efficiencies up to 95 per cent. Particle enumeration may be done manually when captured on a membrane filter or automatically when a high-rate particle counter is connected in line with the vacuum probe.

Evaluation of a vacuum probe used to remove microbial contamination from a surface and to capture the microorganisms on a membrane filter. The vacuum probe proved to be an effective device for sampling surface contamination resulting from the accumulation of airborne microorganisms. The 98 per cent removal and 88 per cent recovery demonstrated in this study compared favorably with the 89 per cent removal and 67 per cent recovery reported in preliminary tests. The vacuum probe procedure recovered twice as many microorganisms as did the swab-rinse technique when compared directly. M.M.

The complex consists of the quality control analysis laboratory, the main cleaning room, the preclean room, and the airlock. With this complex, it is possible to keep a continuous flow of work moving through the system. Tubing ar~d fittings arrive at the preclean room exposed, oily, and otherwise contaminated, and enter the clean room in a nearly spotless condition. Final cleaning and testing are performed, and the clean packaged parts are sent on their way to the clean assembly area. The area has been in continuous operation for 12 months with no shutdowns. Overall performance by the complex has been more than satisfactory. M.M. A70-16711 MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION DETECTED ON THE APOLLO 9 SPACECRAFT. John R. Puleo, Gordon S. Oxborow, and Richard C.

Description of methods by which actual sources of contamina- tion were traced, giving specific examples, such as ball bearing contamination, relay contact failure, internal fogging of instrument windows, corrosion in electronic circuitry, and air-conditioning system problems. The specific cases are chosen to represent the widest possible range of analytical techniques. A literature survey is very much a part of any organized investigation, and references are made to general and specific chemical literature, where such is pertinent. The work is illustrated with photographs of contamination specimens taken during various stages of investigations. It is shown that any significant contamination is closely related to the actual manufacturing operations, and that improvements in such will generally improve the reliability of the product.

Dirk Durrer (International Academy of Aviation Medicine, Brussels, Belgium). International Congress of Aerospace Medicine, 18th, Amsterdam, Netherlands, Sept. 15- 18, 1969, Paper. 7 p. 14 refs. Review of the increasing importance of cardiology to com- mercial aviation medicine. The conservative 20 per cent estimate given for moderate and advanced arteriosclerosis in the 20- to 50-year pilot age group has to be at least doubled for the 40- to 50-year age group. On the other hand, the 50- to 59-year age group among pilots is expected to increase from 10.3 per cent in 1967 to 40.7 per cent in 1987, while the stress of flight operation is likely to grow only with the advent of the jumbo jet and SST. Furthermore, present crew organization places the main burden upon the oldest, most experienced pilot-the captain. In the light of all this, the magnitude of the cardiologist's part in the prophylactic, flight-safety ensuring, risk-minimizing functions of commercial aviation medicine is self-evident. An analysis is made of the influence of the flying task upon circulation, the physiological significance of the pulse rate increase, emotions and the circulatory response in pilots, the pilot-cooperation problem, the passenger and the jumbo jet, and time displacement and biological rhythm.

Science, vol. 166, Dec. 26, 1969, p. 1621-1624. 13 refs. NIH-NSF-NASA-supported research. An orthorhombic form of crystalline formylmethionine transfer RNA has been obtained which contains one molecule as the asymmetric unit of the unit cell. Three-dimensional X-ray diffraction data have been collected up to a resolution of 12 11, and from this a Patterson function has been calculated. The function contains an elongated ridge of interatomic vectors parallel to the c-axis of the crystal. Analysis of the function suggests that the molecules are elongated and dimerized in an overlapping antiparallel fashion along the c-axis. The dimer has a length near 109 a and a width of 35 in one direction. The individual molecular length is approximately 80 8 with an irregular cross section measuring 25 by 35 8.

An interpretation is given of typical radiation sources as applied to human targets, and some deficiencies in the application of available information to the determination of safe working levels indentified. Laser radiation problems are discussed and particular attention is drawn to the critical near infrared region. It is suggested that improved data is required for the spectral biological effect on nonionizing radiation at all wavelengths with the emphasis on damage threshold levels.

Review of radiation doses at dose points of interest and tediniques of their calculation for various space radiation environ- ments.

Disc~tssion of the requirements, development problems, and implementing means of appropriate radiation monitoring systems. In 01-der to be appropriate, space radiation dosimetry must be capable of I-ecot-ding both the total dose and the 'quality' from all types of radiation which might be incident upon an astronaut in significant intensities. There exist, however, some uncertainties in the primary radiation field because of the difficulties involved in making statistically self-consistent measurements in all energy regimes of interest and the extreme criticality of knowing the exact material clistt-ibution about the dose points. These factors demand above all the developnient of sophisticated dosimetry systems which, when interpreted correctly, will provide meaningful astronaut dose in- formation and will obviate any necessity for radiation spectrometry inside of manned space vehicles. Toward the development of such dosimetry systems, special attention is devoted to dose-equivalence aspects, parameters involving absolute accuracy, and to currently available active and passive dosimetry varieties. A review of the advantages, philosophy and design of unmanned vehicle experiments concludes the discussion. M.V.E. A70-17266 DOSE MEASUREMENTS FROM THE OVI-4 SATELLITE AND THE WL-304 SPACE PROBE. G. Radke (USAF, Weapons Laboratory, Kirtland AFB, N.Mex.) and J. Conklin (Computer Sciences Corp., Los Angeles, Calif.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 40, Dec (Section 2) 1969, p. 1504-1508. Review of the results of the radiation-dose experiments per- formed from the satellite OVI-4 and the WL-304 space probe. The dose rate measured from the OVI-4 shows a periodic variation caused by the combined effects of nonuniformity in the shielding protecting the tissue-equivalent ionization chambers, anisotropy of the geomagnetically trapped radiation, and the slow tumbling motion of the OVI-4 satellite. This variation shows how the instantaneous dose rate in space can change by nearly a factor of 2 depending on the satellite orientation. As to the WL-304 experiment, its purpose was to measure tissue dose rate along a trajectory with an apogee of approximately 17,575 km, i.e., through the high radiation intensities of the inner radiation zone of the Van Allen belts. The measured and calculated peak dose rates for the first pass through the inner zone agree within 2.3%. M.V.E.

Description of the spacecraft shielding configuration and radia- tion detectors used on the Gemini 4 and 6 flights and discussion of the monitored cabin-radiation data. In order to determine the integral internal radiation intensity, five multidosimeter packages were placed aboard at points of maximum, minimum, and inter- mediate shielding. The experimental results are a function of mission length, orbital variables and detector location within the spacecraft, as well as of onboard radiation sources (e.9.. luminous watch dial, etc.) and differing responses of the detectors themselves. Each of these influences is discussed, and directional effects, in particular, are evaluated. M.V.E.

Aerospace Medicine, vol. 40, Dec. (Section 2) 1969, p. 1535-1546. Results of a series of experiments conducted on the Gemini IV and Gemini VI flights to measut-e the accumulated dose and dose rate as a function of elapsed time and position within the spacecraft. The radiation environment consisted mainly of energetic protons and electt-ons from the inner Van Allen belt, which was encountered each time the spacecraft passed thro~tgh the South Atlantic Anomaly. The instruments used wet-e designed to measure the low radiation levels that were anticipated. The measurements were made using two tissue-equivalent ionization chambet-s which wet-e radiations. A pol-table sensor was used by the astrotiauts to conduct a series of radiation survey measurements. It is shown to be possible to carry out predictions of the doses interior to a complex manned spacecraft with an accuracy of at least a factor of three. It is considet-ed that the doses received wet-e not sufficiently high to create a hazard. F.R.L. A7047271 A REVIEW OF SOVIET MANNED SPACE FLIGHT DOSIMETRY RESULTS. J.

The influence of exercise during hypoxia was studied by subjecting six individuals to maximum exertion while breathing different gas mixtures. The decrease in maximum ventilated air and exercise capacity during increasing hypoxia despite near constant values for heart rate, systolic pressure and pulse pressure is interpreted as indicating that maximum exertion was limited by cardiac output capacity but not necessarily by coronary blood flow capacity.

(Section 1) 1969, p. 1300-1304. 24 refs. Hematologic changes were studied in 145 white rats subjected to 4.5 and 6.5 g. The studies included the possibilities of therapeutic prevention of changes by administration of vitamin B,, and folic acid and the degree of reversibility of the changes after return to 1 g environment. In nontreated animals, sacrificed immediately after return to 1 g, the study showed: a statistically significant decrease of erythrocytes and Hb-values, the inversion of the leukocytic formula, in the sense that neutrophyl granulocytes increased and relative leukocytics decreased. There was a total decrease of elements in the medullary erythropoietic system, maturation inhibition of erythropoietic series, a decrease of medullary mitotic index and leftward deviation to the prophase of the medullary mitotic curves. Decrease of hematopoietic activity with its effects on peripheral blood were in proportion to the hypergravitation at values 4.5 and 6.5 g compared to 1 g. These changes though showing a tendency to recover toward normal physiological values, did not attain the normal ranges two months after return to an environment of 1 g. The favorable effect of vitamin Bt2 and folic acid were demonstrated in the treated groups of animals by the prevention of premature hematologic lesions and by resistance against late effects of excess gravity which were still present after two months at 1 g in nontreated animals.

A70-17287 * TESTICULAR DEGENERATION IN MACACA NEMESTRINA FLIGHT TESTS. R. Zemjanis, Gondos, W. R. Adey, and A. T. I<. Cockett (Harbor General Hospital, Torrance, Calif.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 40, Dec. (Section 1) 1969, p. 1316-1322. 17 refs. Contract No. NAS 2-2151. Testicular tissue was obtained from eight Macaca nemestrina monkeys before and after pre-space flight tests. Normal spermato- genesis was observed in all of the pre-test specimens, except for one taken from an animal with juvenile testes. One animal which was involved in the test for only seven days had a normal terminal specimen. Severe testicular degeneration developed in the six remaining animals, all of whom wele kept under test conditions for 14 days or more. Seminiferous tubules were generally lined by a single to double layer of Sertoli cells and scattered spermatogonia, mainly type A. Spermatocytes were rare and no spermatozoa were seen. The change involved all of the tubules in a uniform manner. The changes finding of testicular degeneration in the test animals indicates that potentially adverse effects of space flight conditions on spermatogenesis must be consideted. Immobilization appears to be one of the factors deserving particular attention. (Author) EFFECT OF TWO WEEI<S BED REST ON VENOUS POOLING IN THE LOWER LIMBS. Richard P. Menninger, Richard C.

The present study was conducted to determine by more direct measurements, the effect of inactivity (two weeks bed rest) on the pressure-volume characteristics of the legs. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) of a magnitude (minus 40 mm. Hg) known to produce blood volume shifts similar to those occurring with tilt was applied to two subjects before and at the end of the bed rest period. Leg volume changes were measured directly at one, three, and five minutes using whole leg water plethysmographs located in the LBNP chamber. The measured volume changes suggest that venous distensi- bility was not increased by two weeks bed rest. The characteristic increase in heart rate elicited by LBNP was greatet- following bed rest as anticipated. In view of the apparent inconsistency between previous circumference measurements and the present plethysnlo- graphic observations, additional studies are needed to delineate the importance of changes in venous distensibility in HOURS 'GROUND LEVEL DENSTRO- GENATION.'

Bends incidence was observed in 16 volunteer men who, chiefly after 2 hr of 'shirtsleeve' exposure to oxygen, took a decompression frorn 14.5 to 5 psia (pounds per sq in., absolute) and then exercised intermittently in either a ratio of oxygen to nitrogen of 70 to 30 or oxygen for 3 and 9 hr at psia. This was followed by a second decompression to 3.5 psia oxygen for a period of 3 hr also with exercise for a total of 102 manflights. Among the 12 men who suffered bends in 45 instances, there were 36 cases of grade 1 that within a mean 1.5 hr increased to grade 2. With one exception, those who had lesser quantities of body fat were less susceptible to bends. The absence of diluent nitrogen tended to protect those with greater burdens of fat.

Aerospace Medicine, vol. 40, Dec. (Section 1) 1969, p. 1331-1335. 10 refs. The effects of high temperature on psychomotor performance and physiological function were studied in the laboratory on male pilots (age 30-51) holding a current medical certlficate. A total of 41 runs were made at neutral (23.8 C, 75 F) or hot (60 C (140 F), 71.1 C (160 F)) temperatures with low humidities (less than 20 mm Hg at 60.0 and 71.1 C). Heart rate (ECG), deep body temperature (rectal probe) and skin tempet-ature were recorded at two-minute intervals. Performance on a complex performance device (two-dimensional tracking, mental arithmetic, and monitoring) was scored for five- minute intervals which varied in task difficulty. During exposure to 71.1 C, mean rectal temperatut-e reached 38.05 C (100.5 F), mean peak heart rate was 132 beatslmin, and mean finger temperature peaked at 42 C (107.6 F). There wet-e significant decrements in performance (tracking and mental arithmetic) at 71.1 C. At 60.0 C there were no performance decrements during 30 minutes of exposure. Results are discussed as they apply to aircrew in high performance aircl-aft. (Author) A70-17291 HlGH FIDELITY SIMULATIONS IN THE EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS-ACUTE C02 EXPOSURE. James R.

The usual laboratory evaluations of psychophysiologic responses to stress are based on measurements of uncertain relevance to operational effectiveness. This study examines the use of high fidelity simulations for such evaluations. Because of its importance in artificial environments, carbon dioxide (C02) was chosen as the stressor. The test gas was 5% C02 in ail- (normoxic), delivered by mask. C02 and 02 concentrations were continuously monitored. Each subject served as his own control with performance evaluations on air without mask, on air only with mask, and on C02 in air by mask. The first test involved image motion compensation in optically tracking a ground target from simulated orbit. The second involved the simulated horizontal landing of a reentry vehicle by jet qualified pilots. Exposure to 5% C02 in air for 15 minutes did not result in detectable decrements in image tnotion compensation. The hori- zontal landing simulations, however, revealed detectable degradation in the pilot's ability to control the final landing phase. It is concluded that high fidelity simulations appear to be ~tseful in confirming practical stress tolerance limits. In addition limited conclusions as to emergency limits for acute C02 exposure are made. (Author) A70-17292 * EFFECT OF SPACECRAFT LEVEL VIBRATIONS AND GRAV- ITIES ON PLECTONEMA BORYANUM. E.

This study was designed to determine if spacecraft level vibrations and G's caused changes in the blue-green alga Plectonema boryanum. The proposed use of unicellular algae as a medium of gas exchange, food and water supply, and waste disposal during pi-olonged space flight prompted this investigation. Exposure to vibration or gravity (GI ranges for 15, 30, and 60 minutes failed to cause a change in algal colonial morphology. A critical G range (9.6 to 10 G's) at constant vibration of 700 hertz for 30 minutes caused a significant decrease in the amount of contamination in impure cultures. Algae cells exhibited swelling when exposed to 9.6 and 9.8 G's at the same vibt-ational frecluency and time period as mentioned above. An incl-ease in extl-acellular polysacchat-ide production was exhibited in pure cultures inoculated with algal samples vibrated at 700 hel-tz, 10 G's for 30 minutes. Chromatographic studies indicated that tlie coniposition of the polysaccharicle was not changed as a res~~lt of vibt-ation of the inoculum at 700 hertz, 10 G's fot- 30 minutes.

During the experiments the 02 was kept at 150-400 mm Hg. After decompression and blood analysis of the embryos, it was found that 10 atm N2-02 inhibited viability and development even though 100% of the eggs were fertile. Ten atm He did not prevent partial development, but all embryos were dead. The 40% of the embryos which had developed were alive, 13% were developed but dead, 13% were fertilized only, and 14% were not fertilized. The embryos incubated under 2.5 atm air weighed 27.8% less than controls and possessed 8.1% greater Hb, 20% greater MCHbC, and 26.4% greater MCHb. At 2.5 atm the experiment was inconclusive in assessing nitrogen's role as a growth inhibitor, as seen at 10 and 2.5 atms.

Aerospace Medici~ie, vol. 40, Dec. (Section 1) 1969, p. 1369-1372. Possible indicators of a pilot's emotional state which have thus far received little reseal-ch attention are his vocal utterances during air-to-ground radio communications. An exploratory study has been conducted wherein excerpts of tape-recot-ded conversations between pilots and contt-ol tower operators transmitted during known emotionally stressful situations were subjected to spectrographic analysis. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of narrow-band spectrogt-ams of selected utterances indicate that measurements of fundamental frequency and range of funclaniental frequency, together with obset-vation of the fundamental frequency contour, may serve to signify when a pilot is ~~ndergoing emotional stress.

Nomograms were developed to show the interrelationship of time and dose to methemoglobinemia or plasma MMH concentration as observed during the first 2 hours after application of MMH to the chest of anesthetized male dogs. Limitations of the notnogranis are discussed in respect to range and accuracy. It is emphasized that the nomograms were compiled from responses of anesthetized dogs. These noniogl-ams coitld be used to estimate the severity of human exposure only in conjunction with other known MMH intoxication symptoms. In the absence of dose-I-esponse data ft-om humans. however, the nomogt-ams at-e considered the best available data by which to evaluate accidental exposure by skin contact with MMH.

Keeping a crystal pick up over the brachial altery and under a pneumatic blood pressitre cuff, pulses were recorded along with the cuff pressilt-es as the pressure in the cuff was dropped from 200 mm Hg to zero. The pulse complex for presystolic pressures in the cuff consisted of two components corresponding to compression and decompression of the crystal surface it1 contact with the cuff. The aniplitirde of the second component of the pirlse complex appreciably increased in comparison to the first component at one point, and the first component vanished at another point while the cuff pressures wet-e decreased from presystolic valves. The pressitre in the cuff corresponding to the first point agt-eed with the systolic pressure and that corl-esponding to the second agreed with the diastolic pressure. Possible explanation for the changes in the pulse wave as observed at systolic and diastolic points are also given. (Author) A70-17300 RETURN TO FLYING AFTER COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS. William H.

These are (1) the human body as a self-regulating system (honleostasis) and (2) the physiological time regulatol-, or the biological clock (cyclostasis). In manned orbital space flight and on a manned landing mission to the moon and Mars, the solution fob- survival is a closed ecological system with adequate Ilfe-suppotting and protecting subsystems to meet the respective requit-ements for man as a homeostatic system. The cyclostatic natul-e of the body clock is evidenced by the fact that the duration of the cycle can be shortened to 18 hr or extended to 28 hr; the fact that the sleep/wakefulness cycle continues in its nearly circadian pattern under constant light or dal-k conditions; and the fact that a shift in the phases of the cycle cannot be achieved instantly, rather it requires a certain time for readjustment.

TI-anslation. The cardiac spontaneous activity is assured by the presence of catecholamines in the pace-maker fibers. Experiments were pet-- fot-med on 15 isolated preparations of sinus node of the rabbit hearts, placed in a plastic chamber. The bioelectl-ic activity was recorded with glass microelectrodes. All preparations were treated with alpha-methyl-DOPA until complete cessation of biolectric activity. It was found that the alpha-methyl-DOPA, as inhibitor of catecholamine synthesis, al-I-ested the spontaneous activity of the isolated pace-maker. Addition of catecholamines or washing out the pl-eparation with Tyrode solution reactivated the bioelectl-ic activity of the pace-maker. Glucagon, possessing an analogical mechanism of action to that of catecholamines, did not restore the activity of the pace-maker, art-ested by alpha-methyl-DOPA. These phenomena seem to indicate that catecholamines are indispensable for the PI-ocess of spontaneous excitation. (Author) A70-17423 # EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM CLOTTING. 6, 1968, p. 784-790. 22 refs. Translation. The influence of short term physical effort on blood clotting was studied in 30 healthy men, physical workers, aged 17-19 years. Thrombelastograms of the full blood were recorded. Clotting and bleeding times, plasma fibrinogen level, euglobulin fibrinolysis rate as well as thrombocytes count were determined. Physical work was measured, using a bicycle foot ergostat at 100-150 watts for 5-10 min, corresponding to 3000-9000 kGm. Clotting processes were studied before exercise, immediately aftel- effort, as well as 30 pin after effort termination. It was found, that short-term physical work, did not PI-oduce any distinct disol-ders in blood clotting or fibrinolysis in physical worket-s. The lack of significant disorders of clotting factors and their inhibitors was connected with too short duration of exercise. ( Author) A70-17424 # EFFECT OF 6, 1968, p. 800-809. 22 refs. TI-anslation. The influence of vibration on the adl-enocortical function was sttldied in matitle guinea pigs. Vibration stimuli (frequency 50 Hz, amplitude 1 mm, tinie of exposure 3 lirs daily) were applied. The animals were subjected to vibration for 3.6 ant1 12 days. Sinusoidal, vertical vibration ir!dttced after a sufficiently long duration, protluced a significant adt-enocot-tical response. The reaction of adtenal cot-tex to the vibration stimuli was biphasic. The first stage, lasting up to the 6th day of vibration, was cliaractet-ired by tlie occut-I-ence and gradual enhancement of stimulation symptotns. In the second stage, occurt-ing between tlie 6th and 12th day of exposure, gradual regression of stimularory phenoniet-ro~l was stated, corresponding to adaptation or secretory exhaustion of the adt-enal cot-tex.

The aim of wot-k was to investigate the course of changes in acetylcholine concentration in the brain tissue of rats exposed repeatedly to the action of mechanical vibt-ations. Experiments wet-e perfot-med on 263 rats. Rats wet-e exposed to the action of mechanical vibration together with noise, or only noise, 2 ht-s daily, for 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days. Concentt-ation of acetylcholine, acetylcholine esterase activity and acetylcholine synthesis ability were studied in fresh tissue of the cet-ebral hemispheres. It was found that after a single 2-hr exposure, the concentt-atioti of acetylcholine increased in the cet-ebral tissue of rats, then gt-adually decreased and concentration in the brain tissue of rats exposed repeatedly to the action returned to not-ma1 values after 15 exposures, similarly to tlie contt-ol group. Acetylcholine estet-ase activity and ability of cerebral tissue to synthesize acetylcholine gt-adually increased. The adaptation mechanisms to mechanical vibration were discussed.

Polish Medical Joort~al, vol. 8, no. 4, 1969, p. 902-908. 19 )refs. Translation. Development of an experimental procedut-e for investigating the radioprotective effectiveness of chemical compounds against the effects of low-dose X-ray irradiation. The effect of ionizing radiation on golden hamster fetuses and the pt-otection affot-ded by cysteamine have been studied. Doses of 70 t- and 100 mg of cysteamine per kg body wet-e used. Under the influence of radiation the fetuses showed development anomalies of the eyeball and/or died. Cysteamine provides a certain protection from radiation injury, but it is probably also harmful to the fetuses. The described expet-imental procedut-e appears to be useful for studies of the effectiveness of chemical radioorotective substances. M.V.E.

Evaluation of tlie infli~ence of the nervous system on the course of erythema radiation reactions. Symmetric sites on the foreatms of subjects with unilateral paralysis or after unilateral sympathecto~ny were irradiated. In one woman erythema essential I-adiation reaction in the paralyzed extremity occurred with a two weeks delay, but the further course of the reaction was the same as in the healthy extremity. In rabbit ears deprived of the spinal and autonomic nerve supply the reaction usually occitrl-ed earliet- and was more intense. On the other hand, on denervated ears late complications in the form of perforation of the ear concha were not observed. It is believed that the different course of the reaction is due to the better blood supply to the denervated ear. M.V.E. A70-17431 COMPARED EVOLUTION OF HEART RATE AND BODY TEM- PERATURE DURING MUSCULAR EXERCISE IN HOT EN- VIRONMENT (EVOLUTION COMPAREE DE LA FREQUENCE CARDIAQUE ET DE L'EXERCICE MUSCULAIRE A HAUTE TEMPERA- TURE). F. Pirtiay, J. M. R. p. 23-30. 20 refs. In French. Heart I-ate and body temperature wet-e measured in 23 men walking on a treadmill during 1/2 an hour in a very hot environment with atn enet-gy expenditure of about 1 liter of oxygen per minute. A lineat- relationship was found between the two parametet-s, at least fot- the middle part of the diagram. For lower values, below 100 beatslmin, heart !-ate is influenced in a variable manner by the body temperatut-e. Above 170 beatslmin, heart rate approaches its highest value, and is hence no more influenced by hypet-thermy. From one subject to another, tlie extent of cardiac reaction varies considerably. On the avet-age, when body temperature increases by 1 deg C, heart rate inct-eases by 32.3 beats/niin, but extreme values are 21 and 46 beats/min. Tlie linearity of the diagram justifies the use of heart rate as a reference of a thermal overloading during muscular exet-cise in hot envit-onment. The individual compot-tment tt-uly reflects each subject's capacity in bearing hot climates. (Authot-) A70-I7432 PULMONARY DIFFUSING CAPACITY DURING MUSCULAR EXERCISE (DIFFUSION DE MUSCULAIRE). F. Pirnay, A. no. 1, 1969, p. 31-37. 26 refs. In French. The CO diffusing capacity has been measured by a 'steady state' method with direct measurenients of P sub CO in the alveolar air. Seven young males where tested during muscular exercises. The CO diffusing capacity increased without leveling off in relation to the energetic expense even till very high 0 sub 2 intake, ranging about 4 or 5 I/tnin. By each subject, the relation between the 0 sub 2 intake and the diffusing capacity was variable; by the whole gt-oup of subjects submitted to many tests, this relation seems to be linear. The possibility of a maximal pulmonat-y permeability that involves a humoral impairing during exhaustive work is discussed. (Authot-) A70-17433. DESIGN FOR A BREATHING VALVE WITH REDUCED AIR RESISTANCES (KONSTRUI<TION ElNES 28, 5 refs. In German. Higli resistances in a comtnonly used breathing valve led to the construction of a new valve. Tlie new design, based on aet-odynamic pt.inciples, allows the air to pass through tlie valve more easily. Laboratory and field tt-ials have shown the new design to be satisfactory.

Internatio~lale Zeitschrift fur angewa17dte Physiologic einschliesslich Arheitspl7ysiologie, vol. 28, no. 1, 1969, p. 61-75. 28 refs. Research supported by the Department of National Health and Welfare. Expel-imental investigation of the validity of an approxinlate theoretical equation describing the conductance of atmospheric oxygen to the working tissues of the human organism. Tests on a group of 14 young adults and 48 children indicate that the theoretical oxygen intake values are 15 to 20% higher than the experimental values. The discrepancies are linked to a local inhomo- geneity in the diffusion/perfusion relationships. V.Z. A70-17450 ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN UNLOADING REFLEX AM MENSCHEN). A. Strupplet-, 0. Mehls (Neurologische Munich, West Germany), and W. M. Landau (Neut-ologische I<linik. Munich. West Germany; Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.). Pfliigers Archiv, vol. 313, no. 2, 1969, p. 155-167. 16 refs. In German. Research supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Analysis of the unloading reflex in humans, using an experi- mental setup by which a muscle could be unloaded without any increase in tension and the acceleration of the unloading could be vat-ied independently of the preexisting innervation level. It is found that under both static and dynamic conditions thel-e regularly occurred a silent period with constant latency if certain tht-esholds of shortening and acceleration were exceeded during the shortening. This is interpreted as due to a decrease in spindle afferent dischat-ge and is compared with the temporal cout-se of the phasic muscle stretch reflex. The unloading reflex is dect-eased or disappeat-s cotnpletely if the mode of innervation of tnotor neurons during the initial baseline innervation is irregular and shows a tetidency to synchronize. The role of the mode of innetvation for the origin of the unloading reflex is discussed. A.B.I<. A70-17521 COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN LUNG MECHANICS BASED ON A SURVEY OF LITERATURE DATA. K. E. Spells (RAF, Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough, Hants., ingland). Respiration Phvsioloqy, vol. 8, Dec. 1969, p. 37-57. 101 refs. Data for the various components of compliance and resistance of the chest-lung system, and for inertance and natural frequency, have been collected for different species. Possible theoretical relationships have been indicated. Generally, the trends with body mass (m) are roughly as expected. A notable exception is the slow variation proportional to m(-0.393) implied by the statistical analysis of the data for total respiratory (less upper airway) resistance, but here the evidence is rather meagre. The data for inertance and natural frequency are too few for statistical analysis and are included mainly to emphasize the need for further experimental work to be undertaken. Theory suggests that the dimensionless product (total respiratory resistance times lung-thorax compliance times resting respiratory frequency) should be a constant independent of body mass, but insufficient evidence has been collected to confirm this. (Author) A70-17522 EFFECT OF SLOPE AND SHAPE OF DISSOCIATION CURVE ON PULMONARY GAS EXCHANGE. John B. West (Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, England). Respiratio~i Physiology, vol. 8, Dec. 1969, p. 66-85. I1 refs. Factors affecting gas exchange in the presence of ventilation- perfusion inequality have been examined. These include the slope and shape of the blood-gas dissociation curve, the type of ventilation- perfusion distribution, and whether the gas is being transferred into or out of the blood. It was found that the impairment of gas output caused by ventilation-perfusion inequality wasgreatest for inert gases of medium solubility such as nitrous oxide and was less for gases of both lower and higher solubilities. This was true both for sym- metrical and skewed log normal distributions of ventilation-perfusion ratios. The factors governing gas uptake were similar except at high inspired concentrations. The shape of the blood-gas dissociation curve made remarkably little difference to the effect of uneven distribution on gas transfer. For example, when the effects of the shapes per se of the 02 and C02 curves were compared, the differences were very small. In practice, the greater vultlerability of 02 uptake to ventilation-perfusion inequality can be explained by the slopes, not the shapes, of the two dissociation curves. (Author) A70-17598 HEARING THRESHOLD AND EAR-CANAL PRESSURE LEVELS WITH VARYING ACOUSTIC FIELD. E. A. G. Shaw (National Research Council, Div. of Applied Physics, Ottawa, Canada). Acoustical Society of America, Journal, vol. 46, Dec. 1969, pt. 2. p. 1502-1514. 9 refs. A well-damped circumaural enclosure is equipped with five independent acoustic driver units located at cardinal positions. The acoustic field near the external ear may thus be varied in a manner corresponding to angle of incidence. The acoustic pressure at a well-defined position at the ear-canal entrance is measured with a probe tube passing under the circumaural cushion. With each subject and frequency, the driver voltage level at hearing threshold LC and the ear-canal response REC are determined for each driver unit in turn. A double series of measurements has been made with six subjects from 1 to 12 kHz and three to six subjects from 13 to 16 kHz at 1-kHz intervals. The ear-canal pressure level at hearing threshold LE is found to be virtually independent of the acoustic- field geometry up to 12 kHz. Changes in LC and REC observed after a one-week interval can be related to changes in (1) subject hearing sensitivity, (2) coupling between probe-tube orifice and ear-canal wave pattetn, and (3) coupling between the various driver units and the ear canal. Changes in subject sensitivity are approximately 2 dB, independent of frequency, up to at least 13 kHz. Probe coupling changes are small below 9 kHz. At the higher frequencies, driver coupling changes are occasionally very large (more than 20 dB in extreme cases), generally much greater than changes in subject sensitivity, and dependent on frequency in a distinctive manner related to the geometry of the sound field.

Experimental sttidy of the influence of different physical pi-operties of observed objects on their visibility by the human eye. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the existence of quantitative relationships between the visibility of simple solitary objects on the one hand and the proposed fundamental character- istics of visual sensitivity and resolution on the other hand. One series of experiments measured contrast sensitivity at variable temporal and spatial frequencies. A generalized equation is derived for the spatial and temporal resolving power as a function of pattern contrast and average luminance. Another series of experiments provides evidence that there is no interaction between threshold detection processes for patterns of different orientations and of different spatial frequencies; this suggests that these processes are functionally separate. Additional experiments show a correlation between subjective pattern perception and the visual evoked potentials recorded from the occipital part of the cortex with scalp electrodes. T.M. A70-17649 ENGINEERING IN THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. G. H. Myers (New York, University, New York, N.Y.) and Victor Parsonnet (New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry, Newark, N.J.). New York, Wiley-lnterscience, 1969. 210 p. 105 refs. $14.95. This book is devoted to the technological, device-oriented aspects of artificial internal organs in the human cardiovascular system. The principal devices discussed are the pacemakers, the artificial heart, heart valves, and vascular prostheses. These devices are covered from three aspects. First, there is a description of the pertinent physiology of the 'natural' human organ, written so that a knowledge of b'iology is unnecessary to understand the nature of the material. Second, there is a summary of the basic operating principles of the most important of the devices of the class (including many in the research stage). Third, there is a review of the materials used in the implanted devices, in which particular attention is given to their properties in a biological environment. Numerous tables and experi- mental data are included in this category. The approach is to indicate the general working principles of each of the devices, along with the relative problems and advantages, and to show the areas in which future improvement may be expected. Thus researchers and clinicians in the field may learn the general methods of operation and the theoretical principles of new devices. Data on the physiology and materials involved is presented.

(A7047702 06-05) Van Nuys, Calif., Surv~val and Fl~ght Equipment Association. 1969, p. 47-57. Description of the results of a fleet evaluation program of the AOH-1 helmet, a single integrated assembly designed to replace the standard flight helmet, oxygen mask retainer kit and mask-mounted or panel-mounted oxygen regulator. The evaluation program was carried out by means of a questionnaire, which was completed by approximately 150 pilots, and by means of many individual reports which were received from both military and civilian personnel who wore the helmet. The completed questionnaire is summarized, and some of the reports are excerpted. M.M. A70-17713 # OPTIMAL COLORS FOR MARICERS AND SIGNALS. Robert L. Hilgendorf (USAF, Aerospace Medical Research Labora- tories, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio). IN: SURVIVAL AND FLIGHT EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL FLIGHT SAFETY, SURVIVAL AND PERSONAL EQUIPMENT SYMPOSIUM, 7TH. LAS VEGAS, NEV., OCTOBER 27-30, 1969, PROCEEDINGS. VOLUME 1. (A70-17702 06-05) Van Nuys, Calif., Survival and Flight Equipment Association, 1969, p. 121-131. 7 refs. Study of certain segments of three main aspects of the problem of what color or colors to use for target andlor rescue markers. These are (1) the color of the stimulus (marker or signal), (2) color of the background for the stimulus (terrain color, sea, etc.), and (3) ambient illumination or viewing condition of the stimulus and hackgt-ound (daylight, dusk, night, etc.). Major attention is given to the effects of these factors on the time required to detect a signal and make a response, and the ability to correctly identify the color of the signal. Reddish colors are considered to be the most universally effective. F.R.L. A70-17714 * AIR CRASH RESCUE IN THE ARMY. William R. Briot (NASA, Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, Tex.).

Astronaut Armstrong ejected after the vehicle went out of control and crashed when pressure was lost in the attitude-control system. NASA test pilot Algranti ejected at 90 ft, a second before the trainer crashed and burst into flame. It was concluded that wind forces were the primary cause of the crash. The working sequence of the ejection system is outlined. F.R.L. A70-17750 f RADIATION Biophysics, 3rd. Ca171hridge, Mass., Aug. 29-Sept. 3, 1969, Paper. 10 p. Reseal-ch supported by the Bundesministerium fiir Wissenschaftliche Forschung. Study of the effects of X rays arid UV (radiation on the bacteria Escherichia coli B/r in a vacuum of 0.00001 tort-. It is shown that tlie inactivation of the irradiated cells was much increased as compared with the controls irt-adiated at an atmospheric pressure. It is found that the sensitivity to X rays in vacuums was enhanced by a factot- of 4, and the sensitivity of to UV even by a factor of 10. It is excluclecl that the increased UV sensitivity was due to a selection of UV-sensitive mutants bv a vacuum treatment. Z.W.

Derivation of a quantitative characteristic of the central com- pensatory process on the basis of a study of the mystagmus responses of guinea pigs subjected to bilateral labyrinthectomy carried out in two stages. After removal of the left labyrinth, a clearly expressed rightward spontaneous nystagmus was noted. In this case the average number of nystagmus strokes per 20 sec amounted to 45 plus or minus 4. A day after the operation, this number decreased to 21 plus or minus 2 (i.e., a decrease of 54%). Thereafter, the number of nystagmus strokes continued to decrease, until eight days after the operation no spontaneous nystagmus was observed in any of the animals. After removal of the right labyrinth, a spontaneous nystagmus toward the initially removed labyrinth was noted. In this case the average number of nystagmus strokes amounted to 25 plus or minus 4.5 (or about 56% of the value obtained after the first operation). A day after the operation, this number decreased by 50% and continued to decrease thereafter. A.B.K. A70-17822 FORTY GERMINAL PAPERS IN HUMAN HEARING: A SOURCE BOOK IN PSYCHOACOUSTICS. Edited by J.

George P. Vose (Texas Woman's University, Denton, Tex.) and Lewis M. Hurxthal (Lahey Clinic Foundation, Boston. Mass.). American Journal of Roentgenology, Racliuni Therapy and Nuclear Medicine, vol. 106, July 1969, p. 486-490. 6 refs. Grant No. NGR-44-013-005. Study of the effects of rec~tnibency on bone density. Three young adults participated in a study involving 14 days of complete bed rest, and one subject was retained as an ambulatory control. A slight but significant increase in X-ray density at the os calcis site was noted among the bed rest subjects as the study progressed, but the increase was not evident in the control subject. No significant density variations occurred in the hand phalanx or distal radius. Periodic caliper measurements of the heel indicated that increased tissue thickness during the latter phases of bed rest may have accounted for the apparent gain in X-ray density of the os calcis. An adequate soft tissue correction factor must be applied in future studies of the effects of bed rest and weightlessness upon skeletal density. M.V.E. A70-18015 * ESTIMATION OF CHANGES IN BONE CALCIUM CONTENT BY RADIOGRAPHIC DENSITOMETRY. George P. Vose (Texas Woman's University, Denton, Tex.). Radiology, vol. 93, Oct. 1969, p. 841 -844. 8 refs. Grant No. NGR-44-013-005. Description of an experiment equating percentage changes in 'X-ray calibration wedge mass equivalency' to actual changes in bone calcium content. Utilizing X-ray mass absorption coefficients deter- mined for a heterogeneous beam, it was determined that a decrease in wedge mass equivalency of 4% in the as calcis within a 14-day period would represent a loss of 6 mg of calcium per day. Such a loss may be possible in a small trabecular bone such as the os calcis but obviously cannot be concurrent throughout the skeleton. Previously reported X-ray absorption changes of -2.91% and -2.87% in the Gemini 7 astronauts indicate a probable calcium loss of about 3 mg a day from the os calcis. M.V.E. A70-18016 AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECTS OF STRESS UPON SKILLED PERFORMANCE. M. Hammerton and A. H. Tickner (Medical Research Council, Cambridge, England). Ergonomics, vol. 12, Nov. 1969, p. 851 -855. 6 refs. Investigation of the effect of an anxiety-producing situation, such as an impending parachute jump, on the performance of a pilot in the execution of an acquisition tracking task. Tests on a group of 19 expelienced Regular Army men, a group of 9 Regular Army trainees and a group of 16 Territorial Army trainees showed that the effects of such situations were more in evidence in the Territorial Army trainees, less in evidence in the Regular Army trainees and did not occur in the experienced Regular Army men. It is concluded that anxiety does affect the execution of such tasks but its effects can be minimized by appropriate training. V.Z. A70-18017 HEART RATE AND THE CONCEPT OF CIRCULATORY LOAD. G. C. E. Burger (Amsterdam, University, Amsterdam, r\\!etherlands). Ergonomics, vol. 12, Nov. 1969, p. 857-864. 21 refs. Discussion of physiological functional loads produced in humans by dynamic and static muscular work, exposures to extremely hot or cold environments, mental stresses, and information pt-ocessing assignments. The validity of oxygen consumption and heartbeat rates as integral ergonomic criteria is assessed, showing that these criteria are effective only for heavy dynamic musculat- loads. A concept of circulatory load designed to cover the above mentioned variety of physiological loads is introduced and its quality as a more universal ergonomic criterion is analyzed. V.Z. A70-18018 MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING OF AN AIRCRAFT HANDLING RATING SCALE. J. F. Murrell (Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough, Hants., England). Ergonomics, vol. 12, Nov. 1969, p. 925-933. 7 refs. Discussion of the quality of the Cooper aircraft handling rating scale on the basis of the experience of test pilots who used it during flight. An analysis of the responses of individual pilots indicates that problems arise in comparing the ratings when they are obtained by different users of the scale. It is concluded that the Cooper Scale cannot be used as an equal interval scale when ratings are made by one pilot, because of a severe data distortion. Suggestions are made as to how the scale could be used more effectively. V.Z. A70-18085 # A REVIEW OF ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH EXHAUST PRODUCTS FROM BERYLLIUM SOLID PRO- PELLANT. F. G. Gorman and H. M. White (Aerospace Gorp., San Bernardino, Calif.). American lnstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Stli, New York, N.Y., Jan. 19-21, 1970, Paper 70-1 17. 13 p. 46 refs. Members, $1.00; nonmembers, $1.50. Development of high-performance Be motors has been impeded by existing restrictions. Actions by govet-nment agencies which have been taken pertaining to curtailment of open-air test firings of high-performance solid rocket motors utilizing beryllium (Be) powder as a fuel are summarized. Atmospheric contamination of cities from existing firing sites is examined by means of mathematical model predictions and actual exhaust sample data; results indicate concentrations are within limits recommended by NAS-NRC. A critical review of existing restrictive measures is recommended in light of present toxicological information; recent analytical and biological test data indicate that exhaust products from Be motors are essentially insoluble and hence present few health hazards, so that safety can be assured by adherence to reasonable control standards. A methodology whereby Be propellant could be de- veloped for high-performance rocket motors is suggested. (Author) A70-18123 ' i/ HYDRODYNAMIC PROBLEMS IN BLOOD COAGULATION. H. E. Petschek and R. F. Weiss (Avco Everett Research Laboratory, Everett, Mass.). American lnstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Aerospace Sciences Meeting, 8th. New York, N.Y., Jan. 19-21, 1970, Paper 70-143. 16 p. 18 refs. Members, $1.00; nonmembers, $1.50. NIH Contract No. PH 43-67-1120; Contract No. NASw-1894. Recent experimental observations of thrombus formation in a stagnation point flow are described. The coagulation process includes diffusion of platelets to the surface, attachment of white cells within a critical radial distance of the stagnation point and subseqctent aggregation of platelets near white cells. The radius of the white cell attachment region increases with decreasing flow parameter, and is correlated by the local surface shear stress. The experimental data are analyzed with a two-phase, non-Newtonian flow model. The velocity field and surface stress distribution are calculated with an ap- proximate viscosity law, using a boundary layer formulation, and a white cell bonding stress is deduced. Diffusion of platelets is shown to depend on red cell tumbling, and an approximate diffusion coefficient is derived. The calculated platelet diffusion rate is compared to experimental data, and the effects of rouleaux formation are considered. Finally, perturbations of the flowfield due to aggregation and thrombus growth are analyzed. The dependence of thrombus shape and growth rate on flow separation and wake formation is also discussed.

Research supported by the Charles A. King Trust; PHS Grant No. RR-88. Evaluation of the use of frequency spectra of arterial sounds as a tool in the study of atherosclerosis. Frequency analyses of these sounds were performed and their spectra correlated with a fluid mechanical model of turbulence produced by jet-like flow past an occlusion. On the basis of these results, significant information can be obtained concerning the diameter of the vessel, the degree of occlusion, and the local flow velocity. The noninvasive technique appears to have widespread application in the study of arterial disease. M.V.E.

Munro (MIT, Cambridge, Mass.). National Academy of Sciences, Proceedings, vol. 64, Oct. 1969, p. 677-682. 17 refs. PHs Grants No. CA-08893-04; No. AM-11237; Grant No. NGR-22-009-272. Hepatic polysome profiles vary in untreated rats as a function of time of day. The ratio of polysomes to total ribosomes increases from 50 to 73 per cent in darkness. There is also a daily rhythm in tyrosine transaminase activity which resembles but does not coincide with the polyso~ne rhythm. Both rhythms are dependent on the cyclic ingestion of dietary 131-otein, and disappear in rats given a rotein in-free diet. (Author) A70-18405 EARLY PHASE 0' MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIC INJURY AND INFARCTION. Robert B. Jennings (Northwestern University, Chicago, III.). Anlerical~ Jo~/r/7al of Cardiology, vol. 24, Dec. 1969, p. 753-765. 55 refs. Research supported by the Chic~go Heat-t Association; NIH Grant No. HE-80729. The acute effects of ischemia on myocardial tissue are reviewed in this papel- with emphasis on how the events observed in experimental myocardial ischemic injury in dogs relate to the sequential changes occurring in the myoca~dium of man during the first few hours after the onset of acute infarction. The general effects of ischemia on myocardium include those which are secondary to a diminished local supply of substances such as oxygen and metabo- lites as well as changes resulting from the impaired diffusion of substances such as lactic acid and electrolytes from the poorly perfused ischemic tissue to the genet-al circulation. Cell death (irreversible injury) first develops after 20 minutes of ischemia in areas of maximum injury in the dog heart and infarcts are not fully developed for GO to 120 minutes after occlusion. Prior to the developnient of cell death, the severely ischemic cells are reversibly injured and show a vat-iety of altet-ations fl-om normal. These changes include depletion of supplies of glycogen and high energy phosphate, increased content of lactic acid and hydrogen, relaxation of myofibrils and failure of contraction. Cells which have just died show the same changes as well as mitocho~ldrial, electrolyte, and nuclear defects. Which, if any, of the preceding changes causes the development of irreversibility in ischemic injut-y remains to be established. Some data is presented in support of the hypothesis that mitochondria1 defects may be CI-itical in the genesis of the il-reversible state. (Author) A70-18406 BIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS OF EARLY MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA. Robert B. Case, Michel G. Nasset-, and Richard S. Crampton (St. Lulte's Hospital Center, New York, N.Y.). American Journal of Cardiology, vol. 24, Dec. 1969, p. 766-775. 55 refs. PHs Grant No. HE-02621. Tlie biochemical disturbances resulting from inadequate coronary blood flow are briefly reviewed. Results of experiments in which the onset of myocardial ischemia was examined by use of a continuous sampling technic are presented. At the point of maximal coronal-y ar-teriolar dilatation, a rise in coronary sintts lactate and potassium levels occurred simultaneously, accompanied hy a rise in left atrial pressure. The rates of potassium loss and lactate PI-oduc- tion from ischemic tissue wet-e directly related; the ratio was approximately 1 :2 on a molar basis. The total amount of potassium lost by the left ventricle after 7 minutes of ischemia was estimated to be 1.0 per cent of its normal content, and 5.4 per cent aftet- 17 minutes of ischemia. Restoration of COI-onary flow resulted in potassium uptake, indicating that potassium lost ft-om an ischemic area is replaced quickly in the presence of adequate COI-onary flow. Electrocardiogt-aphic correlation showed that depression of the junction between the QRS complex and the S-T segment appeared simultaneo~tsly with the rise in coronary sinus potassium and lactate levels. The junction became progressively more depressed as metabolic evidence of ischemia increased. The flat 'ischemic' S-T segment depl-ession was a latet- feature, appearing only aftel- ischemia had been well established for several minutes. The early electro- cardiographic changes seen in these experiments are not currently accepted as evidence of ischemia in clinical pt-actice.

Research suppot-ted by the Centl-al Association; NlH Grant No. HE-12498. Ventriculat- ectopic beats may be generated during acute myocardial infarction as the result of enhanced automaticity in the His-Put-kinje system, focal reexcitation due to the flow of CUI-rent between myocardial fibet-s which are repolarized at dispat-ate times, or reentry of the impulse induced by local impait-ment of excitability and conductivity in the ventricular tissues. The ect c beats occur more ft-equently when the basic ventt-icular rate is slow, and the danger of fatal episodes of ventricular fibrillation is also increased at slow ventricular I-ates. Fibrillation is more likely to be induced by early ectopic beats in the ventl-icle dut-ing myocat-dial infarction, because the development of sustained ectopic activity and tut-bulent impulse propagation is facilitated by increased inhomogeneity of the ventricular tissues with respect to excitability and conductivity, The aggressive prevention and tt-eatment of ventricular ectopic beats and bradyarrhythmia was emphasized as one of the most effective means of PI-eventing life-thl-eatening ventricular fibl-illation and lowering mortality trates from acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms of action of various drugs and the efficacy of increased ventricular rates in suppressing ectopic activity were discussed. It was concluded that the artificial pacing of the heart at !relatively rapid rates is a valuable adjunct to the measures used in the management of ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute myocat-dial infarction.

Campbell (Cambridge University, Cambridge, England). Science, vol. 167, Jan. 23, 1970, p. 386, 387,6 refs. Research supported by the Medical Research Council. The amplitude of the potential evoked by a moving grating, recorded from the occipital scalp, is less when it is oblique compared with vertical and horizontal. This inequality is not found by recording the electroretinogram. Thus, orientational effects must arise between the site of origin of the electroretinogram and the evoked cortical response. (Author) A70-18408 THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF BRADYCARDIC RHYTHMS IN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. Douglas P. Zipes (Naval Hospital, Pot-tsmouth, Va.). Americall Joorr~al of Cardiology, vol. 24, Dec. 1969, p. 814-825. 64 refs. The clinical significance of bradycardic rhythms as they pertain to patients developing acute myocardial infarctions is reviewed. Proper therapy of the at-rhythmia frequently is pr-edicated on an undet-standing of (1) the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the production of the bradyarrhythmia, (2) the hemodynamic and electrophysiologic consequences of the slow ventricular rate, and (3) the exact electrocardiogt-aphic interpretation of the bradycardic rhythm. These three points are discussed in detail and illustrated by appropriate electrocardiographic examples. The factors t-esponsible for the production of the bt-adycardic t-hythm as well as the consequences of the slow heart rate may be unique in a patient with an acute myocardial infarction. The advent of artificial pacing has made it mandatory to be able to predict initiatly which bt-adyar- I-hythmia is likely to be pt-ogt-essive-in terms of further, more severe distut-bance in impulse fot-mation or conduction, or hemodynamic or electtophysiologic consequences-and may not respond to a medical approach. A~tificial pacing must be instituted early in patients with these disturbances.
