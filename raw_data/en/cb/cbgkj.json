It's a common question asked by many skeptics and first-time users. Now, after five years of use, I can confidently add my voice to the thousands of other positive reviews attesting to the effectiveness of crystal deodorant. Table of Contents What is crystal deodorant? It looks like a block of quartz. It's also known as an alum stone, made of naturally occurring mineral salts. When applied, it leaves an invisible salt film on the surface of the skin to prevent or slow down odour-causing bacterial growth. In this respect, it's a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. Regular antiperspirants contain aluminum chlorohydrate or aluminum zirconium that blocks the sweat glands and prevents wetness. Crystal deodorants help prevent odour, not wetness. It works It works through bacteriostatic action. Given that it's not an antiperspirant, it doesn't penetrate the skin or clog pores. It remains on the surface of the skin and acts as a coagulant. It constricts protein, a food source of bacteria, so bacteria die, reducing odour. The salt molecules in the alum raise PH levels. Bacteria hate high PH. It's effective, working all day long, and then some. There are travel days that are so long, they stretch into two. Even when showers aren't readily available, crystal deodorant has performed better than other products I've used. How to apply The best time to use a crystal deodorant stone is immediately after showering when underarms are clean and damp. If you're without access to a shower, clean the underarms to remove any odour. Crystal deodorant won't mask any existing odour; it works best on clean skin to prevent odour. Wet the stone by running its top under water and then apply it to each underarm. Dampen the stone as necessary so it glides smoothly. Rub the stone up and down or in a circular motion. Other advantages of crystal deodorant 1. It's natural Crystal deodorant doesn't contain artificial fragrances or perfumes to mask body odour. It's free of the synthetic chemicals aluminum chlorohydrate, zirconium, and chloride. Also absent are phthalates, silicones, dyes, and parabens. As a result, it's a better choice for people with sensitive or easily irritated skin. 2. It reduces plastic waste The travel size produced by [Crystal](https://packinglighttravel.com/product/B000L998JY/US/packlightra0d-20/) is packed in a recyclable plastic dispenser. It's not ideal from an environmental perspective, but it's a step in the right direction because the crystal lasts for many months. An [alum stone](https://packinglighttravel.com/product/B08QS18B7K/US/packlightra0d-20/) is available 'naked' in various shapes. The danger in using a stone without a container is that when wet, it can slip from the fingers and break into many pieces when it hits the floor. I've found that the plastic base of the travel size is shaped for an effective grip. Also, as the stone becomes smaller and should it disengage from the container, the base of the stone retains a circular lip that is easy to hold. 3. It's readily available All too often, natural products are only available online. Shipping individual purchases to individual consumers isn't an eco-friendly practice. Besides being hard on the environment, the shipping costs are hard on the wallet. I purchased my first travel-sized crystal deodorant at my local health foods store. But, increasingly, I've seen it in the travel-sized section of drug stores. This makes it much more accessible at an affordable price. 4. There's no residue left on clothing Residue on clothing from traditional antiperspirants is a thing of the past. Those chalky streaks on fabric as it brushed over freshly applied deodorant sometimes required a change of clothes. With crystal deodorant, there's no residue left behind on clothing. 5. It's cheap The price is on par with other deodorants of a similar quantity. However, because my crystal deodorants have far outlasted any other deodorant I've used, it's an economical choice. 7. It doesn't expire Unlike most other deodorants with a three-year expiry date, crystal deodorant is composed of 99.99% crystallized mineral salts, which accounts for its long shelf life. However, [crystal products](https://packinglighttravel.com/product/B00AKCT6ZI/US/packlightra0d-20/) infused with ingredients such as aloe vera have an expiry date. 8. It's travel friendly For packing light travellers, crystal deodorant can be a game-changer. The [travel version](https://packinglighttravel.com/product/B000L998JY/US/packlightra0d-20/) from Crystal is 1.5 ounces (40 grams) in a container that's 2.75 inches (7 centimetres) tall with a base 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) across at the base. It's relatively lightweight, takes up very little space, and doesn't leak. Also, it's not a liquid, gel, aerosol, or powder. It's a solid, so it doesn't need to be packed in a '3-1-1' bag for carry-on travel. This is useful for carry-on travellers with limited space in their one-quart/one-litre bag. But... Crystal deodorant isn't an antiperspirant. It isn't for everyone, especially those who perspire profusely. It might require a break-in period. Some bodies need a 'deodorant detox' from mainstream deodorants and antiperspirants. Give crystal deodorant a week for your body to adjust. You might be satisfied with the results.
