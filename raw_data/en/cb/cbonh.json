Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the United States, SCLC accounts for 10-20% of all lung cancers. Although progress has been made in recent years, the majority of patients with advanced stage lung cancer still die from their disease. New treatments are needed. Precision medicine continues to impact the lives of lung cancer patients with research into genomics and genetics leading to unprecedented progress in improving outcomes. Tailored treatments have emerged to match a person's genetic makeup or a tumor's genetic profile. As a result, patients with lung cancer now typically receive molecular testing that guides their physicians in determining which therapies are more likely to boost the chances of survival while limiting the potential for adverse effects. Results from studies evaluating immunomodulatory approaches using anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have demonstrated promising results and are advancing the standard of care for lung cancer. PD-1 is a protein that inhibits certain types of immune responses. Drugs that block PD-1, such as Keytruda may enhance the ability of the immune system to fight cancer. KEYNOTE-028 is an ongoing early stage clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of Keytruda in more than 450 patients with PD-L1 positive cancers. The clinical trial results were presented by Dr. Patrick Ott from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The updated findings from 24 heavily pre-treated patients with advanced SCLC demonstrated a confirmed response rate of 33.3 percent including one complete response and seven partial responses. The responses to treatment were durable, with an average duration of response of 19.4 months (range: 3.6+ to 20.0+). Keytruda was well tolerated and reported side effects were consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. \"These long-term data, which show meaningful response rates and durable responses in certain patients with small cell lung cancer, are encouraging,\" said Dr. Ott. \"With these findings, we are advancing understanding of the potential for immunotherapy to make a difference for these patients.\" A larger trial, KEYNOTE-158, has been initiated to further evaluate Keytruda in advanced SCLC and malignant pleural mesothelioma.
