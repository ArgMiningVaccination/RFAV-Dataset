Dear Pediatrician, Between [flu shot season](https://www.forbes.com/health/family/when-to-get-flu-shot-for-child/) and COVID-19 vaccines, I'm struggling with my child and shot anxiety. I'm not sure what I can do to ease their nerves over needles, or how to make it hurt less. And as a parent, it's hard to watch them scream and cry over every little jab. Can you help? Sincerely, Sick Over Shots Dear Sick Over Shots, I see parents who share your worries nearly every day; you are not alone. The stress of shots is very real for many young people, and the consequences of shot anxiety and needle phobia can last a lifetime. Kudos to you for reaching out for help. How Common Is Shot Anxiety? Most kids can successfully tolerate injections. But for a significant few, getting a shot is a severely disturbing experience with lifelong implications. In the U.S., 3% to 10% of adults have a high degree of fear over needles, with some even developing a phobia [[1]](#footnote_1). The intensity of needle fear ranges from a \"nervous stomach\" to debilitating panic attacks, and can worsen over time. For people with needle phobia, the anxiety surrounding getting an injection biologically heightens the pain response. This chemical reaction increases the immediate pain sensation the person experiences in the short-term, while priming long-term memory for additional fear response. This cycle can repeat over time, potentially worsening the fear and anxiety as a person ages. Why Is It Important to Deal with Shot Anxiety? For people with chronic medical conditions requiring routine injections (like diabetes), needle fear contributes to negative health effects. In addition, shot anxiety is a marker for future vaccine hesitancy. Directly addressing and treating needle phobia and shot anxiety when your child is young has the power to improve their health care over their lifetime. Specifically, managing shot anxiety and needle phobia is one pathway to long-term vaccine acceptance, and improves the likelihood of your child receiving proper preventative health care on their own, when they get older. How Can I Prepare My Child for Shots? If your child gets nervous before shots, here are some steps to take to help your child (and pediatrician) get through the experience with less stress: Before the Doctor's Office - Never promise there will be no shots. Although it may feel like a harmless phrase, promising no shots at office visits gives your child false reassurance and can threaten parental trust. In addition, since the recommended vaccine schedule frequently changes, your pediatrician might recommend a shot when you don't expect it. Making the \"no shot\" promise delays opportunities to get vaccine protection and may result in additional office visits and costs. - You know your kid best. Some children do better in the office when they know a shot may be coming. If they need preparation time, briefly discuss the possibility beforehand. However, if the knowledge of an upcoming vaccine increases your child's worry, save the conversation until after arriving at the office. - Shots hurt. Don't lie about it. I like the phrase, \"Getting a shot can hurt a little, but it's helping your body get stronger. Any pain you feel will go away quickly. I'll be here to hold your hand, if you like. Or, you can sit at the exam table by yourself. Which would you like to do?\" At the Doctor's Office - Don't use shots as a threat. There are few phrases more frustrating to a pediatrician than parents who say, \"If you don't behave, the doctor is going to give you a shot.\" Although the comment may seem funny or lighthearted at the moment, it's time to drop it. This statement encourages your child to associate shots with punishment, which is damaging and untrue. Plus, associating any medical intervention as a consequence of behavior sets kids up for mistrust of the medical system. - Be careful of words that make it worse. Apologizing about a vaccine and expressing excessive reassurance and empathy increases anticipatory fear. Rather than providing comfort, our emotional overcompensation results in the perceived pain of the injection being amplified. In other words, when parents talk too much about the shots, kids get more worried and fearful than if fewer words were spoken. So, keep it short and sweet. When shots are discussed, use honest language, make explanations brief, stay calm, keep a matter-of-fact attitude and don't project a personal concern about discomfort onto the kids. How To Make Shots Hurt Less We cannot make injections pain-free for every child. That being said, complete elimination of pain is not necessarily the goal. Working through a painful experience and managing this type of stress is an important part of growing up. For kids with needle fear, achieving this ability requires a dedicated and supportive plan. - Stay on track. Needle fear does not develop until around 5 years of age. Following the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine schedule means your child will get many required vaccines before that age. - Grab the screens. Screen time can be a welcome distraction for your child. Grab the phone, iPad or gaming device and zone out. Wearing headphones seems to improve the effect. - If multiple injections are needed, request the most painful shot be given last. Trust me, we know which shots hurt the most. - Trick the pain receptors. Pain perception is a complex process with lots of parts. With certain distractions, pain perception can be diminished. Common ways to do this include ice packs, vibration devices and (my favorite) the cough trick. When a child is about to receive a shot, ask them to cough three times. If the injection is done during the second cough, the perception of pain can be decreased. - Use numbing spray. Ethyl chloride is a topical anesthetic spray used to decrease injection pain. After being sprayed on the skin, the ice-like effect numbs the skin for about one minute. Ethyl chloride has been shown to lessen injection pain, and it's quick and easy to use. Ask your doctor's office if this is something they supply. - Topical lidocaine cream is available over the counter. Apply a thick layer of cream to the location of the injections at least 30 minutes before arriving at the office. Alternatively, prescription-strength topical anesthetic creams and patches might be available with your doctor's approval. - For kids with extreme anxiety, short-acting [anti-anxiety medication](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/anxiety-medication/)can be prescribed. If your child is needing this level of support, seeking professional help to directly address needle fear is the best long-term solution. There are numerous evidence-based treatments\u2014ask your pediatrician for a recommendation. Addressing a child's needle fear is important to de-escalate the short-term stress and to minimize the long-term physical and emotional trauma of injections. Ask your pediatrician what tips and tricks they recommend for shot anxiety.
