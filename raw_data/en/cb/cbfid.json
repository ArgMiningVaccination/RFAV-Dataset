If a doctor determines that a test for COVID-19 is needed, it will be sent to a laboratory that is able to perform testing for COVID-19. Remember, a test is not a treatment or a cure. If you have symptoms, stay home and maintain your distance from others. Double-down on hand washing and cleaning surfaces you frequently touch. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, including if you plan to be tested or are waiting for your results, you should self-quarantine. Even if your results are negative, if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and your doctor feels it is likely you have the disease, you should continue to self-quarantine for 7 days after the start of your symptoms, 72 hours after your fever resolves without fever-reducing medicines, and until your symptoms are significantly improved, whichever is longest.
