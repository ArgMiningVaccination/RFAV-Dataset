For most kids who are relatively healthy, vitamins aren't a necessity. However, we understand the struggles of getting your child to eat nutritious foods so vitamins are a great choice for most kids. Vitamins are a great way to supplement a diet and give your child the extra nutrients they need to grow big and strong. Ultimately, a great diet should give your child all of the vitamins and minerals they need to grow, feel good, and stay healthy. Keep in mind that supplementing your child's diet with vitamins will ensure you're covering all of their health-related bases. If you're a parent worried about the ingredients in vitamins, we totally get it. Thankfully, there are a number of organic kids vitamins available on the market and we'll show you our favorites in this article! When Should Kids Start Taking Vitamins? The age at which your child should start taking vitamins is usually around the age of four. Most healthy children who are growing steadily don't need a vitamin supplement, but it's always good to check with their doctor. As your child gets to the age of four and their diet diversifies, it's probably a good idea to give them multivitamins unless their doctor suggests otherwise. The worst-case scenario if your child takes vitamins is that they take too much of their daily limit for a particular vitamin. This won't lead to any significant health problems, but should still be dealt with immediately by reducing their vitamin intake. What to Look for In Organic Kids Vitamins There are a few key ingredients in kid's vitamins that you should look out for. These include vitamins A, E, K, C, and D and are usually found in most organic kids' vitamins. You shouldn't give your child more vitamin A, E, or K than their recommended daily intake for their age group. You can find out their daily recommendation from the label on their vitamins. However, vitamin C and D, which are water-soluble vitamins can be taken at more than 100% of your kid's daily limit. Do Vitamins Expire? Even the best organic kids vitamins will expire at some point...but do they really expire? The answer is no, they don't actually expire. Vitamins don't become unsafe to ingest when they expire, they simply become less potent. Most of the ingredients in vitamins and other dietary supplements break down over time. So giving your child an expired vitamin isn't the end of the world, but just remember you can't expect expired vitamins to be as potent. How to Dispose of Expired Vitamins Next time your kid's vitamins expire don't just throw them in the trash! This can put children and animals at risk for possibly consuming them. Also, avoid flushing them down a toilet since it can lead to water contamination. The FDA recommends that you mix the vitamins with used coffee grounds or cat litter. Then, put that mixture into a sealed bag and throw the entire bag in the trash.
