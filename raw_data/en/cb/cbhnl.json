Please help [Plants](/wiki/Plant) that produce [toxins](/wiki/Toxin) and/or causes irritation on contact are referred to as poisonous plants. [[1]](#cite_note-1) The toxins in poisonous plants affect [herbivores](/wiki/Herbivore), and deter them from consuming the plants. Plants cannot move to escape their predators, so they must have other means of protecting themselves from herbivorous animals. Some plants have physical defenses such as [thorns, spines and prickles](/wiki/Thorns,_spines_and_prickles), but by far the most common type of protection is chemical. [[2]](#cite_note-2) Over millennia, through the process of [natural selection](/wiki/Natural_selection), plants have [evolved](/wiki/Evolution_of_plants) the means to produce a vast and complicated array of chemical compounds to deter herbivores. [Tannin](/wiki/Tannin), for example, is a defensive compound that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more complex molecules such as [polyacetylenes](/wiki/Polyyne) are found in younger groups of plants such as the [Asterales](/wiki/Asterales). Many of the known [plant defense compounds](/wiki/Plant_defense_against_herbivory) primarily defend against consumption by [insects](/wiki/Insect), though other animals, including humans, that consume such plants may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild discomfort to death. Many of these poisonous compounds also have important [medicinal](/wiki/Medicinal_plants) benefits. [[3]](#cite_note-3) The varieties of [phytochemical](/wiki/Phytochemistry) defenses in plants are so numerous that many questions about them remain unanswered, including: - Which plants have which types of defense? - Which herbivores, specifically, are the plants defended against? - What chemical structures and mechanisms of toxicity are involved in the compounds that provide defense? - What are the potential medical uses of these compounds? These questions and others constitute an active area of research in modern [botany](/wiki/Botany), with important implications for understanding plant evolution and medical science. Below is an extensive, if incomplete, list of plants containing one or more poisonous parts that pose a serious risk of illness, injury, or death to humans or domestic animals. There is significant overlap between plants considered poisonous and those with [psychotropic properties](/wiki/Psychedelic_plants), some of which are toxic enough to present serious health risks at recreational doses. There is a distinction between plants that are poisonous because they naturally produce dangerous phytochemicals, and those that may become dangerous for other reasons, including but not limited to infection by bacterial, viral, or fungal parasites; the uptake of [toxic compounds](/wiki/Phytotoxin) through contaminated soil or groundwater; and/or the ordinary processes of decay after the plant has died; this list deals exclusively with plants that produce phytochemicals. Many plants, such as [peanuts](/wiki/Peanut), produce compounds that are only dangerous to people who have developed an [allergic reaction](/wiki/Allergy) to them, and with a few exceptions, those plants are not included here (see [list of allergens](/wiki/List_of_allergens) instead). Despite the wide variety of plants considered poisonous, human fatalities caused by poisonous plants - especially resulting from accidental ingestion - are rare in the developed world. [[4]](#cite_note-4) Poisonous plants that are food[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_poisonous_plants&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Many plants commonly used as food possess toxic parts, are toxic unless processed, or are toxic at certain stages of their lives. Some only pose a serious threat to certain animals (such as cats, dogs, or [livestock](/wiki/Livestock)) or certain types of people (such as infants, the elderly, or individuals with pathological vulnerabilities). Most of these food plants are safe for the average adult to eat in modest quantities. Notable examples include: which in high doses is toxic to dogs, cats, and some types of livestock. Cats are more sensitive. [[5]](#cite_note-5) [Asparagus officinalis](/wiki/Asparagus_officinalis) [Asparagus](/wiki/Asparagus) [Asparagus officinalis](/wiki/Asparagus_officinalis)and [Asparagus densiflorus](/wiki/Asparagus_densiflorus). Though asparagus plants cultivated for food are typically harvested before they reach reproductive maturity, the berries of the mature plant are poisonous, containing furostanol and spirostanol [saponins](/wiki/Saponin). Rapid ingestion of more than five to seven ripe berries can induce abdominal pain and vomiting. Sulfur compounds in the young shoots are also considered at least partially responsible for mild skin reactions in some people who handle the plant. [[6]](#cite_note-6) [Citrus limon](/wiki/Citrus_limon) [Lemon](/wiki/Lemon) [citrus fruits](/wiki/Citrus_fruit), including lemon, [lime](/wiki/Lime_(fruit)), and [orange](/wiki/Orange_(fruit)), among others, are known to contain aromatic oils and compounds of [Psoralen](/wiki/Psoralen), which is toxic to dogs, cats, and other animals.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] The compound is found all over the entire plant. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, depression, and [paralysis](/wiki/Paralysis)if eaten over a long period, and is considered the cause of the disease [neurolathyrism](/wiki/Neurolathyrism), a [neurodegenerative](/wiki/Neurodegenerative)disease that causes paralysis of the lower body and [emaciation](/wiki/Emaciation)of gluteal muscle (buttocks). The disease has been seen to occur after [famines](/wiki/Famine)in Europe (France, Spain, Germany), North Africa and South Asia, and is still prevalent in Eritrea, Ethiopia and parts of Afghanistan when Lathyrus seed is the exclusive or main source of nutrients for extended periods. [Malus domestica](/wiki/Malus_domestica) [Apple](/wiki/Apple) [amygdalin](/wiki/Amygdalin), a [cyanogenic](/wiki/Cyanide) [glycoside](/wiki/Glycoside).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] The quantity contained in the seeds of a single apple is usually not enough to be dangerous to humans, but it is possible to ingest enough seeds to provide a fatal allergens and urushiol have been observed. Those with a history of poison ivy or poison oak contact dermatitis may be most at risk for such an allergic reaction. During mango's primary ripening season, it is the most common source of plant in Hawaii. cassava, liberating [hydrogen cyanide](/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide). [[8]](#cite_note-cereda-8)Cassava varieties are often categorized as either sweet or bitter, respectively signifying the absence or presence of toxic levels of cyanogenic glycosides. The 'sweet' cultivars can produce as little as 20 milligrams of [cyanide](/wiki/Cyanide)per kilogram of fresh roots, whereas bitter ones may produce more than 50 times as much (1 g/kg). Cassavas grown during [drought](/wiki/Drought)are especially high in these toxins. [[9]](#cite_note-9) [[10]](#cite_note-10)A dose of 40 mg of pure cassava [cyanogenic glycoside](/wiki/Cyanogenic_glycoside)is sufficient to kill a cow. It can also cause severe calcific pancreatitis in humans, leading to chronic pancreatitis. Processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.) of cassava root is necessary to remove the toxins and avoid getting sick. In the tropics, where cassava farming is a major industry, \"Chronic, low-level [cyanide](/wiki/Cyanide)exposure is associated with the development of [goiter](/wiki/Goiter)and with [tropical ataxic neuropathy](/wiki/Tropical_ataxic_neuropathy), a nerve-damaging disorder that renders a person unsteady and uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning, particularly during famines, is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating, irreversible paralytic disorder called [konzo](/wiki/Konzo)and, in some cases, death. The incidence of konzo and tropical ataxic neuropathy can be as high as 3 percent in some areas.\" [[11]](#cite_note-11)For some smaller-rooted sweet varieties, cooking is sufficient to eliminate all toxicity. The cyanide is carried away in the processing water and the amounts produced in domestic consumption are too small to have an environmental impact. [[8]](#cite_note-cereda-8)The larger-rooted, bitter varieties used for the production of flour or starch must be processed to remove the cyanogenic glycosides. [[12]](#cite_note-12)Industrial production of cassava flour, even at the cottage level, may generate enough cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides in the effluvia to have a severe environmental [Myristica [neuroblastoma](/wiki/Neuroblastoma)cells. [[13]](#cite_note-13)It has [psychoactive](/wiki/Psychoactive)properties at doses much higher than used in cooking. Raw nutmeg produces [anticholinergic](/wiki/Anticholinergic)-like symptoms, attributed to myristicin and [elemicin](/wiki/Elemicin). [[14]](#cite_note-pmid15249817-14)The intoxicating effects of myristicin can lead to a physical state somewhere between waking and dreaming; euphoria is reported and nausea is often experienced. Users also report bloodshot eyes and memory disturbances. [[15]](#cite_note-15)Myristicin is also known to induce hallucinogenic effects, such as visual distortions. Nutmeg intoxication has an extremely long delay before peak is reached, sometimes taking up to seven hours, and effects can be felt for 24 hours, with lingering effects lasting up to 72 hours. [[16]](#cite_note-16) [[17]](#cite_note-17) toxic [lectin](/wiki/Lectin), is present in many varieties of common bean but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans. The lectin has several effects on cell metabolism; it induces [mitosis](/wiki/Mitosis)and affects the cell membrane regarding transport and [permeability](/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane)to proteins. It [agglutinates](/wiki/Agglutination_(biology))most mammalian [red blood cell](/wiki/Red_blood_cell)types. Consumption of as few as four or five raw kidney beans may be sufficient to trigger symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset is from one to three hours after consumption of improperly prepared beans, and symptoms typically resolve within a few hours. [[18]](#cite_note-FDA-18)Phytohaemagglutinin can be deactivated by cooking beans at 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F) for ten minutes, which is required to degrade the toxin and is much shorter than the hours required to fully cook the beans themselves. For dry beans, the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration)(FDA) also recommends an initial soak of at least five hours in water, after which the soaking water should be discarded. [[18]](#cite_note-FDA-18)However, lower cooking temperatures may have the paradoxical effect of potentiating the toxic effect of haemagglutinin. Beans cooked at 80 \u00b0C (176 \u00b0F) are reported to be up to five times as toxic as raw beans. [[18]](#cite_note-FDA-18)Outbreaks of poisoning have been associated with the use of [slow cookers](/wiki/Slow_cooker), the low cooking temperatures of which may be unable to degrade the toxin. [Prunus cerasus](/wiki/Prunus_cerasus) [Cherry](/wiki/Cherry) [amygdalin](/wiki/Amygdalin), [petioles](/wiki/Petiole_(botany))) are edible, leaves themselves contain notable quantities of [oxalic acid](/wiki/Oxalic_acid), which is a [nephrotoxic](/wiki/Nephrotoxic)and [corrosive](/wiki/Corrosive)acid present in many plants. Symptoms of poisoning include kidney disorders, convulsions and coma, though it is rarely fatal. The [LD50](/wiki/Median_lethal_dose)(median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375 mg/kg [body weight](/wiki/Body_weight), [[19]](#cite_note-19)or about 25 grams for a 65 kg (~140 lb) human. Although the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%, [[20]](#cite_note-20)so almost 5 kg of the extremely sour leaves would have to be consumed to reach the [LD50](/wiki/Median_lethal_dose). Cooking the leaves with soda can make them more poisonous by producing soluble [oxalates](/wiki/Oxalate). [[21]](#cite_note-21)However, the leaves are believed to also contain an additional, unidentified toxin, [[22]](#cite_note-22)which might be an [anthraquinone](/wiki/Natural_anthraquinone) [glycoside](/wiki/Glycoside)(also known as [senna glycosides](/wiki/Senna_glycosides)). [[23]](#cite_note-23)In the edible leaf stalks, the concentration of oxalic acid is much lower, contributing only about 2-2.5% of the total acidity, which is dominated by [malic acid](/wiki/Malic_acid). [[24]](#cite_note-24)This means that even the raw stalks may not be hazardous (though they are generally thought to be in the US). However, the tart taste of the raw stalks is so strong as to be unpalatable to most consumers. [Solanum lycopersicum](/wiki/Solanum_lycopersicum) is toxic if ingested, causing digestive upset and nervous excitement. Use of tomato leaves as an [herbal tea](/wiki/Herbal_tea)( [infusion](/wiki/Infusion)) has been responsible for at least one death. [[25]](#cite_note-calimaster-25)Leaves, stems, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant also contain small amounts of the poisonous alkaloid [tomatine](/wiki/Tomatine), [[26]](#cite_note-Barceloux-26)although levels are generally too small to be dangerous. [[26]](#cite_note-Barceloux-26) [[27]](#cite_note-Mcgee-NYT-27)Ripe tomatoes do not contain any detectable tomatine. [[26]](#cite_note-Barceloux-26)Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit or chew the plant material. [[28]](#cite_note-28) [Solanum tuberosum](/wiki/Solanum_tuberosum) [Potato](/wiki/Potato) [glycoalkaloids](/wiki/Glycoalkaloid), of which the most prevalent are [solanine](/wiki/Solanine)and [chaconine](/wiki/Chaconine). Solanine is also found in other members of the [Solanaceae](/wiki/Solanaceae)plant family, which includes [Atropa belladonna](/wiki/Atropa_belladonna)(deadly nightshade) and [Hyoscyamus niger](/wiki/Hyoscyamus_niger)(henbane) (see entries below). The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. The toxin affects the nervous system, causing [headaches](/wiki/Headache), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea)and intense digestive disturbances, [cramps](/wiki/Cramps), weakness and confusion, and in severe cases [coma](/wiki/Coma)and death. Poisoning from cultivated potatoes occurs very rarely, however, as toxic compounds in the potato plant are generally concentrated in the green portions of the plant and in the fruits, and cultivated varieties contain smaller concentrations than wild plants. [[29]](#cite_note-29) [[30]](#cite_note-30)Cooking at high temperatures (over 170 \u00b0C or 340 \u00b0F) also partly destroys the toxin. However, exposure to light, physical damage, and age can increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber, [[31]](#cite_note-31)the highest concentrations occurring just underneath the skin. Tubers that are exposed to light turn green from [chlorophyll](/wiki/Chlorophyll)synthesis, thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Some varieties of potato contain greater glycoalkaloid concentrations than others; breeders developing new [cultivars](/wiki/Cultivar)try to keep solanine levels below 200 mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, even they can approach solanine concentrations of 1000 mg/kg (1000 ppmw). The [U.S. National Toxicology Program](/wiki/U.S._National_Toxicology_Program)suggests that the average American consume no more than 12.5 mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is several times this, depending on body weight). [Vitis](/wiki/Vitis)spp. [Grape](/wiki/Grape) [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] See [grape and raisin toxicity in dogs](/wiki/Grape_and_raisin_toxicity_in_dogs). Other poisonous plants[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_poisonous_plants&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Countless other plants not commonly used in food or drink are also poisonous, and care should be taken to avoid accidentally contacting or ingesting them. Some of these are popular ornamental plants or are cultivated for purposes other than consumption. |Scientific name||Common name(s)||Description||Picture| | |[jumbie](/wiki/Jumbie)bead, ruti, and weather plant. toxic ribosome-inactivating protein related to [ricin](/wiki/Ricin).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, liver failure, and death, usually after several days. Ingesting a single seed can kill an adult human.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] The seeds have been used as beads in jewelry, which is dangerous; inhaled dust is toxic and pinpricks can be fatal.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] The seeds are unfortunately attractive to children. [Aconitum](/wiki/Aconitum)spp. [aconitine](/wiki/Aconitine), which disables nerves, lowers blood pressure, and can stop the heart. Even casual skin contact should be avoided. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and cardiac irregularity. It has been used as a poison for bullets (by German forces during World War II), as a bait and arrow poison (ancient Greece), and to poison water supplies (reports from ancient Asia).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] If ingested, it usually causes burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth, followed by vomiting and nervous excitement. It is usually a quick-acting poison and has been used in the past for killing wolves (hence one of the common names). [Actaea pachypoda](/wiki/Actaea_pachypoda) vomiting and is often fatal. [Milk sickness](/wiki/Milk_sickness)is caused by drinking milk from cattle that have eaten white snakeroot, which can sicken or kill humans.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] [Agrostemma githago](/wiki/Agrostemma_githago) [saponins](/wiki/Saponin)githagin and agrostemmic acid. All parts of the plant are reported to be poisonous and may produce chronic or acute, potentially fatal poisoning, although it has been used in folk medicine to treat a range of ills, from parasites to cancer. There are no known recent clinical studies of corn cockle which provide a basis for dosage recommendations; however, doses higher than 3 g (of seeds) are considered toxic. [[32]](#cite_note-32) [Anemone nemorosa](/wiki/Anemone_nemorosa) [protoanemonin](/wiki/Protoanemonin), which can cause severe skin and gastrointestinal irritation, bitter taste and burning in the mouth and throat, mouth ulcers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and [hematemesis](/wiki/Hematemesis). [[33]](#cite_note-33) [Anthurium](/wiki/Anthurium)spp. [calcium oxalate](/wiki/Calcium_oxalate)crystals. The sap is and eyes. [[34]](#cite_note-nc-34) [Aquilegia](/wiki/Aquilegia)spp. [gastroenteritis](/wiki/Gastroenteritis)and [heart palpitations](/wiki/Heart_palpitation)if consumed. The flowers of various species were consumed in moderation by [Native Americans](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States)as a [condiment](/wiki/Condiment)with other fresh greens, and are reported to be very sweet and safe if consumed in small quantities. Native Americans also used very small amounts of the root as an effective treatment for [peptic ulcers](/wiki/Peptic_ulcer). However, medical use of this plant is difficult due to its high toxicity; columbine poisonings are easily fatal. [[35]](#cite_note-35) [Areca catechu](/wiki/Areca_catechu) [arecoline](/wiki/Arecoline), an alkaloid related to [nicotine](/wiki/Nicotine)which is addictive. It produces a mild high, some stimulation, and much red saliva, which cannot be swallowed as it causes nausea. Withdrawal causes headache and sweats. Use is correlated with [mouth cancer](/wiki/Mouth_cancer), and to a particularly of the legs.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] [Arnica montana](/wiki/Arnica_montana) [helenalin](/wiki/Helenalin), which can be poisonous if large amounts of the plant are eaten or small amounts of concentrated Arnica are used. Consumption of A. montana can produce severe [gastroenteritis](/wiki/Gastroenteritis), internal bleeding of the digestive tract, raised liver enzymes (which can indicate inflammation of the liver), nervousness, accelerated heart rate, muscular weakness, and death if enough is ingested. [[36]](#cite_note-36) [[37]](#cite_note-pmid11558636-37)Contact with the plant can also cause skin irritation. [[38]](#cite_note-38) [[39]](#cite_note-39)In the [Ames test](/wiki/Ames_test), an extract of A. montana was found to be [mutagenic](/wiki/Mutagen). [[37]](#cite_note-pmid11558636-37)The plant's toxicity has led to the USFDA officially declaring it to be unsafe. [Arum maculatum](/wiki/Arum_maculatum) [saponins](/wiki/Saponins)and can cause skin, mouth, and throat irritation, resulting in swelling, burning pain, breathing difficulties, and stomach upset. One of the most common causes of plant poisoning.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] [Atropa belladonna](/wiki/Atropa_belladonna) contain [tropane alkaloids](/wiki/Tropane_alkaloids) [[40]](#cite_note-veterinary-40)- as do those of its species [A. baetica](/wiki/Atropa_baetica), [A. include [dilated](/wiki/Mydriasis) [pupils](/wiki/Pupil), sensitivity to light, blurred [vision](/wiki/Visual_perception), [tachycardia](/wiki/Tachycardia), loss of [balance](/wiki/Sense_of_balance), staggering, headache, [rash](/wiki/Rash), flushing, dry throat, slurred root of the plant is generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to another. Ingestion of a single leaf of the plant can be fatal to an adult. [[40]](#cite_note-veterinary-40)Casual contact with the leaves can cause skin pustules. The berries pose the greatest danger to children because they look attractive and have a somewhat sweet taste. [[45]](#cite_note-Grieve-45)The consumption of two to five berries by children and ten to twenty berries by adults can be lethal. In 2009, a case of A. belladonna being mistaken for blueberries, with six berries ingested by an adult woman, was documented to result in severe [anticholinergic](/wiki/Anticholinergic)syndrome. [[46]](#cite_note-46)The plant's deadly symptoms are caused by atropine's disruption of the [parasympathetic nervous system](/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system)'s ability to regulate involuntary activities such as sweating, breathing, and heart rate. The [antidote](/wiki/Antidote)for atropine poisoning is [physostigmine](/wiki/Physostigmine)or [pilocarpine](/wiki/Pilocarpine). [[47]](#cite_note-47)A. belladonna is also toxic to many domestic animals, causing [narcosis](/wiki/Unconsciousness)and [paralysis](/wiki/Paralysis). [[48]](#cite_note-NC_State-48)However, cattle and [rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit)eat the plant seemingly without any harmful effects. [[44]](#cite_note-pmid17575737-44)In humans, its anticholinergic properties will cause the disruption of cognitive capacities like memory and learning. [[42]](#cite_note-giancarlo-42) [Brugmansia](/wiki/Brugmansia)spp. [scopolamine](/wiki/Hyoscine_hydrobromide)and [atropine](/wiki/Atropine); often fatal. These plants are closely related to and were once grouped with members of the genus [Datura](/wiki/Datura), which contain the same deadly alkaloids. Effects of ingestion may include losing connection with reality and hallucinations. An unfortunate case has been reported in the neuroscience literature about a young man performing self-amputation with pruning shears after intentionally ingesting Brugmansia tea, [Colocasia](/wiki/Colocasia), and [Arum](/wiki/Arum)) is edible after [[50]](#cite_note-50)[ [failed verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)] [Caltha palustris](/wiki/Caltha_palustris) [protoanemonin](/wiki/Protoanemonin). Ingesting large quantities of the plant may cause convulsions, burning of the throat, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, dizziness, and fainting. Contact of the skin or [mucous membranes](/wiki/Mucous_membrane)with the juices can cause blistering or inflammation, and gastric illness if ingested. Younger parts seem to contain lower toxin concentrations and heating breaks these substances down. Small amounts of Caltha in hay do not cause problems when fed to livestock, but larger quantities can lead to gastric illness. [[51]](#cite_note-51) [Cascabela thevetia](/wiki/Cascabela_thevetia) [cardiac glycosides](/wiki/Cardiac_glycoside). Many cases of intentional and poisoning of humans are known. [[52]](#cite_note-52) [Cephalanthus occidentalis](/wiki/Cephalanthus_occidentalis) [medicinal](/wiki/Medicinal_plant)uses, but it is [[53]](#cite_note-usda-53) [Cerbera odollam](/wiki/Cerbera_odollam) [cerberin](/wiki/Cerberin), [calcium](/wiki/Calcium) [ion channels](/wiki/Ion_channel)in [heart muscle](/wiki/Heart_muscle), causing disruption of the heartbeat. This is typically fatal and can result from ingesting a single seed. Cerberin is difficult to detect in [autopsies](/wiki/Autopsy)and its taste can be masked with strong [spices](/wiki/Spice), such as a curry. It is often used in [homicide](/wiki/Homicide)and [suicide](/wiki/Suicide)in [India](/wiki/India); [Kerala](/wiki/Kerala)'s suicide rate is about three times the Indian average. In 2004, a team led by Yvan Gaillard of the Laboratory of Analytical Toxicology in La Voulte-sur-Rh\u00f4ne, France, documented more than 500 cases of fatal Cerbera poisoning between 1989 and 1999 in Kerala. They said \"To the best of our knowledge, no plant in the world is responsible for as many deaths by suicide as the odollam tree.\" [[54]](#cite_note-54)A related species is Cerbera tanghin, the seeds of which are known as tanghin poison nut and have been used as an ' [ordeal poison](/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal#By_poison)'. [Chelidonium majus](/wiki/Chelidonium_majus) [isoquinoline](/wiki/Quinoline) [alkaloids](/wiki/Alkaloid), but there are claimed to be therapeutic uses when used at the correct dosage. [[55]](#cite_note-PDR-55)The main alkaloid present in the herb and root with [berberine](/wiki/Berberine), chelidonine, [sanguinarine](/wiki/Sanguinarine), and [chelerythrine](/wiki/Chelerythrine)also present. Sanguinarine is particularly toxic with an [LD50](/wiki/Median_lethal_dose)of only 18 mg per kg body weight. [[56]](#cite_note-Golob_1999-56)The effect of the fresh herb is [analgesic](/wiki/Analgesic), cholagogic, [antimicrobial](/wiki/Antimicrobial), [oncostatic](/wiki/Oncostatic), [[57]](#cite_note-57)with action [sedative](/wiki/Sedative). In animal tests, Chelidonium majus is shown to be [cytostatic](/wiki/Cytostatic). Early studies showed that the [latex](/wiki/Latex)causes [contact dermatitis](/wiki/Contact_dermatitis)and eye irritation. Stains on skin of the fingers are sometimes reported to cause eye irritation after rubbing the eyes or handling contact lenses. The characteristic latex also contains [proteolytic enzymes](/wiki/Proteolytic_enzymes)and the [phytocystatin](/wiki/Cystatin)chelidostatin, a [cysteine protease](/wiki/Cysteine_protease)inhibitor. [[58]](#cite_note-58) stimulant that induces seizures.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] When dried, the poisonous effect is reduced. The most common species is C. maculata; one of the species found in the Western United States, C. douglasii, often found in pastures and swamps, has especially thick stems and very large and sturdy flowers which are sometimes harvested for flower displays. This is inadvisable as the sap is sap can cause skin [eczema](/wiki/Eczema)in some people. The bark, roots, latex, and leaves are poisonous. [[61]](#cite_note-ntbg-61) [Colchicum autumnale](/wiki/Colchicum_autumnale) [colchicine](/wiki/Colchicine). Colchicine poisoning has been compared to [arsenic](/wiki/Arsenic)poisoning; symptoms typically start two to five hours after a toxic dose has been ingested but may take up to 24 hours to appear, and include burning in the mouth and throat, [fever](/wiki/Fever), [vomiting](/wiki/Vomiting), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea), [abdominal pain](/wiki/Abdominal_pain), and [kidney failure](/wiki/Renal_failure). Onset of multiple-system organ failure may occur within 24 to 72 hours. This includes [hypovolemic shock](/wiki/Hypovolemic_shock)due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the [GI tract](/wiki/GI_tract), which may result in death. Additionally, those affected may experience kidney damage resulting in low urine output and bloody urine, low white blood cell counts (persisting for several days), [anemia](/wiki/Anemia), muscular weakness, and [respiratory failure](/wiki/Respiratory_failure). Recovery may begin within 6 to 8 days. There is no specific antidote for colchicine poisoning, although various treatments do exist. [[62]](#cite_note-62)Despite dosing issues concerning its toxicity, colchicine is also a popular medicine at low doses, prescribed in the treatment of [gout](/wiki/Gout), [[63]](#cite_note-nps1-63) [familial Mediterranean fever](/wiki/Familial_Mediterranean_fever), [pericarditis](/wiki/Pericarditis), and [Beh\u00e7et's disease](/wiki/Beh%C3%A7et%27s_disease). It use as an [anti-cancer](/wiki/Cancer)drug.

Datura has been used as an [entheogenic](/wiki/Entheogen)drug by the indigenous peoples of the Americas and others for centuries, though the extreme variability in a given plant's toxicity depending on its age and growing environment make such usage an exceptionally hazardous practice; the difference between a recreational dose and a lethal dose is minuscule, [[66]](#cite_note-66)and incorrect dosage often results in death. For this same reason, Datura has also been a popular poison for suicide and murder, particularly in parts of Europe and India.

[[144]](#cite_note-144) [[145]](#cite_note-145) [Voacanga africana](/wiki/Voacanga_africana) [iboga alkaloids](/wiki/Ibogaine), including stomach pains, and [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea). Wisterias have caused poisoning in children of many countries, producing mild to severe [gastroenteritis](/wiki/Gastroenteritis). [Xanthium](/wiki/Xanthium)spp. [Xanthium strumarium](/wiki/Xanthium_strumarium)), a native of North America, can be poisonous to livestock, including horses, cattle, and sheep. Some domestic animals will avoid consuming the plant if other forage is present, but less discriminating animals, such as pigs, will consume the plants and then sicken and die. The seedlings and seeds are the most toxic parts of the plants. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours, producing unsteadiness and weakness, depression, [nausea](/wiki/Nausea)and vomiting, twisting of the neck muscles, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty breathing, and eventually death. Xanthium has also been used for its medicinal properties and for making yellow dye, as indicated by its name (Greek xanthos = 'yellow').
