It could be as simple as monitoring the quantity of food, adding a few items, or taking away one or two. One of the most natural ways to boost our immune system is through the food we eat. One strategy I like to use when it comes to nutrition is to look at the colors on your plate. You can optimize your immunity by eating a variety of colors to attain a variety of vitamins and minerals. Numerous studies show that the different pigments in the skins of fruits and vegetables are powerful antioxidants crucial for maintaining health, preventing cancer, and protecting against environmental toxins. In Chinese Nutritional therapy, food colors affect each organ system. For example: Green \u2014 (Liver) broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and dark leafy greens like kale Red \u2014 (Heart) beets, red bell peppers, and pomegranates Yellow/Orange \u2014 (Spleen) carrots, pumpkins, squash, and sweet potatoes White \u2014 (Lungs) cauliflower, maitake mushrooms, pears, and daikon radishes Black/Blue \u2014 (Kidneys) eggplant, black mushrooms, blueberries, and seaweed This strategy is a good one to use, especially as we enter Fall/Autumn. Depending on the season, different varieties of fresh produce allow us to eat locally and more naturally instead of processed foods year-round. There is a relationship between the gut and the immune system. Chinese Medicine Five Element Theory teaches us that nourishing one organ can improve the following organ in the generating cycle. In this case, the late summer element is nourished by the Spleen/Stomach\u2014the Earth. The next organ, the Lung, or Metal Element, is most prominent during the fall/winter season. So if we feed the digestive system well, the immune system benefits greatly. Here are 5 of the best foods to boost your immune system and help fight disease: Garlic \u2014 is found to have antibacterial and antifungal properties in fighting infections. Garlic boosts the number of virus-fighting T-cells in your bloodstream. Mushrooms \u2014 contain powerful polysaccharides called beta-glucans, which have been found to help to fight inflammation and balance the immune system. Try Chaga and Reishi, or add maitake and shitake mushrooms to your next soup for a boost.

Papayas \u2014 one of my favorites, is loaded with Vitamin C, even more than citrus fruits, have potent antioxidants, and are a great anti-inflammatory food. Squeeze a little lime on it to give it a flavor kick. Ginger \u2014 has warming properties, helps remove toxins from the body, and helps to decrease inflammation, which can help reduce a sore throat and other inflammatory illnesses. Great for nausea too! Cinnamon \u2014 hotter in nature, helps to warm the body, relieves body aches, and encourages sweating to push out the pathogens. Additionally, cinnamon can help with blood sugar regulation. Bonus herb for immunity: Astragalus - for over 2000 years, Astragalus, or Huang Qi, has been an adaptogen used in Asia to prevent illness, especially cold and flu. Astragalus has been shown to have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral properties.

There is a recipe for an Immunity Spice Blend that is an easy way to add some flavor to your daily meals and strengthen your immune system while you're at it. As the weather begins to change, our bodies will have to learn to defend themselves from external pathogens. With COVID-19 in the endemic stage and kids back in school, we must continue to nourish our bodies physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Get proper sleep, eat well, and laugh often. And add these foods to your meal plans. Small changes make great gains. "}
