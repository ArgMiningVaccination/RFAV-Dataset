If you are currently on medication and wish to have a more effective, holistic way to treat anxiety; we can help. It is possible to treat the underlying causes of panic attacks and anxiety, rather than just attempt to mask or numb the symptoms. Would you like to say goodbye to drug-based treatments for anxiety, and be free of the adverse effects of prescription drugs? We can help. Why are natural, holistic anxiety remedies likely to be more effective than traditional therapies alone? A holistic approach to treating anxiety starts with careful observation of the problem. Sometimes a problem becomes easier to solve by defining it more clearly. For instance, a person may believe something like, \"I can't possibly get a good job, I'm just not good enough.\" On closer inspection, however, one might discover that it's too general a statement to even start to solve. But if one deconstructed the various factors involved in the statement, the problem might actually just fall apart quite easily. For instance, if asked to take inventory of skills and abilities, and especially, interests, that one does have, the list could be short or long, but likely longer than expected. Then, one could further consider ways to improve on those specific skills, or areas of keen interest, with education or practice, for example, to make those skills more marketable. Then, a good job becomes very possible. Similarly, simply stating, \"I have overwhelming anxiety\" without looking more specifically at the factors contributing to the condition, this problem may well remain unsolved. If the anxiety is a hormone surge or deficit, for example, or is stemming from a past trauma being triggered, simply telling a doctor \"I have overwhelming anxiety\" is going to result in a quickly written prescription for anti-anxiety medication. It will NOT solve the recurring anxiety problem, because the factors of the problem have been completely overlooked. At Alternative to Meds, we specialize in finding out the root causes and contributors to a problem, and then actually addressing them. That process takes more than 5 minutes, but it can unlock the solutions much more easily. Our approach combines the necessary elements of traditional treatment with the commonly overlooked aspects of natural healing. Holistic treatments and strategies that are informed by strategic lab testing and other assessments are the foundations of the programs at Alternative to Meds Center. Alternative to Meds Center is an inpatient program designed to provide holistic support for the natural healing systems of the body. These natural body systems are designed to help overcome and resist both mental and physical health problems, including anxiety, stress, and depression. Are you or your loved one struggling with anxiety and unable to receive the help you need from traditional treatment methods? The unspoken assumption of most traditional approaches is that body and mind function separately as if each of the body's organs is operating all on its own. However, recent science demonstrates that the opposite is true. Multiple systems of the body and mind interact and communicate with one another in a multifaceted network of hormonal, metabolic, and biochemical relationships. Even distant organs such as the thyroid gland, immune system, brain, adrenal gland, liver, and gut interact. In many vital ways, they function successfully as one coordinated unit. We can help you bring your body back to balance in safe, comfortable ways. Anxiety medication is not the only choice. You have other options. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is one of the therapies we use in tandem with holistic treatment for anxiety. Research shows this kind of counseling to be successful in the treatment of social anxiety, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and phobias, as well as several other conditions. CBT is individualized therapy, but can also be delivered in a group format. Counseling can help address the negative patterns and distorted ways we look at ourselves and the world. As the name implies, this involves two primary factors: Cognitive therapy investigates how negative cognitions and thoughts contribute to anxiousness. Behavior therapy can use the safe space of the counseling environment to investigate how one behaves and reacts in anxiety-triggering situations. Studies have documented the significant success of treating mental health symptoms such as anxiety and depression successfully with CBT. And, these results last and even improve over time, according to medical research. Do you wish to live your life differently, and discover safe, holistic ways to treat anxiety? One of the basic ideas of cognitive-behavioral treatment is that our thoughts, rather than just external events, can affect how we feel. Put another way, it isn't always the situation that governs how one feels \u2014 sometimes it is one's perception of the situation. As an example, visualize yourself being invited to a party. Think of three separate ways of perceiving the invitation, and how your thoughts would influence your emotions. Cognitive behavioral counseling effectively helps people be in control of their thoughts and emotions. Our goal is to teach you new skills as you learn how to be your own mental health care expert. These types of strategies used in CBT make drug-free remedies for anxiety within reach and relatively easy to implement without getting hooked on prescription medications. What Are the Symptoms of Anxiety? Anxiety as a term can refer to many different feelings and these are not the same for everyone. One person may feel they are about to choke, or perhaps their breathing becomes constricted and they can't get a deep breath. Excessive perspiration may occur. Memory lapses or inability to speak normally or think clearly are also possible features. These often occur in public speaking situations. For some, it may mean an urge to quickly leave an area, even though there is no imminent or observable threat. Some would characterize their anxiety as uneasiness, apprehension, fear or terror, panic, worry, and dread, in varying degrees, sometimes quite intolerably extreme. These feelings can creep up gradually, or erupt suddenly, as in a \"panic attack.\" It is no wonder that so many people readily accept prescription medication as a solution. The condition can be ruinous. However, holistic treatments for anxiety are effective and available. Characteristics of Anxiety Some experience temporary anxiety that comes and goes, and some would describe their anxiety as unrelenting and never abating. Holistic treatment for anxiety looks at these characteristics as important markers in planning out the best ways to defeat symptoms. Different factors are generating these types of anxiety responses, and they can be investigated and addressed. Physical symptoms which often accompany the feelings of anxiety can include insomnia, jitters, shaking, shortness of breath, sweating, flushing, fainting, heart palpitations, rapid heart rate, decreased sex drive, diarrhea, chest pain, feeling of restriction across the chest or abdomen, muscle stiffness or tension, temporary paralysis, urinary incontinence, and nausea. Some people who experience anxiety feel terrorized and fear they are having a heart attack. Unresolved chronic anxiety can turn into a larger health problem if the symptoms persist and become excessive. When symptoms interfere with regular activities of daily life or cause emotional stress, it can become a debilitating condition. You don't have to suffer from the symptoms of anxiety any longer. Real help, drug-free remedies for anxiety, without depending on a prescription drug, are available right now. What Are the Causes of Anxiety? The precise causes of panic and anxiety are often overlooked. But they can be pinpointed with an exhaustive search. Anxiety may be triggered by extreme stress or traumatic events, such as an accident, a divorce, or death, or things that consciously or unconsciously remind one of earlier trauma, as in a PTSD condition. Hereditary and physiologic factors can also contribute to anxiety. Certain drugs or substances, and withdrawal from such drugs, can lead to anxiety. Some of the most common triggers include high sugar and high-carb diets, generally poor eating habits, hypoglycemia, asthma drugs, over-the-counter decongestants, caffeine (and withdrawal from caffeine), tobacco, alcohol, medications, and other substances including addictive narcotics. Toxic exposures can also induce anxiety, and holistic treatments can reduce anxiety. We are bombarded with toxins in the workplace, the home, where we go to school, in the air we breathe, and in the water we drink. We also believe that there are better answers available besides ignoring all of the above, and just taking prescription drugs for a lifetime and continuing to struggle. We work to discover the underlying causes of symptoms like anxiety and treat them holistically.
