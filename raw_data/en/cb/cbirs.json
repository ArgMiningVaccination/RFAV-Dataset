Be More Tree by Rowena J Ronson What would happen to our homes if they were not built with strong, firm foundations? Over time, with the multiple stresses that both internal and external influences bring, cracks - both large and small - would be likely to form, and perhaps there might be subsidence too. Is it not the same for the beings that live in our homes as well? We might manage our soul's little wounds by plastering them over, maybe with a distraction or two, or even a hefty dose of denial. Without even a thought for the cause, the wallpaper goes up, and with it too, the mask. Everything all looks pretty again. And if that doesn't work, of course there is always escaping, in all its forms, to further disconnect us from what we are consciously or unconsciously running from. But what internal landscape have we shaped that can actually hold us together when we are shaken to our core? What keeps us standing upright, much like a resilient oak, when all we want to do is surrender our leaves to the fall? What coping mechanisms do we possess to help us maintain homeostasis while remaining healthy, authentic and whole? We build our awareness, and therefore our immunity, health and strength, by resisting plastering over the cracks, and by questioning why they have formed. We dig deep into the ground with ever-growing roots. Roots born out of enquiring minds and our wish to exchange resistance for an efficient ability to adapt. And with strong foundations we are able to learn, to feel, to heal - and by doing so, we grow tall and wise. Our branches stretch to the sky as we develop and nourish our spiritual and emotional pulp throughout our entirety. And these challenging times have brought all the cracks of humanity into sharp focus. Our disconnection from our planet is being brought to our species' very door in these epic times of our evolution. Let these be times of great learning and change for the better. And on a personal level, Be More Tree.

The wish is that those who practise homeopathy should keep on looking; keep on looking at the world out there and the world inside themselves.\" ... 'Working with Rowena Ronson has been nothing short of inspirational. Starting from 12 years ago working with my daughter for minor issues to now working individually with my children, husband and myself. Rowena has helped us develop and grow as individuals and also as a family unit. Through counselling, homeopathy and deep spiritual work we have felt supported, guided and nurtured as we all enter new phases of our lives. Rowena has been a shining light for us all and we are most grateful to her for her warmth, energy and beyond caring nature in all that she undertakes. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Rowena to anyone who needs support on their journey, whether that is mental or physical. There is simply no one like her.' MM, female in her 50s 'Talking to Rowena has allowed me to see things that I never would have seen if left to my own devices. We were having a casual chat about my addiction and I really had no expectations of this chat changing how I felt towards my addiction. But then she asked me what do I want and I said 'to not crave, want or think about weed all the time everyday', and then she said 'so essentially you have to break up with it' and I agreed. I had told her that I had planned to only smoke on weekends in order to break the habit, which I thought was a great idea! And then she said, 'could you imagine trying to break up with your girlfriend but shagging her every weekend?!' ... and it was at this point she helped me realise and understand how to break my addiction. It is a hard and a long process that everyone needs support through and Rowena provides that!' JM, male aged 21 'Working with Rowena Ronson has been nothing short of inspirational.
