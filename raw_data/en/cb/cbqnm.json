UHS does not employ SANE nurses and does not have the ability to collect evidence. Students who have experienced a sexual assault within the last 72 hours and who wish to have evidence of their assault collected are strongly encouraged to seek a SANE nursing exam at University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Seeking a SANE exam does not require you to make a police report. For additional resources and support, contact: Do I have to have a pelvic/internal examination before starting birth control? No. Students requesting a birth control method that requires a prescription need to have a contraceptive consultation, but a pelvic exam/ internal examination or Pap is not required before starting. During the consultation, we will review health history and discuss options for birth control. If you are a candidate for cervical cancer screening, this will be discussed during your visit. What should I do to prepare if I am having a cervical cancer screening (a \"Pap\") during my wellness visit? If you are scheduled for a wellness visit that will include a cervical cancer screening test, please avoid douching or using any internal vaginal products (like lubricants, spermicide, creams) for 24 hours before your test. If you are bleeding heavily, we may ask you to reschedule your exam because large amounts of blood can affect the accuracy of the test. What if I have an abnormal cervical cancer screening (\"Pap\")? Some abnormal cervical cancer screening results may require follow up, depending on current screening guidelines. Your provider will follow up with next steps. What should I do before an IUD or arm implant insertion? In the 2 weeks prior to the IUD or implant insertion, use a form of pregnancy prevention (either consistent use of a barrier method or other form of birth control) for any internal/vaginal sex with a partner with who could get you pregnant. The day of an IUD or implant insertion, we recommend taking 800 mg of ibuprofen with food about 1 hour before the visit. (If you cannot take ibuprofen, you can take acetaminophen). On the day of the IUD or implant insertion, the clinician will assess risk of pregnancy by asking about sex since the last menstrual period and a urine pregnancy test will be performed. You will be able to return to work, school and sports after the IUD or implant insertion. IUDs and the arm implant are covered 100% by student health insurance. Students with other insurances should contact their insurance to see if the IUD or implant is covered with University Health Services. What if I am interested in pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP)? All of our UHS clinicians provide counseling, prescriptions and follow up for PrEP. PrEP is a medication taken by mouth that can reduce HIV transmission by over 90%. Richard E. Lindner Center2751 O'Varsity Way, "}
