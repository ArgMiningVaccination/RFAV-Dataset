The aim of the study was to analyze TCM prescription patterns for patients with IHD. Materials and Methods: The retrospective population-based study employed a randomly sampled cohort of 4317 subjects who visited TCM clinics. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan for the period covering 2000 to 2017. Data analysis focused on the top ten most commonly prescribed formulae and single TCMs. We also examined the most common two- and three-drug combinations of TCM in single prescriptions. Demographic characteristics included age and sex distributions. Analysis was performed on 22,441 prescriptions. Results: The majority of TCM patients were male (53.6%) and over 50 years of age (65.1%). Zhi-Gan-Cao-Tang (24.76%) was the most frequently prescribed formulae, and Danshen (28.89%) was the most frequently prescribed single TCM for the treatment of IHD. The most common two- and three-drug TCM combinations were Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang and Danshen\" (7.51%) and \"Zhi-Gan-Cao-Tang, Yang-Xin-Tang, and Gua-Lou-Xie-Bai-Ban-Xia-Tang\" (2.79%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that most of the frequently prescribed TCMs for IHD were Qi toning agents that deal with cardiovascular disease through the promotion of blood circulation. The widespread use of these drugs warrants large-scale, randomized clinical trials to investigate their effectiveness and safety.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-06-30", "cleaned_text": "Clinical Patterns of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Ischemic Heart Disease Treatment: A Population-Based Cohort Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58070879](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58070879) [Cardiology](/journal/medicina/sections/cardiology_)) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-medicina-58-00879)]. The World Health Organization listed IHD as number one in the global burden of disease in 2020. Statistics published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan, in 2020 listed chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and pneumonia as the top three causes of death. Heart disease was a major cause of death among individuals over 45 years of age, and the number of deaths due to heart disease is increasing. Classical symptoms of IHD include chest tightness and chest pain, the onset of which can be sudden (i.e., without previous symptoms). Treatment for IHD focuses on the selection of appropriate medications and mediating risk factors, including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, poor kidney function, metabolic syndrome, obesity, imbalances in diet, a lack of exercise, smoking, and stress [ [2](#B2-medicina-58-00879)]. In severe cases, cardiac catheterization and stent placement are necessary. In cases where the vascular obstruction is too severe, coronary artery bypass surgery may be performed [ [3](#B3-medicina-58-00879)]. [4](#B4-medicina-58-00879)] as well as the post ischemic myocardial In the current study, we explored TCM prescription patterns from 2000 to 2017, using the population-based NHI database in Taiwan. Searches were conducted to determine the number and frequency of visits to TCM clinics under diagnostic codes specific to IHD: ICD9 410-414 (ICD10: I20-I25). We then ranked frequently prescribed TCM formulas and single TCMs for IHD. These results provide a valuable reference for clinical treatment of patients with IHD. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Sources 2.2. Study Design 2.3. Statistical Analysis [9](#B9-medicina-58-00879)] and has been widely applied in medical research over the last few decades [ [7](#B7-medicina-58-00879), [8](#B8-medicina-58-00879)]. In the current study, data mining was used to characterize TCM prescription patterns for IHD. Parameter X, the support (%) of a prescribed drug set, was defined as the group of the data set comprising drug set X. Here, support is defined as the frequency with which a rule appears in the database. Using statistical software R (version 2.13.2, The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) package 'arules', we used the function 'apriori' with minimum support set at 1%. 3. Results 3.1. Patient Features [Table 1](#medicina-58-00879-t001), the number of consultations for IHD increased with age, likely due to a gradual deterioration of heart function with age. Overall, consultations for IHD increased from the age of 35, and individuals 50 years accounted for 65.1% of the cases of morbidity. In terms of gender differences ( [Figure 1](#medicina-58-00879-f001)), the incidence of morbidity among females exceeded that of men prior to the age of 49 (earlier onset), whereas the incidence of morbidity among males was 1.14 times that of women after 50 years of age (higher overall incidence). 3.2. Single TCMs [Table 2](#medicina-58-00879-t002), Danshen (28.89%) was the single the formula commonly for IHD, followed by 3.4. TCM Combinations [Figure [Table plus Yuanzhi ( [Table 7](#medicina-58-00879-t007)). 4. Discussion [41](#B41-medicina-58-00879)]. This may also explain why we recorded 22,441 prescriptions for only 4317 subjects during the 18-year study period. [42](#B42-medicina-58-00879)]. The constituents from Danshen include lipophilic components (tanshinone IIa and cryptotanshinone) as well as hydrophilic compounds (Sal-A and Sal-B), which have exhibited beneficial effects for the heart due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties [ [43](#B43-medicina-58-00879), [44](#B44-medicina-58-00879), [45](#B45-medicina-58-00879), [46](#B46-medicina-58-00879)]. Danshen is widely prescribed for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, myocardial of Yujin have also been shown to promote blood circulation, relieve pain, and protect against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, studies have reported on the cardioprotective potential of puerarin by reducing myocardial oxygen consumption and increasing coronary oxygen supply [ [55](#B55-medicina-58-00879)]. Researchers have also reported that Gegen can reduce the area of myocardial infarction, reduce serum CK-MB activity, and reduce apoptotic cell death [ [56](#B56-medicina-58-00879)]. Isoflavones from Gegen have also been shown to have anti-atherosclerosis effects. For example, daidzin and formononetin can lower serum cholesterol while genistein can lower triglyceride levels [ [57](#B57-medicina-58-00879)]. A number of have Gegen possesses cardioprotective, neuroprotective, vasodilatation, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammatory effects. Other studies have demonstrated the effects of Gegen in preventing coagulation, protecting vascular endothelial cells, and preventing damage due to myocardial ischemia. It has even been shown to enhance insulin resistance and lower blood sugar levels. It is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes [ [58](#B58-medicina-58-00879)]. [29](#B29-medicina-58-00879)]. They have also been linked to the alleviation of oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes due to toxins or [ glabra L.) have been linked to the alleviation of smooth muscle spasms. Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang has been shown to reduce the concentration of triglycerides in serum, decrease the ratio of TXA2/PGI2, and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines in rats fed a high cholesterol diet [ [32](#B32-medicina-58-00879)]. Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang has also been shown to reverse myocardial fibrosis in hypertensive rats by increasing myocardial cell protection and decreasing TGF-1 mRNA and protein expression [ [60](#B60-medicina-58-00879)]. In a swine phlegm and blood stasis type coronary heart disease model, Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang combined with Gua-Lou-Xie-Bai-Ban-Xia-Tang was shown to have significant protective effects against myocardial apoptosis, upregulate Bcl-2 protein expression, expression [ [34](#B34-medicina-58-00879)]. [29](#B29-medicina-58-00879)]. Injections based on Sheng-Mai-Yin have been shown to promote the recovery of cardiac performance in patients who underwent bypass grafting of the coronary artery [ [35](#B35-medicina-58-00879)]. [36](#B36-medicina-58-00879)]. It has also been shown to have protective effects against type II diabetes and acute myocardial ischemia by ameliorating oxidative [62](#B62-medicina-58-00879)]. Danshen has also been discovered to synergistically cooperate with other herbal medicines (such as Radix Puerariae lobatae, and Danhong injection), or Western drugs (such as Atorvastatin) in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases [ [61](#B61-medicina-58-00879)]. 5.
