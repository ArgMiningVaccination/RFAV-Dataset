According to a 2006 study published by the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, the average pH level for your skin is just below 5, which makes it slightly acidic (needed to kill bacteria). Other studies have shown the \"optimum\" pH level is 5.5 - so anything between 5 and 5.5 is what we consider \"balanced.\" What happens when a man's pH balance is off? If your skin's pH is too high (alkaline), it is not producing enough sebum, and you may experience symptoms like: - Dry skin and flakes - Fine lines and wrinkles - Increased sensitivity Your skin's acid mantle is breaking down at these levels, making your skin more susceptible to bacteria and damaging UV rays.

How can a man balance his pH levels? Now that you've established your skin's pH level, you can take action to correct it or maintain it. 1. Avoid harsh ingredients The first step to getting your skin back on track is stepping away from harsh ingredients and making the switch to pH-balanced products. Many skincare products carry a pH level of 8 - 10, which means they're going to dry your skin out. These high levels, combined with tap water (which has a pH level as high as 8.5), are a recipe for disaster. The first step is to avoid harsh cleansers and soap. Avoid [toxic men's skincare ingredients](https://www.vitaman.com/blogs/news/toxic-skincare-ingredients) like SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), parabens, fragrance and parfum, BHT, and alcohol - all of which dry out your skin. 2.
