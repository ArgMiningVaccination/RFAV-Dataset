The survey demonstrates the essential role that distributors will serve in the 2015-2016 flu season in helping healthcare facilities and patients access vaccines, hypodermic supplies, administration kits, diagnostic tests, and more. The 2014-2015 influenza season was a moderately severe year, in which the influenza A (H3N2) predominated overall while the influenza B viruses accounted for the largest proportion of circulating viruses after March. The healthcare supply chain demonstrated flexibility and operational skill through 24-48 hour delivery and logistical expertise to ensure healthcare providers were well-supplied throughout the flu season. Additionally, the 2015 Influenza Vaccine Production & Distribution Market Brief provides key information on: Flu vaccine production, supply, and allocation Patient and physician vaccination trends Diagnostic resources for managing influenza Manufacturing and distribution processes Sites for patient vaccination Medicare reimbursement guide Quality reporting measures related to influenza vaccination Vaccine effectiveness trends Who Should Read this Report This report is intended for several key audiences: senior sales, marketing, and strategy executives of healthcare distribution and manufacturing companies, and healthcare sales staff in the field. Stakeholders in the influenza vaccine supply chain and government agencies responsible for the public health and oversight of the production and distribution of influenza vaccines will also find this report of interest. 4 2015 Flu Market Brief Health Industry Distributors AssociationMost patients receive a \"trivalent\" vaccine, meaning that it protects against three different influenza strains. The Food & Drug Administration has selected the following three viruses for the 2015-2016 trivalent influenza a B/Yamagata lineage virus)Some of the 2015-2016 flu vaccine is \"quadrivalent\" (four strains) vaccine and also protects against an additional B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus). This is a B/Victoria lineage virus.Manufacturers Plan to Increase Production to More Than 174 Million Doses of Flu Vaccine Vaccine manufacturers project they will produce roughly 174.5 million doses for the 2015-2016 influenza season. At most, the projection would represent an 11.1% increase from the total number of vaccines manufactured for the 2014-2015 flu season. The projected increase in flu vaccines for the 2015-2016 influenza season can be attributed to some manufacturers increasing their production capacity and a potentially more active flu season; however, the increase is slightly smaller than last year's 13.8% increase in production.

Using 174.5 million doses as an average of the projected industry total, manufacturers have increased production by approximately 17 million doses from the previous season. While Novartis had the most significant shift in production estimates, their projection (36 million) represents an increase of 6 million doses from last year's expected delivery.

(High dose vaccines, which are IM vaccines, will all be trivalent this season.) For people who are 18 through 64 years old, a jet injector can be used for delivery of one particular trivalent flu vaccine (AFLURIA\u00ae by bioCSL Inc.). Nasal spray vaccines will all be quadrivalent this season. Intradermal vaccine will all be quadrivalent. Within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approved indications and recommendations, no preferential recommendation is made for any type or brand of licensed influenza vaccine over another.

Package inserts for US-licensed vaccines are available at the CDC .7 2015 Flu Market Brief Health Industry Distributors AssociationLast Year's Flu Vaccine Demand Highest in Late September Over the past five years, demand for vaccine peaks in October and supply peaks in November and December. However, the 2014-2015 influenza season showed demand for vaccines earlier in the season with the largest jump in percentage of flu vaccines released occurring in late September. The CDC recommends that providers begin offering vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available, and if possible, by October. In fact, the CDC is recommending that the elderly get vaccinated no later than December due to last season's increase in influenza risk for those over 65 years of age. The CDC's National Influenza Vaccination Week for the upcoming season is scheduled for December 6-12, 2015.

These results are similar to the early 2013-2014 flu season when 31.8% of adults and 64.6% of children were vaccinated in doctor's offices. The CDC survey shows that pharmacies, drug stores, and other retail sites experienced a increase of about 3.1% in flu vaccinations among adults in 2014. Over the past year, some retail sites are continuing to expand, some are being bought by other clinics and some are closing. Among the biggest five retail clinics tracked by Merchant Medicine LLC, 250 clinics were added between August 2013 and April 2015.

Throughout the year, distributors offer providers logistical and operational expertise that is particularly important during the flu season. As public health officials continue to expand flu immunization rates and preventive health services, the supply chain will play an integral role in serving clinical professionals. In addition to a robust flu vaccine supply detailed on the next page, distributors plan to bring a full line of essential medical products to providers throughout the 2014-2015 season. According to participants in the survey, all distributor participants that serve physician offices will carry: Hypodermic supplies (syringes and needles), Sharps collectors (disposal), Wound care products (gauze, bandages, alcohol prep pads), Medical gloves, and, Antibacterials and disinfectants. Additionally, more than 85% of these distributors plan to deliver Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests (RIDTs), which are used to identify the flu virus in less than 15 minutes. Distributors identified the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived* status and low cost as the most important attributes of these tests.

The prefilled syringe category showed a significant increase, as did the nasal spray category. Distributors that participated in the survey plan to deliver 9.64% more pre-filled flu vaccines in the 2015-2016 season than in the 2014-2015 flu season. Pre-filled syringes represented about 21.4% of all surveyed distributors' flu vaccine deliveries. Multi-dose vaccines represent 70.11% of a distributor's deliveries, showing a 12.24% decrease in percentage of vaccine types overall from the 2014-2015 flu season.

Of all vaccine types, the high-dose intramuscular vaccine (CPT 90662) receives the highest reimbursement rate, followed by the intranasal vaccine (CPT 90685). Most intramuscular vaccines received a small payment update. Annual Part B deductible and coinsurance amounts do not apply for flu vaccines.

CMS finalizes measures for providers to receive their full annual Medicare payment update. If providers fail to report, they will not receive Medicare payment. Some provider settings have to report the percentage of their patients who were assessed and appropriately given the seasonal influenza vaccine as part of their quality reporting requirements. CMS is also requiring a number of quality reporting programs to send healthcare personnel (HCP) vaccination rates to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

Having an effective vaccine is an essential component in the effort to prevent the spread of influenza during flu season. In the five seasons leading up to the 2014-2015 season, flu vaccines had an average effectiveness of 50% (2009-2010 to 2013-2014). Over the past 10 seasons, flu vaccines have had a 40.6% effectiveness rate with a high of 60% in 2010 and a low of 10% in 2004. High and low effectiveness rates are expected as the industry works toward better vaccines to prevent the extremely adaptable virus. Adjusted Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates for Influenza Seasons from 2005-2015 Influenza Season Adjusted Brief Health Industry Distributors AssociationManaging Influenza with Diagnostic Resources The CDC identifies that RIDTs can help in the diagnosis and management of patients with signs and symptoms compatible with influenza. They also are useful for helping to determine whether outbreaks of respiratory disease, such as in nursing homes, hospitals, schools, and other settings, might be due to influenza. Rapid diagnostic testing for influenza should be done when the results will affect clinical decision making, according to the CDC. Important points about rapid flu tests: Tests are available to identify the ability to identify the presence of influenza A and B viruses, and display the result in a qualitative way (positive vs. negative), in 10-15 minutes. Once the flu virus is recognized, providers can use the diagnosis to begin treating patients and prescribing antiviral medications. More than 16 tests have been approved by the FDA. Many tests are CLIA-waived. Most tests can be used with a variety of specimen types (see Influenza Diagnostic Table ). The accuracy of the tests can vary based on the type of specimen collected (for example throat swab versus nasal swab). The positive and negative predictive values vary considerably depending upon the prevalence of influenza in the community. The Importance of Laboratory-Based Surveillance Laboratory-based surveillance for flu virus is critically important to the selection of viruses for the next season's influenza vaccine. This data is also useful for obtaining information on the emergence and prevalence of antiviral resistant strains, and the identification of human infection with novel influenza A virus (e.g. an influenza A virus of animal origin that may occasionally cause illnesses in people) that may have pandemic potential. Many manufacturers have increased their production capacity in order to prepare for a future pandemic situation.METHOD TYPES DETECTED ACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS TEST TIME CLIA WAIVED Rapid influenza diagnostic tests A, B, or both, depending on the testNP swab, (throat swab), nasal wash, nasal aspirate<15 minutesVaried Viral culture (conventional) A and B NP swab, throat swab, NP or bronchial wash, nasal or endotracheal aspirate, sputum3-10 days No Rapid cell culture (shell vials; cell mixtures)A and B NP swab, throat sputum1-3 No Immunofluorescence, direct (DFA) or indirect (IFA) antibody stainingA and B NP swab or wash, bronchial wash, and RNA-based) and other molecular assaysA and B NP swab, throat NP Brief Health Industry Distributors AssociationAppendix: Distribution's Role in Influenza Vaccination The influenza vaccine supply chain is divided into two channels; each channel represents roughly 50% of vaccine sales/distribution. In one channel, vaccine doses are sold directly by the manufacturer to customers (e.g., physicians, hospitals, pharmacy, public agency, community vaccinator, etc.). In another channel, vaccine is sold by manufacturers to distributors, who in turn deliver vaccine to their customers - primarily physician offices. Once distributors receive the vaccine it is generally distributed to providers within 1 to 3 days, helping providers reduce their inventory expense and storage costs. Distributors are the primary channel for delivering influenza vaccine to physician offices, the preferred patient venue for vaccination.
