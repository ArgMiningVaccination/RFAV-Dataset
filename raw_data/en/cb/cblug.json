Results 62% white, and36%Black. Reasons for capacity consultation included patient requesting discharge against medical advice (36%),refusing placement (21%),refusing intervention (20%),andability tomake (N=1),and90%ofpatients experiencing concurrent delirium lacked capacity .Ofpatients who also received ethics consultation (N=17),82% lacked capacity and65% hadanestablished psychiatric history . Conclusions :Psychosis, delirium, dementia, advanced age, and ethics consultation appear tobeassociated with lacking capacity .Future analyses include understanding which variables arecorrelated withoutcome ofcapacity assessment .Poster III- 26 APD 2020 46J.
