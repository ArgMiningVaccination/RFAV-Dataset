Hof and his team in both hyper/hypoventilation and strength ventilation breathing techniques. Total time training is 8 days. | Behavioral: Hyper/hypoventilation | Subjects are asked to hyperventilate for an average of 30 breaths. Subsequently, the subjects exhaled and hold their breath for approximately 2 minutes (\"retention phase\"). The duration of breath retention will be entirely at the discretion of the subject himself. Breath retention is followed by a deep inhalation breath, that will be held for 10 s. Subsequently a new cycle of hyper/hypoventilation begins. Behavioral: Strength ventilation This exercise consists of deep inhalations and exhalations in which every inhalation and exhalation is followed by breath holding for 10 s, during which the subject tightens all his body muscles. | Active Comparator: EIN | The 'extensive instruction' group (EIN): a group of subjects (n=10) that will receive an extensive instruction course supervised by the research team (in absence of Mr. Hof) in both hyper/hypoventilation and strength ventilation breathing techniques. | Behavioral: Hyper/hypoventilation | Subjects are asked to hyperventilate for an average of 30 breaths. Subsequently, the subjects exhaled and hold their breath for approximately 2 minutes (\"retention phase\"). The duration of breath retention will be entirely at the discretion of the subject himself. Breath retention is followed by a deep inhalation breath, that will be held for 10 s. Subsequently a new cycle of hyper/hypoventilation begins. Behavioral: Strength ventilation This exercise consists of deep inhalations and exhalations in which every inhalation and exhalation is followed by breath holding for 10 s, during which the subject tightens all his body muscles. | Active Comparator: STR | The 'short training' group (STR): a group of subjects (n=10) that will receive only a short training of 1 hour (immediately prior to the study) by Mr. Hof and his team in both hyper/hypoventilation and strength ventilation breathing techniques. | Behavioral: Hyper/hypoventilation | Subjects are asked to hyperventilate for an average of 30 breaths. Subsequently, the subjects exhaled and hold their breath for approximately 2 minutes (\"retention phase\"). The duration of breath retention will be entirely at the discretion of the subject himself.

Behavioral: Strength ventilation This exercise consists of deep inhalations and exhalations in which every inhalation and exhalation is followed by breath holding for 10 s, during which the subject tightens all his body muscles. | Active Comparator: SIN | The 'short instruction' group (SIN): a group of subjects (n=10) that will receive no training, but only an short instruction course of 1 hour (immediately prior to the study) supervised by the research team (in absence of Mr. Hof) in both hyper/hypoventilation and strength ventilation breathing techniques. | Behavioral: Hyper/hypoventilation | Subjects are asked to hyperventilate for an average of 30 breaths.
