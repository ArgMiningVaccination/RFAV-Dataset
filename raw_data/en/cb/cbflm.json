The International Committee for Fair Play (CIFP), based in Hungary, awarded Elliott its top honour, the Jean Borotra World Fair Play Trophy, named after the founder of the organisation, it said.

In nominating Elliott for the Fair Play award, AOC secretary-general Craig Phillips wrote: \"Herb's mentorship of young athletes has been exemplary. He has steadfastly promoted a commitment to excellence, both in sport and in life.\" In 2002, he was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for service to community leadership through the development of sport in Australia. He has also been honoured by the International Olympic Committee as a recipient of the Olympic "}
