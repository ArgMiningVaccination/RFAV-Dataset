Our bodies have an inherent wisdom, and are able to maintain a healthy balance when we have a deep understanding of our own individual needs. VAYA's mission is to empower each client to restore their health, through strengthening the connection between body and mind. Together we create a system of healing, tailored to your own unique needs. Healing is not one-dimensional, and requires addressing every aspect of the individual - in mind, body, and soul. VAYA's offerings seek to create a truly holistic approach that addresses the unique needs of each individual, knowing that no two beings are the same. Ayurvedic Medicine is at the root of VAYA's healing practice, which works to clear any imbalances in the body + mind, and help us find our way back to a strong and healthy center. This is achieved through diet and lifestyle choices, along with the use of traditional Ayurvedic healing techniques and herbal support. Mindfulness + Meditation, Somatic Healing, Astrology, Reiki Energy Work, and Movement as Medicine are offered as supplemental healing tools, to support your individual journey. Elements from these various healing modalities help to strengthen self-awareness, and create a basis for empowering each client to heal from within. To learn more about how VAYA's offerings can support you in your journey of health and healing, schedule a consultation! Available over the phone or in person. "}
