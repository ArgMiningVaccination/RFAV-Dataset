Tell us immediately if you've had a bad reaction to any medication. Bring a list of your current medications used at home, including vitamins, herbals, inhalers and over-the counter medications. If you notice that a medication looks different from what you have been given before, ask us to check the medication and explain why it has changed. Make sure to keep the list up to date. You may use a medication card for this list. Ask if you are unsure about a medication's purpose or how to take it. "}
