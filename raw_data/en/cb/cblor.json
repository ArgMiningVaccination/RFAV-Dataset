Homeopathy is holistic because it treats the person as a whole, rather than focusing on a diseased part or a labeled sickness. Homeopathy is natural because its remedies are produced according to the U.S. FDA-recognized Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States from natural sources, whether vegetable, mineral, or animal in nature. The word Homeopathy, which comes from the Greek, through Latin into English, literally means \"like disease\". This means that the medicine given is like the disease that the person is expressing, in his totality, not like a specific disease category or medical diagnosis. "}
