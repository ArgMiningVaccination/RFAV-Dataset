M.D., Minsk Medical Institute, Belaris (1973) - Ph.D., Institute of Virology, Academy of Medical Science, Moscow Russia (1976) - D.Sc., Institute of Virology, Academy of Medical Science, Moscow Russia (1987) Research Areas and Projects Dr. Lukashevich's research interest includes pathogenesis of liver dysfunctions caused by highly pathogenic RNA viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers (HFs). In collaboration with Dr. Arteel's team, he discovered a novel mechanism of liver involvement in pathogenesis of viral HFs. According to this mechanism, the virus-induced pathophysiological hepatocyte proliferation is accompanied by cell cycle arrest and contributes to expansion of the infection to parenchymal cells. Elevated levels of plasma transaminases are likely explained, at least in part, by aborted hepatocyte proliferation causing apoptotic events and induction of oval cells, the \"second line\" of liver protection against the injury. These results may lead to the development of new therapeutic interventions for devastating diseases caused by HF viruses (e.g., Lassa, Machupo, Ebola). Development of new preventive vaccines based on advanced vaccine technologies is another scientific avenue in Dr. Lukashevich lab. He designed several promising vaccine candidates against Lassa HF, the most prevalent HF in West Africa, and against South American HFs. He co-invented infectious DNA (iDNA) technology to improve existing and experimental live-attenuated vaccines against Yellow Fever, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis, Japanese Encephalitis, and Chikungunya. This technology combines advantages of naked DNA immunization and high efficacy of live-attenuated vaccines. The iDNA-launched vaccines are \"manufactured\" in vaccinated individuals and do not require traditional vaccine manufacturing facility and technology. "}
