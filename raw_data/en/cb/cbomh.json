Benefit basics - Member resource guide The guide is a single resource you can use to take an active role in your health and engage with your health plan. It provides useful information about myProvidence, care options, and other programs available for PHP members. - What is health insurance? Health insurance is a contract between the person who buys health insurance (for example, an individual, employer, or association) and a health insurance company. You (and/or your employer) pay a premium \u2014 a specific amount of money \u2014 for your insurance coverage. In exchange, the health insurance plan pays all or a portion of the health care service cost. While no one plans on getting sick, it happens. Having health insurance helps pay for these costs and provides protection from very expensive medical services in the event care is needed. - Things to know about health insurance There are a lot of plans, providers, and coverage options to choose from. When you receive care from a provider, you may have to pay a copayment (a flat dollar amount) or a coinsurance (a percentage of the amount) for health care services (such as an office visit, lab work or an X-ray). You may have to meet a deductible each year before your health plan begins paying benefits. In-network providers have an agreement with the health plan to participate as a health care provider for a given plan. Plan benefits are typically better when services are rendered by an in-network provider. Plans typically have a calendar or plan year out-of-pocket maximum, which is the most you'll pay for covered health services during the plan year. After you receive care, the provider will submit a claim for services. Your health plan will send payment to the provider and will send you an Explanation of Benefits, which shows how the claim was paid. Read more about this via the EOBs explained link below. Your provider sends you a bill that shows what your health insurance company paid and what you still owe for the care received. It's your responsibility to pay the provider the remaining balance. - Types of medical plans There are a number of different types of medical plans. They are similar in that they cover many of the same services. Yet, they can differ greatly in: - How much you pay for coverage (i.e., the health insurance premium) - The amount you pay each year before the plan pays for covered services (i.e., the deductible) - Provider choice Here are 3 common types of medical plans: - Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). Under an HMO, your health insurer gives you a list of primary care physicians (PCP) you can choose from. If the doctor you want to see is not part of the plan's network, you could see that doctor, but you may pay for the complete cost of care. Generally, your primary care provider also needs to refer you to a specialist if you want to see one. - Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) / Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO). A PPO plan provides more provider choice. You may go to any doctor you want, but visits are more affordable if you choose in-network providers. You do not need a referral to see a specialist. - High deductible plan + health savings account (HSA). Another health care option is a high-deductible health plan along with a health savings account (HSA). In exchange for having a higher deductible, you pay a lower monthly premium. After you sign up with a high-deductible plan, you're eligible to open an HSA. You'll get a debit card with your HSA. Any time you need to pay for qualified medical expenses (for instance copays, prescription drugs), use your debit card to pay for the cost of care. Any money left over in your account at the end of the year rolls over to the following year. Plus, HSAs have some tax advantages. - Health insurance words & phrases Like any industry, health insurance has its own terminology Before you receive care, get to know what an insurance word or phrase means. The more you know, the more you can make the most of your benefits and your health. - Health accounts can help you save There are several different types of integrated accounts including health savings accounts (HSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), and flexible spending accounts (FSAs). Your employer may have selected a healthcare account plan. Whichever type is available to you, you can be assured that Providence Health Plan, along with our partner HealthEquity, is committed to ensuring that your enrollment, billing and claims are seamless. Explore the links below to see if one of these health accounts is right for you. Understand how your health plan and providers work together The following example provides a general overview of what to expect when your use your health plan benefits: You need to go to the doctor for an ongoing cough. You want to use your benefits wisely, so you decide to access care from an in-network provider. - Finding a provider Find an in-network provider by searching the provider directory. - Scheduling an appointment Use your myProvidence account via myChart or call the office to arrange your visit. - Going to see your doctor Your provider finds that you have an infection. She prescribes an antibiotic to treat your infection. - Picking up your prescription You fill your prescription by choosing an in-network pharmacy which you found by searching the Provider & Pharmacy Directory. - What your provider pays The health plan pays its share of amount(s) owed to your provider and sends you an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) explaining how the claim was paid. - What you pay You will receive a bill from your provider for any amount you owe. That amount will be paid directly to the provider or through Providence bill pay for Providence providers. What if you didn't have health insurance? Seeking medical treatment for illnesses or accidents would be very expensive without health insurance. Health insurance offsets the cost of doctor bills, surgery, hospital, laboratory and X-ray fees, and pharmacy costs. Take a look at the following two examples that compare costs without insurance to costs with insurance in a plan that has a preferred provider network: Example 1: Sample healthcare cost for a sports injury (costs are approximate)* | | Service | | Cost without insurance | | Cost with insurance |Office visit||$190||$20 copay| 20% of |Urgent care||$190||$38 pay 20% of the cost)| | Total cost: | | $2,890 | | $730 *This example assumes the calendar year deductible has been met and that care is received from an in-network provider. Your insurance provider pays the in-network provider the balance, up to the contracted rate. Example 2: Sample healthcare cost for strep throat* | | Service | | Cost without insurance | | Cost with insurance |Office visit||$190||$20 copay| |Prescription for an antibiotic||$50||$10 copay| | | $240 | | $30 *This example assumes a calendar year deductible need not be met for the plan to pay benefits, care received was from an in-network provider and a generic prescription drug was purchased. Providence Health Plan pays the in-network provider the balance, up to the contracted rate.
