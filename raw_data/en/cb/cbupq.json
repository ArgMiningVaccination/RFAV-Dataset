Hence, many modules to fill the gap are prepared and being prepared in collaboration with The Carter Center. Gondar University College of Medica l Science has so far produced two modules on Pneumonia in Under Five Children and Malaria Uncomplicated and this is the third on Expanded Pr ogram on Immunization (EPI). EPI is one of the main in tegrated health services in the country. Expanding this program will decrease the morb idity and mortality due to vaccine preventable diseases. Basically, this module is prepared fo r the health center team, but other professionals at the service areas can also use it. It should be clear that this module is not a substitute for text books, but rather can help students to underst and the program in a simplified way and push students to make the teaching st udent-centered and team approach. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This module is the contribution of many scholars at Gondar University College. Hence, we would li ke to thank all those who contributed directly or indirectly for the development of this module. We would like to extend our deep apprec iation to Gondar University College and The Carter Center for funding and arranging everything for the completion of the module. We would like also to extend our hear t-felt gratitude for those National and International experts who had spent t heir precious time on reviewing the whole document, to mention some, Prof essor Dennis Carlson, Professor Nicholas Cunningham, Dr. Jacobs Troy, and Dr. Enda le Tefera of Addis Ababa University.

In 1977 EPI set the followin g three long-term objectives: To reduce morbidity and mortality fr om six major childhood diseases, i.e. measles, tuberculosis, tetanus, pertussi s, poliomyelitis and diphtheria by immunizing all children throughout the world by 1990, To promote national self-reliance in de livering immunization services within the comprehensive health service, and To promote regional self-reliance in vaccine production and quality control. The Ethiopian health poli cy had given emphasis to th e prevention and control of major communicable diseases. Thus, in Et hiopia EPI was initiated in 1980. The objective of the National Immunization Policy was to reduce mortality and morbidity in children from the EPI target diseases through the immunization of all children under the age of one. The program had been planned to make immunization services available to 10% of the population in 198 0 and to increase immunization access by 10% each year. Despite various initiatives and campaigns over the years, immunization coverage (DPT 3)1 in most parts of Ethiopia remains low (41.91%), and this contributes to high morbidity and mortalit y among children. Some of the factors accounting for under immunization service are: \u0083 lack of transportation \u0083 ineffective cold chain \u0083 shortages of trained health personnel 2 \u0083 poor inter-sectoral collaboration \u0083 inadequate community involvement and participation. The main purposes of this module are: a. To bring a significant change in EPI coverage, t ogether with other strategies, proper training of health professionals is mandatory. This module will contribute a lot in training of the Health Center Team and other health professionals in the health service areas. b. To help students/users to learn through self-help, and c. To assist the shortage of texts and referenced books on the subject. 1.2. Directions for using the module 1 DPT 3 = EPI coverage is measured using th e third dose of DPT as indicator. Continue with the par t of the core module . Attempt to answer all the pre-test questions and write your answers. Go through the rest of the core module. Do learning activity one in t he core module - Case Study. Each category of students should read their respective Satellite Module. Answer all post-test questions. Study and discuss the specific le arning objectives, activities, roles and tasks of each ca tegory of students, and CHWs/Front-line health worker s as well as caregivers. Compare your answers of t he pre-test and post-test by checking against the key given. 3 UNIT TWO CORE MODULE 2.1.

Learning Activity One: CASE STUDY Part I Woizero Kenubish Alemu, w ho delivered a week ago, came to Kossoyie health post with her male newborn. The mother complained that her baby is unusually crying, has difficulty of sucking and swallowing. She gave further history that the delivery took place at home and was attended by local traditional birth attendant. The assistant had used a blade to cu t the cord and applied cow-dung. The mother responded that she had no history of any immunization and follow up of antenatal clinic. Questions 1. What do you think the caus e of illness of this child? 2. Why do you ask about immunization and antenatal care? 3. What do you advise to the lo cal traditional birth attendant? Part II The Front-line community health work er (CHW) examined the newborn. On physical examination, he f ound out that the newborn was restless, difficulty of opening the mouth, and unhea led umbilical stump Questions 1. What is your impression now as to the cause of this child's illness? 2. What measures should be taken by t he community health worker to save the baby? Part III The CHW advised the mother to take her sick newborn to th e nearest health center where you work. Questions 1. What would you do for this baby? 9 Part IV After proper management in the health inst itutions the baby recovered from his illness. W/ro. Kenubish thank ed the health worker and returned home after two weeks. The newborn was in a good condition and the family was very happy. Unfortunately, after a month, the child became sick again and developed fever, sneezing, running nose, and mild c ough. Gradually the cough became worse and was continuous. Because of this problem, the mother took the newborn to a local \"Awaki\" (local healer). Then the local healer looked at the child and gave chopped materials. He advised the mother to dissolve in water and give the child to drink. The mother gave the dissolved \"medication \" but there was no improvement and finally she took him back to the health center. Questions 1. What is/are your probable impr ession/s of the infant's illness? 2. What will be the management of this case? 3. What do you advise to the mother? 102.4. Definition and Epidemiology of EPI Target Diseases Table 1. Definition of EPI Target Diseases Ser. No. Target Disease Definition 1 Pertussis / Whooping cough An acute bacterial disease of the respiratory tract characterized by intense cough in paroxysms and someti mes with forceful inspiratory gasp and absence of fever, tachypnea, soar throat, hoarseness, etc. 2 Tetanus A neurological disease characterized by generalized increased rigidity and convulsive spasms of skeletal mu scles from the bacterial toxin. 3 Poliomyelitis / Polio An acute viral disease with severity ranging from in apparent infection to paralytic disease. It is a crippling dis ease that can occur in adults but it is mainly commoner in children. 4 Diphtheria An acute bacteria disease of tonsils, pharynx, larynx, and nose. It occasionally affects the conjuncti va, genitalia and can damage the heart. 5 Measles It is a highly contagious acute viral disease characterized by fever, runny nose, cough, irritability, conjunctiviti s, lacrimation, enanthema labial mucosa, and maculopapular rash appearing in a shower distribution over a period of 3 days. 6 Tuberculosis (TB) It is a chronic mycobacterial disease wit h a wide variety of clinical forms, pulmonary tuberculosis being the predominant form. 11Table 2. Epidemiology of EPI Target diseases Disease Transmission Predisposing factors Magnitude and distribution Pertussis - Spreads from person to person by droplets, i.e. through coughing or sneezing etc. - Not being immunized - Overcrowding - Poor ventilation - Malnutrition - 60,000,000 cases of pertussis occur per year world wide, with more than half a million deaths Tetanus - Neonatal tetanus mainly occurs as a result of umbilical cord contamination at birth. - A person may become infected if contaminated soil or dung enters a wound or cut. - Cutting umbilical cord with non sterile instrument. - Lack of adequate tetanus toxoid (TT) immunization of mothers. - Applying cow dung, mud and other contaminated materials on the umbilical stump. - Home deliveries attended by untrained traditional birth attendants. - Harmful traditional health practices like uvulectomy, tonsillectomy. - Tetanus occurs worldwide and is endemic in 90 developing countries, but its incidence varies considerably. - Neonatal tetanus is the most common form, which kills approximately 800,000 infants each year. - In developing countries, neonatal tetanus represents about half of all neonatal deaths and about 25% of infant mortality. - In Ethiopia neonatal tetanus accounts for two thirds of all tetanus deaths. Poliomyelitis - Feco-oral (main) - Airborne droplets (rare). - Not being immunized - Poor sanitation and hygienic practices - Overcrowding - Poverty \u0083 It occurs in many regions of the developing world. Globally in 2001 were: - 80% decrease in number of polio cases (from 2979 to 480) - 50% decrease in endemic countries (from 20 to 10) - 51 countries in Europe have been polio-free for 3 years. - No wild poliovirus type 2 isolated for the last 2 years. 12Table 2. continued ... Disease Transmission Predisposing fact ors Magnitude and distribution Diphtheria - By droplets and secretions from the nose, throat and eyes. - Contact with skin ulcers - Clothing and other articles that have been contaminated with fluid from skin ulcers - Over crowding - Poor living conditions - Not being immunized - Malnutrition - It tends to be a disease of the colder months and of temperate climatic zones. - Affects people of all ages but mostly non-immunized children under 15 years old. - Although incidence has decreased worldwide, it remains endemic in many developing countries. Measles - By droplet spread or direct contact with noise/throat secretions of infected persons. - Also spread by indirect contact with articles soiled by secretions - Not being immunized - Overcrowding - Malnutrition - In countries with low immunization coverage, measles is common in children - In countries with effective childhood immunization programme such as Europe and U.S.A. measles is limited to older age groups. - In Ethiopia measles is among the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children. - Major outbreaks with large attack rates resulting in as high as 15-20 oC case fatality rates have been reported in Ethiopia - It is highly contagious disease affecting nearly 90% of susceptible household contacts. - Epidemics occur every 2 - 3 years in population with large susceptible group. 13Table 2. continued ... Disease Transmission Predisposing fact ors Magnitude and distribution Tuberculosis - Respiratory route: Airborne droplet nuclei from sputum of person with infectious tuberculosis. - Alimentary route: Ingestion of infected raw or non-pasteurized milk. - Poor nutritional status - Not being immunized - Infection with HIV/AIDS - Habit of drinking non- boiled/non-pasteurized milk - Overcrowding - Contact with pulmonary tuberculosis cases - About one third of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis. - Every year 3 million people die from tuberculosis, mostly in developing countries where it kills one in five adults. - Nearly 75% of pulmonary tuberculosis cases in developing countries belong to the economically active group of the population. - In Ethiopia in 1993 E.C. was the 3 rd leading causes of out patient morbidity and the first cause in hospital death? 142.5. Characteristics and Mana gement of EPI Target Diseases 2.5.1. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Etiologic agent - A gram-negative bacterium called Bordetella pertussis. Pathogenesis - The organism produces oxin and affects larynx, trachea, sometimes the alveoli. Clinical features - Incubation period is 7 - 17 da ys. The symptoms of classical pertussis last about 6 weeks and are divided into 3 stages. A. Catarrhal stage - The onset is insidious, - Sneezing - Running nose - Anorexia - Malaise lasts 1- 2 weeks - Night cough B. Paroxysmal stage - Lasts 2-4 weeks following the infection. - Characterized by rapid consecutive (5-15) cough before a breath is taken and followed by deep hurried inspiration (whoop). - Post cough vomiting is common at all ages, - Factors stimulating cough include fright, anger, crying, sneezing, inhalation of irritant, and over distention of the stomach. C. Convalescent stage - It begins after 4 weeks of the illness, and is manifested by a decrease in the frequency and severity of t he paroxysms of coughing. Diagnosis A. Clinical - The child is well appearing and play ful between patoxysms of cough. - Presence of children with similar illness in the family or vicinity. - There is no chest finding on physical examination. - The diagnosis is usually made on the distinctive clinical feature of the cough. To observe the classical type of cough put tongue depressor to stimulate the coughting. N.B. Not all children with pertussis whoo p. Whooping is uncommon in infants < 3 months. 15B. Laboratory - WBC 15000 - 20000/mm3 (rarely to 50,000/mm3) - 60 - 80% Lymphocytes - Microscopy; Gram stain - Culture to isolate the organism Differential Diagnosis - Aspiration of foreign bodies - Viral pneumonia - Influenza - Acute bronchitis and broncholitis. Management A. Specific measures - Antimicrobial - Erthromycine - Ampicillin - Sedatives - Promethazine Hydrochloride - Phenobarbitone (when t here is seizure) - Steroid - Predinsolone B. General measures - Frequent small feeding and continue feeding if vomiting occurs soon after meal. - Oxygen if needed - Severe cases especially inf ants are best managed in hospital. - Prophylactic Erythromycin for all hous e hold members and other contacts regardless of age, history of immunization of symptoms. Complications - Apnea - Conjunctival hemorrhage - Otitis media 162.5.2. Tetanus tetani Pathogenesis Tetanus toxin, after germination of t he Cl.tetani spores in a contaminated umbilical stump or wound in ot her parts of the body, is released to the peripheral nerves and circulation. Th is causes sustained exci tatory neuronal discharge and muscle contraction. Clinical features Tetanus occurs in several clinical forms. One of the most important manifestations is neonatal tetanus (NNT). Its incubation period is from 1-14 days (in 90% of the cases) but it can last up to 54 days. The period of onset (the time between the first symptom and start of the spasm) rang es from hours to day. The clinical featur e has two forms: A. Local tetanus - pain around the umbilicus - dirt, dung and clotted blood are usually present B. Generalized tetanus - It is the most common form of the di sease and presents wit h early symptoms. - Progressive difficulty in feeding (sucking and swallowing) - Hunger and crying. This is followed by paralysis or diminished movement - Lock jaw (clenched) - Stiffness to the touch and s pasms with or without opisthotonus. - Board like abdomen. - Hyper extended extremities. 17Diagnosis Diagnosis of neonatal tetanus is mainly by clinical features. Prognosis Indicators of poor prognosis are: - Incubation period < 7 days - Period of onset < 48 hrs. - Presence of spasm - Autonomic nervous system disturbances like, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmia. Complications - Respiratory arrest - Laryngeal spasm - Presence of autonomic nervous system disturbances. Prevention - Immunization of children and women. - Health information on harmful practices - Training of Traditional Birth Attendants (TTBA). 182.5.3. Poliomyelitis Etiologic agent - It is caused by poliovi ruses type I, II and III. Pathogenesis - The virus affects the anterior horn ce lls of the spinal cord and several areas of the brain. Damage may be reve rsible with recovery, but it may go on to irreversible nuclear destruc tion where muscle paralysis results. Clinical features - Incubation period is 6 - 14 days - Fever, malaise, headache and muscle pain - Nausea, vomiting, soar throat and stiffness of the neck and back with or without paralysis. - Paralysis usually affects the legs, more often one. Diagnosis - It is mainly by clinical features. Management Acute phase - Keep the limbs position with cushions - Apply warm packs - Provide analgesics - Active and passive movements are assisted by physiotherapist after the acute phase ended. Recovery phase - Continue with full range of passive/act ive movement of the affected limb every day. Residual phase - Regular out patient supervision of physical, social and economic problems if needed. 19 2.5.4. Diphtheria Etiologic agent - It is caused by Gram-positive bacterium called Coryne- bacterium diphtheriae. Pathogenesis - The bacterium produces exotoxin which causes local tissue inflammation and necrosis. In cases where the pharynx is involved, there are patches of a grayish membrane with a surrounding dul l red inflammatory zone, which may cause pharyngeal obstruction. Clinical features - The incubation period is usually 2 - 5 days. - Sore throat which may be followed by stridor. - Grayish white membrane seen in oropharynx. - Upper airway obstruction by the membrane. Diagnosis - Clinical signs mentioned above - Microscopy -Gram stain Management A. Specific - Diphtheria antitoxin if the diagnosis is strongly suspected clinically. - Antimicrobial therapy wit h penicillin or erythromycin B. General - Strict bed rest and sedation - Intubations if needed. Complications - Airway obstruction - Toxic cardiomyopathy (50 - 60% of diphtheria deaths) - Vocal cord paralysis 202.5.5. Measles Etiologic agent - It is caused by Measles Virus. Pathogenesis - The essential lesion of measles is f ound the the and intesti nal tract; and in the conjunctivae. Clinical features - The incubation period ranged from 7 - 18 days. - The initial stage (catarrhal stage) st arts with fever, cough, sneezing, running nose and red, runny eyes. Koplik's spot s in the mouth occur before the rash. - A characteristic red blotchy rash appears on the third to 7th day, beginning on the face becoming generalized, lasting 4 - 7 days. Diagnosis - It is made mainly by clinical features epidemiological grounds. Management - Severe cases only are admitted to the hospital. - Mothers are advised about care at hom e which includes - reducing fever, maintaining hydration and nutrition. - Serious complications are treated in hospitals. Complications - Pneumonia - Otitis media - Malnutrition - Encephalitis - Eye problems and blindness (absci sed with Vitamin A deficiency) 212.5.6. Tuberculosis Etiologic agent - Pulmonary tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis of the gastrointestinal tr act is caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Pathogenesis - Tubercle bacilli infect - The tubercle: \u0083 May heal, leaving scar-tissue \u0083 May continue as a granuloma \u0083 May eventually proceed to necrosis, liquefaction, sloughing, and - The initial lesion may disseminate tubercle bacilli: \u0083 By extension to adjacent tissue \u0083 Via bloodstream \u0083 Via lymphatic system \u0083 Through the bronchi. Clinical features - The incubation period ranged is 4 - 12 w eeks but the infection may persist for months or years before the disease develops. - The clinical features of pulmonary tuberculosis are: \u0083 Persistent cough for more than 3 weeks. \u0083 Sputum production, which may or may not be blood stained. \u0083 Weight loss \u0083 Chest pain \u0083 Shortness of breath \u0083 Intermittent fever, night sweats \u0083 Less of appetite \u0083 Fatigue and malaise 22Diagnosis - Clinical features - used laboratory technique \u0083 Culture - Tuberclin skin testing - Chest X-ray Management - Chemotherapy: there are two phases of treatment 1. Intensive or initial phase - the first two or thre e months of treatment. 2. Continuation phase - the remaining duration of treatment. - Drug Regimens There are two recommended standard tuberculosis drug regimens: \u0083 Directly observed Treatment short course (DOTS), which is for 8 months; in DOTS the patients are given the drugs under observation by health worker for the first two months. \u0083 Long course chemotheraph (LCC); wh ich is given for 12 months. During the initial phase of short course therapy the recommended regimen of uncomplicated pulmonary tuber culosis is two months of INH, Rifamcpin and Pyrazinamide followed by four mo nths of Isoniazid and Rifampin. 232.6. Prevention and Control of EPI target diseases - Health Information about the importance of immunization. - Proper management and inspection of vaccines. - Early diagnosis and treatment. - Ensuring a clean and safe environment. - Avoid harmful traditional health practices. - Training of community health worker s (CHW) and traditi onal birth attendants (TBA) - Integration of immunization into al l aspects of primary health care - Mass mobilization. - Integration of nutrition educ ation with health services. - Provision of services and expansion of outreach sites. - Integrated package of sc hool health interventions. 2.7. Immunization Immunization is the process of adm inistrating a weakened or killed microorganism or its product to stimulate the host's immunologic response to that antigen. Types of Vaccines: Vaccines can be - Killed microorganisms (pertussis), - live but weakened - attenuated - mi croorganisms (measles, polio TB) - toxoids (tetanus and diphtheria). Target group - all under one year children and women of ch ildbearing age (15 - 49 years). Side effects of vaccines BCG 1. Normal reaction - a small red, tender sw elling about 10 mm across appears at the place of immunization after about 2 weeks - Abscess: due to injection errors - Ulcer - Scar 242. Severe reaction - Sometimes there is severe lo cal inflammation or deeper abscess. - Sometimes the lymphatic glands near t he elbow or in the axilla swell. This may be because: You used a needle that was not sterile You injected too deeply under the skin by mistake You gave too large a dose of vaccine. DPT - Fever - Soreness at the injection site - Abscess - Convulsion (rare) Polio - Usually none Tetanus Toxoid (TT) - Pain, redness and swelling at the infection site. Measles - Fever 5 - 8 days late - Occasional rash Contraindications of vaccines DPT should not be given if the child has developed severe reactions like shock, convulsions, anaphylactic reaction, etc. to the previous dose of DPT. This is a rare side effect due to the pertussis component of DPT vaccine. Infants with clinical AIDS should not receive BCG vaccine and oral polio, but should be given the other EPI vaccines. 25Immunization Schedule A. For those who start at birth: Contact Age of Child Vaccines 1st At birth BCG and Polio 0 2nd 6 weeks OPV 1 and DPT 1 3rd 10 weeks OPV 2 and DPT 2 4th 14 weeks OPV 3 and DPT 3 5th 9 months Measles B. For those who start later Age of child Antigens Less than 6 weeks BCG and OPV 1 Above 6 weeks BCG if not given previously OPV (3 doses) DPT (3 doses) Above 9 months BCG if not given previously OPV DPT Measles C. Tetanus toxoid vaccine schedule for women (15 - 49 years) Dose Minimum interval Duration of protection TT1 - 0 TT2 4 weeks 3 years TT3 6 months 5 years TT4 1 year 10 years TT5 1 year Life long Note: If a woman was given 3 doses of DPT vaccine when she was a child, provided that a written document of her immunization is available, and the doses are given at the right intervals, the 3 doses of DPT can be counted as two doses of TT. 26Childhood Immunization Schedule Age Birth 1 month 2 months3 months4 months5 months6 months ...9 months Vaccine BCG B C G Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus DPT 1 DPT 2 DPT 3 Oral polio Polio 0 OPV 1 OPV 2 OPV 3 Measles Measles vaccine Age in week 6th weeks 10th weeks 14th weeks 2.8. The cold chain The cold chain is the interconnection of equipment or people t hat ensure vaccine potency by keeping vaccine cold all th e way from the manufacturer to the mother/child. Manufacturer Airport Central Vaccine stores Regional Stores Zonal stores Health Center District Health office store Mobile or Outreach Service Health post Mother and Child Source : WHO: immunization in practi ce 1989 (Slightly modified). 27Equipment Materials that are used in the cold chain include: - thermometers - ice packs - vaccine carriers - cold boxes - refrigerators and freezers. Note : Skilled human power to maintain the cold chain is necessary. Precautions for vaccines - All vaccines have to be stored at 0 oC to 8oC both at the health center and the outreach unit. - Storage time for all vaccines is up to a month at the hea lth center/health station and up to 1-2 days at the outreach unit. - Measles and polio be kept frozen. - Never freeze DPT or tetanus vaccine. - Keep diluents with vaccine in refr igerator if there is space. - If not, refrigerate at least the diluents needed for the following day. 2.9. EPI Delivery Strategies Static: immunization performed as part of routine activity of the Health units. Outreach: an immunization approach in which t he staffs of health unit go out and administer vaccine to mothers and children in their catchments areas. Mobile: an immunization approach only singl e dose vaccination (measles, BCG) in nomadic, settlement areas and mostly used for controlling epidemics of measles. Campaign: an immunization approach conduct ed by mobilizing the community, example polio and measles vaccination. 282.10. Indicators The following are some indicators t hat show a successful immunization programme: - BCG scar on the right shoulder. - Completed immunization card. - Vaccine storage times and temperatures at health centre and out reach level. 2.11. Immunization Problems A. Drop Out A drop out is defined as a ch ild or a woman who failed to return for subsequent doses for which he or she is eligible. The possible causes of drop out rates are: - unsure of dates of return - long wait at the vaccination centre - vaccination centers open at inconvenient hours - some health workers do not explain the need of completing vaccination. - negative attitude of some health workers towards the program. - mothers usually busy on other engagements. - family left the place for a while. - child develops side effects or was sick on the appointed date. - was sick on the appointed date. A child or a woman who di scontinued the immunization program should not have to restart the immunization. There is no maximum interval between two immunizations. B. Missed opportunities Current policy is that all children and mothers at the he alth facility for any reason should be screened for immunization status and vaccinated if eligible. 29Common causes of missed opportunities are: - health workers do not know the policy - health workers screen but tell patients to return later - health workers only vaccinate wo men with TT if they are pregnant - health workers only vaccinate the index child, miss the siblings. - health workers only open a vial if there are enough clients who need it - false contraindications to immunization, example not giving polio vaccine to a child with diarrhea. - logistical problems, such as vaccine shortages, poor clinic organization, and inefficient clinic scheduling - the failure to administer simultaneously all vaccines for which a child was eligible - accessibility; time (women carry household responsibilities), distance, cost of transportation - Acceptability: culture, rumors, beliefs, etc. Dropouts and missed opportunities are caus es of low vaccination coverage, and have potential solutions. These are: - Social mobilization - Dropout tracing mechanisms - In service training to community hea lth workers and uti lization of other motivation mechanisms. - High level advocacy. - Get commitment by the local leaders. - Monitoring and supervision the program - Ensure financial and logistics su pport for the health institutions. - Monitor coverage periodically. - Daily integrated health service for all women and children attending the health units. 30 2.12. Assessment and Evaluation of EPI Services The ultimate goal of EPI is not to provide immunizati ons to all populations but rather it is to significantly reduce t he morbidity and mortalit y from the vaccine preventable diseases. Always priori ty should be placed on monitoring immunization coverage and disease incidence. This can be found from: - Health institution reports, - Surveillance: It is defined as a regular collecting, co mpiling, analysis, and interpretation of current data on the frequency of specific diseases (WHO). It is the regular dissemination of acquired information to those responsible for disease control and health service planning. Purposes of surveillance system include A. To facilitate the early recognition of changes in the patterns of diseases; B. To identify changes in environmental and host factors that may lead to an increase in the frequency of the diseases; C. To monitor the safety and effectivene ss of prevention and control measures; - Survey, cluster survey The EPI Coverage Survey Often routine reports are inaccurate and one may have to resort to EPI coverage survey to determine the coverage, and provide additional information. WHO's Expanded Program of Immunization has developed a rapid survey methodology which is valuable not only to determine vaccination coverage, but also reasons underlying for failure to vaccinate children. The main advantage of this methodology is that it can be completed quickly and it's technically mu ch easier to carry out than a simple random sample survey in populations that are not censured. 31Its principal disadvantage is that it a llows one to draw conclusions about the population as a whole; one can't compare sub-populati ons. For example, one cannot compare rates between the boys and girls in the sample population using the standard 30 by 7 cluster methodology. However, with modification of sample size, this too is possible. The standard cluster survey methodol ogy involves choosing 30 different \"clusters\" of 7-10 households. A \"cluste r\" is a randomly chosen group which, for the EPI coverage survey, contains 7- 10 children of appropriate age (12-23 months). Thus, each unit randomly select ed is a group or \"cluster\" of persons rather than an individual. In order to select the clusters, one must first know the total population of the area under consideration, as well as the populat ions of the various towns, villages, or other centers in the area. These popul ations' centers ar e listed with their population, and a cumulative population besides it. A sampling interval is determined by di viding the total population by 30. A random number will be select ed between one and the determined sampling interval. The community for which the cu mulative population equals or exceeds the random number is selected. It will contai n the first cluster. Add the sampling interval to that random number. The community for which the cumulative population equals or exceeds this value is selected as the community containing the second cluster. And so on, unt il the all 30 communities have been chosen. Large communities may contain more one cluster. Once the communities have been selected, one then chooses the cluster. This is done by selecting a starting household. If the community has been censured and a list of households available, this is re latively easy procedure. One numbers the houses and selects, at random, one hous e, the first house. If no household number exists, one goes to the center of the community (churches, mosque, 32school, market, etc.) and selects a random direction in which to proceed (usually by spinning a bottle). One then counts t he number of houses between the center and the periphery of the selected quarter and selects one house at random, this becomes the starting house. The second household to be visited is the one closest to the first (i.e. the household with the front door nearest to the first door) and so on until you complete t he required cluster number. If any of your households contain more than one child, it is advisable to consider including hem all. The vaccination status of each child is determined usually by card. Once all 30 clusters have been finished, one will have 210 or up to 300 children. So, after this procedure, we know wher e we are in terms of the coverage of vaccination for the target group is concerned. What is next? In addition to determining coverage, t he EPI coverage survey allows one to identify reasons for immunization failure. Fo r all those in the ta rget group who are found not to have been completely vaccinated, the mothers are asked to identify the major reasons why? 33 Immunization Monitoring Chart It shows the progress you are making in ra ising immunization coverage in your catchement areas. This chart enables the number of people you actually immunize each month with your coverage targets. 34UNIT THREE SATELLITE MODULES Satellite Module for Health Officer Students on Expanded Program on Immunization 3.1.1.

Immunization A. Active immunization The protection of the host in which eit her the altered organism or its product induces the host to produce antibodies. It involves stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies and cellular immune responses that protect against the infectious agents. B. Passive immunization The protection of the suscept ible host by administration of protective antibodies produced by another host, e.g. tetanus ant itoxin. It consists of providing temporary protection through administrati on of exogenously produced antibody such as immune globulin. 3.1.5. Assessment and Evaluation of EPI A. Health institution reports B. Surveillance See the core module C. Survey, cluster survey 383.1.6. Immunization problems, solutions and drop out rates calculation Problems - Reasons for drop out - See core module Dropout rates calculations - Over all drop out rate = Coverage with BCG - Coverage with measles x 100 Coverage with BCG - Drop out rate for a single antigen (e.g. OPV) = Coverage with OPV 1 - Coverage with OPV 3 x 100 Coverage with OPV 1 There is a problem whenever the dropout rate is greater than 10%. It is essential to determine why the failure occurred. - Missed opportunities - See core module - Culture and Beliefs Though the immunization service is a ccessible, there are some people who are not using the service because of culture and beliefs. - Lack of geographic access includes lack of transportation facilities and spare parts for vehicles. - Problems associated with the vaccines a) BCG Efficacy is uncertain b) Pertussis - Low immunogenecity - Requires 3 doses 39- Common minor side effects in 50% - Rare serious toxicity e.g. Seizures, neurological disorder c) OPV - Thermal instability - Poor immunogenecity - Requires multiple doses d) Measles - Thermal instability - Inadequate immunogenesity when circul ating maternal antibodies present. Problems of knowing the target population - Knowing the target po pulation is important because the necessary vaccines and logistic could be prepared earlier. Problems related to the supplies, cold chain and maintenance. - Shortages of supplies like syringes, needles, vaccines, ice boxes, vaccine carriers, etc. - Maintenance of cold chain equipm ent is costly and unavailability of spare parts. Problem of community involvement - Without the involvement of t he community EPI program will fail. They are important in the planni ng, implementation & evaluation process. 40 Lack of inter-sector collaboration - EPI is the responsibility of all sector s/ministerial offices, not only left to health workers. It needs the colla boration of all bod ies/authorities. Without them it is impossible to reach EPI goal. Ineffective management - Assignment of unskilled manager. - Poor scheduling and allo cation of resources. - Poor information system resulting in inadequate recording and reporting. Solutions Developing dropout or defaulters trac ing mechanisms like using community health workers/front line health workers to trace defaulters. This is sensitizing the population through health education, discussion, etc. about the program. Refer to the core module for other solutions. Calculations on Drop Out Rate Instruction : Work out the following questions based on the data given in the table. In 2000, the Family Health Department of one of t he Regional Health Bureaus conducted EPI cluster survey. A total of 300 children age 12 month of 23 months were identified by the survey. Out of the 300 children, 70 di dn't start vaccination at all. The vaccination cards of the remaining 230 children were checked. The table below shows the number of children who got different vaccines. 41 Vaccine No. of children who got the vaccine BCG 230 DPT 1/OPV 1 200 DPT 2/OPV 2 180 DPT 3/OPV 3 150 Measles 130 Calculate: 1. The overall drop out rate. 2. Drop out rate for DPT. 3.1.7. Management of EPI Procedures to follow in conducting EPI include: Know the catchement area. Know the target population through survey. Organize and conduct in service training for the staff. Allocate resources such as - Assign staff, - Procure the required am ount of vaccines, refriger ator and other supplies, - The necessary financial support (budget), - Transportation, etc. Manage the cold chain - Arrangement of vaccines in the refrigerator - Use different mechanisms of ensuring the cold chain. Identify the strategy to be used and their frequencies. Prepare and organize i mmunization schedule/session (e.g. how many out reach sites?) 42 Give appropriate information for the clients such as: - be specific on the date and time of the next immunization. - give the client a writte n note of the date and time. - the place of the next immunization, particularly if you change the previous site. - number of visits a child and mot her still need in order to be fully immunized - side-effects may occur Collect and distribute materi als for recording and reporting. Social mobilization (the clients, comm unity, other sector members, etc.) to create awareness. Devise means of monitoring, supervising evaluation, such as - Prepare and use monitoring chart. - Calculate immunization co verage, drop out rate, etc. Identify problems and give solutions. Identify those illegible who are not vaccinated and are listed as dropouts. 43Learning Activity: Two Instruction Fill the boxes by selecting rela ted facts listed from A - D.

Prevention and control of EPI target diseases A. Survey and surveillance 1. Survey - An investigation in which information is systematically collected. Conditions to conduct survey when: developing new site an out break occurs 59 there is need to know EPI target groups laboratory analysis indicates a danger to health there are changes in the health of the community. Activities under survey are: mapping of the catchment areas and house numbering. identification of total number of popul ation and house holds in the catchment area identification of ta rget groups particularly mothers and children assessment of environmental health conditions data compilation, analysis and interpretation 2. Surveillance - is an ongoing scrutiny of t he factors that determine the occurrence and distribution of di seases with the purpose of detecting changes in trends or dist ribution in order to initiate investigative or control measures. Surveillance systems are: routine reporti ng (see Annex I) compiled reporting Components of surveillance system Surveillance of cases. Surveillance of animal reservoirs or vectors Surveillance of environmental factors relevant to health. Surveillance of demographic changes. B. Information, Health Edu cation and Communication (IEC) \u00be Mass mobilization through health information. \u00be Increase immunization awareness/knowledge for: pregnant women attending antenatal services women of child bearing age th rough regular health services 60 women coming with children to imm unization or regular primary care facilities. women coming with or without children to immunization community as whole \u00be Ensure clean and safe delivery which can be achieved by: clean hands of the birth attendants. clean cutting and care of the umbilical stump. clean surface where the delivery is performed. \u00be Training and supervision of delivery staffs Health workers front line health workers (CHW) \u00be Eliminate use of certain tr aditional practices such as cow dung, ash, contaminated blades, Contaminated cord tie. C. Cold Chain 1. Management and inspection of vaccines Read the cold chain record paper about the previous dates and time. Record the external thermome ter reading of the refrigerator. Open the refrigerator. Record the internal thermometer reading. See the arrangements of vaccines on the shelf inside the refrigerator Close the refrigerator. Record the thermometer reading of t he refrigerator externally and check weather it has increased or not. Check the shelf life of vaccines and expiry dates. 61 2. Vaccine storage times and temper ature (refer to the core module) 3. Refrigerators and Freezers \u00be Is vaccine storage space sufficient? Is there sufficient ai r space between the vaccines? Have you considered new activities to increase immunization coverage which may raise the maximum stok es needed in the refrigerator? Have you remembered to load bottles of water (or icepacks with water) in the refrigerator to keep the refrigerator to cool if the energy source fails? Do you have more than one-mont h supply of vaccine stored in the refrigerator? \u00be Is the temperature efficiently controlled? Your refrigerator is adequate for vacci ne storage only if it can maintain an internal temperature between 0oC - 8oC. If the temperature rises above + 8oC Store water bottles or icepacks filled wit h water in every spare place in the refrigerator, except one half of the volume, which needed for air circulation. This helps stabilize the te mperature stops it from fluctuating widely during the day. Close the windows or ventilator at night to keep the store room warmer. D. Environmental sanitation and prope r hygienic practices related to EPI target diseases Proper disposal of human ex creta and other liquid wastes. Perfect of food from all kinds contaminants. Proper hygienic practices (hand washing) Proper ventilation (through and cross vent ilation)to facilitate air circulation Avoid over-crowding Proper construction, maintenance, and treatment of drinking water supplies.

Satellite Module for Medical Laboratory Technology Students on Expanded Program on Immunization 3.4.1. Introduction Purpose and use of the satellite module This satellite module is prepared for M edical Laboratory Technology students. It emphasizes only areas that were not covered by the core module. Directions - Students are advised to study the core module before going into the satellite module. - After completing the satellite module answer all the questions given as a pretest at the beginning of the core module. - Compare your results with that of the previous pretest given. 3.4.2. Learning objectives Upon completion of the activities in this satellite module, the students will be able to: - Describe the basic microbiological pr ocedures for specimen collection, handling, processing, exami nation or dispatching to a reference laboratory. - Identify and differentiate the specific bacterial agents from bacteriological specimens. - Determine some hematological tests 3.4.3. Laboratory Diagnosis The EPI target diseases are usually diagnosed based on clinical features. This is because: The diseases are acute and therefore prompt management of the patient is crucible before laboratory results are available. Health center laboratories have no ad equate facilities to investigate the etiologic agents. 67 Nevertheless, the health center labor atories can perform Grains stain & investigate microscopically the etiologic agents for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus for confirmation of cases wh en requested. The most im portant role of health center laboratory is to refer microbiologi cal specimens to a reference laboratory for further investigation. Laboratory investigations of EPI target diseases. A. Corynebactorium diphtheria Morphology and stai ning characteristics - Gram positive rod - Non motile - Non capsulated, non spore former - Appear in clusters joined at angle like 'Chinese letters' Specimens Throat, nasopharyngeal swab, and other suspected lesions. Collection of dispatch of specimens Using a sterile cotton wool swab a spec imen can be collected either from the throat or nasopharynx Put it in a sterile container with care not to contaminate the swab. To do investigati on in the health center laborato ry, label the specimen, make a smear, stain and look under the microscope To dispatch the specimen to a refe rence laboratory, put the swab in the appropriate transport medi a, label and send it as soon as possible. Staining method - Gram's stain Make a smear of the spec imen and fix the dried smear. Cover the fixed smear with cryst al violet stain for 30 seconds. Rapidly wash off the stain with clean water. 68 Tip of all the water and cover the smear with Lugol's iodine for 30-60 seconds. Wash of the iodine with clean water. Decolorize rapidly (few se conds) with acetone alcohol. Wash immediately with clean water. Cover the smear with neutra l red stain for 2 minutes. Wash off the stain with clean water. Wipe the back of the slide clean, and air dry. Examine the smear microscopically. B. Bordetella pertussis Morphology and stai ning characteristics Gram negative coceobacillos (short rod) Non motile Capsulated It may occur singly or in chains and may show bipolar staining Specimen a) For bacteriological examination Nasopharyngeal secretions collected us ing pernasal swab or by aspiration. b) For haematological examination - blood Get blood either from the vein or finger and perform the total and differential white cell counts. Procedure for total white cell count Dilute the blood with white cell diluting fluid. Use either 1% HCl or 2% acetic acid solutions (these solutions breaks the RBCs and suspend and disperse the WBCs). Mix the solution very well and discard the first four drops before charging the counting chamber. Transfer a small representative solution ta king care not to overfill or create air bubbles into the counting chamber. 69 Count the white cells in the 4 'W ' sections using the 10X objective. Make the calculations; add the four counts and multiply by the dilution and volume correction factors. Report the white cell count per cubic millimeter of blood. Procedure for the differential white count Make a smear of the blood specimen on a glass slide. Allow to dir dry and stain it with wrights or Gram's stain Wipe the back of the slide with cotton and allow the film to dry. Put a drop of oil (immersion) and l ook under the microscope using 100X objection Count 100 WBCs and report the different type of WBCs in percentage. Collection and dispatch of specimen: Do the same as mentioned above for Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Staining method - Gram's stain C. Clostridium tetani Morphology and stai ning characteristics - Gram positive rod - Motile - Non capsulated long thin rods with round spore at one end (terminal) giving the typical 'drum stuck' appearance - Mostly found in chains and tends to be pleomorphic - Not often seen in smears Specimen - Wound exudate (pus) and infected tissue 70Collection and dispatch of specimen Collect a sample of the pus or infe cted tissue on a sterile cotton wool swab. Make a smear of the sample on a cle an slide for Gram st ain and examine for typical drumstick spore formers. To dispatch, put the specimen in a ster ile transport media, label and send it with a request form to reach a refer ence microbiology laboratory within 6 hours. D. Polio virus Characteristics Polio viruses are enteroviroses that contain single stranded RNA of positive polarity. The virion is naked The three serotypes of poliovirus ar e highly cytopathic to many primary cell cultures and permanent cell lials, c ausing cell death with changes in cell morphology. Specimens Feces, throat swab Collection and transport of specimens Stool : Mix about 1 ml of specimen with 9 ml of sterile phosph ate buffered saline, and allows to sediment for about 30 minut es (or centrifuge). Transfer the supernatant fluid to and sterile contai ner, label, and send in an insulated cold box to reach the virology labo ratory within a short period of time. Throat swab : Using a sterile swab, collect a specimen from the infected area by the help of a spoon to depress the tongue. - Put it in a sterile tube. - Label and send the swab using a viru s transport media (VTM) with its request form to a reference laboratory. 71E. Measles Virus Characteristics Measles virus is a single stranded RN virus belonging to the family paramyxovirus and genus Morbillivirus. Collection and transport of specimens Isolation of the virus from clinical specimens is difficu lt. The following specimens can be used to diagnose measles. 1. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctiva s pecimens (at the initial stage of the disease) 2. Stool and urine (at later stages) 3. Cerevrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum Specimen collection is made strictly following the st andard procedures of the World Health Organization (WHO). Specimens, if not sent to virology labor atory immediately after collection, should be kept in a refrigerator , but never freeze them The transport medium of choice for me asles virus is bovine serum since it contains proteins that are essential to stabilize viral infectivity. The diagnosis of measles is best done from clinical ground s. However, in laboratories where there ar e special facilities, the following techniques can be followed: Virus isolation using cell cultur es and observing cytopathic effects Electro microscopic examination of the virus directly form the clinical specimens Serological test - a four-fold increas e of specific antibody titers in a serum taken 7 - 14 days interval is the basis for diagnosis. Histological examination and hybridization of RNA. 72 F. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Morphology and stai ning characteristics - Straight or slightly curved rod shaped organism - Is strictly aerobic acid fast bacilli - Non spore forming, non capsulated, and non motile - Acid fastness depends on the waxy envel op mycolic fatty acid of cell wall - Once stained with primary stain (carbol fu chsin) they resist decolorization by acid alcohols. Laboratory diagnosis of P. tuberculosis This is mainly based on the identificat ion of the bacilli M. tuberculosis from different clinical specimens. Specimens Sputum, Pleural, peritoneal, and cerebrospinal fluid Collection and transport of specimens For reliable lab diagnosis, three sputum samples should be collected properly and submitted. Morning samples are more likely to contain tubercle bacilli. However, it may be difficult for an outpat ient to provide three early morning sputum samples. Accordingly, an outpatient usually provides a spot morning spot sputum samples as follows: Day one - sample one- \"on the s pot\" sample when the patient first presents himself/herself to the health station Day two - Sample two- an early \"morning\" sample Day two - Sample three-another \"on the spot\" sample in the sam day the morning sample is given. Laboratory diagnosis: Microscopic examination of S putum for acid fast bacilli (AFB) Ziehl-Neelsen Technique - Direct method: A small portion of t he purulent sputum is transferred to a slide to make a thin smear. 73- Concentration technique using a hour s hold bleach-\"barakina\": This technique kills some normal flora microorganisms, inactivates the virulence of mycobacterium, and also helps to digest the mucous substance that suspends the bacteria and this increases the chnce of positivity. Culture - Lowenstein-Jensen Medium is t he ordinary culture media for tubercle bacilli. - Raised, dry, cream colored colonies of tubercle bacilli are looked for Biochemical reaction - Niacin test is positive New techniques - Molecular probes (DNA probes) - it detects Mycobacterial RNA sequence - High performance liquid chromatography - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - Enzyme immunoassay 74Roles and Tasks of Medical Laboratory Technicians A.

Satellite Module for Community Health Workers/ Front-Line Health Workers on Expanded Propgram on Immunization 3.5.1. Introduction This satellite module is prepared by cons idering important issu es that can help the Community Health Workers (CHWs) in the prevention and control of EPI target diseases. EPI target diseases ar e common childhood communica ble disease that can disable and kill many children. Being a health agent of the community, your knowle dge on EPI and EPI target diseases will save many ch ildren's lives. Therefore, this short and precise satellite module is prepared to help teach, take care of sick child in the community, and health post in the control and prevention of EPI target diseases. 3.5.2. Learning Objectives \u0083 List EPI target diseases \u0083 Mention disabilities relat ed to EPI target diseases. \u0083 State the activities of the CHWs concerning the EPI 3.5.3 Short information about EPI Prevention is always better than cure. It is much more cost-e ffective to protect children from a disease by immunization th an to treat. In addition, serious illness affects the happiness and economic well being of the whole family of the community. 77Causes of EPI target diseases In our country, most of the babies born die before they are five years old. These deaths are often due to six deadly diseases: Measles Tuberculosis Tetanus (lock jaw) Whooping cough (pertussis) Diphtheria Poliomyelitis All of these diseases can be prevented by immunization. Routine immunization will prevent thousands of deaths. Children not only die from th ese six diseases, many more thousands will be left with disabilities, such as; lameness, deafness, permanent mental handicap etc. Activities and pr eventive measures \u0083 EPI target diseases are vaccine preventable. \u0083 Identify the disease. \u0083 Notify the nearby health institution. \u0083 Provide the prescribed medications. \u0083 If no improvement, help them visit the health professionals. \u0083 Children could be prevented from EPI target disease by attending the full immunization schedule. \u0083 Give health education to the community on the importance of the vaccination. \u0083 Remind the community about the m onthly immunization schedule/program. \u0083 Participate in the immunization programs. 783.6. Take-Home Messages for Caregivers 3.6.1 Short information about EPI \u0083 Many children suffer from vaccine preventable diseases. \u0083 Children are liable to most of these diseases due to lack of immunity. \u0083 Immunizing children will prevent them against these diseases. Causes and transmission of the six childhood vaccine preventable diseases \u0083 These diseases are caused by bacteria and viruses. \u0083 Transmissions take place through; dr oplets inhalation, freco-oral, and contamination of wounds (umbilical stump). Some signs and symptoms \u0083 High body temperature \u0083 Can not eat or drink normally \u0083 Difficult breathing \u0083 Fit \u0083 Rash (measles) \u0083 Irritable and doesn't like being touched. \u0083 Passes little or no urine Measures to be taken at home \u0083 Keep the child cool using cold sponging if there is fever. \u0083 Give frequent drinks or sips. \u0083 Prevent other children from catchi ng the illness by avoiding contact with cases /isolation/. \u0083 Visit the nearby clinic. 79 Prevention \u0083 Report to the CHW or to the nearest health institution if your child is sick \u0083 Have your children fully vaccinated. \u0083 Understand the advant ages of vaccination. \u0083 Do not miss your vaccination schedule when the child is sick. \u0083 Continue feeding children during sickness. \u0083 Women of child bearing age must comp lete Tetanus Toxoid vaccination, at least 2 vaccination before delivery. 80UNIT FOUR Glossary Attenuation The act of thinning or weak ening, as the alteration of virulence of a pathogenic microorganism by passage through another host s pecies, decreasing the virulence of the organism for the native host and increasing it for the new host Active immunization Stimulation with a specific antigen to induce an immune response.
