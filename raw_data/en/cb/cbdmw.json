This study aims to identify social-psychological fac-tors associated with MPV acceptance among Dutch women to add to the current understanding of vac- cine hesitancy worldwide, and to inform the development of communication and information campaigns about MPV.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online survey among 611 women (174 pregnant women, 205 women who had given birth in the past two years and 232 women of 20-35 years old). The primary and secondary outcomes were vaccination intention and attitude towards MPV, respectively.Pearson's correlation and regression analyses were used to examine social-psychological and socio- demographic determinants of the outcomes. Results: Vaccination intention was most explained by attitudes towards MPV, beliefs about safety, moral norm and the belief about the effectiveness of MPV (R 2= 0.79). Other factors associated were injunctive norm, anticipated regret of vaccinating, and decisional certainty. Attitudes towards MPV were further explained by descriptive norm, risk perceptions of side effects, and risk perceptions of the baby getting pertussis when not vaccinating, and fear of MPV and of the disease (R2= 0.76). Finally, pregnant women had a signicantly lower intention and less positive attitude towards MPV than non-pregnant women. Conclusions: Communication about MPV should address the most important determinants of MPV inten- tion and attitude, i.e. beliefs about safety and effectiveness and moral norms. Furthermore, such informa-tion may benet from taking into account affective feelings of pregnant women such as anticipated regret and fear towards MPV. Further research could explore this. The timing of communication about MPV can be important as determinants of MPV acceptance may vary depending on pregnancy status. /C2112020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is an infection of the respiratory tract caused by the bacterium Bordetella Pertussis . Pertussis is most severe among infants younger than six months, who are too young to be (fully) protected by vaccination. About half of young infants who get pertussis require hospital care andin rare cases, pertussis in babies may lead to convulsion, encephalopathy and even death [1]. Pertussis incidence in the Netherlands has increased since 1996, with a rate of up to 63 per100,000 during an outbreak in 2011-2012 [2]. From 2005 until 2014, 1,711 cases of pertussis were reported in Dutch infants. Of these cases 1,279 were ve months of age or younger with 1,020 being admitted to hospital and ve mortalities [3]. In December 2019 maternal immunization during pregnancy (i.e., 'maternal pertussis vaccination' or MPV) with the TdaP vaccine, containing Tetanus, Diphtheria an acellular Pertussis, was introduced in the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.047 0264-410X/ /C2112020 Elsevier Ltd.

The Netherlands has seen a decline in vaccination uptake since 2003, which stabilized at 90.2% of children completely enrolled in the program in 2018. There is however vaccine-specic hesitancy, with for example a lower uptake of HPV vaccination (45,4% in 2018). DTaP vaccination for children had an uptake of 92.5% in 2018, with a lower uptake in religious areas [4]. Besides the vacci- nation against H1N1 influenza (2009) during an outbreak, there is no experience with vaccination of pregnant women in the Nether- lands [5]. The uptake of H1N1 vaccination among pregnant women was 63%. It appeared that mothers' beliefs about the protection of the child and possible harmful effects of the vaccine for the unborn child, and the government's, GP's and midwife's advice best pre- dicted vaccination status [6].In the UK, where MPV was introduced in 2012 in response to increased pertussis incidence, uptake stabi- lized around 70% in 2017 [7]. In the America, cov- erage was 54.4% in 2017 [8]. In Australia, coverage was estimated at 85.2% in 2017 [9]. To effectively communicate and facilitate an informed choice regarding MPV among pregnant women, it is important to gain fur- ther understanding of reasons that might hamper or promote MPV acceptance. Even more so because choices and experiences sur- rounding maternal vaccination appear to impact later decision making processes on childhood vaccination [10]. A literature review by Wilson et al. (2015) [11] found that factors associated with vaccine uptake during pregnancy were beliefs about the vac- cine safety and effectiveness [12-15] , a desire to protect the baby [16], perceived risk (i.e., perceived susceptibility of the baby to get pertussis if not vaccinated, and perceived severity of the disease) [13,14] , the opinion of the partner [17], the recommendation by a healthcare professional to get the vaccine [12,13,15,16,18-21] , and the logistic convenience to get the vaccine [16]. In the Nether- lands, insights into the reasons for MPV acceptance are lacking. A study on the acceptance of a cocooning strategy among parents (where the parents get vaccinated to prevent infecting the child) found attitude, anticipated regret, and decisional certainty to be associated with vaccine acceptance [22]. It is unclear which factors are of influence at different moments in the decision making pro- cess, for example before or during pregnancy. Insights in these fac- tors could guide the development of communication about MPV to facilitate informed decision making and decrease decisional conflict. This study aims to identify social-psychological factors associ- ated with MPV acceptance among Dutch women who are pregnant and who are not pregnant or have recently given birth. These determinants are theoretically based on social cognitive theories to explain human behavior, in particular the Health Belief Model(HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [23,24] . Besides, factors such as beliefs about safety and effectiveness, decisional certainty, moral norms, and risk perception are suggested to be critical by the existing literature on vaccine acceptance in preg- nancy and by focus groups on vaccine acceptance in a cocooning strategy [12-16,19,22,25] . We included both pregnant and non- pregnant women to examine whether the ndings for pregnant women are different compared to non-pregnant women, as differ- ent factors may be of influence during different moments of the decision making process. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design This is a cross-sectional, survey based study.2.2. Participants A questionnaire was set out in April 2017 among two existing, online panels organized via Flycatcher, a private, ISO 26,362 certi- ed research company. People could join the panel online and by participating in online questionnaires, the panel members could collect points that can be exchanged for gift vouchers. Panel mem- bers were recruited via e-mail if they represented women who (a) were pregnant and therefore in the position to decide about mater-nal vaccination, (b) had given birth within the last two years and could imagine how they would have felt making the decision, or (c) did not have children, but were of child bearing age (20-35). Participants were excluded if response rate was insufcient or if they explicitly indicated that they did not have a wish to become pregnant. They were also excluded if they had already receivedMPV during their current pregnancy, because this could cause con- rmation bias, i.e. people are more likely to be positive about the vaccination if they have already received it. 2.3. The online questionnaire The survey was based on two general theoretical frameworks, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Health Belief Model (HBM). The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) argues that intention (i.e. the intention to perform a certain behavior) is the main predic- tor of behavior, which is in turn predicted by attitude and per- ceived social norms [24]. According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), a decision to engage in certain health behavior is deter- mined by risk perception. Risk perception results from the extent to which one perceives oneself susceptible to a health threat ('per- ceived susceptibility') and the extent to which one perceives the threat as severe ('perceived severity'). In addition, the likelihood to perform the behavior depends on the perceived benets of and barriers to that behavior [23,26] . Attitude is dened as ''the degree to which a person has a favor- able or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior in ques- tion\" [24]. Social influences are constituted by descriptive norms and injunctive norms. Descriptive norms refer to the expected behavior of other people, i.e. whether other pregnant women are expected to receive MPV. Risk perceptions (i.e. perceived severity and susceptibility) of side effects for the mother and the child, and the baby getting whooping cough when not vaccinating were included in this study. This also accounts for outcome expectancies, referring to a person's estimation of the benets and barriers of accepting MPV, beliefs about the vaccine's effectiveness and safety, as well as beliefs about alternative strategies for the prevention of whooping cough. Because some people may hold both positive and negative beliefsabout the vaccination, the concepts of outcome expectancies and beliefs about the safety of the vaccine are based on weighing both beliefs in favor and in disfavor of the vaccine. In the case of vaccine acceptance [27], research has shown that decisions are not only influenced by cognitive biases [28]. Since affective factors appear important too [29], we also included antic- ipated regret of vaccinating, fear of MPV or of the baby suffering from whooping cough, feelings of trust in the NIP, the government and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environ- ment, i.e. the RIVM [27]. Previous experiences with other vaccina- tions and with whooping cough, and the feeling that it is the moral responsibility of a pregnant woman to get MPV, i.e. moral norm, have been found to influence vaccine acceptance and were included in our study [30]. Because decisional certainty, i.e. the extent to which someone found it easy to make the decision or had doubts, has shown to influence vaccination behavior [22], we included a subscale of the complete decisional conflict scale by O'Connor (1995). ThisC. Anraad et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 6254-6266 6255subscale consists of three items: 'deciding on MPV is something I have to give a lot of thought' (1 = completely disagree to 7 = com- pletely agree), 'I nd deciding on MPV ...' (1 = very easy to 7 = very hard) and 'about the MPV decision I feel ...' (1 = very certain to 7 = very uncertain) [31]. Socio-demographics included were age, having children, coun- try of birth, working in the healthcare sector, highest completed education (low and intermediate level versus high level of educa- tion), and afliation with religion, homeopathy, natural care and/ or anthroposophy. Table 1 provides an overview of all constructs measured, the number of items used for each construct, an example of an item that was used, the scales used, and the internal validity of each construct. Items targeting attitude, descriptive and injunctive norm, outcome expectancies, beliefs about safety of the vaccine,anticipated regret, fear of MPV or of the baby suffering from whooping cough and trust were measured on 7-point Likert scales. Perceived effectiveness of strategies to prevent pertussis in infants was measured on a 10-point scale. Items with the same underlying theoretical construct were averaged into a composite score when internal consistency was sufcient (Cronbach's alpha a> 0.60 or Pearson correlation coefcient r > 0.50). We have included the complete questionnaire in the appendix. After giving informed consent, participants had access to the online questionnaire via a personalized link. Women who did not respond were sent a reminder one week after the start of the study. The online questionnaire consisted of 54 questions (see Table 1 for exemplary items). Non-pregnant women were asked to imagine how they would answer the questions in the case that they were pregnant. The questionnaire started with a brief introduction about whooping cough and the planned introduction of MPV during pregnancy, aimed to protect newborns against whooping cough. The exact text can be found in the appendix. 2.4. Data analysis Data was analyzed using IBM's SPSS version 25. First, we ana- lyzed means and standard deviations and Pearson's r between study variables. Factors that by univariate analysis appeared signif- icantly (p < 0.05) associated with intention were included in a step- wise linear regression analysis on that criterion (backward selection). Social-psychological variables were added in the rst step. Socio-demographic variables were added in the second step to correct for demographic variation. We report both the start and end-model of the regression analysis. Because attitude towards MPV appeared to be the strongest predictor of intention, we then repeated the same regression strategy with attitude towards MPV as criterion variable. Decisional certainty is somewhat complex to interpret in a lin- ear analysis because the scale only refers to the certainty of the decision and not to the extent to which someone is positive or neg- ative about MPV. It has a possible moderating effect on the rela- tionship between vaccination intention and its determinants, because the extent to which determinants are of influence on health behavior may depend on the extent to which these determi- nants are certain [32]. Therefore, moderation of the associations between determinants of intention and intention by decisional cer- tainty was explored by adding interaction terms to the linear regression models, with the interaction terms made with the cen- tered values for decisional certainty and the variable associated with intention. If the R change was positive and the interaction term and F change were signicant (p < 0.05), moderation was fur- ther explored in a multivariate model with decisional certainty and the concerning dependent variables. The most persistent modera- tors were then looked at in more detail using simple slopes analy- ses [33]. We computed slopes for the regression of thoseattitudinal variables on intention at three levels of the moderator variable decisional certainty: one standard deviation above or below the mean (low and high) and the mean level (moderate). The simple slope analyses were done using PROCESS version 3.1 by Andrew Hayes (model 1), using centered variables and 5000 bootstrap samples. Because we found that pregnancy status was signicantly asso- ciated with the criterion in our regression models (i.e. vaccination intention), differences in mean scores on all variables were tested between pregnant and non-pregnant women by independent sam- ple t-tests, using 95% condence intervals. 3. Results 3.1. Sample Fig. 1 shows the inclusion of participants. In total 736 women started with the survey and 664 women completed it. Women were excluded when response quality was insufcient (n = 19), when they had already received MPV during their current preg- nancy (n = 28), or when they explicitly indicated that they did not want to become pregnant (n = 6). In total 611 women were included in the analyses, including pregnant women (n = 174, of which 68 did not yet have children), women who had given birth to a child within the two years preceding the questionnaire (n = 205), women aged 20-35 who were not pregnant and did not have children yet (n = 232). Participants were on average 30 years old. Women who were born in the Netherlands (96%), were highly educated (76%) and who worked in the healthcare sec- tor (38%) were overrepresented. Table 2 shows the mean scores on all social-psychosocial measures. Intention towards MPV was scored neutral (M = 4.11; SD = 1.57) while attitude was more pos- itive about vaccination in general than about MPV in particular. One should be cautious with interpreting differential mean scores on beliefs about vaccines people are already familiar with for years versus beliefs about a new vaccine to be implemented by the NIP. 3.2. Correlations Table 3 shows the Pearson's r between social-psychological variables and MPV intention. Cohen (1988) argues that correlations of r = 0.10 to23 are indicative for a small effect size, r = 0.24 to.36 for a moderate effect size, and r /C210.37 for a large effect size [34]. Table 3 shows that large associations with intention were found for attitude, beliefs about safety, moral norms and beliefs about the effectiveness of MPV. Large effects were also found for outcome expectancies, injunctive norms, trust, attitude about vaccines in general, and fear of the vaccine. Weaker correlations, but still indi-cating large effects were found for decisional certainty, risk percep- tions of side effects, descriptive norms, and fear of the disease. Moderate effect sizes were found for anticipated regret, and small effect sizes for beliefs about the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle as a strategy to protect against whooping cough. 3.3. Regression analyses of intended MPV uptake Table 4 shows that the linear regression model explained 79% of the intention to accept MPV, both with and without a stepwise backwards selection of determinants. The Akaike Information Cri- terion (AIC) is lower for the model with backwards selection than for the model with all variables, indicating that the backwards model presents a better t. In the model with backwards selection, attitude towards MPV appeared the strongest determinant of intention ( b= 0.45), followed by moral norms ( b= 0.20). Other determinants in the model were beliefs about safety, decisional6256 C. Anraad et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 6254-6266Table 1 Psychosocial variables and their internal reliability.

Perceived susceptibility had a score from 1 to 7, and perceived severity had a s core from 0 to 6 because if the proposed risk (in this case of the baby getting pertussis) is perceived to be not severe at all, the susceptibility to it is irrelevant. These were mu ltiplied, and this resulted in a scale varying from 0 to 42 in which 0 is a low risk perception and 42 is high risk perception. Fig. 1.

This table shows that attitude towards MPV had a lower effect on intention under low decisional certainty ( B= 0.94) than under moderate decisional and under high decisional certainty ( B= 1.05). This means that the effect of attitude towards MPV on vaccination intention is larger when participants are more certain about their decision. For attitude towards MPV there is no signicant difference in unstandardized beta for the different levels of certainty, but for outcome expectancies and moral norm, there is. 3.5. Average differences between pregnant women and non-pregnant women. Looking at pregnancy status, the intention to vaccinate was sig- nicantly lower among pregnant women than among non- pregnant women (mean difference = 0.87). Table 6 shows that pregnant women scored lower on most determinants of intention. Their risk perceptions of side-effects of the vaccine for mother and child were signicantly higher (mean differences = -2.30 and /C01.87 respectively). 4. Discussion 4.1. Main ndings This study explored the determinants of intention to accept MPV during pregnancy among a sample of pregnant and non- pregnant women. Univariate analyses showed that attitude towards MPV had the strongest correlation with intention, fol- lowed by moral norms with regard to MPV, outcome expectancies, beliefs about safety and the effectiveness of MPV, injunctive norms, and trust in the NIP and the RIVM. The multivariate analyses showed that the regression models were adequate in explaining intention (79% of the variance) and attitude (76%) towards MPV. Intention towards MPV was explained by attitude about MPV, moral norm, beliefs about safety, decisional certainty, injunctive norm, anticipated regret of vaccinating, and beliefs about the effectiveness of MPV. Attitude towards MPV was explained by beliefs about safety and the effectiveness of MPV, moral norm, attitude about vaccines in general, risk percep- tion of the child getting pertussis when not vaccinating, risk per- ception of the side effects of MPV for the child, descriptive norm, fear of the vaccination and the disease and being pregnant. Preg- nant women had a signicantly lower intentions than non- pregnant women. These ndings align with earlier ndings from other countries, suggesting that social-psychological factors associated with vac- cine acceptance include beliefs about safety and effectiveness, as well as risk perception of the disease [12-15] . The association between injunctive norms and vaccination intention corresponds to earlier ndings that the opinion of the partner of the respondent and recommendation by a healthcare professional influence accep- tance of vaccines during pregnancy [12,13,15-21] . Moral norms towards MPV have been found to be of influence in a qualitative study on pertussis vaccine acceptance in a cocooning strategy [35]. Aside from attitude towards MPV and beliefs about the effec- tiveness of MPV, moral norm was the most robust determinant of vaccination intention, both in the univariate analyses and the mul- tivariate regression analyses. According to norm-activation theory [36], moral norms will influence behavior when individuals are aware of the consequences of their actions for others and when they accept personal responsibility for those actions [37]. In the case of MPV, the choice to accept or refuse MPV may have conse-Table 3 (continued birth (Reference: Anraad et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 6254-6266 6261Table 4 Regression analyses of MPV intention (model 1) and attitude about MPV (model 2).

Contrarily, non-pregnant women appeared to feel more of a moral obligation to vaccinate than pregnant women. This may be due to a lower risk perception of side-effects of the vaccine in non-pregnant women than in pregnant women. We found moderating effects of decisional certainty for almost all variables in the univariate analyses, with stronger effects on intention under high certainty than under low certainty, although these effects did not persist in multivariate regression models. However, low decisional certainty can be a sign of attitudinal ambivalence (holding both positive and negative beliefs on a sub-ject simultaneously) and this has been found to moderate the attitude-behavior relationship in research studying other health behaviors [38]. Measurements of intention, attitude and decisional certainty may have some level of interdependence, and indepen- dent measurements are needed to rmly state that effects of atti- tude are lower under a low decisional certainty than under high decisional certainty. Therefore, it would have been ideal to include behavior instead of intention in the moderation analysis. Attitudi- nal ambivalence can lead to negative affect surrounding decision making [39] and individuals with high attitudinal ambivalence towards specic behavior are more pliable and less stable over time in performing these behaviors [40]. Intention and associated variables were lower among pregnant women than among non-pregnant women. The regression analyses and mean differences show a larger difference in intention than attitude towards MPV between pregnant and non-pregnant women. A possible explanation for these differences is the so- called hot-cold empathy gap. 'Cold' being the group of non- pregnant women, who do not have to make the decision yet, 'hot' being the group of pregnant women who are closer in time to the decision on MPV. Cold-to-hot empathy gaps in medical deci- sion making were rst described by Loewenstein (2005) as: '' .... people mis-predict their own behavior and preferences across affective states. When people are in an affectively 'cold' state, they fail to fully appreciate how 'hot' states will influence their own preferences and behavior\" [41]. In this context, vaccination inten- tion and its determinants are lower among pregnant women, for whom the choice is more urgent compared to non-pregnant women.4.2. Limitations This study has limitations. First, the size of the group pregnant women (n = 174) within the sample is small to make robust state- ments about the extent to which different factors are key in the decision making process, but this study does provide an explora- tory view on the differences in factors related to the intention to accept MPV between pregnant and non-pregnant women. A second limitation is the generalizability of the sample from the panel, of which most women were highly educated and born in the Nether- lands, and a relatively high percentage working in healthcare. We left sociodemographic factors in the regression models to correctthese factors. Third, this is a cross-sectional study, whereas a lon- gitudinal study would be ideal to be able to measure the influence of the factors over time and to infer causality and also to include MPV uptake instead of vaccination intention. Finally, it would be ideal to measure vaccination uptake as well as vaccination inten- tion but this was not possible at the time of the study because MPV was not yet implemented in the NIP. 4.3. Implications for future research First, because in our study, cognitive social-psychological vari- ables associated with vaccination intention score lower amongpregnant women than among non-pregnant women, affect- related factors could be at play. Further research could aim to understand in what way affect-related determinants influence maternal vaccination acceptance during pregnancy. Second, future studies identifying determinants of vaccine uptake could also include possible moderation on the attitude-intention relationship by decisional certainty, because we found that this may be occur- ring. Third, in this study we measured the moral norm of accepting the vaccine, whereas some women may nd it their moral respon- sibility to refuse the vaccine. Because we found striking differences between non-pregnant women and pregnant women in socio-psychological determinants, longitudinal studies are needed to explain the decision making process of pregnant women from preconception to postnatal. Addi- tionally, different communication strategies can be tested based on the determinants found, including strategies that have more atten- tion to affect and emotions, rather than fact-based information. 4.4. Implications for practice First, our study found that attitude towards MPV is key for vac- cination intention and that both are signicantly associated with moral norms, beliefs about the effectiveness and safety of MPV, outcome expectancies, injunctive norm, trust in the NIP, decisional certainty and risk perceptions. To promote informed choice and to meet the information need of pregnant women, these key factors should be addressed in future communication about MPV. It is important to note that the two components of risk perception,Table 4 (continued ) Model 1a.

Anraad et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 6254-6266i.e. perceived severity of and perceived susceptibility to pertussis, should both be addressed individually in risk communication Second, we recommend clinicians to encourage and facilitate pregnant women to actively make an informed decision on MPV. Being certain about their choice will provide pregnant women with a more robust attitude about vaccination, and will make them less vulnerable to misinformation. Because vaccination for pregnant women is a subject that involves emotions such as anticipated regret, fear for the vaccine and fear of the disease, taking their emotions and concerns seriously is important to facilitate an informed decision making process. Our study shows that it is difcult to determine an MPV deci- sion of women who are uncertain about MPV. When a pregnant women is in doubt about MPV, clinicians can provide help by actively checking whether potential misperceptions are presentabout safety of the vaccine, side-effects of the vaccine, and risk per- ceptions of the baby getting pertussis. Furthermore, because pregnant women were found to have a lower attitude towards MPV and a lower vaccination intention than non-pregnant women, information provision may benet from careful timing. Communication could address more cognitive factors when the decision is further in time (''cold\", before preg- nancy; e.g. addressing beliefs about safety and effectiveness and risk perception, whereas it could be more relevant to pay attention to possible concerns and related emotions that may arise when closer to the moment of decision (''hot\", during pregnancy; e.g. addressing physical discomfort or feeling more protective about the unborn child on information given to pregnant women). This strategy could promote a robust attitude towards MPV before get- ting pregnant or early in pregnancy and ultimately, an informed decision.
