We are using business software (Healthie) to organize appointments, store and protect patient data, track communication confidentially and is generally the office space for our courses.

Guided Courses Following a [ Health Evaluation](https://www.charleycropley.com/the-self-healing-physician) from our skilled naturopathic doctor, [Guided Courses](https://www.charleycropley.com/guided-courses) are dynamic engagements with patient-students. The nature of these Courses with Nourish is high touch, experiential, barrier breaking and unique to each patient-student. The themes of healing for human beings are the same, the focus of treatment is individual--which means how we get there or said better, where we put our attention expands the healing in that particular area of our health. Education & Training for Physicians and Healthcare Professionals This training covers the fundamentals of an initial workup using behavioral diagnostics and therapeutics, report of findings, prognosis, and prescription of behavioral therapeutics. We are still treating from a disease model if we do not consider the human condition. The [Physician Heal Thyself](https://www.charleycropley.com/the-self-healing-physician) guided course offers a true health model rather than a disease model. Thank you, Charley! You helped me instill in my mind/heart/soul that I can heal myself. I learned (or remembered) how to connect with the love and kindness I feel for myself and use this to soothe my negative self-talk. -Danielle H. "}
