Keywords: Bo tulinum toxin; Knee osteoarthritis Knee Osteoarthritis Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is an intractable and devastating consequence of degeneration that results in tremendous impact on daily activities. Painful disabling KOA occurs in more than 10% of people who are over 55 years old. Those who are severely disabled accoun t for up to 25% of aging people and KOA is a major cause of total knee replacement [1-3]. Current osteoarthritis therapies largely rely on rest, weight loss, bracing and assistive devices, physical modalities, therapeutic exercises, and pharmacological interventions [4] which are unsatisfactory for the majority of severe disabled patients, who are left with ambulation deficit despite vigorous tr eatment intervention. Although numerous patients can be treated with surgery, some of them are not good candidates due to multiple co-morbidities. For these reasons, intra-articular (IA) treatments that reduce chronic joint pain and improve function is the long-term effective and safe alternative options. In a number of recent studies, pain intensity and functional performance resulted from osteoarthritis has been improved after IA injection of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT -A). The Botulinum neurotoxin has been comprehensively studied for its mu scle-paralyzing effect by proteolysis of membrane-associated pr oteins inhibiting of the exocytotic release of acetylcholine, thereby blocking neurotransmission from motor nerve terminals. However, as the growing body of research has demonstrated, IA BoNT-A injection applied to the painful joints can successfully improve symptoms and function by anti-nociceptive effect [5-9]. The mechanism of pain mo dulation after IA BoNT-A injection by means of two very different strategies by direct inhibition of nociceptive neuropeptides release suc h calcitonin gene related peptide (cGRP), glutamate and the expression of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 at the primary sensory fibers, leading to a reduction of peripheral sen sitization; by indirect inhibition of central sensitization associated with neuropathic pain through the reduction of the se and blocked of substance P and cGRP secretion within central nerve system [10-12]. The role of botulinum toxin type A in the clinical management is no w considered as part of an established option for chronic advanced arthritis or osteoarthritis if a patient has been refractory to conservative treatments, failed to corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid IA injection and unable to undergo joint surgical intervention. As compared with conventional therapy, IA BoNT-A injection has significant therapeutic effect on pain processing and functional re covery [13]. The pilot study provides evidence that BoNT-A com pared to IA corticosteroid achieves a significant and persistent pain modulating effect [6]. The following study further confirmed thatthe IA BoNT-A compared to education only yielded favorable ou tcomes that were of considerable longevity, at least 6-month period [14]. Another study demonstrates that IA BoNT-A in patients with chronic painful total knee arthroplasty, providing short-term therapeutic effect, indicating IA BoNT-A not only play a role on alle viating KOA symptoms before surgery but also post-operation pain control. Although there is a lack of head-to-head randomized trials to compared IA BoNT-A and IA hyaluronate in patients with knee osteoarthritis, but the efficacy was assessed in patients with unilateral ank le osteoarthritis. The study provides encouraging results related to pain relief and functional recovery by both interventions without statistically significant intergroup difference, these effects initiating at 2 we eks and last for half year [9]. The dose-dependent effect of BoNT-A has not yet been proved due to only single research observed the difference [6]. Further studies sh ould focus on the response rate of different doses. There are two su btypes of botulinum neurotoxin are available for clinical practice which are serotype A and serotype B. Though BoNT-B is as clinically effective as BoNT-A, BoNT-A is more widely used in management of pain an d spasticity. That is possible due to more side effects and shorter mo re efficacy after BoNT-B injection [15]. The related literature review on t his issue revealed no severe adverse events among all studies [13]. Recent advances in the use of botulinum toxin type A have highlighted the benefit of anti-nociceptive effect in osteoarthritis. Such pain modulation consolidates induced peripheral inhibition and central desensitization effects when it is applied by intra-articular inj ection. This innovative and safe method could be applied as a com plementary therapy performed in conjunction with traditional KOA treatment. References 1.
