Physically, mentally, emotionally - the build up of stress in our bodies can wreck havoc in more ways than one. In fact, stress has such a powerful impact that it can often be the cause of problems such as sleep deprivation, weight gain, deteriorating heart health and poor cognitive function. There's no denying that living in our modern world is stressful. Whether you're balancing work, personal relationships, your social life or worrying about the future - there are stress triggers that accompany our every move. Yet, even though it may seem impossible to completely eradicate stress from our lives - it's crucial to reduce its impact in order to shelter and protect our overall well being. If you've read my previous posts, you know that I'm actively engaged in mental health practices and therapy to improve my quality of life. Therefore, I'm an advocate for any proven method that can help minimize and reduce the presence of negative psychological feelings. More importantly, I am interested in continually educating myself on the current wellbeing practices that are being used by doctors in modern medicine. Today, I want to focus on a concept that I've been hearing about for a while and one that is directly tied to stress and its effects on our health - NET Mind Body. While researching stress-reduction methods, I came across the practice of NET and how it works to eliminate prolonged strain on our bodies caused by emotional triggers. It's truly an interesting approach that has proven to be effective for many individuals. So, I wanted to share the research I have found to see if the NET mind body practice is a technique worth exploring. Let's talk about what NET Mind Body is, the practice of it in modern day medicine and whether it's a good fit for your mental health journey. What Is Net Mind Body? For us to fully understand the concept of Net Mind Body and how it affects your mental health and psychological wellbeing, I want to share information provided by [MyHolisticDoc. ](https://myholisticdocs.com/our-services/emotional/neuro-emotional-technique-mind-body-medicine/) NET stands for \"Neuro Emotional Technique\" and is a practice of mind body medicine. In essence, they explain that as humans we experience emotional responses to situations that occur in our lives. And, these emotional responses can often cause our bodies to have stress and prolonged negative effects on our overall health. According to [MyHolisticDoc](https://myholisticdocs.com/our-services/emotional/neuro-emotional-technique-mind-body-medicine/): \"Neuro Emotional Technique or NET, uses muscle testing, body reflex points, and semantic reactions (physiological reactions to memories or words) to assist and guide you to recall the specific negative emotion and when it first occurred. This engages a specific neuro-emotional pattern, a reactive button. While you mentally hold the emotional memory, a gentle physical correction associated with it is made to deactivate the button, releasing the reactive response.\" Therefore, the practice of NET connects our brains to our physical bodies - in order for us to pinpoint the memory that is exerting stress on our bodies and causing us to feel pain. How Do Doctors Practice NET Mind Body? Since, we now know what Neuro Emotional Technique is - let's talk about how doctors utilize this method in their own practice. For more context, I turned to [Integrated Wellness](https://integratedwellness.com.au/techniques/neuroemotional-technique-net/) to read about the history of NET and it's overall scientific background - \"NET acknowledges the relationship between the body's emotional health, environmental toxicity, nutritional balance and structural integrity. It's a methodology used to normalize unresolved physical and or behavioral patterns in the body that has enabled patients to enjoy better health and emotional and physical wellbeing.\" Here is a graphic from their article that shows the connection between NET (emotional) and toxins (homeopathic), biochemistry (nutrition) and structural (physical correction). Integrated Wellness goes on to explain the two ways that NET is most effectively used by doctors today: Body focused approach: The aim is to clear NECS, Neuro Emotional Complexes. These are effectively lingering emotions that are not allowing the body to properly heal. They can cause consistent pain and overall a poor state of wellness. NEAT: Neuro emotional anti-sabotage technique. \"This process allows an individual to identify a limiting subconscious belief, understand its source and resolve it.\" The concluding research is that the NET approach has been known to \"dramatically improve health and allow people to experience significant personal change.\" And in truth, it makes complete sense. So often we are unaware of the role that stress and emotions play in our daily lives. More than just a feeling of being overwhelmed, stress at its core is a form of toxin. Causing injury, upset and destruction - stress is more harmful than we truly understand. So, by engaging in a practice that its core is meant to eliminate this toxin, the logical result would be a better emotional and physical wellbeing for the patient. Is Net Mind Body Right For You? From the research provided, I'm sure you've already decided whether the NET mind body technique is right for you. [Integrated Wellness ](https://integratedwellness.com.au/techniques/neuroemotional-technique-net/)notes that, \"Research at Harvard, Oxford and Macquarie Universities has shown NET to be effective in treating such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), hypothyroidism and infertility, to name a few.\" You obviously don't need to have one of these conditions in order to receive NET therapy, but it's promising to know that this practice works for situations that often seem to lack a definitive cure or solution. If you're suffering from prolonged, continual stress, emotional trauma and negative psychological thought processes - I would conclude that NET may be a valuable practice in eradicating such problems. Of course, in any situation, you should talk to your doctor or therapist about the options of NET and whether it's right for your long term treatment plan. Yet, I hope you found this information helpful and to have shed some light on a medical practice that is helping to reduce the amount of stress we place on our bodies. And, in turn, balance the emotions we possess in order to achieve better, stronger mental well being. Have you ever done NET mind body therapy?
