QUERI provides funding for four ESP Centers, and each Center has an active University affiliation. Center Directors are recognized leaders in the field of evidence synthesis with close ties to the AHRQ Evidence -based Practice Centers. The ESP is governed by a Steering Committee comprised of participants from VHA Policy, Program, and Operations Offices, VISN leadership, field-based investigators, and others as designated appropriate by QUERI/HSR&D. The ESP Centers generate evidence syntheses on important clinical practice topics. These reports help: \u00b7Develop clinical policies informed by evidence; \u00b7Implement effective services to improve patient outcomes and to support VA clinical practiceguidelines and performance measures; and \u00b7Set the direction for future research to address gaps in clinical knowledge. The ESP disseminates these reports throughout VA and in the published literature; some evidence syntheses have informed the clinical guidelines of large professional organizations. The ESP Coordinating Center (ESP CC), located in Portland, Oregon, was created in 2009 to expand the capacity of QUERI/HSR&D and is charged with oversight of national ESP program operations, program development and evaluation, and dissemination efforts. The ESP CC establishes standard operating procedures for the production of evidence synthesis reports; facilitates a national topic nomination, prioritization, and selection process; manages the research portfolio of each Center; facilitates editorial review processes; ensures methodological consistency and quality of products; produces \"rapid response evidence briefs\" at the request of VHA senior leadership; collaborates with HSR&D Center for Information Dissemination and Education Resources (CIDER) to develop a national dissemination strategy for all ESP products; and interfaces with stakeholders to effectively engage the program.

Epidemiologic data suggest that rates of MS vary with demographic and environmental factors. The disease presentation is very heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations . Progression of MS may vary with modifiable risk factors . This systematic review focuse d on modifiable risk factors and exposures that are associated with MS progression , and interventions that are directed at modifiable risk factors to delay progression . The Key Questions (KQs) were: KQ1: What modifiable epidemiologic factors are related to multiple sclerosis progression following diagnosis? KQ2: What environmental exposures prior to or during military service are related to multiple sclerosis progression following onset symptoms? KQ3: Among identified risk factors for progression, what treatment/risk factor modification therapies have been shown to delay or hasten the progression of multiple sclerosis once it has initiated? The review will be used by th e VA Multiple Sclerosis Centers of Excellence to initiate new research studies, refine clinical guidelines, and plan for targeted disease- modifying and disease - prevention strategies. METHODS Data Sources and Searches We search ed the databases PubMed, E MBASE , AMED, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Green FILE , Military Collection , and DTIC to March 2015; reference- mine d reviews and included studies; and consult ed with experts to identify pertinent studies. Literature searches were not restricted to a narrow set of known risk factors but were exploratory in nature. Study Selection The review focused on patient -modifiable risk factors, such as food intake or health behaviors of patients with MS. Studies mee ting the following criteria were eligible for inclusion in the review: Population : Adults with MS (KQ1, KQ 3), military personnel/ Veteran s with MS (KQ2) Interventions/exposure : Potential MS progression risk factors (KQ1, KQ 2; eg, smoking, nutrition) and interventi ons targeting risk factors (KQ3; eg, smoking cessation programs, dietary interventions ) Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 2 Comparators (study design) : Observational and experimental studies analyzing factors associated with MS progression ( the comparator (KQ3 ) Outcomes : Progression of MS, primary outcome measure Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS ) Timing : not restricted Setting : No restriction but planned subgroup analyses for Veteran population . Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment For KQ1 we extract ed sample characteristics, geographical region, and number of participants ; study design, analysis, and assessment timing ( eg, prospective) ; the predicted outcome, assessed potential risk factors, and controlled vari ables ; EDSS results and other MS progression results . For studies relevant to KQ 2, we extract ed study details and MS progression results associated with prior military service exposure and exposure during military service. For intervention studies ( KQ3) we extract ed methodological characteristics; number and characteristics of participants; intervention and comparator content and duration ; EDSS results and other MS progression outcomes together with the follow -up point, and adverse events . For KQ1 and KQ2 we distinguished concurrent, retrospective, and prospective studies. Prospective studies were assessed with QUIPS, a critical appraisal tool for prognostic studies . The RCTs informing KQ3 were assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data Synthesis and Analysis All included studies were presented in evidence tables , grouped by key question, to allow a comprehensive overview. We differentiated results based on standardized and common measure s of disease status, the EDSS, and other results. Where possible, variables were pooled using a restricted maximum- likelihood estimator and the Hartung -Knapp -Sidik -Jonkman standard error method for random -effects models to identify reliable and valid effects across studies. Continuous outcomes were report ed as standardized mean differences ( SMD) , dichotomous outcomes as relative risks (RR) , time to event data as hazard ratios (HR) , and c orrelations were transformed to z statistics (using the Fisher transformation) to pool across studies. Point estimates were reported with the 95 percent confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic, publication bias with the Egger and Begg test, and we used the trim -and-fill method in the presence of publication bias. KQ1 studies were grouped by evaluated risk factor s. A summary of findings table documented the number of available studies for all risk factors that had been addressed in more than one study, the strength of association with MS progression , and our confidence in the finding. For studies in military personnel and Veterans relevant to KQ2, we differentiated assessed variables and statistically significant effects across studies documented in a summary of findings table . Intervention studies ( KQ3) were stratified by intervention category and summarized across studies in a summary of findings table . The quality of evidence assessment followed the standard GRADE approach for RCTs and an adaptation for prognostic factor research for KQ1 and KQ2. The quality of evidence indicates the confidence in the results that are dr awn from the literature, and we distinguished high, moderate, low, and very low quality of evidence. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 3 RESULTS Results of Literature Search The search identified 8,594 citations . In total , 94 studies met inclusion criteria. Summary of Results for Key Questions Fifty -nine studies contributed to KQ1, 4 studies contributed to KQ2 (all also relevant to KQ1), and 36 RCTs addressed KQ3. KQ1: Modifiable R isk Factors Studies assessed a number of risk factors and used a variety of progression measures, including EDSS scores , time to conversion from remitting relapsing to secondary progressive MS, and odds of reaching EDSS 6 (requiring a cane for walking) . Thirteen studies were prospecti ve studies, assessing risk factors and subsequent outcome measures at 2 different time points. Vitamin D has been addressed in a large number of studies. Across studies, t here was a negative correlation of - 0.22 (CI -0.32, -0.12; 11 studies; I2 66%) indica ting that lower Vitamin D level s are associated with higher EDSS scores. The result i s primarily based on concurrent predictor studies (measuring Vitamin D level and disability status at the same time ). Across studies, we identified an increased risk of faster progression in smokers than nonsmokers (HR 1. 55; CI 1.1 0, 2.1 9; I2 72%; 7 studies, 8 datasets ). The result is primarily based on retrospective studies. The use of epidural analgesics during childbirth delivery ha s been assessed in 3 studies and none reported a statistically significant association with EDSS or DSS scores. Results for sun exposure, sunscreen use, month of birth, diet, fish consumption, alcohol consumption, exercise, trauma, oral contraception, geog raphic region , and education have been addressed in more than one study, but the differences in risk factor operationalizations and outcome measures did not allow concrete evidence statements to be made. All other investigated factors have been addressed i n only one of the included studies and have not been replicated. These include effects of cesarean delivery ; breast feeding ; having been breast fed ; obstetrical and spinal anesthesia; childhood maltreatment ; working outdoor s; individual health -promoting li festyle domains ; meditation practice ; insurance coverage ; medical care satisfaction variables ; exposure to different types of animals ; coal heating ; wood heating ; humid living space ; no sewage system ; no piped water ; type of environment ( eg, farm) ; specific diet factors such as coffee consumption, liver consumption, vitamin supplementation, fortified foods, vegetarian diet ; cod liver oil intake ; occupational status ; deployment to a war theater ; being a Veteran ; and earthquake experience. KQ2: Exposures Prior to or During Military S ervice We identified 4 studies that reported on exposures prior to and during military services associated with MS progression ( KQ2) in active military personnel or Veterans . Assessed risk factors were geographic location at entry to the military, occupational status at entry to the military, average fall/winter sun exposures before MS onset, cod liver oil intake at ages 6 -15, Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 4 fish consumption at ages 6 -15, deployment, being a Veteran , and dietary treatment. None of the studies assessed the same risk factors and outcome measures varied across studies. KQ3: Risk Factor M odification Therapies Despite the inclusive and extensive systematic search, all identified risk factor modification interventions targeted either physical exercise, dietary interventions, or vitamin D supplementation. Across the 3 6 predominantly small RCTs, w e did not detect interventions with statistically significant treatment effects compared to passive control groups on MS progression. The pooled effect of exercise interventions on EDSS scores was not different from untreated control groups ( SMD 0.02; CI -0.40, 0.44; I 2 0%; 7 RCTs). However, u sing baseline -adjusted data for a sensitivity analysis , the result favored the exercise intervention (SMD - 0.19; CI -0.34, -0.03). The 12 identified dietary intervention evaluation s primarily assessed the effects of fatty acid supplement s. We did not identify a statistically significant effect on the relative risk of progression (RR 0.86; CI 0. 67, 1 .05; I2 placebo Vitamin D supplementation showed a trend for improved EDSS scores but the pooled standardized mean difference was not statistically significant from placebo groups (SMD -0.15; CI -0.33, 0.02; I 2 0; 5 RCTs). However, the weighted mean difference favored vitamin D supplementation and showed that suppleme nts were associated with a 0.22 -point difference in EDSS scores ( WMD -0.22; CI - 0.39, -0.05). DISCUSSION Key Findings and Strength of Evidence Our systematic review and meta- analysis focused on modifiable risk factors. We systematically searched for , documented, and synthesized evidence available in the research literature on MS progression. A large number of relevant studi es is available to contribute to the evidence base but the research area is very complex. We did not identify factors that were shown to be significant risk factors in epidemiological studies and published evidence that shows their amenability to intervention and their effects on MS progression. KQ1 There was great variation in assessment and prediction details across studies relevant to KQ1 and only 1 3 prospective studies were identified, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the litera ture. There is moderate- quality evidence of a correlation between vitamin D levels and EDSS scores. Our confidence in the result was downgraded to moderate quality of evidence due to indirectness . The correlation does not allow causal inferences and prospective studies are needed linking vitamin D intake to MS progressio n. There is moderate- quality evidence (downgraded due to unexplained heterogeneity) suggesting an association between the time to progression and smoking. There is low -quality evidence (due to study design limitation and lack of point estimates) suggesting that epidural analgesia during childbirth is not associated with Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 5 EDSS scores. A large number of potential risk factors have been reported in the literature; however, the existing evidence i s insufficient for providing concrete evidence statements for individual outcomes. KQ2 The quality of the evidence for research on environmental exposures during military service was determined to be insufficient for evidence statements because all factors were reported in only one included study without replication in another participant sample. KQ3 Despite substantially more available literature on risk factor modification therapies, we confirmed earlier reviews showing that currently no statistically si gnificant evidence exists t o supports specific interventions for MS progression and more research is needed . The quality of the evidence for the result of no difference between exercise interventions and untreated control groups on EDSS scores was downgra ded due to severe study limitations and conflicting results in a sensitivity analysis ( imprecision ). Our confidence in the evidence summary is limited because studies were not designed to assess EDSS changes, study sample sizes were very small, there were baseline imbalances, and the interventions may have been too short to achieve and detect changes with standard diagnostic criteria. Nonetheless , any treatment effect is likely to be very small; adjusting for baseline imbalances, the estimate was 0.20 points on the EDSS scale. The quality of evidence for the dietary intervention results showing the absence of an effect on MS progression measured as deterioration or EDSS scores were both downgraded to moderate due to study limitations . The early st udies lack reporting detail while the more recently published studies were small and did not report statistical power calculations to determine whether studies could detect an effect of the intervention on MS progression. The quality of evidence for a non- significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on EDSS scores was downgraded due to study limitations and imprecision . The included studies were small and the lack of reported power calculations makes it unclear whether the studies were sufficiently power ed to be able to detect small treatment effects. The statistical significance was dependent on the effect measure, showing that the effect estimate is not very robust. Nonetheless, any potential treatment effects are likely to be small with an estimated di fference of 0.22 points in EDSS scores between intervention and control groups. Applicability Very few studies report ed specifically on VA samples . However, t here is no indication that risk factor results and treatment effects are not applicable to the VA population. Research Gaps/Future Research Our systematic review showed that more prospective research studies are needed to allow predictions and meaningful interpretation of risk factor analyses . Furthermore, future studies should report more details and statistical analyses in order to facilitate evidence synthesis in Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 6 meta -analyses. Specific areas that need more research are the consumption of alcohol and sun exposure and their potential effect s in slowing progression. The existing intervention studie s testing the effect on MS progression should determine the statistical power needed to detect a difference between treatment groups , in particular for vitamin D supplementation trials . Effects of smoking cessation should be investigated given the associat ion between smoking and MS progression. Based on sensitivity analyses we found that more studies evaluating the effects of long-term exercise interventions are warranted . Finally, although our review addressed a broad research field, there are other, potential risk factors of interest that are outside the scope of this review, including the effect of treatable comorbidities of MS. Conclusions A large number of studies is available to contribute to the growing research literature on modifiable risk factors and MS progression , but the research field is very complex. Risk factor studies used diverse operationalizations of risk factors and different outcome measures , and more prospective studies are needed . Most consistent results were shown for the associati on between EDSS scores and Vitamin D levels. Smoking was associated with a faster progression of MS in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Risk factors in Veterans and active military personnel were one of the key questions for this review but very few studies are available to inform on this participant subgroup. We did not identify interventions that showed a statistically significant effect of exercise, dietary, or vitamin D supplementation on EDSS scores across studies. However, studies were not designed to assess effects on MS progression. More research is , in particular, needed on interventions for smoking cessation, adequately powered vitamin D supplementation RCTs, and RCTs testing the effects of long -term exercise interventions.

MS is characterized pathologically by focal areas of inflammation, demy elination, gliosis , and axonal damage through out the central nervous system.4,5 The course of MS is characterized by clinical relapse s and disease progression. Relapse, exacerbations, or attacks, are acute, inflammatory events that occur episodically within the central nervous system. The y can correspond to either the development of new focal inflammatory lesions or the reactivation of old lesions , and a fter an exacerbation, symptoms spontaneous ly remit, either partially or completely. Progression describes a steady deterioration in neuro logic function associated with new symptoms and continuously worsening disability which takes place over a period of at least 6 (Poser criteria) or 12 months (McDonald criteria).6,7 Once progression has developed, the course is continuous despite occasional plateaus an d temporary minor improvements.8 MS disease presentation is very heterogeneous with variable clinical manifestations that evolve over time . About 80% of patients present with r elapsing -remitting disease which manifests in relapses followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions) . Other subtypes of MS include secondary progressive MS (patients develop relapsing -remitting MS but then begin progressing with or without relapses ). In about 50% of patients the course of MS changes from relapsing- remitting to secondary progressive disease after 10 years .9 Active p rogressive MS show s a slow progression of disability from onset with periods of stability and occasional relapses , while patients with primary progressive MS show progressive worsening in disability from onset without exacerbations. It is estimated that while 15% of patients with MS will become severely disabled within a short time , for 25% of patients MS will never affect daily life. 10 Epidemiologic data show that rates of MS appear to vary with environmental factors . 10 This suggest s a role of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with the onset and phenotypic manifestation of the disease. Similarly, the course of MS varies with demographic variables and possibly ot her factors . Furtherm ore, t he mechanism that change s the disease pattern from relapsing- remitting to secondary progressive MS is largely unknown.9 Factor s that may explain the diversity in clinical presentation , help predict the course of the disease , and identify potential trigger s of disease progression are of great interest to patients and clinicians, in particular modifiable risk factors .11 Disease- modifying t herapies for relapsing f orms of MS are only partially effective in slowing short -term morbidity and there are no effective medication options for progressive MS.12 Additional MS treatment and management options are needed to support patients with a diagnosis of MS . Some risk factors associated with the onset or progression of MS may be translatable into interventions , such as in the case of the potential risk factor vitamin D Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 9 deficiency , which can be tested in effectiveness trials by treating MS patients with a vitamin D supplement .13 This project focuses on empirical evi dence on modifiable exposures and risk factors that are related to MS progression and approaches to reduce progression that are directed at modifiable risk factors. This review will be used by the VA Multiple Sclerosis Centers of Excellence to initiate new research studies, refine clinical guidelines , and plan for targeted disease- modifying and disease -prevention strategies. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 10 METHODS TOPIC DEVELOPMENT This topic was developed in response to a nomination by the VA Multiple Sclerosis Center of Excellence -East, for an evidence review to examine the role of modifiable risk factors and military exposures in the progression of MS, as well as methods to reduce progression that are directed at modifiable risk factors. The Key Questions (KQ) were: (1) What modifiable epidemiologic factors are related to multiple sclerosis progression following diagnosis? (2) What environmental exposures prior to or during military service are related to multiple sclerosis progression following onset symptoms? (3) Among identified risk factors for progression, what treatment/risk factor modification therapies have been shown to delay or hasten the progression of multiple sclerosis once it has initiated? SEARCH STRATEGY We search ed the electronic databases PubMed (medical literature) ; EMBASE (biomedical literature) ; AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) ; SCOPUS and Web of Science (broad research databases indexing conference papers and innovations) ; GreenFILE (environmental factors ); DTIC (Defense Technical Information Center ), and ProQuest Military Collection ( databases for military research) for primary research studies published in English to March 2015 without date restriction . Dates of database inception varied; for example , PubMed systematically indexes research published since 1966, with some earlier publications. For KQ1, we employ ed a search strategy that combined known presumed risk factors , and a more general search for prognostic study designs based on a published sear ch filter14 applied to PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science , and GreenFILE . The KQ2 search strategy used search terms for military populations to identify MS studies without further study restrictions in the databases PubMed , EMBASE ProQuest Military Collection . For KQ3 we applied a search filter for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to search the databases PubMed, AMED, SCOPUS, and Web of Science, to target eligible studies. The PubMed search encompassed all indexed RCTs in MS patients and was not restricted to a set of pre-defined intervention s, to avoid missing relevant studies targeting uniquely -named o r novel interventions . Furthermore, we screen ed references of pertinent reviews and consult ed with topic experts to ensure that all relevant studies were identified . Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 11 STUDY SELECTION Two independent reviewers screen ed titles and abstracts of retrieved citations and record ed decisions in an electronic database. Citations deemed potentially relevant by at least one of t he reviewers were obtained as full text. The full -text publications were screened against the specified inclusion criteria by 2 independent literature reviewers; disagreements were resolved through discussion within the review team. The literature flow was documented in an electronic database and reasons for exclusion of full text publications were recorded. To be included in the systematic review, studies had to meet the following criteria, organized in the PICOTS framework . Participants: Studies in h uman adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of MS were eligible for inclusion for KQ1 and KQ3. KQ2 was limited to active military personnel and Veterans with MS. Studies exclusively focusing on pediatric MS in children and adolescents were excluded. Studies targeting a range of clinical conditions were included as long as data on MS progression was reported separately. The sample composition of MS populations was not restricted but risk factor studies excluding all progressive forms and not reporting on MS progression were excluded ( eg, studies describing disease severity in explicitly non -progressive forms). Intervention: Studies reporting on modifiable epidemiologic factors and environmental exposures potentially associated with MS progression (\"risk factors\") were eligible for inclusion for KQ1 and KQ2 . Eligible r isk factors include d (but were not limited to) the geographic region of residence, sun exposure, vitamin D intake , polyunsaturated fatty acid intake , diet, smoking, alcohol, exercise , vaccinations, anesthesia exposure , radiation therapy exposure , use of oral contraception, fertility treatment, childbirth delivery variables, breastfeeding, salt intake, use of milk products, water sources intake , trace elements intake , mercury exposure , trauma exposure , military service/deployment, and military exposures . Non-modifiable risk factors such as genetic predispositions, physiological correlates, or demographic characteristics at MS onset were excluded. Descriptive factors such as quali ty of life or vitality with unclear modifiab ility, comorbidities, and concurrent psychological correlates of disability status that are more likely to be a reaction to than a predictor of MS ( eg, coping strategies and perceptions of body image ) were excluded. Factors directly associated with known MS medication, such as the use of disease- modifying treatment , type of medication, medication combinations, dosing schemes, adherence, and timing of therapy onset were also excluded. Intervention s tudies e valuating the effect of modifying the intake or exposure to potential risk factors ( eg, smoking cessation, weight loss, or exercise programs; nutrition al interventions targeting vitamin D or Omega -3), alone or in combination with other therap ies, were eligible for KQ3 . Treatment studies testing potential risk factors were eligible for inclusion regardless of the current strength of association in empirical studie s, but studies evaluating unspecific interventions not associated with potential or identifi ed MS risk factors (eg, acupuncture ) were excluded . Treatment studies evaluating the effect of existing , FDA -approved MS medications that aim to m odify the disease course of MS ( eg, interferon beta- for autoimmune and immunodeficiency and medication given for their immunomodulatory properties (eg, statins) or tested for their use in MS ( eg, lithium) were excluded regardless of any underlying risk factor hypothes es (eg, infection, hygiene hypothesis ). Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 12 Comparator (design): Observational studies ( eg, case- control, cohort studies comparing 2 cohorts, or cross -sectional studies including surveys ), and experim ental studies analyzing factors associated with MS progression were eligible for KQ1 and KQ2 . Non-randomized e xperimental studies had to have a non- treated concurrent control group to identify standard progression rates and provide a power calculation to d etermine a priori whether differences between experimental groups could be identified. Risk factor s tudies had to report data on 10 or more participants with MS. Case studies speculating about associations were excluded. RCTs in adults regardless of the co mparator were eligible for KQ3. Only primary research studies were eligible for inclusion . Pertinent reviews and secondary data analyses were retained as background paper for reference mining. Outcome: Studies reporting on the progression of MS were eligible for inclusion in the review. The primary outcome was Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS) scores or progression classifications based on EDSS score cut -offs. Studies reporting on earlier versions of the EDSS scale; other global patient -centered, clinical MS progression measures ( eg, Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite [MSFC] , multiple domain assessment s of the Functional System Score [FSS] , Patient Determined Disability Scale [PDDS] ); the clinical course of MS ( eg, progression defined by cl inical judgment, time to secondary progression ); or comparing MS subgroups relevant to progression ( eg, relapsing -remitt ing versus secondary -progressive stage) were eligible for inclusion . Studies reporting on disability measures focusing on the general ability to walk (eg, MS Progression: Disease Step s [DS]) were included . Studies only reporting on individual characteristics of walking ( eg, gait, muscle strength , speed ) were excluded . Studies reporting on other individual symptoms (eg, fatigue or depress ion) or individual diagnostic markers ( eg, lesions shown with imagin g techniques) without reporting on patient outcomes of MS progression were excluded. Studies reporting disability measures not specific to MS ( eg, receiving a disability pension) were excl uded. Studies reporting on MS -associated mortality were included if the endpoint was part of a continuum of progression and not an incidence measure of MS. S tudies reporting on all -cause mortality in MS patient samples , for example investigating whether as sociations between epidemiologic factors and mortality found in the general population ( 'smoking predict s mortality ') also apply to the MS population , were excluded. Studies exclusively reporting on the onset, rather than the progression of MS , and studies only reporting on the prevalence and incidence of MS without differentiating MS subtypes relevant to MS progression (eg, primary progressive MS) were excluded. Timing: Risk factor studies were not limited by exposure duration and timing ( eg, childhood exposure) and any follow -up points were eligible for inclusion in KQ1 , but investigator -initiated exposures ( ie, interventions ) were restricted to long -term interventions if they did not report a statistical power calculation indicating that the study had suf ficient power to show a difference between exposed groups . We included prospective (measuring the exposure before the outcome), retrospective (measuring the exposure of a past event retrospectively at the time of measuring the outcome), and concurrent (measuring the exposure status and the outcome at the same time point) studies. Studies eligible for KQ 2 were limited to exposures prior to or during military service . Intervention RCTs including any intervention duration, regardless of the intervention timing , and any follow -up points were eligible for inclusion for KQ3. Setting: Studies of any settings were eligible for inclusion in the review . Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 13 Other limiters: English- language studies were included. The review was registered in PROSPERO, the international registry for systematic reviews PROSPERO http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ . (PROSPERO 2015:CRD42015016461) Protocol D eviation s Due to the overwhelming size o f the literature identified through our literature searches that exceeded the available time and resources needed to complete the project , we removed co - morbidities such as stress, anxiety, depression, infections, sleep problems, or obesity regardless of their treatability and modifiability status from the eligibility criteria. We also excluded the large body of literature on pregnancy and parity given that the decision to have children may be directly associated with disease severity and anticipated progression (reverse causality is discussed in more detail in the discussion section). Finally, w e excluded studies that report ed on the physiological or clinical status of patients, such as body weight or serum fatty acid levels, without information on the inta ke or patient behavior ( eg, diet regime) other than v itamin D. In sum, w e excluded factors that could either be a reaction to , an independent comorbidity, or a predictor of MS progression , and concentrated primarily on behavior and choices or exposures somewhat under the control of the patient or their families. DATA ABSTRACTION Studies underwent standardized abstraction of study -level data in an electronic database. Data collection forms were designed by the project lead and discussed in the review team. For KQ1 (risk factors) studies, we extract ed information on the MS population ( eg, proportion of patients with relapsing -remitting, secondary progressive, or primary progressive MS ; age; % male ; race/ethnicity distribution ). We document ed the number of participants in the study sample and the number of cases (ie, patients with progressive MS). W e record ed the geographic region of the sample . We document ed the study design ( eg, cohort study) , method s used to analyze the results ( eg, linear mixed effects model , partial correlations ), and the predictive timeframe (concurrent, retrospective, prospective data) . We extracted analyzed , potential , modifiable risk factors of interest together with the time of exposure ( eg, alcohol consumption in last 2 years ). We record ed all independent variables entering the prediction model. We extract ed the point estimate of effects and statistical significance of risk factors on MS progression. The evidence table differentiates predictions for EDSS scores and other clinical course characteristics relevant to MS progression . Concurrent studies were defined as measuring the exposure status and the outcome at the same time point, such as current alcohol intake. Retro spective studies assessed at least some outcomes retrospectively (eg, cod liver oil consumption during childhood) . Prospective studies had to report on at least 2 different points in time assessing the risk factor prior to the MS progression outcome to be classified as prospective. For studies relevant to KQ2 (military service exposures) , we extract ed the information on the study population including : MS characteristics and military service status ; number of study participants and cases , geographic region ; study design; analytic method ; assessed prior or post military service exposures ; assessed military service exposures ; other analyzed independent variables ; predictive time frame ; EDSS score results; and other clinical course results . Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 14 For intervention stud ies (KQ3 , risk factor modification therapies ), we extract ed the study design and methodological characteristics , number of randomized participants per intervention group and proportion of participants with progressive MS , characteristics of participants , intervention components and co -interventions, comparator details , outcomes , followup points, statistical power analysis, EDSS results , other disease progression results, and adverse events . Some studies were reported on in more than one publication. Studi es, defined by the included participants, were only counted once, regardless of the number of publications the results were published in . The data extraction considered data from all publications available for the study. QUALITY ASSESSMENT For KQ1 and KQ2 we distinguished concurrent, retrospective, and prospective studies. Prospective studies were assessed with QUIPS (Quality In Prognosis Studies), a critical appraisal tool for prognostic studies.15 Intervention studies ( KQ3) were assessed with the Cochrane r isk of bias tool assessing selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias (where appropriate ). Quality criteria definitions and scoring guidelines for all domains are documented in Appendix C together with the assessment results . DATA SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS The evidence tables provide info rmation on each included study to allow a comprehensive overv iew. Summary of findings tables summarize results for analyzed modifiable risk factor in the general population (KQ1) and military samples (KQ2) , and results for individual interventions (KQ3) across all identified studies. The evidence tables and summary of findings tables differentiated results based on EDSS scores, the primary outcome of the review , and other MS progression results. The EDSS16 is widely used to assess the disability and the progression of MS. Scores range from 1 (no disability) to 10 (death due to MS). A milestone often us ed in research is EDSS 6, characterized by the need for a cane or other constant assistance to walk 100 meters. Where possible, variables were pooled across studies in meta- analys es to identify reliable and valid effects across studies. We pooled studies w here at least 3 studies were available for the risk factor of interest and the effect measure of interest (eg, correlations, time to event data, count data) . Continuous outcomes were reported as standardized mean differences (SMD) to facilitate the comparison of effect sizes across outcome measures. We calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) to determine the clinical importance of the effect for studies reporting on the primary outcome EDSS scores. Dichotomous data were presented as relative risks (RR). For time to event data we computed hazard ratios (HR) . Correlations (r) transformed to z statistics (using the Fisher transformation) to pool across studies . Point estimates were calculated together with the 95 percent confidence i nterval (CI). W e used a restricted maximum -likelihood estimator and the Hartung -Knapp -Sidik -Jonkman method for random -effects models to pool across studies . Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 15 All studies relevant to KQ1 were summarized narratively. When at least 3 studies were available that report ed on the same risk factor and the same outcome measure, we performed meta- analysis. The synthesis differentiated variables assessed as potential risk factors, and results indicating a statistically significant association with MS disability and pr ogression. The synthesis addressed negative and positive associations indicating worsening of progression status or protective factors. In addition, it also documented the absence of associations. Due to the diversity in study designs , analytic methods , and effect measures , and the small number of studies , studies in military personnel and Veterans relevant to KQ2 were summarized narratively. We differentiated assessed variables and statistically significant effects. The narrative synthesis emphasizes risk factors identified in more than one individual study. Intervention studies ( KQ3 ) were summarized narratively , grouped by intervention category. When at least 3 studies were available for the same intervention group and outcome measure ( eg, EDSS scores , number of patients progressing, time to progression) , we performed meta- analysis. Data were based on intention -to-treat results , where available. For continuous outcomes results were based on unadjusted post-intervention scores . Results of studies in milit ary personnel and Veterans were an a priori planned subgroup analysis . RATING THE BODY OF E VIDENCE We rated the quality of the evidence for individual risk factors across all identified studies (KQ1), in military and Veteran populations (KQ2), and for individual interventions (KQ3) across all identified pertinent studies. Based on GRADE guidelines17 the quality of the evidence was categorized as follows: High : We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate : We are moderately confident in the ef fect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low : Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from th e estimate of the effect. Very low : We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Given the complexity of epidemiological data collection and interpretation , the synthesis focused on factors that have been assessed in more than one study. Other, unique assessment results were reported in evidence tables but not further documented in the summary of findings tables for KQ1 and KQ3 to provide a concise overview . Given the relevance to the VA , all available evidence was documented for KQ2. For KQ1 and KQ2 we t ook the following criteria into account to determine the level of evidence quality. These are based on an adaptation of the GRADE framework for prognostic factor research .18 The \"phase of investigation \" criterion w as used as a starting point (high or moderate quality of evidence). The criteria \"study limitations, \" \"inconsistency, \" \"indirectness, \" \"imprecision, \" and \"p ublication bias \" were used to decrease the quality of evidence. T he criteria Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 16 \"moderate / large e ffect size \" and \"exposure -response gradient \" were used to increase the evidence grade where applicable. For KQ3 we t ook the number of identified studies and the criteria \"risk of bias, \" \"inconsistency, \" \"imprecision, \" and \"publication bias\" into account. The starting point was high evidence because the data are based on RCTs.17 Publication bias was assessed with the regression test (Egger test) and the rank test (Begg test). Results indicating evidence of publication bi as were reanalyzed using the trim -and-fill method to adjust for potentially missing studies.

PEER REVIEW A draft version of the report was reviewed by technical experts , clinical leadership , and additional peer reviewers where appropriate. Reviewer comments and how we have addressed them is documented in Appendix D. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 17 RESULTS LITERATURE FLOW The literature search identified a large numb er of citations ( N = 8,594). We selected 455 potentially relevant publications to be obtained as full text in order to screen them against the predetermined inclusion criteria. We obtained a large number of publications as full text and checked studies for the outcome of interest after piloting the inclusion criteria in the first set of citations . Publications did not systematically mention progression in the title or abstract of the publication; hence , a large number of studies was obtained as full text and results sections were carefully screened for data relevant to MS progression . In total, 300 publications were excluded because they did not meet one or more of the inclusion criteria. The list of excluded studies a nd the reasons for exclusion are documented in Appendix B. A large proportion of the studie s was excluded because the full -text review showed that the study did not report on MS progression . The second -largest reason for exclusion was associated with studies not reporting on modifiable risk factors (Exclude -Intervention/Exposure) . In total, 9 5 studies19-112 met inclusion criteria and contributed to answering the review questions. Of these, 5 9 studies contributed to KQ1. Despite the extensive search i n general and specialist databases for military research, we only identified 4 studies that provided data for KQ2. In total, 36 RCTs were identified that contributed to KQ3.

Risk factor studies meeting inclusion criteria were p ublished between 1973 and 2015, with a large proportion of studies having been published in the last 3 years . Of note, n o study was excluded due to the publication year for this review and all databases were searched withou t date restriction. Studies were conducted in the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Iran, Italy, Belgium, UK, t he Netherlands, France, Swed en, Germany , Turkey , and Finland , and some were international samples based on online survey s. Studies identified participants through hospital records or surveyed members of MS registries. Most studies used unselected samples that included a range of MS forms. Studies assessed a large variety of modifiable epidemiological factors and used differen t operationalizations of potential risk factors ( eg, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, exercise / physical activities assessed with the revised Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile [HPLP -II]). Some studies assessed the current status while others assessed lifetime prevalence (eg, ever smokers). Included studies used a broad range of outcome measures such as EDSS scores, other patient - reported scale scores, correlations with EDSS scores or other measures of disease status , time to EDSS 6, time to EDSS 4, time to secondary progression, or time to wheelchair dependency . Some studies used standardized scales such as the EDSS while others reported on clinician - defined outcomes ( eg, clinical deterioration). The research study p ool included 13 prospective studies.20,30,35,69,72,76,87,91,96-98,112,113 These studies assessed participants at 2 or more different points in time and are be tter suited to make predictions (rather than establish concurrent associations , or rely ing on retrospective assessments from memory about factors experienced in the past ). Details of all included studies are presented in the evidence tables. We grouped studies exclusively report ing on vitamin D or sun exposure, studies reporting on childbirth -related factors, studies investigating the role of smoking, studies reporting on diet and nutrition , and studies reporting on unique factors such as childhood trauma. The last evidence table summarizes studies that investigat ed more than one risk factor of interest for this revie w. Of the single -factor studies, the largest group addressed vitamin D . Vitamin D can be absorbed from exposure from sunlight, from diet, or from dietary supplements. The first evidence table for KQ1 documents how published studies have operationalized this potential risk factor for MS progression .

Several studies recruited patients through MS registries. Total sample sizes ranged from 46 and 2 ,837. The majority of studies were concurrent studies, measuring the current status of the proposed risk factor and the outcome of interest simultaneously . Four studies assessed retrospective data (ie, predicted outcomes from exposures in the past ).39,51,58,95 Two studies were prospe ctive studies20,114 reporting on the risk factor and outcome sequentially, with the exposure preceding the outcome measure. Assessed potential risk factors (as reported) were serum or plasma 25(OH)D levels at the time of assessment , 25(OH)D levels in the summer and winter, 1,25(OH)2D, vitamin D -binding protei n, vitamin D levels not further specified, dietary vitamin D intake, sun exposure in the summer, sun exposure in the winter, time in the sun on leisure and on work days, and the month of birth. Several studies reported on the correlation between 25(OH)D levels and EDSS scores , either reporting the correlation coefficient , the p -value, or paraphrasing the association . No other specific risk factor ( eg, sun exposure) and specific outcome (eg, MSSS score) combination was assessed in more than one study. Only one study reported on the change between relapsing - remitting MS to secondary progressive MS. Koch et al51 analyzed the month of birth and the time from MS onset to secondary progression in sample of patients with primary progressive or relapsing- remitting MS. Half the studies adjusted for potential confounders, such as age and duration of disease. One of the prospective studies reported that 25(OH)D levels of 50nmol/L at up to 12 months predicted lower disability during the subsequent 4 years.20 The other prospective study reported a statistically non-significant correlation between vitamin D nutrition and EDSS progression, but it was unclear whether the study had suffic ient power to detect an effect .91 The quality assessment of the two prospective studies is shown in the appendix. The study by Ascherio et al was a clinical trial sample,20 rather than derived from a large and broad er in scope MS registry sample . The study by Soilu -Hanninen was very small (23 patients with MS) and may als o not be a good representation of the population of interest.114 Another lar ge group of studies reported on smoking and effects on disease progression , as documented in the next evidence table.

Studies from the US, different European countries, Iran, and Tasmania contributed research. All but 3 studies were retrospective analyses . Participants were recruited at MS centers and registries. The number of included participants ranged from 98 to 1,465. Specific a ssessed risk factors were : current smoking status ; smoking status as baseline ; age of starting and quitting; early (15 years or younger) or later smoking start; nu mber of cigarettes smoked per day; current, past, or never smokers; ever versus never smokers; number of cigarette pack -years in total ; pack -years smoked in past 6 months; smoking status before and after onset of MS; nonsmoking periods; and smoking duratio n in years. Information came from self -reported survey data or medical records. All studies used multivariate methods controlling for demographic and disease characteristics. Studies used a range of outcome predictors, assessing continuous outcomes, dicho tomous status variables, and time to event data. The individual measures were EDSS scores, MSSS scores (measure of rate of disease progression, standardized for disease duration), EDSS score divided by disease duration, time to conversion to secondary prog ression from onset , time from disease onset to EDSS 4, time to EDSS 6, reaching EDSS 4 during study period, reaching EDSS 6, experiencing progression, age at onset of secondary progression , and proportion of patients who progressed on EDSS after 2 years/ a fter 5 years (increase in EDSS score) . Three prospective studies were identified. All reported a statistically significant effect of smoking on MS but reported on different outcome measures . 76,97,112 The detailed quality assessment of the prospective studies is shown in Appendix C. Two of the studies did not indicate major flaws . One was published as a n abstract only and lacked detail .

Study sample sizes in the studies varied widely , ranging from 1 74 to 2,105 included women . Studies used different outcomes measures : EDSS , DSS, or MSSS scores . One study included only patients with relapsing - remitting MS. It predicted EDSS and MSSS scores and reported on the odds r atio of having a more benign disease course defined as MSSS below 2.5.85 The studies evaluated a number of potential risk factors that may be associated with MS progression: epidural and/or spinal analgesia during delivery , breast feeding, use of oral contraceptives , and cesarean delivery . All stud ies adjusted for covariates in the analyses, in particular the age at the time of the first child and age at MS onset. Three studies were retrospective analyses but 2 studies assessed women at the time of pregnancy and followed them for a number of years.30,72 The quality assessment of the prospective studies are shown in the appendix. The main source of potential bias was confounding due to selection bias. It is possible that participants self -selected the exposure or intervention, such as breast feeding , because of their EDSS scores . Hence studies may show reverse causality with EDSS scores (the outcome) influencing the variable assessed as the risk factor. We also identified studies that exclusively reported on diet and its effects on disability and progress ion of MS , as documented in the following evidence table.

All s tudies were conducted in the US or the US and Canada. One study reported concurrent data, meaning current dietary fatty acid intake, in patients with relapsing- remitting MS. The study, published as a conference abstract, lacked detail but stated that none of the assessed fatty acids were related to disability.21 Two studies were retrospective analyses.38,54 One reported on the duration of alcohol consumption after MS diagnosis. The other focused on men on active duty in the US Army and reported on the disease course for patients that were put on a specific diet in the hospital, compared to patients without administration of a specific therapy.54 The study did not report a statistical analy sis but , applying Fisher's exact test to the raw data, we find that the difference between groups was not statistically significant. No information was available on the specific diet and approaches may have varied across patients and hospitals. A fourth study reported on the Swank diet in multiple publications .98,118,119 The prospective study compared \"good dieters ,\" meaning people with fat consumption of 20g per day or less , and \"poor dieters\" who exceeded the fat consumption limit. Patients who were given the diet advice were followed for 34 years. The study reported that in each of the disability groups, the average worsening in disability grade and t he percentage of deaths of the poor dieters significantly exceeded those of the good dieters. The detailed quality assessment of the study is shown in Appendix C. The main concern is the ascertainment of the risk factor , which in this case is the complianc e of the participants with the diet and self -reports that determined the classification into good or poor dieters. A small group of studies exclusively reported on exercise behavior as shown in the following evidence table.

The number of included participants ranged from 11 to 8,983. The studies included retrospective and prospective analyses. A large retrospective stud y used data from 8,983 survey respondents .62 It reported an association between self-reported physical activity in the last 12 months and disability measure d with the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PD DS), indicating that physical activity decreased steadily with increasing disability. The PDDS is a self-report measure of disability using a scale of 0 (normal) through 8 (bedridden), developed as a surrogate for the EDSS. Another retrospective study assessed the use of physical rehabilitation and reported that patients who had used inpatient, outpatient, or home -based rehabilitation had higher levels of impairment compar ed to patients who were not rehabilitated.64 A very small, prospective study in 11 participants reported a negative correlation between objectively measured physical activity over one year and EDSS scores. 87 No other data were reported that may inform the temporal association between the 2 variables, such as the effect of physical activity at baseline on MS progression. A prospec tive study by Stuifbergen et al , on the other hand , assessed exercise behavior in a sample followed for 5 years. Exercise scores at the first assessment time point were negatively correlated (r = -0.17) with annual change rate in functional limitations due to MS ( Incapacity Status Scale, ISS; self -reported degree of impairment ).96 A prospective study by Motl et al68 reported that participants with higher premorbid physical activity leve ls reported less change in disability over time (PDDS scores) compared with those who reported lower premorbid physical activity. The risk of bias evaluation for the prospective studies is shown in the Appendix C. The objectively measured study only inclu ded 11 patients and data were not prospectively analyzed .87 The other prospective stud ies were higher quality but neither report ed on EDSS scores, the primary outcome of this review.

Three were US studies, one was conducted in Iran , one in Turkey, and one in Germany . All but one were retrospective studies ; one followed patients prospectively .35 Where reported, studies included a range of MS subtypes. The largest study compared 2,150 VHA Veterans with 2,107 non -VHA Veterans and 16,119 non -veterans. In terms of risk factors, studies reported on education, peripheral trauma ( eg, surgery, head injuries), childhood maltreatment, geographic regions with high or low MS prevalence, recent earthquake exposure, and being a VHA Veteran . A prospective study reported that progression to a non- ambulatory status or death was significantly greater among patient s who lived in LA county, a low -prevalence area for MS.35 The detailed risk of bias assessment for this study is shown in the appendix. Of note, the study measured disability status at follow -up by a self -administered mailed questionnaire; hence , the progression data are not b ased on physician assessments. One study used a VA -relevant dataset and reported that VHA Veterans had higher PDDS scores than non- veterans.104 The other studies reported no associations between assessed predictors and outcome measures. The last KQ1 evidence table summarizes all those studies that reported on more than one group of risk factor of interest for this revie w, for example studies reporting the effect of smoking and exercise.

The studies addressed a wide range of potential risk factors such as alcohol, wine, coffee, fish , cod liver oil, and fat consumption . Studies also addressed health -promoting nutrition and other dietary factors; alcohol- related problems, drug misuse, smoking; vitamin D levels , sun exposure ; oral contraceptive intake ; physica l activity ; meditation practices, spiritual growth ; interpersonal relationships ; and stress management behaviors . Some studies associated MS progression with insurance coverage and treat ment -associated factors; latitude and geographic location; and deploym ent to a war theater. Three studies primarily reported on concurrent data27,43,106 (that is , linking current behavior such as current alcohol intake to EDSS sco res). Most studies assessed the effects of prior events , exposures, or behaviors in retrospective studies .36,55,63,105,106 60,99 The retrospective study by D'hooghe was based on a 2009 survey of people registered in the Flemish MS society , and t he data were reported in multiple publications focusing on the effects of alcohol, coffee, fish, and smoking;36 sunlight exposure;120 and menarche, oral contraceptives, and self -reported health promotion behaviors .122 A German study assessed a catalogue of potential risk factors, ranging from exposure to vaccines, childhood diet, exposures to pets and livestock, and environmental factors such as living near an industrial plan t.55 One prospective study address ed vitamin D levels and smoking. The longitudinal US study reported that EDSS scores were not associated with smoking at baseline but each 10ng/mL higher vitamin D level was associated with lower subsequent disability.69 The detailed risk of bias assessment for this high -quality study is documented in Appendix C. Summary of F indings and Quality of Evidence We identified a large number of studies reporting on pot ential modifiable risk factors for MS progression. However, studies assessed very specific risk factors ( eg, vitamin D serum level , sun exposure in the summer 2 hours or more daily , etc) and predicted very specific outcomes ( eg, EDSS scores, time to reach EDSS 6 , etc). The following summariz es the available evidence for individual risk factors across all i dentified risk factor studies. Vitamin D Vitamin D and sun exposure -associated variables have been addressed in a large number of studies ; however, the risk factor analyses used many different approaches , as documented in the evidence tables (see Table 1 and Table 7) . The following figure summarizes the correlation between EDSS scores and the physiological vitamin D level of participants . The figure shows a risk factor and outcome measure that was reported in multiple studies that all reported a correlation as the measure of association or allowed computing a correlation from the reported data. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 58 Figure 2: Correlation between EDSS Score and V itamin D L evel Eleven included studies reported a correlation between vitamin D levels and EDSS scores . Across all available data, there was a weak negative correlation of -0. 22 (CI -0.32, - 0.12; 11 studies) indicating that lower vitamin D level s are associated with higher EDSS scores. All individual studies suggested the same direction of effects but not all were statistically significant and t here was evidence of heterogeneity (I2 66%). We also identified evidence of publication bias (regression test p = 0.045, rank test p = 0.087). Using the trim -and-fill method of correcting for potentially missing studies, the estimate was slightly lower but still statistically significant (r = -0.20; CI -0.29, -0.11). Eight data points in the meta -analysis came from concurrent data analyses , assessing current vitamin D level and EDSS scores at the time of data assessment . One retrospective chart review also reported an association.95 Of the 2 included prospective studies, one highlighted that there was no t a statistically significant negative correlation between vitamin D nutrition and EDSS progression .91 However, the finding is likely to be linked to the small sample size; the reported correlation is in range with other reported results seen in the forest plot. The other prospective study showed higher vitamin D levels to be associated with lower subsequent disability in a multivariate analysis.69 An additional prospective stud y assessing on vitamin D w as identified that could not be added to the meta -analysis because it reported on other measures of association . The study reported that values greater than or equal to 50nmol/L at up to 12 months predicted lower EDSS scores (p = 0.004).20 The evidence suggesting a correlation between vitamin D levels an d EDSS scores was downgraded to only moderate quality of evidence due to indirectness . For this systematic review, the correlation between the physiological measures of vitamin D serum or plasma level is an indirect outcome . The review evaluated patient -modifiable risk factors, such as expo sure, intake, or behavior al risk factors . The meta -analysis shows a correlation between the physiological level and a progression measure and whether the physiological levels can be directly influenced by the participant is an unresolved question . We did not identify more than one study reporting on intake of vitamin D and a measure of MS progression . Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 59 Sun E xposure Five studies reported on sun exposure and MS progression.36,60,63,99,103 All were retrospective studies . Four r eported a negative association of sun exposure and MS progression or a positive association of increasing disability and reduced sun exposure . One reported an association i n patients with relapsing onset MS but not in progressive onset MS . However, all studies used different assessment tools (EDSS, PDDS, and MSSS) and different predictors ( time to sustained EDSS 6, time to PDDS 8, a score of MSSS 6 or above, odds of reaching an EDSS score greater than 6, EDSS scores) . Hence it was not possible to estimate the size of the potentially protective effect across studies and the quality of the evidence base is currently insufficient for concrete effect estimates . Sunscreen Use Suns creen use has been addressed in 2 studies.36,60 Both reported no association with MS progression but both used different outcome measures (reaching EDSS 6, MSSS scores), precluding concrete evidence statements. Month of B irth Three studies assessed whether the month of birth was associated with disease progression, often hypothesizing this affects the amount of sunshine a newborn is exposed to.39 51,58 One study reported on the time from onset to secondary progressi on, one on progression to EDSS 6, and one on MSSS scores. All reported no impact on disease progression but studies did not report on the same outcome measure and did not report numerical results other than the statistical significance of the association that would allow further analyses . The quality of the evide nce base was determined to be insufficient for specific evidence statements . Smoking A large number of studies reported on smoking but studies used a variety of operationalizations of the risk factor and a range of different outcome measures . The forest plot summarizes the studies that reported on disease progression, either operationalized as time to reach EDSS 6 , time to conversion to secondary progression , or time to progressive disease . The studies compar ed current and/or ever smokers with nons mokers and/or never smokers . Data are primarily based on retrospective data collections. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 60 Figure 3: Time to P rogression and Smoking Across studies we identified an increased risk of faster progression in smokers than nonsmokers (HR 1.55; CI 1. 10, 2. 19; I2 72% ; 7 studies , 8 datasets ). However, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity (that is , unexplained variation in results across studies ). A subgroup analysis restricting to studies predictin g time to secondary progressi ve MS (rather than progression to EDSS 6 or progression in all samples) showed a larger effect estimate, but the pooled effect was not statistically significant in this subset and substantial heterogeneity remained 77%; 4 RCTs ). There was also evidence of publication bias (rank test p = 0.179, regression test p = 0.038). A sensitivity analysis computing the trim -and-fill method to account for potentially missing studies estimated a smaller effect ( HR 1.33, CIs 1.05, 1.85; 2 estimated missing studies ), but nonetheless a still statistically significant effect. The forest plot includes one out of 4 identified prospective studies.97 The other prospective studies could not be added to the meta- analysis because they reported on different measures. These studies report ed conflicting results: o ne found no association between smoking status at baseline and EDSS scores over a period of 5 years (incidence rate ratio [ IRR] 0.09; - 0.17, 0.36)69 while another one found baseline smoking status to be a predictor of physical disability after 6 years.112 The third reported that the cumulativ e cigarette pack -years smoked after cohort entry was associated with an increase in longitudinal MSSS scores (p < 0.001).76 The body of evidence regarding an effect of smoking on the risk of progression was downgraded to moderate evidence quality due to unexplained heterogeneity in effect estimates across studies (inconsistency ). Diet Evidence on dietary regimen was sparse and lacked detail.21,36,38,54,60,63,98 We did not identify more than one stud y report ing on the same diet or diet variable except fish consumption (see below). S tudies addressing fat consumption did not report on the same outcome measure . Results across individual studies varied , with some studies showing associations with MS progression , other s not; and results also varied within studies (comparing relapsing and progressive onset MS).36 Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 61 The only identified prospective study reported on the Swank diet for MS patients and showed that for poor dieters, operat ionalized as participants with an intake of more than 20g fat per day, the average worsening significantly exceeded those of the good dieters , but the size of the effect was not reported.98 The quality of the ev idence base was judged to be insufficient overall. Fish C onsumption Fish consumption specifically, which is associated with vitamin D as well as fatty acid intake, has been evaluated in 3 studies : the Flemish registry survey , a study in patients with progressive MS registered in the VHA Multiple Sclerosis Surveillance Registry , and an Italian cohort .36,60,63 The studies differed in risk factor timing (current ; in the last 2 years ; intake as a child) and used different outcome measures . The existing retrospective studies reported conflicting results with regard to the presence or absence of a negative association with MS progression. The quality of evidence was determined to be insufficient for specific evidence statements. Alcohol Alcohol consumption or alcohol misuse has been addressed in 5 studies in total .27,36,38,43,106 Possible alcohol -related problems,27 moderate duration of alcohol use after MS onset ( 15 years or less as compared to those who did not consume alcohol or consumed it for more than 15 years),38 higher levels of alcohol consumption (using a 5 -point scale ranging from never to daily)43 have been associated with lower EDSS score categories , that is le ss disability in participants consuming alcohol , in 3 identified studies . One study found an association of alcohol consumption (compared to no consumption) with a reduced risk to reach EDSS 6 in relapsing MS patients but not in patients with progressive o nset MS. 36 One study found that engaging in moderate alcohol consumption (up to 30g/day for women, up to 45g/day for men) compared to low or no alcohol consumption was associated with reduced odds of increased disability based on the PDDS (OR 0.59, p < 0.001). No prospective study exists, and the identified studies reported predominantly on concurrent association s (measuring current intake and current disability status) . We did not identify more than one study reporting on the same operationalization of alcohol consu mption and the same progression or disability measure; hence , the quality of evidence was insufficient for effect estimates across studies. Exercise Although a handful of studies on physical exercise is available, w e did not identify more than one study re porting on the same specific exercise variable and the same measure of MS progression . 36,43,62,64,68,87,96,123 All identified studi es reported an association between exercise and EDSS score or another measure of progression or disability , but the direction of effects varied by study design . Only 2 identified studies were prospective ly analyzed , predicting later progression from basel ine physical activity.68,96 Both highlighted the possible role of premorbid or baseline physical activity on future progression. Neither report ed on the primary outcome of the review. One reported that p remorbid physical activity statistically significantly predict ed the linear change in PDDS scores in patients with relapsing -remitting MS and emphasized the possible role of physical activity for lessening disability progression .68 The other reported that baseline exercise scores were negatively correlated with the annual change rate in functional limitations assessed Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 62 with a self -reported incapacity status scale and discussed the potential positive impact of exercise on MS progression .96 The overall qua lity of evidence was determined to be insufficient for concrete evidence statements , given the differences in outcome and predictor measures . Trauma Two studies addressed exposure to brain trauma .55,89 Both reported that it is not a risk factor for MS progression , but studies used different outcome measures (mean increase in DSS per year, benign MS defined as DSS equal or lower than 2 after 11 or more years of MS duration). No concrete evidence statement could be formulated for an individual outcome that has been s hown in more than one study. Epidural A nalgesia The association with MS progression and epidural analgesia has been addressed in 3 studies , including 2 prospective and one retrospective study .30,57,72 None reported a statistically significant association with EDSS or DSS scores . We did not identify st udies that reported on the change to secondary progression. The quality of the evidence for the statement that epidural analgesia does not affect progression was downgraded due to phase of investigation and imprecision . The risk factor was identified in exploratory, not confirmatory, studies and the point estimate of the association was not reported in either study. Hence, the strength of association is not known (studies only reported the statistically significance of the association). Oral Contraception Three studies reported on oral contraceptive use with conflicting results within and across studies . 36,40,57 The Flemish registry survey reported that use of oral contraceptives was related to an increased risk of reaching EDSS 6 in progressive but not in relapsing onset MS.36 A second study reported that patients who had used combined oral contraceptives continuously for at least one year had lower EDSS scores compared to never users , indicating a protective effect .40 A third study reported that women who started oral contraceptives after disease onset h ad lower EDSS scores than both never users and past users. A benign disease course was predicted by current oral contraceptive use compared to never or past users.85 Given that none of the studies compared an identi cal combination of risk factor and outcome measure operationalization, the quality of evidence was determined insufficient for concrete evidence statements. Geographic R egion Two studies addressed geographic regions but in different operationalizations ( eg, high vs low MS prevalence areas ; geographic region of military personnel at entry to the military ) and studies used different outcome measures (3 -point scale differentiating walking without aids, walking with aids, and restricted to wheelchair; progressi on to DSS 6 and DSS7).35,105 Only one of the studies reported an association; progression to a non -ambulatory status or death was significantly greater among patients who lived in Los Angeles County (a low -prevalence area). The different outcome measures, risk factor operationalizations, and conflicting results cannot be combined to a concrete evidence statement. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 63 Education Two studies investigated an association between education and MS progression.22,99 Both studies were retrospective analyses , they reported on EDSS greater than 6 or MSSS scores , and they reported conflicting results. One study assessing MSSS did not find that education predicted getting st atistically significantly worse in a sample of 338 patients, the other one reported that lower educational attainment predicted EDSS scores abo ve 6 (OR 1.5; CI 1.2, 2.8). Given the lack of replication on outcome measures and the conflicting results , the qu ality of evidence was rated insufficient . Other F actors All other factors have been addressed in only one of the included stud ies and have not been replicated yet . The study details together with the results are shown in the evidence tables. KQ1 Summary The summary of findings table documents the available evidence for specific risk factors and specific outcome measures that were reported in more than one study. We did not include results that were based on a single study without replication by another, i ndependent author group, given the complexity of epidemiological data collection. Results (strength and statistical significance of the association) for EDSS scor es and for other MS progression -relevant findings w ere summarized across studies. For each ou tcome, the GRADE summary is documented. The summary of findings tables is organized by outcome and where outcomes were not identical or not compatible across studies, no effect estimate could be determined and the evidence was consequently graded as insuff icient for concrete evidence statements. The table show s the presence and the absence of associations , and factors delaying as well as hastening progression have been considered .

Despite the extensive search, very few relevant studies were identified. In addition, only some of the studies addressed environmental exposures during military service. The remaining studies addressed other factors in samples of Veteran s. One of the studies ha s been presented in the context of diet risk factors (evidence table 4). The study evaluated MS in men on active duty in the US Army . It reported on the disease course for patients that were put on a specific diet in the hospital, compared to patients without administration of a specific therapy. 54 The reported data were not statistically significantly different between groups. However, no information was available o n the specific diet and approaches may have varied across patients and hospitals. A second study focused on disability and treatment patterns of MS patients in Veterans and non- veterans. The concurrent study reported that VHA Veterans had statistically si gnificantly higher PDDS scores than non- veterans.104 More information is presented in table 6, the evidence table summarizing \"other\" MS progression risk factors . Two additional studies reported on multiple risk factors of interest and are shown in more detail in evidence table 7. O ne study reported on a Gulf War -era MS coho rt which includes 2,631 patients.105 The study reported that deployment to a war theater, geographic location , and occupational status at entry to the military were not predictors of progression to DSS 6 and DSS 7. The s tudy was reported in a conference abstract and data on the exact point estimate and measure of dispersion were not available. The fourth study addressed vitamin D exposure and reported on the average fall/winter sun exposure before MS onset, cod liver oil intake as a child (ages 6 to 15), and fish consumption between the age of 6 and 15.63 The study reported on 219 Veterans with progres sive MS registered in the Multiple Sclerosis Surveillance Registry. The study used the PDDS to assess Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 66 progression and predicted hazard ratios for the time to reach a PDDS score of 8 from disease symptom onset. This stage indicates that a wheelchair or scooter is the main form of mobility. The study reported low average sun exposure in the fall/winter before disease onset was associated with an increased risk of progression (HR 2.13; CI 1.20, 3.78) and cod liver oil during childhood and adolescence was associated with a reduced risk (HR 0.44; CI 0.20, 0.96). Fish consumption was not statistically significantly associated with PDDS progression in this sample. The study concluded that ex posure to vitamin D before MS onset may slow disease -related neurodegeneration and thus delay progression to disability in patients with progressive MS. Summary of Findings and Quality of Evidence for Key Question 2 The summary of findings table showing KQ2 evidence is grouped by exposures prior to or post military service and exposures during military service. All studies relevant to KQ2 also contribute to KQ1 and were already included in KQ1 evidence statements. Table 9.

In addition, all a ssociations were based on only one study , and Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 67 without any replication in independent studies, the available evidence was graded as insufficient. Some of the factors shown in thi s summary of findings table were uniquely addressed in the KQ2 -relevant studies, such as deployment. Other investigated factors , such as sun exposure , have been addressed in other studies documented in the KQ1 evidence synthesis ; however, the exact operati onalization of the factors, for example sun exposure during childh ood and teenage years, also has not been replicated in other available studies by independent author groups. KEY QUESTION 3: Among identified risk factors for progression, what treatment/ris k factor modification therapies have been shown to delay or hasten the progression of MS once it has initiated? We identified a substantial number of intervention evaluations; however, they addressed only a small range of interventions. Despite the comprehensive search and inclusive inclusion criteria, all ident ified studies evaluated either v itamin D supplementation, exercise interventions, or dietary interventions. Details of included studies contributing to KQ3 are presented in 3 evidence tables in the following text . The largest group of interventions addressed physical exercise.

Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 73 The 18 studies tested a range of physical interventions, including aerobic exercise, resistance training , physiotherapy, or rehabilitation with maximal strength training. Settings were home - based or rehabilitation centers. The majority of studies compa red the program to no treatment; 3 studies compared to treatment as usual .29,66,81 Two studies assessed the comparative effectiveness of a robot -assisted intervention84,56 and one the effect of adding pressure splints to the training.19 The training duration ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Studies enrolled between 10 and 147 participants . The majority of included studies w as small and did not report a statistical power calculation. Four studies reported a power calculation but for a different outcome than MS progression or disability scores.32,81,83,109 Two studies reported that power was insufficient even for the primary outcome.66,84 Only one study took EDSS scores into account for the power calculation ; the study reported no changes in impairment o ccurred in either group after 3 -week inp atient physical therapy or exercise training at home.92 The identified studies were primarily in patients with mild MS who were ambulatory. However, 2 of the included studies w ere specifically designed to test the comparative effectiveness of robot -assisted gait training compared to conventional walking treatment or adding pressure splints to the training in patients with progressive MS ; EDSS scores improved in both intervention arms .19,84 All included studies reported on disability of MS measured by the primary outcome of this review - EDSS scores . However, in none of the studies was MS progression a primary outcome , and only selected studies reported EDSS assessments to be a secondary outcome42,74,75,83,84 to evaluate the intervention. Given the short duration of the intervention, many studies reported no substantial changes in EDSS levels after the intervention. Half the studies did not report on adverse events. Reported adverse events were relapses,26,81,83 breathlessness and fatigue,79 muscular pain,83 and unrelated illnesses.75 Two studies assessed adverse events and reported that none occurred.37,56 The risk of bias assessment for the identified studies is shown in Appendix C. Performance bias was a prominent source of bias in the identified interventions because blinding of participants and personnel was not possible given the nature of the intervention. In addition, only selected studies ensured that the outcome assessors were blind to the treatment condition. Two studies, Fimland et al and Petajan et al, had noticeable imbalanced samples at baseline, with intervention patients that had higher EDSS scores than the control group. 37,127 While the internal validity of included studies varied, several studies were not particularly suitable to assess the outcome of interest due to the short duration of the intervention. Only 11 out of 18 studies reported on an intervention with a duration of 2 months or more.29,32,34,42,66,74,75,79,81,83,109 The second group of inte rvention studies reporte d on dietary interventions.

Three studies evaluated the effects of advice for a diet of foods with \"Hot nature\" according to tradition al Chinese medicine, a very low -fat diet plus fish oil , and a low -fat plant -based diet.80,107,110 Studies compared interventions primarily to placebo. One study compared to patients assigned to waitlist (patients will receive the intervention eventually).110 Another compar ed to different, not very low -fat diet advice plus placebo instead of fish oil supplementation.107 All studies tested long -term interventions ; the duration ranged from 6 to 30 months. Studies enrolled between 31 and 312 patients. Studies either reported no power calculation to determine the sample size necessary to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups , or it was computed for a different outcome than MS progression or disability scores. One of the included studies tested the intervention specifically in chronic progressive non-relapsing MS ,24 while other studies used unrestricted MS samples or did not report on the form and stage. Several s tudies reported on EDSS result s but not all reported EDSS end point values to allow a comparison between intervention and control group s. Some studies only stated the statistical significance of the difference, reported the statistical significance of the difference between baseline and endpoint for each group , or reported no specific numbers . Four included studies were published before the development of the EDSS and reported on the number of patien ts who deteriorated.24,25,65,73 The adverse event assessment was sparse ; 5 included studies did not report on adverse event s at all, 3 reported adverse events but did not specify the treatment group patients were assigned to, and 2 gave no details on the experienced eve nts. Only 2 studies reported on adverse events by intervention group and reported that one or 2 patients withdrew from the study. The risk of bias assessment for the identified studies is shown in Appendix C. There was insufficient detail to assess the ris k of bias in a number of dietary intervention studies, in particular the studies that were published 40 years ago, presumably due to differences in reporting standards . 24,25,65,73 Compliance in diet advice studies was judged to be a source of other bias, given the long duration of the intervention that required the participants to adhere to a demanding dietary schedule. 80,107,110 Studies report ing on vitamin D supplementation are shown in the following, final evidence table . Studies exclusively gave dietary supplements to patients, rather than addressing more complex nutritional changes or dietary habits.

Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 82 We identified 6 RCTs addressing vitamin D supplementation. Studies provided patients with different doses, and some studies explicitly tested high - or low -dose supplementation. Most studies administered vitamin D as a capsule. O ne study provided intramuscular injections. One study provide d vitamin D and calcium.28 All but one study compared intervention effects to placebo ; 1 study provided the control group with a low -dose supplement.94 The duration of interventions ranged from 6 to 24 months. Samples were small and ranged from 23 to 68 randomized patients. One study88 reported a power calculat ion for EDSS score differences . Two studies reported a power calculation , but for a differen t outcome , and 3 reported no power calculation ; hence, it is unclear whether studies were adequately powered to detect a difference in MS progression. Only one study explicitly reported that the sample included 4 (out of 49) patients in secondary progressi on28 and patients with progressive MS were excluded in 3 of the identified studies. 67,88,94 All but one of the identified studies reported mean EDSS scores at the end of the trial for both experimental groups, some together with a statistical significance test for differences between groups. One study reported the proportion of patients completing the trial with increased EDSS , but none of the studies reported on the number of patients who entered progression, or reported on the time to progression. Adverse events were addressed in 4 out of 6 studies : one RCT reported no adverse event s; one reported nephrolithiasis but did not specify the group; and 2 studies reported on minor adverse events. The risk of bias assessment for the individual studies is shown in Appendix C. Studies gave supplements with matching placebos or injections with matching placebo injections, thereby reducing the risk of performance bias. Summary of Findings and Quality of Evidence for Key Question 3 Results for KQ3 studies (risk factor modification therapies) are grouped by identified intervention type : exercise, diverse dietary interventions, and vitamin D supplementation. Exercise Across all identified physical exercise intervention studies, 7 reported post -intervention EDSS score s for both treatment arms. The results are shown in the following forest p lot. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 83 Figure 4: Effect of E xercise Interventions on EDSS S cores None of the individual studies reported a statistically significant effect , and the pooled result also did not provide evidence of statistically significant improvements in EDSS scores for exercise relative to an untreated control several studies showed baseline imbalances , where intervention participants had higher EDSS scores than the control group. Using baseline -adjusted data for a sensitivity analysis , the result favored the exercise intervention -0.03; I2 0; 7 RCTs ). There was no indication of publication bias (r ank test p = 0.562, regression test p = 0.850 ). The quality of the evidence for the result o f no difference between exercise interventions and untreated control groups on EDSS scores was downgraded by 2 due to severe study limitations and by 1 due to conflicting results in a sensitivity analysis ( imprecision ). Our confidence in the evidence summary showing the absence of an effect is limited because m ost studies were not designed to assess EDSS changes, study sample sizes were very small which could only detect a large treatment effect, and there were baseline imbalances. T he intervention duration was not long-term but ranged between 4 weeks and 3 months, which may be too short to achieve , and to detect changes with standard diagnostic criteria. In addition, the difference between intervention and control groups was statistically significant w hen adjusting for baseline scores; hence an intervention effect in better -designed studies cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless , any treatment effect is likely to be very small; even adjusting for baseline imbalances, the estimate was an average of 0.20 points of improvement on the EDSS scale. None of the studies reported on other outcome measures such as the change from relapsing- remitting to secondary progressive MS. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 84 Dietary I nterventions Across studies, 4 dietary intervention studies reported on the number o f patients deteriorating and entering progression in each group. The figure shows that none of the included studies reported a statistically significant effect between fatty acid s supplementation compared to placebo . The intervention duration ranged from 18 to 24 months. Figure 5: Effect of Fatty Acid S upplementation Interventions on the Relative Risk of Progression The pooled relative risk of experiencing progression was not statistically significantly lower in intervention groups (RR 0.86; CI 0.67, 1.05; I2 0; 4 RCTs ). Of note, Bates et al (1977) exclusively addressed patients with chronic progression.24 A similar result was shown for differences in EDSS scores between treatment and control groups across 3 dietary intervention studies testing fatty acids supplementation or Hot nature diet advice. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 85 Figure 6: Effect of D ietary Interventions on ED SS Scores None of the individual interventions demonstrated a statistically significant effect on EDSS scores. Across studies, the difference in EDSS scores was not systematically different between intervention and control groups (SMD -0.13, - 83, 0.56; I2 5%; 3 RCTs ). One identified dietary intervention study reported a significant intervention effect, but this study could not be included in the meta -analysis. The study concluded that high -dose treatment of gamma -linolenic acid significantly reduced disability progressio n compared with placebo and low-dose treatment , but it did not report numerical data.44 The quality of evidence for the dietary intervention results showing the absence of an effect on MS progression (measured as the relative risk of progression [see figure 5] or based on EDSS scores [see figure 6]) were both downgraded to moderate due to study limitations . The early studies lack reporting detail while the more recently published studies were small and did not report statistical power calculations to determine whether studies were designed to detect an effect of the intervention on MS progression. We did not identify studies reporting on other MS progression outcomes such as the time to secondary progression. Vitamin D The 5 RCTs comparing vitamin D supplementation to placebo and reporting on the same outcome measure are shown in the figure. All reported on E DSS scores. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 86 Figure 7: Effect of V itamin D I nterventions on EDSS Scores None of the individual studies reported a statistically significant effect of the specific intervention under evaluation. While the pooled result indicated a positive trend, we also could not show a significant difference in EDSS scores between intervention and control group across all studies using standardized mean differences (SMD - 0.15; CI - 0.33, 0.02; I2 0; 5 RCTs). However, analyzing weighted mean differences to determine the clinical importance of the difference showed a statistically significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on EDSS scores (WMD -0.22; CI -0.39, - 0.05; I 2 0; 5 RCTs). The result indicates a difference in EDSS scores of 0.22 between intervention and control g roups. There was no evidence of publication bias for this result (rank test p = 0.82, regression test p = 0.99). The quality of evidence for a non- significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on EDSS scores was downgraded by 2 due to study limitations and by 1 due to imprecision . The included studies were small and the lack of reported power calculations makes it unclear whether the studies were sufficiently powered to be able to detect small treatment effects. The statistical significance is dependent o n the effect measure, showing that the effect estimate is not very robust. Studies on vitamin D did not report on other MS progression- relevant outcomes.

The study reported no significant changes in EDSS scores in the groups after baseline difference adjustment. Only f ew study details were available; the study was published as a conference abstract. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 88 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSI ON Our systematic review focused on modifiable risk factors, such as health behaviors o f patients with MS. We systematically searched for , documented , and synthesized studies available in the international literature on modifiable risk factors and the effect of modification therapies . The review addressed a broad and very complex research field and a large number of studies contributed to this review. Literature searches were comprehensive and exploratory in nature and were not limited to a narrow set of known risk factors. F ew prospective studies were identified to inform the association between modi fiable risk factors and MS progression, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing literature for KQ1 . Furthermore, w hile the review made every effort to locate studies relevant to KQ2 (exposure during military service) , only a very small number of studies was identified. Although a number of interventions have been tested in RCTs, many were not designed to assess the effect on MS progression, also limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the intervention literature addressed in KQ3 . We did not find variables that were identified as valid risk factor s of MS progression and that have been shown in intervention studies to improve MS progression . However, the review systematically explores and catalogues what is currently known in this research field , highlights promising areas, and identifies future research needs to address the progression of MS. SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE FOR KQ1: What modifiable epidemiologic factors are related to multiple sclerosis progression following diagnosis? Our li terature review identified a large number of modifiable epidemiologic factors that ha ve been assessed in the context of MS progression. However, study designs, operationalizations of risk factors, and outcome assessment measures varied widely. A substantia l amount of research has been dedicated to the role of vitamin D in MS progression . Our synthesis show s a weak but consistent negative correlation between 25(OH)D levels and EDSS scores across studies. Evidence comes primarily from concurrent studies which assess the physiological level and the disability status at the same time. Hence, this result should be interpreted as an association without causal interpretation. L ow vitamin D levels may be the cause, the effect, or a covariate of EDSS levels . In addit ion, w hether the physiological levels can be directly influenced by patients is an unresolved question. The association has also been shown in 2 prospective stud ies that report ed on this outcome and although there was some evidence of publication bias, an adjusted analysis found a very similar effect . We did not find studies reporting on other operationalizations of the role of vitamin D, such as sun exposure or use of supplements, that could be combined , and we did not find studies reporting on the effect of vitamin D on the change from relapsing -remitting to secondary progressive MS. The international literature has linked MS to vitamin D deficiency and suggests ad ditional functions outlining why high levels of vitamin D may be beneficial for MS patients (eg, anti -inflammatory aspects of vitamin D) .4,129 Smoking has also been addressed in a large number of studies and was associated with an increased risk of progression in MS patients. The association was shown in studies predicting time to EDSS scores of 6 (use of cane, crutch, or brace) as well as conversion to secondary Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 89 progression. Our confidence in the exact size of effect is somewhat limited due to unexplained heterogeneity (moderate quality of evidence). Our pooled estimate was statistically significa nt but lower than that reported by a 2011 meta -analysis . The earlier existing meta -analysis was based on fewer studies and did not find a statistically significant effect , and concluded at the time that smoking is important in determining MS susceptibility but the effect on the progression of disease is less certain.130 The now available literature suggests that smoking is an important modifiable risk fac tor for MS progression . This is of particular importance as it is a risk factor that can be directly influenced by MS patients. There is low quality of evidence that e pidural analgesics during childbirth are associated with EDSS scores. This outcome has be en addressed in retrospective as well as prospective studies but all existing studies report on disability levels across study samples, not direct measures of progression in individuals such as time to secondary progression. The risk factors sun exposure, month of birth, diet, fish consumption, alcohol -related predictors , exercise, oral con traception, and education have been addressed in more than one study and were documented in detail in the summary of findings section . It was not possible to de rive specific evidence statements due to the unique operationalization of risk factors and outcome measures ; however, in particular the role of sun exposure and alcohol- related variables should be investigated further. The evidence tables document a large rang e of potential risk factors such as : cesarean delivery ; breast feeding ; having been breast fed ; obstetrical and spinal anesthesia ; childhood maltreatment ; working outdoor s; individual health promoting lifestyle domains ; meditation practice ; insurance cover age; medical care satisfaction variables ; exposure to different types of animals ; coal heating ; wood heating ; humid living space; no sewage system ; no piped water ; type of environment ( eg, farm) ; specific diet factors such as coffee consumption, liver cons umption, vitamin supplementation, fortified foods, vegetarian diet ; cod liver oil intake ; occupational status ; deployment to a war theater ; being a Veteran ; and earthquake experience. These were addressed in single studies and have not been replicated in other studies . The review explored a large number of potential risk factors but shows that in many cases, the existing evidence base investigating an association is insufficient to make evidence statements for specific outcomes and results. This is illustrated by the following examples. Our systematic review showed that t he evidence for an association between progression of MS and dietary factors is sparse. We did not identify more than one study reporting on the same diet and reporting on th e same outcome measure. Similarly, a Cochrane review on dietary interventions in MS highlighted that a number of diets for MS ( eg, Swank Diet) have been proposed ; however , dietary habits in MS patients have not been extensively studied or reported.12 Furthermore, physical exercise has been addressed in a number of published studies, both as a correla te of disability and its predictive validity for MS progression. Study results varied by analytic design. Lower physical exercise can be the cause, the effect, or a covariate of higher EDSS scores. We did not identify more than one study reporting on the s ame risk factor operationalization and MS progression outcome measure. Hence , the existing evidence base is still very limited. Approaches to offer physical exercise to MS patients are traditionally based on optimizing daily functioning , but whether exerci se has a role in slowing progression of MS has also been raised as a research question. 131-133 Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 90 SUMMAR Y OF EVIDENCE KQ2: What environmental exposures prior to or during military service are related to multiple sclerosis progression following onset symptoms? Only very few studies were identified that reported on exposures prior to and during military servic es associated with MS progression (KQ2) in active military personnel or Veteran s. Evaluated risk factors in existing studies include only a small number of potentially relevant exposures such as deployment . The quality of the evidence across studies was d etermined to be insufficient for evidence statements . None of the studies employed a prospective study design and risk factors were addressed in single studies without replication in other studies. All potential risk factors were reported in only one included study without replication in another participant sample. Hence, the available evidence is not suitable to answer the review question . SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE KQ3: Among identified risk factors for progression, what treatment / risk factor modification therapies have been shown to delay or hasten the progression of MS once it has initiated? Our literature searches identified a substantial number of studies that have addressed modifiable risk factors ; however , all addressed exercise programs , dietary inte rventions, or vitamin D supplementation. Exercise interventions did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect on EDSS scores comparing intervention and untreated control groups across all studies reporting on this outcome . However, sensitivity an alyses indicated that , adjusting for baseline imbalances, small effect s on EDSS become apparent (0. 20 point difference between treatment groups). Studies were not designed to assess EDSS changes or other measures of progression , study sample sizes were ver y small with indications of baseline imbalances, and the interventions may have been too short to achieve and to detect changes with standard diagnostic criteria. The negative result s should not be interpreted as exercise not being beneficial in MS in general . Exercise in MS patients may have many positive effects132 and a recent systematic review134 addressing a range of outcomes concluded that exercise may be recommended for rehabilitation . Our review aimed to detect an effect for a very specific outcome - progression of MS. The identified data di d not indicate a statistically significant positive effect of dietary interventions that affected the progression of MS. This result mirrors the conclusion of an existing Cochrane review on dietary interventions for MS that included studies published to November 2011. 12 The review reported that polyunsaturated fatty acids seem to have no major effect on disease progression but cautioned also that evidence statements are limited due to uncertain quality of the studies. Individual studies and the pooled result showed a trend for an effect favoring vitamin D supplementation in MS patients but the statist ical significance depended on the effect measure. Our confidence in the evidence for the absence of an effect is limited given that the existing studies were small and they may lack statistical power to detect small treatment effects. A Cochrane review that searched for intervention studies in May 2010 identified only one study; all Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 91 additional studies shown in our meta -analysis were published after this date. The review concluded that the level of evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation does not allow confident decision -making about the use of vitamin D in MS.4 Any potential treatment effects are likely to be small, with an estimated difference of 0.22 points in EDSS scores between intervention and control groups. Finally, smoking, a risk factor for progression with a stronger evidence base, has not been addressed in RCTs to assess the effects of smoking cessation interventions on progression in MS patients. This is unfortunate because some risk factor studies suggested that negative consequences of smoking can b e reversed in ex -smokers, suggesting that this risk factor could be amenable to intervention. 46 LIMITATIONS It should be noted that t his review was restricted to patient -reported measures of MS progression and disability. O ther progression measures such as MRI results are also of interest to clinicians and can make additional contributions to this complex research field. Furthermore, d ue to resource constraints, thi s review was limited to English -language publications. Although we included several international studies, t he language restriction will have missed some studies, in particular older studies contributing to research on MS progression. This review identifie d a large number of studies contributing to the evidence base on modifiable risk factors associated with MS progression. However, the evidence base is limited due to the small number of prognostic studies and the small number of studies reporting on direct measures of progression (eg, conversion to secondary progressive MS) rather than proxies such as MS disability status. We converted statistics to the extent possible for this review . Nonetheless we were often not able to summarize results across studies d ue to lack of reporting of key variables , such as point estimates and measures of dispersion , in addition to the statistical significance of the presence or absence of associations. Due to the timeframe and lack of resources the review is entirely based on published literature and did not contact authors for missing information or additional data ; furthermore , several included studies have been published decades ago, making it unlikely that additional data is still available . Applicability of Findings to the VA Population We found no indication that risk factor results and treatment effects are not applicable to the VA population. However, the existing evidence does not permit a nalyses to test this hypothesis by identifying moderator effects linking study populations to differential effects. T here are very few risk factor or intervention studies rep orting specifically on VA samples. RESEARCH GAPS/ FUTURE RESEARCH Our systematic review showed that more prospective research studies are needed to allow predictions and meaningful interpretation of risk factor analyses . Furthermore, i t is imperative that r isk factor studies report more details (eg, mean EDSS scores and a measure of dispersion) , more measures of progression , and/or more analyses ( eg, reporting on EDSS scores means as well as time to progression to specific EDSS benchmarks) . While many individual studies do not Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 92 have sufficient statistical power to detect small effects of risk factors on progression, studies may contribute to future meta -analyses. We identified a number of areas with published research on a risk factor of interest, but due to t he unique operationalization of predictor and outcome measure, it was not possible to adequately synthesize results across studies. Although our review addressed a broad research field, there are other potential risk factors that were outside the scope of this review , such as comorbidities .11 There is a growing literature on MS comorbidities , including obesity and the associations of body weight and MS progression, which warrant s an in dividual systematic review .135,136 Future review s should in particular address the role of treatable comorbidities in MS progression. Scoping searches also identif ied a large literature base evaluating the effect of pregnancies. However, any association needs to be interpreted with caution. While the data may suggest a protective effect, reverse causality cannot be ruled out - a MS diagnosis and perceived progressio n may affect reproductive decision making.137 Furthermore, t his review did not target psychological variables , such as depression, anxiety, coping strategies, social functioning, distress, anger, and other emotions and cognitive styles , which may be reactions to MS progression and/or contributing factors to MS progression. Although variables have been assessed in the literature, very often, these have been studied as correlates of the disease, and while many studies have tried to predict psychological variables with MS progression, some have used the psychological variables as predictors for MS progression. These variables should be assessed in prospective risk factor studies to establish the temporal chain of events in order to establish a prognostic link between these variables and MS progression. However, even if a link can be established, it is a different matte r to show that the psychological variables can a) be modified and b) the modification has an effect on progression ; hence , intervention studies testing the modification therapy will be subsequently needed . Generally, more prospective risk factor studies ar e needed that allow determining a temporal sequence of events and that address the direction of associations. For example, a number of studies have reported on alcohol -related measures and show ed better outcomes associated with specific operationalizations of alcohol use or misuse , but t he available studies used primarily concurrent data (correlating current alcohol intake and current disability) and an alternative interpretation of this \"protective\" effect of alcohol is that more disabled people drink less alcohol because of their disability. Sun exposure should also be evaluated further in order to replicate identified associations of specific operationalizations of the predictor variable and MS disability and progression measures. Prospective studies are needed to provide more information on the role of sun exposure and alcohol consumption (and the optimum amount ) in MS progression . 11 Finally, intervention studies testing the effect of interventions on MS progression should determine the statistical power needed to detect a difference between treatment groups . This is in particular needed for vitamin D supplementation trials. In addition, more research on exercise interventions is warranted with studie s that are adequately powered and interventions of sufficient duration to potentially influence MS progression . Effects of smoking cessation interventions should be determined in intervention studies given the association between smoking and MS progression . Furthermore, while a substantial number of intervention studies exist that have reported on disease status and disability measures, larger studies reporting on direct progression measures are urgently needed. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 93 CONCLUSIONS A large number of studies is avai lable to contribute to the growing research literature on modifiable risk factors and MS progression but the research field is very complex. Risk factor studies used diverse operationalizations of risk factors and different outcome measures , and more pros pective studies are needed. Most consistent results were shown for the association between EDSS scores and vitamin D levels. Smoking was associated with a faster progression of MS in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Risk factors in Veterans and active milit ary personnel were one of the key questions for this review but very few studies are available to inform on this participant subgroup. We did not identify interventions that showed a statistically signifi cant effect of exercise, diet , or vitamin D supplem entation on EDSS scores across studies. However, studies were not designed to assess effects on MS progression. More research is needed , in particular, on interventions for smoking cessation, adequately powered vitamin D supplementation RCTs, and RCTs test ing the effects of long -term exercise interventions.

Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 126 APPENDIX C. CRITERIA USED IN QUA LITY ASSESSMENT This appendix documents the individual risk of bias criteria used to assess included studies. In addition, it documents the criteria used to rate the quality of evidence across studies. RISK OF BIAS ASSESSM ENT OF KQ1 AND KQ2 STUDIES A large number of diverse studies contributed to the review. We broadly categorized risk factor studies into concurrent, retrospective, and prospective studies. Concurrent and retrospective studies can provide only limited information on questions of progression, regardless of their methodological quality, and these studies were not further differentiated. The identified prospective studies r elevant to KQ1 and KQ2 were assessed with QUIPS (Q Uality In Prognosis Studies), a critical appraisal tool for prognostic studies . QUIPS assesses the domains study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and repor ting. 15 For each domain we determine d whether the study indicates high risk of bias, moderate risk of bias, or low risk of bias.

Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non -random approach, for example: Sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; Sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; Sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number ; Allocation by judgment of the clinician; Allocation by preference of the participant; Allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests; Allocation by availability of the intervention. Unclear: Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. Allocation concealment : Low risk: Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: Central allocation (including telephone, web -based and pharmacy -controlled randomization); Sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. High risk: Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: Using an open random allocation schedule ( eg, a list of random numbers); Assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards ( eg, if envelopes were unsealed or non -opaque or not sequentially numbered); Alternation or rotation; Date of birth; Case record number; Any other explicitly unconce aled procedure. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgment - for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed. Blinding of participants and personnel : Low risk: No blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. High risk: No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgmen t of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'; The study did not address this outcome. Blinding of outcome assessment : Low risk: No blinding of outcome assessment, but the review authors judge that the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blindin g; Blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. High risk: No blinding of outcome assessment, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'; The study did not address this outcome. Incomple te outcome data: Low risk: No missing outcome data; Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size; Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. High risk: Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 130 Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event ris k enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in ob served effect size; 'As -treated' analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization; Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation. Unclear: Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to , no reasons for missing data provided); The study did not address this outcome. Selective reporting : Low risk: The study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way; The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those tha t were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). High risk: Not all of the study's pre -specified primary outcomes have been reported; One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (eg, subscales) that were not pre-specified; One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre -specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta- analysis; The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'L ow risk' or 'High risk'. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category. Other bias: Low risk: The study appears to be free of other sources of bias. High risk: There is at least one important risk of bias. For example the study h ad a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or h ad some other problem. Unclear: There may be a risk of bias, but there is either: Insufficient information to assess whether an important r isk of bias exists; or i nsufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias. CRITERIA TO RATE THE BODY OF EVIDENCE FOR KQ1 AND KQ2 The GRADE framework for prognostic factor research18 differentiates 8 criteria that are used to evaluate the quality of the evidence across all identified studies: The phase of investigation differentiates whether the risk factor evidence is primari ly based on a study that aimed to identify potential prognostic factors (moderate quality) rather than based on studies aiming to confirm identified associations or explanatory research aiming to understand prognostic pathways (high quality). Study limita tions took the assessment frame into account by differentiating whether the risk factor status and the outcome variable were assessed at the same time (concurrent ly), retrospectively, or prospectively. Prospective studies were further differentiated by the risk of bias based on the QUIPS scores. Inconsistency assessed whether the identified association was consistently present across studies and across study designs ( eg, present in concurrent and prospective studies) . Indirectness took into account whether the available research studies do es not accurately reflect the review question . Examples are cases where the only available research studies reported on vitamin D status, rather than a directly patient -modifiable risk factor such as vitamin D intake. Evid ence w as downgraded for imprecision if the sample size wa s insufficient, the confidence interval was wide and overlap ped the value of no effect, there were less than 10 outcome events for each prognostic variable, or there were less than 100 cases reaching endpoints. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 131 Evidence w as downgraded for publication bias unless the value of the risk or protective factor in predicting the outcome has been repetitively investigated. Evidence for individual risk factors may be upgraded if e ffects are moderate or large or there is evidence of e xposure -gradient response for factors measured at different doses. CRITERIA TO RATE THE BODY OF EVIDENCE FOR KQ3 For KQ3 we took the criteria r isk of bias , inconsistency , indirectness , imprecision , publication bias, large effect , dose response , and all plausible residual confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect and/or would suggest a spurious effect if no effect was observed into account. The starting point was high evidence because the data are based on RCTs. Risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias can lower the quality . Large effect, d ose response, and a ll plausible residual confounding can upgrade the quality of the body of evidence. 17 Risk of bias evaluations were based on the above documented Cochrane Risk of Bias tool assessments. Inconsistency took the direction and the size of effects across studies into account. Indirectness may assess whether comparative effects are based on head -to-head trial evidence or was obtained from meta- regressions and subgroup analyses. Imprecision takes the confidence interval around the point estimate i nto account. Publication bias was assessed to determine whether there is evidence that pertinent studies, in this case negative effect studies are missing. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 132 APPENDIX D. PEER REVIEW COMMENTS/AUTHOR RESPONSES Comment Response Studies missing - Yes - Studies evaluating geography itself as a risk factor, studies prior to 1973, studies involving co- morbidity The identified studies on associations between geography and progression are shown in the \"other\" and the \"multiple\" risk factor section. Studies publ ished prior to 1973 were eligible for inclusion in the review and all databases were searched without date restriction. We have added the eligibility criteria after the description of the included studies in the result section to avoid ambiguity. In addition, we have emphasized that databases were searched from inception. Co-morbidities were outside the scope of this review but we have ex panded the future research section to indicate that sufficient literature exists for systematic reviews on several individual co- morbidities. It would have been useful to add obesity related studies in the review as it appears to be an important co- morbid condition and related information would have been of great research as well as clinical significance. See above. In particular there is a growing literature on weight and MS progression; we have expanded on this issue in the future research section. Several typographical errors are present in the draft, that I assume will be reviewed carefully towards the final dra ft. Typographical errors will be correct before publication Pg 1/Line 8: Traumatic brain injury is more common than MS in younger adults but is not progressive. I'd reword this sentence as follows: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common progressive disease of the central nervous system in young adults and the cause of serious physical disability in adults of working age. Revised as suggested Pg 1/Line 21: Use \"MS\" throughout the manuscript after it's defined. We have revised the text accordingly bu t left the key questions as is to avoid ambiguity Pg 1/Line 49: Is this a preliminary report vs. final? The draft report is subjected to peer review Pg 3/Line 16: \"Concurrent\" is not commonly used and is confusing. It should be replaced with retrospectiv e. To address this point, we have added a definition to avoid confusion (measuring the exposure status and the outcome at the same time point, eg, current alcohol intake) Pg 5/Line 5: Change \"Out\" to Our. Changed Pg 5/Line 25: There are several redunda nt and inaccurate statements in the conclusion. The association between MS progression and vitamin D supplementation is not significant but the conclusions imply it is related. The conclusion should be modified to something like the following: Our systema t ic review documents the available evidence on modifiable risk factors for MS progression. Associations with MS progression are strongest for smoking. None of the intervention studies examining exercise, dietary, and vitamin D supplementation reported a statistically significant effect on MS disability. Other than smoking cessation, there are no other modifiable risk factors that can be given support from this review as an intervention worthy of slowing MS progression. To address the perceived redundancy w e have divided the conclusions into multiple paragraphs: one characterizes the overall evidence base, one summarizes the risk factor studies, one summarizes the intervention RCTs, and the last one describes the evidence for factors that were addressed in both, risk factor and in intervention studies. The correlation between EDSS scores and vitamin D level was statistically significant. We have revised the sentence to avoid the perceived inaccuracy. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 133 Pg 8/Line 3: There are several reviews of MS risk factors published in the literature. Some are comprehensive in scope. The statement below is confusing in implying there are multiple reviews of risk factors translated into treatment options. Is this referring to dietary or exercise treatments? There is an emerging body of research that evaluates risk factors translated into tr eatment options but no systematic review has to date comprehensively synthesized the available evidence. We have deleted the sentence Pg 18/Line 8: Why was 1973 used as the starting y ear (vs. 1970)? See above Pg 51/Line 5: There is no figure in the box. Unfortunately the conversion to PDF in the online editorial manager system did not display the figure; this will be corrected in the final report. Forest plots: There is no confide nce interval represented on the summary measure of risk in the diagram. This should be included. We were not sure how this perception came about, confidence intervals are shown for individual studies and the pooled effect in all forest plots Please see ed itorial suggestions and comments in the uploaded document. Thank you for your careful review; we have accepted all editorial changes p. 10: So if I understand correctly, a study on solely Relapsing Remitting MS (RR MS), the most common disease type, would have been excluded - even though patients with RR MS often progress over time? We have revised the sentence to avoid confusion p. 24: Sentence is unclear. Which of the studies does this phrase refer to? Author name added to avoid ambiguity p. 50: awkward wording Revised to clarify that the individually assessed risk factors as well as predicted outcomes were very specific p. 51: Figure missing from draft See above p. 51: I assume you mean since the Vit D values were dichotomized, rather than reported as a continuous variable? The statement is unclear as written, since the study did in fact use the EDSS. The studies did not report on a correlation, hence they could not be added to the meta-analysis; we have clarified this in the text p. 52: G raphs have a diagonal line, which should be deleted. Formatting changes are due to converting to PDF and will be corrected in the final report p. 54: Which - any alcohol consumption, or heavy drinking, or both? Clarified p. 56: Explain the \"downgrades\" ( or refer to the text in the legend) Added p. 69: Unclear in this context We have added more explanation regarding the waitlist condition p. 78: Would this be better expressed as \"pregnancy\" rather than \"children\"? See above p. 82: Unclear. Do you mean \"for which the published evidence demonstrates their amenability...\". Need a clear statement to conclude the review! We have revised the draft conclusions Did any study examine the impact of moving to a different region/climate/latitude during childhood or early adulthood? We did not identify such a study I have a general concern that there may be confusion in discussion of studies between change from Relapsing-Remitting MS (RR MS) to Secondary Progressive MS (SP MS), and progression of disability caused by MS, which can occur both in RR MS and SP MS. Yes, several studies did not restrict to RR MS and studies used a variety of outcome measures. To address this concern, we have highlighted those studies in the summary of findings section that specifically reported on the change from RR to SP MS and those t hat only included patients with RR MS at baseline Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 134 Was the post -partum period also analyzed separate from pregnancy itself? It is commonly held that MS is likely to be quiescent during pregnancy, but the risk for relapses or progression is increased from baseline during the immediate post -partum interval. Given the complexity of the topic and the diversity across the large number of studies that should be addressed in a separate systematic review we have added this topic to the list of suggested future research studies. Page 5, line 5: Change \"Out\" to \"Our\" See above Page 7, line 16: Change \"described\" to \"characterized pathologically\" and add \"focal areas of\" before \"inflammation...\" Changed as suggested Page 7, lines 35 to 37: Change \"Progressive relapsing MS\" to \"Active progressive MS\" The classification system for MS subtypes was revised in 2014 to remove the classification of \"progressive relapsing\" and replace it with the classification of \"active progressive\" This is given in Reference 8. Changed as suggested Page 10, line 60: Azathioprine is listed as a medication specifically designed for MS, which . Azathioprine was originally developed as an antineoplastic agent it is now used for immunosuppression in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. Other drugs in this class that were omitted from the list include methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. Cladribine, listed later, probably belongs in the same list. We have removed the specific examples and reduced the text to one example per medication type to address this point Page 13, line 54: Move \"presented\" to after \"statistics\" We have revised the sen tence Page 15, line 14: After \"East\" add \", Professor, Departments of Neurology, Pharmacology and Physical Therapy, University of Maryland School of Medicine\" Added Page 15, line 14: After \"MPH\" add \", Director, MS Center of Excellence - West\" Added Page 15, line 26: Change,\"PHD\" to \"PhD\" Changed Tables 1 to 7: I may not be reading the tables correctly but I did not see a column indicating the rating of the quality of the evidence in each study. I believe that Appendix C deals with that issue in detail but should some summary indication be included on these tables? The studies were assessed with a number of individual risk of bias criteria which exceeded the available space in the evidence tables. To address this point we have systematically added information on the risk of bias to the result sections following the evidence tables Tables 1 to 7, case definition: I may not be understanding what is being reported here. I am used to this column being used to report whether an acceptable case definition was used by the study in question. In most cases this would involve a diagnosis of MS based on published criteria such as the Poser, McDonald or modified McDonald criteria. Cases might be further restricted based on disability range using a scale like the EDSS score. The entries in this column don't seem to fit this so I am unclear on what is being displayed here. I am also not clear on whether publications were reviewed to ensure that accepted case definitions were used. We have revised the term to \"predicted variable\" to avoid confusion with MS diagnostic criteria. In addition, we have added the diagnostic criteria for prospective studies to the evidence tables. "}
