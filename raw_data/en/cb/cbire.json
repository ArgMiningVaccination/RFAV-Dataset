A: Yes, definitely. Herbs are hardy and versatile, able to grow nearly anywhere with a little bit of care. You can grow herbs in plastic or clay pots, planter boxes, fabric pots and just about any container as long as it has drainage holes at the bottom. Q: What are some beginner-friendly herbs I can grow? A: Herb plants are fairly easy to grow, especially when compared with growing herbs from seed. However, some herbs are even more beginner-friendly than others. If you're a novice at gardening, you can try planting the following: * [Mint:](https://thegrowers-exchange.com/collections/mint-plants) Keep in mind that mint can spread quickly throughout a garden. Some gardeners control the growth of this herb by planting them in containers. * [Thyme:](https://thegrowers-exchange.com/collections/thyme-plants) This herb is hardy and drought-tolerant, growing well even with minimal care. * [Basil:](https://thegrowers-exchange.com/products/basil-genovese) This plant grows quickly, so you can harvest its leaves soon after planting. It loves full sun and well-drained soil. Q: Can I plant different kinds of herbs together? A: Yes. Many herbs thrive even when they're planted in the same container or garden bed as other herbs. The practice of planting various types of herbs together is called \"companion planting.\" For best results, choosing herb varieties with similar needs regarding sunlight, water and soil conditions is essential. The following are some examples of herbs that you can safely plant together. *Mediterranean Herbs: Some examples are sage, rosemary, lavender, marjoram, thyme and oregano. These herbs prefer arid soil and flourish in the sun. *Moisture-loving Herbs: These include basil, parsley and lemon balm. These plants do best in slightly moist, not soaked, soil. *Lemon-scented Herbs: Herbs like lemon verbena, lemon balm and lemon thyme typically require full or partial shade, moderate watering and well-draining soil. An added plus of planting these together is the refreshing fragrance they produce. Q: Can herbs be grown indoors? A: Yes. Starting an indoor herb garden is a great way to access fresh herbs year-round, even in cold climates. All you need are a sunny spot for your herbs, soil with good drainage and enough water to keep the soil moist but not soaked. All of our plants are GMO-free, naturally grown herb plants!
