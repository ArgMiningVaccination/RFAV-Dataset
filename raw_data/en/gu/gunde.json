HOSPITAL INTRODUCTION | PAGE 1 Introduction to Community Health Needs Assessments GENERAL The Affordable Care Act establishes specific statutory requirem ents that hospitals must meet to qualify as organization described in Sectio n 501(c)(3) of the Internal Rev enue Code and allow them to be exempt from federal income tax. As part of the new IRS requirements, hospit als must conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to serve as an essential tool for developing a health improvement plan for the community the hospital serves. The CHNA poises hospitals as lea ders who have identified the health needs of their communities and are working towards solutions to meet those needs. The statutory requirements specified in the Affordable Care Act state: Each hospital facility must conduct a CHNA at least once every three tax years and adopt an implementation strategy to meet the community health needs iden tified through the assessment The CHNA must take into account input from persons who represen t the broad interests of the community serviced by the hospita l facility; including those wi th special knowledge of or expertise in public health Must be made widely available to the public Each hospital must disclose in Form 990 how it is addressing all of the needs identified in the assessment and if not, why not A CHNA serves as a systematic approach to collecting, analyzing and utilizing data to i dentify priority areas for improving health. Hospitals use this report as a call to action, engaging community members through public awareness messages, creating effective programs and policies and collabora ting with other organizations to bring positive change to their community. The long-term goal of a CHNA is to identify health priorities and develop impact strategies with all health -related stakeholders in the community. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS This CNHA is the continuation of Central Florida Health's dedic ation to community health assessment work. Central Florida Health (formerly known as Central Florida Healt h Alliance) is a not-for-profit family of hospitals including Leesburg Reg ional Medical Center and The Vi llages Regional Hospital. A separate CHNA was completed for each hospital. Central Florida Health engaged t he services of WellFlorida Coun cil to complete the 2019 CHNA for The Villages Regional Hospital and L eesburg Regional Medical Center . This report serves as the CHNA for The Villages Regional Hospital Service Area. WellFlorida Council is the statutorily designated (F.S. 408.033) local health council that serves north central Florida, including the Central Florida Health service areas of Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties along with thirteen other counties. The mission of WellFlorida Council is to forge partnerships in planning, research and service that build healthier communities. WellFlorida achieves this mission by providing communi ties the insights, tools, and services necessary to identify their most THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL INTRODUCTION | PAGE 2 pressing issues (e.g., community h ealth assessments and communi ty health improvement plans) and to design and implement approaches to overcoming those issues. The Central Florida Health St eering Committee and WellFlorida b ased the 2019 CHNA effort on a nationally recognized model and best practice for completing community hea lth assessments and improvement plans called Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP). The MAPP tool was developed by the National Association of Coun ty and City Health Officials (N ACCHO) in cooperation with the Public Health Practice Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion (CDC). NACCHO and CDC's vision for implementing MAPP is: \"Communities achieving improved health and quality of life by mobilizing partnerships and taking strategic action.\" At the heart of the MAPP process are the four core MAPP assessm ents. These are: Community Health Status Assessment Community Themes and Strengths Assessment Forces of Change Assessment Local Public Health System Assessment (LPHSA)* These four MAPP assessments work in concert to identify common themes and considerations in order to hone in on key community health needs. Three of the four MAPP a ssessments are integrated into the 2019 CHNA. Please note, this document is a health needs assessment a nd its purpose is to uncover or substantiate the health needs and health issues in the service area. Establ ishing priority goals and objectives and creating an action or implementation plan are part of the MAPP process referred to as the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). The CHIP process and The Villages Regional Hosp ital's (TVRH) implementation strategy are desc ribed in the companion document . *The Local Public Health System Assessment was omitted from thi s process given that it is typically completed and facilitated by the local health department. The L PHSA measures how we ll the local public health system (county-level) del ivers the 10 Essential Public Health Services. Each county health department should complete t he LPHSA every five years. The Villages Regional Hospital C ommunity Health Needs Assessment Report 2019 serves as the follow-up to the CHNA report completed in 2016. TVRH Service Area includes t wo zip codes from Lake County, two zip codes from Marion County and three zip codes from Sumter County . The Lake County zip codes are 32159 Lady Lake and 34748 Leesburg. Mari on County zip codes include 3 4491 Summerfield, and 34420 Belleview. The three Sumter County zip codes are 32162 The Villages, 32163 The Villages, and 34785 Wildwood. The zip code areas chosen were based on the top 75 percent of disch arges from the TVRH du ring the 2017 fiscal year. The Villages Regional Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report 2019, the 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix, and The Villages Regional Hospital Implementation Strategy 2019 represent the culmination of a six-month process that began in December 2018 and concluded in May 2019. THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL INTRODUCTION | PAGE 3 ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT REPORT The Villages Regional Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report 2019 is comprised of the following main sections: Introduction to Community Health Needs Assessments: This sectio n includes an overview of the CHNA process; description o f the organization of the CHNA report; in sights on using the CHNA; and a brief synopsis of the common themes and considerations identified in the needs assessment. Community Health Status: Detailed in this section are demographic and socioeconomic factors, and mortality and morbidity indicato rs that describe the overall he alth status of The Villages Regional Hospital Service Area as compared to Florida. Community Themes and Strengths: This section provides qualitati ve perspectives on health issues and the health system from the community at-large and fulfills the statutory requirement of taking into account input from persons repres enting the broad interests of the community serviced by the hospital facility. This section also fulf ills the CHNA requirement of re ceiving community input on the health needs of the community. The Commu nity Themes and Strengths sect ion is comprised of key insights and themes from the community survey, healthcare professional s urvey and focus groups. Forces of Change: This section provides qualitative perspective s on trends, factors or events that are or will be influencing the health an d quality of life in the commu nity and the work of the community to improve health outcomes. Recommendations and Next Steps: T his section begins with a brie f summary of the in tersecting themes that cut across all sections of the CHNA and some of the key co nsiderations gener ated from these common themes. Following the summa ry of these themes and consid erations, this section details some general suggestions on how to move forward with the identified needs, provides some specific examples of approaches to address these needs, and discusses some commun ity organizations principles that will need to be addressed to ensure t hat true community health impro vement is realized. USING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT The Villages Regional Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report 2019 is designed so that the three major sections, the Community Health Status, Community Themes and Strengths, and Forces of Change, address the three core MAPP asse ssments that are designated as key components of a comprehensive community health needs assessment as designed by NACCHO and CDC . The identification of broad health needs of the community comes fro m an analysis of the intersecti ng themes in each of these sections. Overall, the main objectives of this CHNA are the following: To accurately depict The Villages Regional Hospital Service Are a's key health issues based on common themes that emerge from th e three MAPP assessments; To identify potential strategic issues and some possible approa ches to addressing those issues; To provide insight and input to the next phase of the community health improvement planning process and implementation strategies; THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL INTRODUCTION | PAGE 4 To provide the community a rich data resource not only for the next phase of the improvement process, but also for ongoing resource and program development and imple mentation as well as evaluation of community health improvement. While The Villages Regional Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report 2019 is a stand-alone document, the report works in concert with the accompanying 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix (also referred to in this document as the Technical Appendix). The Villages Regional Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report 2019 presents data and issues at a more global level for the community. All of the data are also included, often in more granular level detail, in the Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix 2019 . Thus, for most data that are briefly addressed in this report, the Central Florida Hea lth Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix 2019 presents these data at a level of detail breaking data sets do wn, for example, by zip code, race, ethnicity, gender, where appropriate and when avail able. The 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix is an invaluable companion resource to The Villages Regional Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report 2019 , and it will allow th e community to delve deeper into the issues identifie d for a more comprehensive unde rstanding of the scope, prevalence and populations impacted. The 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix is comprised of more than 160 tables, 19 graphs, and suppor ting material across nearly 400 pages. The 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Asse ssment Technical Appendix is organized into the following major data sections: Demographics and Socioeconomics Mortality Mental Health Maternal and Infant Health Health Behaviors Infectious Diseases Health Care Access and Utilization State of Florida Health Improv ement Plan Priority Issues Technical Notes Please note that many of the dat a tables in this report and in the 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix contain standardized rates for the purpose of comparing Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties and to the state of Florida as a who le. It is advisable to interpret these rates with caution when incidence and prevalence rates are low; thus small variations from year to year can result in substantial shifts in the standardized rates. THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL INTRODUCTION | PAGE 5 KEY OBSERVATIONS Presented below are the intersec ting themes which, in essence, comprise an overview of the major health needs and issues that emerged ov er the course of this community health needs assessment in TVRH and Central Florida Health (CFH) Ser vice Areas. These themes, needs and issues are addressed further in the Recommendations and Next Steps section of this CHNA report. Th at section includes an enumeration of potential strategic areas of oppo rtunity as well as a compilati on of evidence-based and promising practice resources for consideration in the creation of the implementati on strategy and action plan to address the identified priority issues.

The data in this section and in the 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix were compiled and tabulated from multiple sources including, but not limited to, the United States Cen sus Bureau; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS); the Florida Department of Health's Office of Vital Statistics; the Florida Agency for Health Care A dministration (ACHA); the Unive rsity of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Jo hnson Foundation. Data were als o obtained from The Villages Regional Hospital (TVRH). Many of the data tables in this section and in the 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix contain standardized rates for the purpose of comparing the TVR H Service Area to Florida as a whole. It is advisable to interpret these rates with caution when incidence and prevalence rates are low (i.e., the number of cases is small); thus, small variations from year to year can result in substantial shifts in the standardized rates. The data presented in this summ ary include references to specific tables in the Techni cal Appendix so that users can refer to the numbers and the rates in context. DEMOGRAPHICS AND SOCIOECONOMICS As population dynamics, or varia tions in the overall compositio n of a population, change over time, so do the health and healthcare needs of communities. Therefore, it is important to review specific indicators, including demographic and socioe conomic factors, to understand a community's current health status, pressing healthcare issues, and disparities. The following sect ion provides a summary of population distribution including age, gend er, and race and ethnicity, and estimates related to the future growth of the population. Also included, are m easures of education, poverty s tatus, employment, and income. Noted below are key findings from The Villages Regional Hospital (TVRH) Ser vice Area demographic and socioeconomic profile. POPULATION Population growth is a key determinant of the healthcare servic es a community requires to be able to sustain positive health behaviors and improved health outcomes. TVRH Service Area primarily serves an adult population greater than 55 years of age at 68.5 percent o f the population, compar ed to 60.1 percent of the Central Florida Health (CFH) Service Area and 32.5 percent of Florida (Table 25). TVRH Service Area also serves a smaller percentage of children aged 0-17 years at 8.8 percent compared to the CFH Service Area at 11.7 percent and Florid a at 20.3 percent (Table 22).

As seen in Figure 2 below, the overwhelming majority of TVRH Se rvice Area population is White at 88.7 percent, which is nearly the sam e as the CFH Service Area at 87 .7 percent but higher than Florida at 75.7 percent White (Table 27). The Bl ack, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Asian populations comprise 7.5, 0.4, and 1.2 percent of TVRH Service Area, respectively, while 0.8 percent identify themselves as another race and 1.4 percent identify as having two or more races (Tabl e 22). By 2013-2017 American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau estimates (ACS), 93.5 percent of the population in TVRH Service Area identified as non-Hispanic or Latino which is comparable to the 92.4 perce nt in the CFH Service Area and 92.7 percent in LRMC Service Area, but notabl y larger than in Florida as a w hole at 75.3 percent FLORIDA HEALTH SA FloridaTHE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 8 FIGURE 2.

LIFE EXPECTANCY Considering all races and ethnic ities, the longest life expecta ncy for males in 2010 was found in Sumter County (78.3 years) followed by L ake County (75.8 years), and M arion County (74.3 ye ars), compared to Florida (76.3 years; Table 4). For females, the longest life ex pectancy for females in 2010 was also in Sumter County (82.5 years), followed by Lake County (81.3 years), and Marion County (80.3 years), compared to Florida (81.6 years). Table 1 bel ow displays life expectancy da ta for Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties compared to Florida; please note that numbers displayed in red indicate where life expectancy fell below the state life expectancy projection . As often seen throughout the state of Florida, there was a disparity in life expectancy in the Black population as compared to the White pop ulation in TVRH Service Area counties.

ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS At 10.6 percent of the population, TVRH Service Area had a lowe r percentage of individuals having lived in the poverty in the past 12 months when compared to Florida at 1 5.5 percent according to 2013-2017 ACS data. The CFH and LRMC Service Areas were similar at 12.2 and 1 2.1 percent, respectively, (Table 37). Within TVRH Service Area, the zi p codes where this indicator of poverty are highest include Leesburg (34748) at 15.8 percent, Belleview (34420) at 14.0 percent and Summerfield (34491) at 11.5 percent while The Villages (32162) was at only 5.4 percent (Table 37). Across the three counties in TVRH Service Area for this same period, Marion County h ad the highest percentage of i ndividuals having lived in poverty in the past 12 months (17.6 percent) whi ch is higher than the state of Florida (15.5 percent). Lake County, at 12.8 percent and Sumter County at 9.2 percent were both lower than f or Florida (Table 37). Gender differences can be seen i n rates of poverty. For 2013-20 17, the percentage of males having lived in poverty in the past 12 months in TVRH Service Area at 8.6 perce nt was close to the overall CFH Service Area rate of 9.8 percent but lower th an the LRMC Service Area at 9.8 percent. All were below the 12.3 percent state rate for Florida. The rate of 11.5 percent of females hav ing lived in poverty in TVRH Service Area in the past 12 months was lower than the CFH and LRMC Service Areas at 13.1 and 13.0 percent, respectively. Although these rates for females were lower than the state rate of 16.5 percent, the rates were higher than for males in the same geographic areas. When compared by servic e area county, both Marion County males at 13.9 percent and females at 18.4 percent had the highest rat es for this poverty measure with both rates THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 10 exceeding state rates (12.3 and 16.5 percent, respectively). Sumter County males and females had the lowest rates at 7.2 and 10.2 percent, r espectively. Lake County rates were lower than state rates but higher than the CFH Service Area rate (Table 41). Poverty rates for children (0-17 years of age) exceeded state r ates in TVRH Service Area. Data show that from 2013-2017 in TVRH Service Ar ea 27.6 percent of children li ved in poverty in the past 12 months compared to 26.6 percent in the C FH Service Area and 22.3 perce nt statewide. For adults 18-74 years of age poverty rates were lower in TVRH Service Area at 9.8 percent co mpared to 11.1 percent for the CFH Service Area and 14.0 percent for Florida. The percentage of older adul ts (75 years of age and older) having lived in poverty in the past 12 months was lower in TVRH Service Area at 6.4 percent than the CFH Service Area at 7.4 percent and state rate of 11. 0 percent (Table 38). As seen in Figure 3, the greatest numbers of children living in poverty were in Sumter County and Marion County at 31 .4 and 29.4 percent, respectively, compared to Lake County at 21.4 percent and Florida at 23.6 percent (Tab le 39). There was a smaller percentage of elderly (65 -74 years of age) li ving in poverty across Lake, Ma rion, and Sumter Count y (6.6, 7.8, and 3.9 percent, respectively) compared to Florida (9.6 percent, Table 40).

Stark differences in poverty rates for Whites and Blacks were seen in the CFH Service Area counties. A s seen in the table that follows, the percentage of the Black population in Marion County at 30.5 percent and in Sumter County at 26.3 percent having lived in poverty in the p ast 12 months exceeded the stat e rate of 24.8 percent. The poverty rate for Whites in Marion County at 15.5 percent also exceeded the state rate for Whites of 13.3 percent (Table 42). TABLE 2.

THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 12 EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT According to ACS estimates for 2013-2017, those in TVRH Service Area 25 years of age and older whose highest level of education completed was a high school diploma (including equivalency diplomas and some college but no degree) for all genders was 55.2 percent; the co mparable state rate was 49.4 percent. Those with a college degree (including Associate's, Bachelor's, Maste r's, professional and doctorate degrees) for TVRH Service Area represented 36. 4 percent of the population co mpared to 38.2 percent for Florida (Table 59). For the 2017-2018 school year, of TVRH Service Area counti es Sumter County achieved the best high school graduation rate at 87.8 percent which exceeded the 86.1 state rate and outpaced Lake County at 84.1 percent and Marion County at 81. 8 percent. Sumter County also recorded the lowest high school dropout rate for the service area for 2017-2018 at 3.6 percent, perform ing better than the state at 4.0 percent, and Lake and Marion Counties at 6.1 and 6.3 percent, respectively (Table 58). MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY The rates of mortality and morbidity are often referred to as t he most direct measures of health and well- being of a community. To gain a better understanding of the current health status of TVRH Service Area population, the prevalence of diseases and quality of life were thoroughly examined. Below are some important data points related to the rates of mortality and mor bidity in TVRH Service Area. CAUSES OF DEATH The top five leading causes of d eath in TVRH Service Area for a ll races in 2015-2017 were Cancer, Heart Disease, Unintentional Injuries, Chronic Lower Respiratory Dise ase (CLRD) and Stroke. For the CFH Service Area and the state of Florida the five leading causes of death were the same as for TVRH Service Area with a slight difference in rank order. Heart Disease was the leading cause of death for the CFH Service Area and Florida while Cancer was at the top of the list for TVRH and LR MC Service Areas (Tables 68, 73-78). As can be seen in the table below, age-a djusted death rates for the top five causes of death in TVRH, LRMC and CFH Service Areas were similar whereas vast differences were eviden t when compared to Florida rates.

Geographic disparities were found in the 2015-2017 TVRH Service Area age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 population for some leading causes of death. Belleview (34420 zip code) had the highest age- adjusted death rate for Cancer at 208.7 and highest rate for He art Disease at 233.4 (Tables 73, 74). For Unintentional Injury deaths, ag ain Belleview at 125.2 per 100,0 00 population recorded the highest rate in the service area at more than twice the state rate of 53.2 (Tab le 75). Examination of age-adjusted death rates for leading causes of d eath in TVRH Service Area counties revealed some notable racial and ethnic d isparities. Blacks in Sumter C ounty had an age-adjusted death rate from Heart Disease (245.0) higher than any other racial or ethnic gr oup in the service area and higher than the rate for Florida Blacks (169.0). Whites in Marion County had e xponentially higher age-adjusted death rates from Heart Disease when compared to other racial and ethnic groups and counties in the service area. Across Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties, White age-adjusted dea th rates were higher from Cancer, Unintentional Injury and CLRD (Table 70, 71).

BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS The presence of wise health beha viors and the absence of negati ve health decisions ar e the cornerstones of a healthy community. Towards this end, national and state gover nments have invested substantial resources to understand the health behavio rs of residents. This Behaviora l Risk Factors section details data on selected health behavi ors. These data are collected annually at the national and state levels and in Florida at the county level every three years by telephone survey as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) . Because BRFSS data are not available at the zip code level, data for select indicators are presented at the county level for La ke, Marion and Sumter Counties to illustrate health be haviors in TVRH Service Area. Categories of health behaviors are presented in alphabetical order below. The BRFSS data are provided in the ir entirety in Table 126 of the 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix.

The percentage of women 18 years of age and older w ho received a Pap test in the past year was 40.9 percent in Lake County, 47.1 percent in Marion County, and 37.3 percent in Sumter Count y; the state rate was 48.4 percent. Similarly, a lower percentage of women aged 21 to 65 had a Pap test in the past three years in Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties at 73.5, 76.9 and 74.0 percent, respectively, c ompared to 78.8 percent for the state. Fewer women in the LRMC Service Area r eported having received a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) test in the past five years. At 18.1 percent, the Sumter County rate is half the state rate of 36.7 percent while Lake County women at 32.8 percent and Marion County women at 26.2 percent a lso fall short. Prostate-specific Antigen Test (PSA) testing rates among men ag ed 50 and older were higher across TVRH Service Area counties. In Sumter County 77.6 percent of men rep orted having had a PSA test in the past two years compared to 54.9 percent st atewide and 55.5 percent in La ke County and 59.1 percent in Marion County. The percentage of men ag ed 50 years and older who had e ver had a PSA test in the all three of the service area counties exceeded t he 67.5 state rate. Sumter County men had the highest rate at 90.5 percent, followed by Marion County at 72.3 percent and Lake County at 70 .3 percent (Table 126). Adults over the age of 50 years in TVRH Service Area reported h igher rates for colorectal cancer screening. At 44.5, 41.4, and 47.4 percent Lake, Marion and Sumter County adults, respectively, had higher rates of blood stool testing than the 36.0 percent state rate. Likewise, adults aged 50 and older in Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties had higher than state rates for ever having had a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy at 71.9, 71.9, and 85.5 percent, respectiv ely, compared to 69.2 percent for Florida (Table 126). CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE In 2016, adults in TVRH Service Ar ea reported higher than state rates of cardiovascular problems. While 3.5 percent of adults statewide and in Sumter County reported ever having had a stroke, 5.0 percent of Lake County and 4.6 percent of Marion County adults had had a stroke . Among Sumter County adults, 18.0 percent reported ever having had a heart attack, angina or coro nary heart disease or stroke, which is significantly higher than the state rate of 9.8 percent. At 13.3 percent Lake County adults and at 14.0 percent Marion County adults also exceed the state rate. When having ha d a heart attack was reported alone, the Sumter County rate of 10.1 percen t was almost twice the state's rate of 5.2 percent. Again, Lake County and Marion County rates at 8.0 and 8.6 percent were also higher tha n the state rate (Table 126). DIABETES In 2016, the percentage of adults who reported having diagnosed diabetes in Lake County was 12.5 percent, 16.6 percent in Marion County, and 16.4 percent in Sumter Count y. All rates exceeded the 11.8 percent state rate with differences of 5.9 percent, 40.7 percent, and 39.0 percent for Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties, respectively. Adults in TVRH Service Area counties reported hav ing pre-diabetes at higher percentages than the 9.4 percent state rate. The percentage of adults with pre-d iabetes in Lake County was 12.1 percent, 10.2 percent in Marion County, and 13. 3 percent in Sumter County (Table 126). THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 16 HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE As would be expected with the population demographics in TVRH Service Area, in 2016 the percentage of adults who had Medicare exceeded the 37.9 percent state rate in all three service area counties. Sumter County reported the highest percentage of Medicare recipients at 76.5 percent which is twice the state rate. About 47.5 percent of Lake County adults and 51.3 percent of Ma rion County adults reported having Medicare. Relatedly, the percentage of adults who reported havi ng any type of health insurance coverage in the three service area counties was similar or exceeded the state rate. Cost was reported as barrier to seeing a doctor in the past year by 17.1 percent of Lake County adults and 19.2 percent of M arion County adults which was somewhat higher than the state rate at 16.6 percent. Higher percentages of Lake, Marion and Sumter County adults reported having had a medical checkup in t he past year when compared to state rates. In 2016, BRFSS indicators point to oral health problems in TVRH Service Area. The percentage of Lake and Marion County adults who had seen a dentist in the past year fe ll below the state's 63.0 percent at 57.2 and 59.4 percent, respectively. Sumte r County adults outperformed t he state rate for that indicator by almost 20 percent at 75.2 percent. However , Sumter County adults reported having had a permanent tooth removed because of decay or gum disease at the highest rate for the service area (65.3 percent) and exceeded the state rate of 47.3 percent by 38 percent. By comparison, 52.7 a nd 58.5 percent of Lak e and Marion County adults reported this tooth remov al, also exceeding the state ra te (Table 126). HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE Across TVRH Service Area in 2016, the percentage of adults who reported poor physical health on 14 or more of the past 30 da ys exceeded the state rate of 12.9 percen t. At 19.6 percent, Mar ion County adults had the highest rates followed by Sum ter County at 15.5 percent and Lake County at 15.4 percent. Relatedly, the average number of unhealthy physical days in the past 30 days r eported was highest in Marion County at 5.7 days, followed by 4.7 days in Sumter County and 4.3 days in Lak e County; the state average was 4.0 days. Among the three LRMC Service Are a counties, Marion County adult s reported the poorest health-related quality of life indicators with 25.7 percent reporting that the ir overall health was \"fair\" or \"poor,\" 12.9 percent reporting having had poor mental health on 14 or more of the past 30 days, and 26.2 percent whose poor physical or mental health kept them from doing usual activ ities on 14 or more of the past 30 days (Table 126). HIV/AIDS In 2016, the percentage of adults under the age of 65 who repor ted ever having been tested for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in TVRH Service Area was lower tha n state rates at 48.4 percent in Lake County, 54.0 percent in Marion Co unty, and 46.1 percent in Lake County compared to 55.3 percent statewide (Table 126). IMMUNIZATIONS Overall, self-reported immunizat ion rates\u2014including those adult s who have received a flu shot, a pneumococcal, and/or a tetanus vaccination in the past year and /or ever\u2014across all th ree counties in TVRH Service Area are either similar or better than those for the st ate as a whole. For example, in 2016 the THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 17 percentage of adults who reported that they received a flu shot in the past year was 40.3 percent in Lake County, 36.5 percent in Marion Co unty, and 58.5 percent in Sumter County while the state rate was 35.0 percent (Table 126). OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY In 2016, statewide 63.2 percent of adults reported being overwe ight or obese. Percent ages in TVRH Service Area counties exceeded that rate . In Sumter County, 73.1 percen t of adults reported being overweight or obese while 64.8 percent and 68. 2 percent of adults in Lake Cou nty and Marion County, respectively, reported being overweight or obe se. When taken separately, obes ity rates for the three service area counties all exceeded state rates. Simila rly, the percentage of adults w ho reported being over weight exceeded state rates for all but Lake County at 32.2 percent compared to 35.8 percent statewide. In TVRH Service Area, only Marion County adults reported being sedentary at a rate higher than the state rate; that is, 36.0 percent compared to 29.8 percent. In Sumter County when compared to state rates, 38 percent fewer adults reported being inactive or insufficiently active and 36 percent more adults reported meeting aerobic recomme ndations (Table 126). SUBSTANCE AND TOBACCO USE In 2016 the percentage of adults w ho engaged in heavy or binge drinking was below the state rate of 17.5 percent in all three counties wi th Lake County at 15.8 percent, Marion County at 14.2 percent and Sumter County at 11.9 percent. Similarly, reported marijuana or hashis h use in the past 30 days among adults in TVRH Service Area counties was below the 7.4 percent state rate with Lake County at 7.0 percent, Marion County at 4.1 percent and Sumter County at 1.9 percent. Lake Co unty and Marion County had higher rates of current smokers at 19.2 and 19.1 percent, respectively, compared to the state rate of 15.5 percent and Sumter County's low rate of 8.0 percent. All three service area counties had lower than state rates for adults who had never smoked at 47.7, 52. 8 and 43.5 percent for Lake, Marion, and Sumter Coun ties, respectively, compared to 58 percent statewide. The percentage of current e-cigarette use in Marion County at 5.1 percent was higher than the stat e 4.7 percent state rate (Table 126). MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH From 2015-2017 there were 3,278 bi rths for all races in TVRH Se rvice Area. There were 41 infant deaths for the same period. Infant death rates for all races, Whites, Blac ks and Hispanics were higher than state rates for the corresponding racial and ethnic groups in TVRH Service Area as well as the larger CFH Service Area. For comparison, the infant death rate per 1,000 live births for Whites in TVRH Service Area was 9.3 while the CFH Service Area rate was 7. 6 and state rate was 4.4. For Blacks those infant death rates per 1,000 live births were 21.0, 15.9 and 11.3, respectively (Tables 105, 106) . The percentage of low birthweigh t births for all races in TVRH Service Area was 10.6 percent, which was somewhat higher than the CFH Ser vice Area rate of 9.5 percent a nd state of Florida rate of 8.7 percent. Low birthweight births occurred at a higher rate among Blacks in bo th TVRH and CFH Servic e Areas at 18.4 and 17.5 percent, respectively; the comparable state rate for low b irthweight births among Blacks was 13.6 THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 18 percent (Table 107). From 2015-201 7, Black women in TVRH Servic e Area had higher rates of first trimester care at 73.6 percent than for TVRH Service Area Whites at 70.0 percent and Hispanics at 71.3 percent (Table 108). While teen birth rates in TVRH Service Area have decreased from 2013-2017, the 2015-2017 rates remained higher than state rates for all races and Hispanics. F or all races, the 2015-2017 teen birth rate in TVRH Service Area was 2.2 percen t (71 births) co mpared to 1.8 p ercent (45) for Whites, 3.3 percent (22 births) for Blacks and 1.8 percent (13 births) for Hispanics. T he CFH Service area rate for the same period for all races was 2.0 percent ( 117 births) compared to the stat e rate of 1.3 percent (Table 109). For the purpose of this indicator, teens are defined as young women age d 15-17 years. TABLE 5.

MENTAL HEALTH Common mental health issues such as anxiety and depression are associated with a variety of other public health issues including substanc e abuse, domestic violence, and suicide. The following are key findings in regards to mental health for TVRH Service Area: Indicator TVRH SA CFH SA Florida All White Black Hispanic All White Black Hispanic All White Black Hispanic Total Births 3 57 35 17 5 4,135 2,101 1,669 1,012 Infant Death Rate 12.5 9.3 21.0 6.4 9.6 7.6 15.9 6.1 6.1 4.4 11.3 5.2 Low Brthwght. 347 211 123 36 565 360 187 52 58,727 34,503 20,207 14,271 Low Brthwght.

Rates of emergency department (E D) visits per 1,000 population for mental health reasons by TVRH and CFH Service Area residents o f all ages and those 18 years o f age and older were lower than state rates for 2015-2017. ED visit rat es for mental health reasons f or children aged 0-17 were higher than state rates for all three years in the reporting period for TVR H Service Area res idents (Table 97). Suicide ranked among the leading causes of death for 18-44 year olds in TVRH Service Area in 2016 by county. Those crude death rates per 100,000 for suicide exceed ed state crude rates. Crude death rates for suicide were 17.1, 26.1 and 16.4 for Lake, Marion, and Sumt er County residents 18-44 years of age; the comparable state rate was 15.6 per 100,000 population (Table 87). According to recent BRFSS data, the percentage of adults in Lak e, Marion and Sumter Counties exceeded the state rate for those who reported being limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental or emotional problems at 23.6, 29.2, and 27.2 percent, r espectively, compared to 21.2 percent statewide. About 12.5 percent of Lake County adults and 12.9 pe rcent of Marion County adults also reported having had poor mental health on 14 or more of the past 30 days. By comparison, Sumter County adults had about half the rate at 6.7 percent while the state rate was 11.4 percent (Table 126). The rate per 100,000 population o f domestic violence offenses i n 2017 was much higher in Marion County at 875.4 than in Florida as a whole at 520.4. The rates in Lake County of 511.1 and in Sumter County at 303.4 were lower than both the 2017 Marion County and Florida rates (Table 104). Numbers and rates of involuntary exam initiations, also referre d to as Baker Acts, in the three TVRH Service Area counties for 2009-2015 are displayed in the table below. Lake and Sumter County rates are below state rates per 100,000 population for the reporting period. Marion C ounty Baker Act rates exceeded state rates early in the reporting period then dropped beginning in 2012 (T able 99).

HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND UTILIZATION Although health insurance and access to healthcare services do not necessarily prevent illness, early intervention and long-term management resources can help to imp rove and maintain qu ality of life and minimize premature death. It is therefore useful to consider in surance coverage and healthcare access in a community health needs assessment. The 2019 Central Florida Health Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix includes data on insurance cove rage, Medicaid eligibility, hea lthcare resources and usage as well as healthcare expenditur es by payor sour ce. Key finding s from these data sets are presented in sections below. SHORTAGE AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS A Health Professional Shortage A rea (HPSA) is defined as a geog raphic area, population group or facility designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration as having shortages of primary medical care, den tal or mental health providers. A HPSA may be a geographic area such as a county or service area, represen t a specific demographic such as low income population, or be a designated institution such as a Federally Qualified Health Center. The score of shortage areas is calculated using the following four key factors: popul ation-to-primary care physician ratio, percent of population with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty le vel, infant mortality rate or low birthweight rate (depending on which score is higher), and trav el time or distance to nearest available source of care (also, depending on which score is higher). The scores range from 0 to 26, where the higher the score signifies the greater the priority.

The types of HPSAs with the greatest priority for all three (3) counties are the FQHC Look-Alike GCHN-Umatilla Health Clinic with a score of 20 and the Low Income HPSA Popula tion in Sumter County also with a score of 20, followed by the Low Income/Migrant Farmworker Popu lation in Marion County, scoring 18 (Table 134). The mental health HPSA's for Lake, Mari on and Sumter Counties include three (3) population groups, one correctional facility, one comprehensive health centers, th ree (3) single counties, a rural health center, a FQHC Look-Alike, and a FQHC. The type of HPSA with th e greatest priority includes Low Income HPSA Populations in Sumter County and Marion County with scores of 17 each (Table 134). The primary care HPSA's for Lake, Mari on and Sumter Counties include three (3) population groups, two (2) correctional facilities, one FQHC Look-Alike, two (2) F QHCs, three (3) rural health centers, and two (2) single counties. The type of HPSA with the highest pri ority score is the Low Income HPSA Population in Sumter County, whi ch had a score of 18 (Table 134 ). A medically underserved area (MUA) may be a whole county or a g roup of contiguous counties, a group of civil divisions or a group of ur ban census tracts in which resi dents have a shortage of personal health services. The lowest possible sc ore is zero (0) and indicates t he highest need while the highest score of 100 indicates areas of lowest need. As of 2019, in the CFH Service Area the MUA with the greatest need is located in North Lake County with a score of 45.6. Sumter Count y was close behind w ith a score of 46.6 while Marion County scored 50.9 (Table 134). HEALTHCARE FACILITIES A variety of licensed healthcare service facilities are located in the CFH Service Area counties . As an example, in 2019 there were 47 assisted living facilities in La ke County, 34 in Mario n County and 13 in Sumter County all exceeding th e calculated rate per 100,000 pop ulation for Florida. CFH Service Area counties fall somewhat short of state rates for adult day care centers and are on par with state rates per 100,000 population for h ospitals (Table 138). Numbers and rates per 100,000 popu lation of hospital beds and nursing home bed in the three CFH Service Area counties are displayed in F igures 5 and 6 below. While cou nty rates fell short of the 2018 state rate of 306.3 hospital beds per 100,000 popu lation, notable gains were made in Marion and Sumter Counties resulting in rates of 267.9 and 275.9, respectively (Table 139) . The rate per 100,000 population of nursing home beds available in 2017 was highest in Lake County at 448.7 , followed by Marion County at 426.1 both surpassing the state rate of 407. 6. Sumter County had far fewer nursing home beds with a rate of 348.6 result ing in an almost 30 percen t difference when comparted to Lake County (Table 139).

N otably, the 2017-2018 Sumter County rate of total physicians was 155 percent below the state rate. While r ates of total physicians dropped, there were small gains in rates of family p ractice physicians in all three CFH Service Area Counti es (Table 140). Despite lower rates of total physician availability, the percentage of adults in 2016 who report ed having a personal doctor was 75.6 percent in Lake County and 77.4 percent in Mari on County while topped by Sumter County at 90.4 percent; all outperformin g the state rate of 72.0 perce nt (Table 126). Dentists were also in short suppl y in the CFH Service Area. For the reporting period of 2008-2018 in Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties, numb ers of dentists increased sligh tly but did not keep pace with population growth causing rates per 100,000 population to remain below sta te rates. In 2017-2018, the rate of dentists per 100,000 population for Florida was 55.8 compared to 39.6, 3 7.2, and 24.2 in Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties, respectively (Tabl e 141). In 2016, only 57.2 and 59. 4 percent of adults in Lake County and Marion County, respectively, reported h aving seen a dentist in the pas t year. While Lake and Marion County fell below the state percentage of 63. 0, Sumter County adults exceed ed the rate at 75.2 percent (Table 126). UNINSURED In Florida, the percentage of ad ults 18-64 years of age who wer e uninsured began to d rop noticibly in 2013 when provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care A ct were fully in effect. Since then, uninsured rates in the three CFH Service Area counties have hovered at or near the 18.4 percent state rate as illustrated in Figure 7 below. The highest rate of uninsured ad ults 18-64 years of age was found in Marion County at 19.4 percent. The same trend is evident for those und er 19 years of age. However, those rates were lower at 5.6, 6.4, and 6.4 percent for Lake, Marion and Su mter Counties and a state rate of 6.6 percent (Table 52). The 2013-2017 ACS data show an estimated uninsured rate of 7.0 percent in TVRH Service Area. Highest uninsured rates in TVRH Service Area were reported for Bellevie w (34420 zip code) at 15.3 percent and Leesburg (34748 zip code) at 10.4 percent. The lowest uninsured rate was found in The Villages (32162 zip code) at 0.8 percent. The CFH Se rvice Area uninsured rate was r eported at 8.9 percent (Table 54). In 2016 according to the BRFSS, a bout 17.1 percent of Lake Coun ty adults and 19.2 percent of Marion County adults said they could not see a doctor in the past year due to cost. The state rate was 16.6 percent. Only 6.9 percent of Sumter Count y adults reported cost as a bar rier to seeing a doctor as might be expected with Sumter County's the high percentage of insured population (Table 126).

MEDICAID For the purpose of data collectio n and reporting, the Florida A gency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) Medicaid Program Office terms those who are enrolled in the Med icaid medical assistance program as Medicaid Eligibles. As shown i n the following table for 2012-20 14, the percent of the population in TVRH Service Area who were Medicaid e ligible was lower than the stat e percent for all three years (Table 135). Further review of Medicaid eligi ble population data by age groups in the individual counties in the CFH Service Area showed pockets of h igh enrollment. In 2018, in Sum ter County 61.1 percen t of the population 0-18 years of age were Medicaid e ligible as were 60.1 percent o f those of the same age in Marion County; the comparable state rate was 48.5 percent. At the other end of the age spectrum for those aged 65 years and older the state rate was 14.5 pe rcent whereas in Lake, Marion a nd Sumter Counties the rates were considerably lower at 8.1, 9.3, and 2.2 percent, respectively ( Table 136).

INSURANCE UTILIZATION For 2015-2017 in TVRH Service Area , Medicare as the payor sourc e covered the largest percent of discharges and patient days. In 2017, those rates were 73.6 pe rcent of discharges and 75.0 percent of patient days. For comparison, st ate rates were 45.8 percent and 51.3, respectively, for 2017. Private Insurance as the payor source ranked as the next highest with 1 1.4, 11.4 and 10.9 percent of discharges in for the same three-year period. M edicaid as the payor source de creased slightly over the three year period, The percentage of discharges with Medicare as the payor increased somewhat in the CFH Service Area as did the Veterans Administration/Tricare as payor to about 1.8 p ercent of discharg es (Table 145). INPATIENT UTILIZATION In TVRH Service Area in 2017, the highest rate of hospital disc harges at 26.4 percent wa s seen for residents of The Villages (32162 zip code). C lose behind were residents o f Leesburg (34748 zip c ode) at 23.7 percent of discharges. The average length of stay (ALOS) was longest for residents of Leesburg (34748 zip code) and Wildwood (34785 zip code) both at 5.4 days. The ALOS for TVRH S ervice Area and CFH Service Area was 5.1 days, compared to the Florida as a whole at 4.9 days (Table 144 ).

AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS For residents under the age of 65 in TVRH Service Area, the mos t common reason for an avoidable discharge was dehydration accounting for 30.2, 39.7 and 35.3 percent of a voidable discharges in 2015, 2016 and 2017. During that period other conditions consistently among the top reasons for avoidable discharges were Cellulitis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Congestive H eart Failure, and Nutritional Deficiencies (Table 149). In TVRH Service Ar ea, Wildwood (34785 zip code) an d Leesburg (34748 zip code) saw the highest avoidable discharge rate s per 1,000 population at 25.6 and 23.1 percent, respectively, for 2017 (Table 147). Medicare was the payor source for the largest per cent of avoidable discharges among those less than 65 years of age in TVRH Service Area in 2017 reaching 34.0 percent. The CFH Service Area rate was 31.3 percent while for Florida as a whole is was 22.2 perce nt (Table 148). While the 2017 rate of preventable dental hospitalizations for TVRH and CFH Service Areas at 0.7 per 1,000 population was a little lower th an the state rate of 0.8, it is noteworthy to mention that in TVRH Service Area residents accumulated 144 preventa ble dental hospitalizations, representing 85.2 percent of all dental hospitalizations (Table 143). THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 27 EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS In 2017, Medicare was the largest payor source for ED visits in TVRH and CFH Service Areas, covering 38.2 and 33.0 percent of ED visits, respectively. In Florida as a w hole for 2015-2017 the largest payor for ED visits was Medicaid at 34.3, 33.8 and 32.4 percent for those th ree years, respectively. (Table 151). The most commonly reported main reason for an ED visit in TVRH Service Area from 2015-2017 was unspecified chest pain, which a ccounted for 5.5 percent of ED visits in 2017. However, the vast majority of reasons, 77.7 percent in 2017, were categorized as \"other\" as t hey were not assigned an International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 or ICD 10 code ( Table 152). There were 69,946 avoidable ED v isits made in 2017 by TVRH Serv ice Area residents for an avoidable ED visit rate per 1,000 population of 152.9. That rate was lower t han the CFH Service Ar ea of 164.2 but both were lower than the state rate o f 190.3. Within TVRH Service Ar ea, the highest rates were found in Belleview (34420 zip code) at 263.6, in Summerfield (34491 zip code) at 240.1 and in Wildwood (34785 zip code) at 239.2 per 1,000 population (Table 150). Recent rates of ED visits per 1, 000 population for mental healt h reasons in TVRH Servic e Area for all ages at 55.6, children aged 0-17 years at 12.0, and adults 18 years of age and older at 61.4 were lower than CFH Service Area rates of 60.9, 13.8, and 68.0, respectively. Rates in both service areas were lower than state rates for the three aforemention ed age groups; comparable state rates were 71.2, 12.3, and 85.6 for the same time period of 2017 (Table 97). In 2017, TVRH Service Area resid ents made 1,732 preventable ED visits for dental reasons, which amounted to 95.7 percent of all dental ED visits. TVRH Service area prev entable dental ED visit rate per 1,000 population was 8.6 in 2017; the s tate rate was also 8.6. In tha t same period within in TVRH Service Area, Belleview (34420 zip code) had more than twice the service area and state rates at 20.5, followed by Summerfield (34491 zip code) at 14. 8 per 1,000 population (Tabl e 142). READMISSIONS As seen in Figure 8 below, home s elf-care at 45.0 percent, skil led nursing facility (SNF) at 29.0 percent, and home health services at 20.0 perc ent accounted for the majority of initial discharges and readmissions at TVRH in fiscal year 2018. Togethe r, intermediate care facilit ies, home and medical facility hospices, federal facilities, short-term care, transfers from rehabilitation faci lities, and another types of health care institutions account for about six (6.0) percent of discharges and readmissions to TV RH. The total number of readmissions was 1,548. Similar ly, the readmission rates for those persons initially discharged from The Villages Regional Hospital (TVRH) and later readmitted to LRMC were comparable to the rates of initial discharges and readmissions for TVRH as the initial and readmit hospital as displayed in Figure 9 below. As such, home self-care at 48 percent, SNF at 23 percent, and home health services at 19 percent accounted for roughly 90 percent of initial discharges from TVRH and readmiss ions to LRMC. Readmissions totaled 194 (Table 156). In fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, thirty (30)-day aggregate hospital-wide (all- cause) unplanned readmissions accounted largest p ortion of readmissions for LRMC as the initial and readmitting facility at THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 28 77.9, 74.0 and 75.6 percent, respectively. The next largest ca use was 30-day heart failu re at 7.2, 9.6 and 7.6, respectively for the same time period. This trend also held tru e for TVRH as the initia l hospital with LRMC as the readmission facility as can be seen in the table that follo ws (Table 161). FIGURE 8.

THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 31 COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS The County Health Rankings are a key component of the Mobilizing Action Toward Community Health (MATCH), a collaboration project between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Counties receive a rank relative to the health of other counties in the state. Counties having high rank s, e.g. 1 or 2, are considered to be the \"healthiest\". Health is viewed as a multifactorial construct. Counties are ranked relative to the h ealth of other counties in the same state on the following summary measures: I. Health Outcomes--rankings are based on an equal weighting of on e length of life (mortality) measure and four quality of life (morbidity) measures. II. Health Factors--rankings are based on weighted scores of four t ypes of factors: a. Health behaviors (9 measures) b. Clinical care (7 measures) c. Social and economic (9 measures) d. Physical environment (5 measures) Throughout the years, some Count y Health Rankings methodology a nd health indicators have changed. Thus, caution is urged in making year-to-year comparisons. The data are useful as an annual check on health outcomes, contributing factors, r esources and relative status w ithin a region and state. The County Health Rankings add to data a community can consider in assessing heal th and determining priorities. The County Health Rankings are available for 2010 through 2019. In the latest rankings, out of 67 counties in the state, Lake County ranked 26th for health outcomes and 2 3rd for health factors for an overall ranking of 26th. Marion County ranked 52nd for health outcomes and 40th for health factors, earning an overall ranking of 52. Sum ter County's rankings included 20th for health outcomes and 25th for health factors for an overall ranking of 20 out of the 67 Florida counties. Factors and indicators that con tributed to each of the LRMC Service Area counties' ranki ngs are briefly described belo w. County Health Ranking scores for the three service area counties are displayed in the table that fol lows (Table 2, Technical Appendix). Lake County ranked 4th for clinical care placing it in the top ten percent of Florida counties. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Lake County scored 56th for its physical environment. Health behavior rankings at 24th and social and economic factor scores at 28th boosted Lake County to an overall ranking of 20th. At 52nd out of 67 counties, Marion County scores point to challenges with social and economic factors, overall mortality and morbidity, the physical environment and h ealth behaviors. Marion County ranked 18th for clinical care placing it among the top third of Florida co unties for this indicator. Sumter County netted the 2nd place ranking for health behaviors, 6th morbidity, and 9th for clinical care. Sumter County's physical environment merited 16th place ranking. Despite the low ranking of 57th for social and economic factors, Sumter County earned an overall ra nking of 20th from among all Florida counties. THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 32 HEALTH FACTORS AND HEALTH OUTCOME SCORES Health factors influence the health of a community and include socioeconomic factors, health behaviors, and clinical care. The overall health outcomes ranking in Marion County (52nd) was much lower than both Sumter County (20th) and Lake County (26th). In TVRH Service Area, Marion County fared worst in both health factors and outcomes, as seen in the table below. TABLE 9.

THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY THEMES AND S TRENGTHS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 34 Community Themes and Strengths Quantitative data from a vast array of secondary or administrat ive data sets only describe part of a community's core health needs an d health issues. A community pe rspective of health and the healthcare experience is essential to fully understanding the health of th e community. The Villages Regional Hospital (TVRH) has utilized two approaches to generate community perspe ctives on health and the healthcare system in the service area. Commu nity surveys of residents and healthcare professionals were conducted and focus groups were held for more in-depth discussions on per ceptions related to health and health care. The key observations and findings from the surveys and focus gr oups comprise the Community Themes and Strengths Assessment and are presented below. FOCUS GROUPS METHODOLOGY Two (2) focus groups were facilitated in TVRH service area to b etter understand community member views on health, wellness, safety, health care, and quality of life i n the area. The focus gr oup script was designed and implemented with final approval from the Central Florida He alth Steering Committee and Core Team members. The Steering Committee and Core Team made concerted ef forts to include underrepresented groups and were guided by demographic data and the team's consi derable knowledge and experience serving TVRH communities to plan the focus groups. Trained faci litators conducted the focus groups using a script, which includes a brief i ntroduction, completion of info rmed consent forms and a demographic survey, and a series of questions asked sequentially. Please se e the Appendix for the focus group materials. The Central Florida Health Core Team assisted in the identifica tion of focus group host sites and focus group participants.

SUMMARY AND KEY THEMES Across the two focus groups, comm on themes emerged. These inclu de health conditions and behaviors, healthcare system challenges and strengths, service area attri butes and infrastructure, and TVRH-specific strengths and problems. Each of these is described in the subse quent section on key themes. The Appendix includes the detailed responses by focus group that may further enlighten issues that surfaced from the particular groups. Themes represent common issues and their sup porting factors as articulated by focus group participants in the two se ssions. The them es are presented below in alphabetica l order. Contributing factors are listed below each th eme, in descending order of the most frequently cited. Detailed responses of the focus groups are found in the Appendix. It is important to note that while these focus group findings are not generalizable to the entire population in TVRH service area , the information provides valuable insights into and indications o f community perceptions, opinions and att itudes about health behaviors, issues and resources, quality of life factors and TVRH's ability to addres s problems and improve health outcomes. Key Themes Theme: Health Conditions and Behaviors Age-related issues Maintaining healthy weight Alcohol and tobacco use Focus group participants expressed concern for age-related issu es including mobility limitations and the onset of chronic conditions such as heart disease, arthritis an d diabetes. Participants recognized the importance of maintaining a heal thy weight through a balance of proper nutrition and physical activity and expressed concern for the many who cannot do so, whether by ind ividual choice or related to the lack of knowledge and/or resources. Alcohol and tobacco use were cited as behaviors that contribute to poor health and noted alcohol's role in injuries, domestic and famil y problems and mental health issues. Theme: Health System Challenges and Strengths Affordable healthcare serv ices and prescriptions Health insurance coverage and affordability THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY THEMES AND S TRENGTHS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 37 Misuse of existing healthcare resources Shortage of physicians and nurses Shortage of services and facilit ies such as mental health care, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, end-of-life care Access to affordable healthcare services was the most mentioned topic by participants at both focus group sessions. The healthcare system was described as \"overwhelmed\" and driven by health insurance financial motivations. Examples of costly health insurance with high deductibles, expensive co-pays and convoluted referral requirements were shared along with instances of exorb itant charges for prescription medicines. While noting that TVRH service a rea has many primary care docto rs, appointment availability and insurance acceptance, including Medicare a nd Medicaid, often present barr iers according to focus group members. Participants opined that these barriers and a lack of health li teracy pushed many to seek routine care in emergency rooms, further burdening the system. Focus group part icipants noted the nursing shortage and lack of physicians including generalists and specialists as maj or contributing factors to shrinking access to health care. In light of the agi ng population in TVRH service a rea, participants felt there were insufficient facilities to accommodate the current and future needs for ment al health, memory, skilled nursing, assisted living and end-of-life care. Theme: Service Area Attributes and Infrastructure Clean, safe environment for healthy living Health care available for those with financial resources Focus group participants had many positive comments about livin g in TVRH service area. In addition to cleanliness, safety, and appeali ng and senior-fr iendly neighborhoods, they cited the healthfulness of the social environment with many opportunities for physical, mental , spiritual stimulation as positives. Noting that these benefits come at a cost, participants expressed conc ern for uninsured reside nts, the working poor and the future affordability of living in TVRH service area, pa rticularly for young adults. Theme: TVRHspecific Issues and Strengths Long waits for care in the emergency room Communication and managing negative perceptions about TVRH Caring nurses, physicians and leadership Community service through education Ov ercrowding and long waits for care in the emergency room were of great concern to focus group participants. They discussed po ssible contributing factors such as the nursing shortage, misuse of the healthcare system in general, and lack of health insurance. All agreed that negative perceptions about the quality of care at TVRH were rampant and in most cases undeserv ed. Participants felt communication was improving under Mr. Pittman's leadership but still had not addr essed the negativity nor adequately manages the public's expectations about the realities of a busy emergen cy room.

Caring n urses and physicians, dedicated leadership THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY THEMES AND S TRENGTHS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 38 and investments in leading edge technologies were among the rea sons given for recommending TVRH to family and friends. COMMUNITY SURVEY AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL SURVEY METHODOLOGY The Central Florida Health Steer ing Committee, in partnership w ith WellFlorida Counc il, collaborated to formulate two similar surveys to query individuals about commun ity health issues and their perspectives on the healthcare. Each survey was tailored to its intended audie nce which included members of the community at-large and healthcare providers. Guided by service area demographics, the surveys were available in English and tested for readability to assure confo rmity with best practices. Both surveys employed a convenience sampling approach where res pondents were select ed based on their convenient accessibility to the surveys. The Central Florida He alth Steering Committee assisted with the survey dissemination through their respective organizations and by connecting WellFlorida to key stakeholders and community partn ers. The community survey was marketed via print (local newspapers) and electronic media (Twitter, F acebook, web site postings). Th e healthcare professional survey was promoted through Central Florida Health internal communications as well as external web site postings. The surveys were accessible online and in paper format upon req uest. There were 583 respondents to t he community survey and 106 to t he healthcare professional survey. After eliminating the incomplete and ineligible surveys, there were 3 92 community surveys and 23 healthcare professional surveys for analysis. The survey instruments are included in the Appendix . For the purpose of this assessment, a community member was defined as any person 1 8 years of age or older who resides in the Central Florida Health servi ce areas including Lake, Marion , and Sumter Counties. Responses from individuals who did not meet the aforementioned criteria were n ot included in the data analysis. While there are advantages of ut ilizing a convenience sampling approach, such as the ability to rapidly analyze and extrapolate findings to form conclusions, it is dif ficult to argue that the sample is representative of the population Central Florida Health serves. As a whole, wo men, older adults, and white residents were overrepresented in the responden t group. While the insights obt ained from each survey are extremely valuable, they cannot be generalized to all Cent ral Florida Hea lth service area resid ents and healthcare professionals. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY SURVEY Tables 11-28 summarize the over-a rching community health and healthcare issues questions asked of community members and healthcare professionals. In general, the top five or the leading responses for each question are presented. Where sufficient data are available, re sponses are presented by the Central Florida Health (CFH) service area and the service area counties (Lake, Marion, Sumter). Questions regarding the following topics are included in the analysis: Most important factors for a healthy community THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY THEMES AND S TRENGTHS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 39 Behaviors with greatest im pact on overall health Most important or biggest health problems in the community Healthcare services that are difficult to obtain Barriers to receiving dental, primary and mental health care Biggest personal ch allenges in the past 12 months Some noteworthy observations include: Access to healthcare services wa s the highest ranked factor tha t most contributes to a healthy community by the individual servi ce area counties and by the en tire CFH service area. The second highest ranked factor was access to convenient, affordable food ; it ranked second in the CFH service area as well as second in Lake and Marion Counties and fifth in Sumter. Low crime and safe neighborhoods appeared in the top five ranking of all areas as did healthy behaviors (Table 12 below). The issues ranked as the most important or biggest problems for the community showed some common themes across the service area. Age-related issues and specific ally lack of affordable assisted living facilities ranked highly in the collective CFH service area as well as in the individual counties. Obesity ranked sixth or higher in all fo ur service area categories as a n important issue. Acc ess to primary/family care ranked eighth or higher in all four areas. Substance abuse /drug abuse, mental health problems and homelessness varied in rankings i n three of the four areas (Table 13 below). Across the service area, behavio rs with the greatest negative i mpact on health were drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and poor eating habits (eating unhealthy foods or overea ting). Also ranked highly among the negative behaviors were lack of personal responsibility and dis tracted driving (Table 14 below). At the top of the list of healthcare services rated as difficult to obtain were alternative medicine/therapy, dental care, prescriptions/medicine or medical supplies, and sp ecialty care. Mental/behavioral health care services also were singled out as a difficult to obtain se rvice in the CFH service area as well as in each of the three service area counties (Table 15 below). While not all survey respondents experienced challenges in rece iving dental, primary and/or mental health/substance use care, those who did frequently cited cost and insurance coverage as barriers (Tables 16-26 below). The list of the biggest personal challenges in the past 12 mont hs seems to confirm the rankings from related survey items. Access to a doctor or dentist, mental health/depression issues and food insufficiency were frequently sel ected across the four service area categories (Table 27 below).

There were 23 completed surveys included in the analysis. In general, the top five ranked responses for each question are presented. Each figure shows the percentage of healthcare profe ssionals who indicated the given response for a question. Questions on the following topics are included in the analysis: Most important factors that define a healthy community Behaviors with the greatest nega tive impact on overall health Most important health pr oblems in the community Strategies to help improve the health of patients and the commu nity Rating of overall commu nity health, health-related quality of l ife, and accessibility of health care Some noteworthy observations include: Similar to community survey part icipants, healthcare profession als ranked access to healthcare services as the highest ranked factor that most contributes to a healthy community. This was f ollowed by healthy behaviors and healthy lifestyles and access to convenient, affo rdable and nutritious foods. Healthcare professionals differed in their ranking by including a clean en vironment, good schools and religious or spiritual values in their list of the top five factors (Table 3 0 below). There was closer agreement among healthcare professionals on th e issues ranked as the most important or biggest problems for the community. They ranked me ntal health problems, overweight and obesity and access to primary care as their top three (Tabl e 31) below. By far, healthcare professionals rated eating unhealthy foods/d rinking sweetened beverages as the behavior with greatest negative impact on health (Table 32 below). In agreement with community survey respondents, healthcare prof essionals listed alternative medicine/therapy, mental/behavioral health and primary/family c are among the healthcare services that are difficult to obtain in the Central Florida Health serv ice area (Table 33 below). Barriers to client self-managemen t of chronic diseases or condi tions most frequently cited by healthcare professionals were cost, lack of insurance coverage and lack of knowledge (Table 34 below). Cost and insurance issues were also among the barriers that surfaced for community survey respondents. More than half of the healthcare professionals who responded to the survey indicated that increasing access to mental health services , initiating efforts to bring m ore physicians to the community, and providing education to residents on appropri ate use of availabl e healthcare services would improve the hea lth of their clients in the Central Florida Health service a rea (Table 35).

The Forces of Change Assessment for Central Florida Health was conducted together for both hospitals within the hospital system, The Villages Regional Hospital and Leesburg Regional Medical Center. This assessment is aimed at identifyi ng forces such as trends, facto rs, or events that are or will be influencing the health and quality of life of the community. Trends are patterns over time, such as m igration in and out of a community or a growing disillusionment with government. Factors are discrete elements, such as a community's large ethnic population, an urban setting, or the jurisdiction's proximity to a major waterway. Events are one-time occurrences, such as a hospital closure, a natura l disaster, or the passage of new legislation. These forces can be related to s ocial, economic, environmental or political factors in the region, state or U.S. that have an impact on the local community. Information collect ed during this assessment will be used in identifying strategic issues. On April 4, 2019, the Steering Committee for the Central Florid a Health Community Health Assessment convened a group of community leaders to participate in this Fo rces of Change Assessment. Prior to the Forces of Change discussion, WellFlorida Council presented prel iminary findings from the secondary data review to familiarize participants with key demographic data, i ndicators of health behaviors and health status, and healthcare utilization facts for the Central Florida Health service area. WellFlorida Council provided a Forces of Change brai nstorming tool used to initiate the identification of threats and opportunities; the tool is found in the Appendix. The Forces of Change summary that follows outlines the trends, factors and events that were identified for Central Flo rida Health Service Area and possible opportunities and/or threats that may need to be considered in any strategic planning process resulting from this MAPP assessment.

First, the Intersecting Themes and Key Considerations are summarized in order to identify the key health needs and issues in TVRH Service Area. Second, this section provides links to major national databases of community health improvement best practices that will be critical resources to identifying proven effective programs and interventions that co uld be implemented in TVRH Service Area. These nationa l databases have been used to s pecify some of the most promising practices in some of the key issu e areas identified for TVRH Se rvice Area in the 2015. INTERSECTING THEMES AND KEY CONSIDERATIONS Presented below are the intersec ting themes which, in essence, comprise an overview of the major health needs and issues that emerged ov er the course of this community health needs assessment in TVRH and Central Florida Health (CFH) Ser vice Areas. The list of common themes is followed by an enumeration of potential overarching strategies as well as a compilation of ev idence-based and promising practice resources for consideration in the creation of the implementati on strategy and action plan to address the identified priority issues. INTERSECTING THEMES/HEALTH NEEDS AND ISSUES Social Determinants (identified in the Community Health Status Assessment data, Forces of Change and Focus Group observations, and Community and Healthcare Professi onal survey data) Aging population Higher rates of poverty among certain sub-populations Food insufficiency and affordability of nutritious foods Lack of affordable housing Homelessness Health Status Measures (identified in the Community Health Stat us Assessment data, Forces of Change and Focus Group observations, and Community and Healthcare Prof essional survey data) Infant mortality among all races and ethnicities and birth outc ome disparities Overweight and obesity with poor nutrition and eating habits, a nd physical inactivity as risk factors and contributing causes to chronic diseases and conditions Age-related health problems including chronic diseases and cond itions, injuries, impairment and mobility issues Heart Disease, Cancer, Diabetes, Chronic Lower Respiratory Dise ase, and Stroke Mental health problems including substance, drug and alcohol ab use Dental problems Health outcome disparities among races, ethnicity, and geograph y Negative health behaviors and poor decisions that impact health THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS | PAGE 64 Healthcare Access and Utilizatio n (identified in the Community Health Status Assessment data, Forces of Change and Focus Group observations, and Community and Healt hcare Professional survey data) Inappropriate and over-utilization of healthcare services (e.g. , Emergency Department) High and rising healthcare costs including services, health ins urance, prescription drugs Shortages of physicians, nurses, mental health professionals Barriers to accessing primary, sp ecialty, mental health and den tal care KEY CONSIDERATIONS Promote a culture of community h ealth as a network of diverse p artners and systems Foster a unifying community orga nizing principle and capacity b uilding system around shared outcomes and measures Create core system metrics to mo nitor performance of the commun ity health system and to inform collective and individual entity investments in community healt h Develop health literacy initiati ves that educate on healthcare system resource availability and appropriate use Enhance or create preventive pro grams, services and resources t o improve maternal health and birth outcomes Enhance or create preventive pro grams, services and resources t o address behaviors that lead to or exacerbate chronic diseases and conditions such as Cancer, Hear t Disease, Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Stroke Enhance or create initiatives to more effectively (as measured by health outcomes) and efficiently (as measured by cost and patient expe rience indicators) manage chronic diseases and conditions Create initiatives to remove impediments that restrict access t o primary, mental health and dental care services and professionals Consider supporting and/or enact ing policies and initiatives th at address root causes of systemic community and personal health issues INTERVENTIONS: GENERAL APPROACH ES AND SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES Prior to any type of prioritizat ion of interventions and activi ties to address critical health needs and issues in TVRH Service Area, community partners should review existing databases of evidence-based and promising practices. These resou rces have been designed to cat alogue the best practices for addressing countless key community health is sues. Each of these resources is designed a bit differently, but at the core, either provides a comprehensive and regularly updated list of p romising and evidence-based practices or has a queryable interface that a llows partners to identify best practices based on the issue, type of intervention or target populatio n. In general, these databases should be consulted prior to any type of intervention identification or prioritization within the commun ity. Presented below are five of the most frequently utilized and widely respected databases of practices for improving community health.

When reviewing practices at these sites, one must keep in mind the following qualifiers for the qual ity of and the type of evidence upon which the intervention is based: CaseControl Study : A case-control study identifies all incident cases that devel op the outcome of interest and compares their exposure hist ory with the exposure history o f controls sampled at random from everyone within the cohort who is still at risk for developing the outcome of interest. Cohort Study : A cohort study is a clinical research study in which people w ho presently have a certain condition or receive a particular treatment are followed over t ime and compared with another group of people who are not affected by t he condition. May or may not de termine an evidence-based practice. CrossSectional or Prevalence Study : A cross-sectional or prevalence study is a study that examine s how often or how frequently a disease or c ondition occurs in a group of p eople. Prevalence is calculated by dividing the number of people wh o have the disease or condition by the total number of people in the group. May or may not determin e an evidence-based practice. Effective Practice : A program that has been scientifically evaluated and has quantitative measures of improvement but those measures a re not statistically significan t. Evidence Based : The study is of peer review qu ality and presents statisticall y significant results in a scientific manner. The intervent ion may be categorized simply as \"evidence-based\" or as \"low,\" \"moderate\" or \"strong\" depending on the strength of the statist ical significance. Evidence Based (Low or Suggestive): While there are no systematic experimental or quasi-experiment al evaluations, the evidence includ es non-experimental or qualitat ive support for an as sociation between THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS | PAGE 66 the innovation and targeted healthcare outcomes or processes, o r structures in the case of healthcare policy innovations. Evidence Based (Moderate) : While there are no randomized, controlled experiments, the ev idence includes at least one systematic evaluati on of the impact of the innovat ion using a quasi-experimental design, which could include the non-rando m assignment of individuals to comparison groups, before-and-after comparisons in one group, and/or comparisons with a historical baseline or control. The results of the evaluation(s) show consistent di rect or indirect evidence of th e effectiveness of the innovation in improving targeted healthcare ou tcomes and/or processes, or str uctures in the case of healthcare policy innovations. However, the strength of the evidence is limited b y the size, quality, o r generalizability of the evaluations, and thus altern ative explanations cannot be ruled out. Evidence Based (Strong): The evidence is based on one or more evaluations using experim ental designs based on random allocation of individuals or groups of individu als (e.g. medical practices or hospital units) to comparison groups. The results of the evaluation(s) s how consistent direct evidence of the effectiveness of the innovation in improving the targeted healt hcare outcomes and/or processes, or structures in the case of healthcare policy innovations. Evidence of Ineffectiveness : Strategies with this rating are not good investments. These s trategies have been tested in many robust studies with consistently negative and so metimes harmful results. Experimental Study : An experimental study is a typ e of evaluation that seeks to d etermine whether a program or intervention had the intended causal effect on progr am participants. Expert Opinion : Strategies with this rating ar e recommended by credible, impartial experts but have limited research documenting effects; further research, often with stro nger designs, is n eeded to confirm effects. Experimental Study : An experimental study is a typ e of evaluation that seeks to d etermine whether a program or intervention had the intended causal effect on progr am participants. Individual Study : Scientific evaluation of the efficacy of an intervention in a single study. Insufficient Evidence : Strategies with this rating ha ve limited research documenting effects. These strategies need further research, often wit h stronger designs, to confirm effects. Mixed Evidence : Strategies with this rating have been tested more than once a nd results are inconsistent or trend negative; further research is needed to confirm effects. Nonsystematic Review : A non-systematic rev iew is a critical assessment and evaluati on of some but not all research studies that address a particular issue. Researchers d o not use an organized method of locating, assembling, and evalua ting a body of literature on a particular topic, possibly using a set of specific criteria. A non-systematic review typically includes a description of the findings of the collection of research studies. The non-systematic review may or may not i nclude a quantitative pooling of data, called a meta-analysis. THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS | PAGE 67 PeerReviewed : A publication that contains or iginal articles that have been written by scientists and evaluated for technical and scientific quality and correctness by other experts in the same field. Pilot Study : A pilot study is a s mall-scale experiment or set of observati ons undertaken to decide how and whether to launch a full-scale project. Practicebased Example : A practice-based example is an original investigation underta ken in order to gain new knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of t hat practice. Promising Practice/Good Idea: The program evaluation is limited to descriptive measures of s uccess. Randomized Control Trial : A randomized control trial is a controlled clinical trial tha t randomly (by chance) assigns participants to two or m ore groups. There are various m ethods to randomize study participants to their groups. Scientifically Supported : Strategies with this rating are most likely to make a differe nce. These strategies have been tested in many robust studies with consistently posit ive results. Some Evidence: Strategies with this rating are likely to work, but further r esearch is needed to confirm effects. These strategies have b een tested more than once and r esults trend positive overall. Systematic Review : A systematic review is a critical assessment and evaluation o f all research studies that address a particular issue. Researchers use an organized method of locating, assembling, and evaluating a body of literature on a particular topic using a set of speci fic criteria. A systematic review typically includes a description of the findings of the collection of res earch studies. The systematic review may or may not include a quantitative pooling of data, called a meta-a nalysis. Systematic Review - Insufficient Evidence: The available studies do not provide sufficient evidence to determine if the intervention is , or is not, effective. This do es NOT mean that the i ntervention does not work. It means that additional r esearch is needed to determine whether or not the intervention is effective. Systematic Review - Recommended : The systematic review of avail able studies provides strong or sufficient evidence that the intervention is effective. The categories of \"strong\" and \"sufficient\" evidence reflect t he Task Force's degree of confidence that an intervention has beneficial effects. They do not directly relate to the expected magnitude of benefits. The categorizatio n is based on several factors, such as study design, number of studies, and consistency of the effect across studies. Systematic Review - Recommended Against : The systematic review of available studies provides strong or sufficient evidence that the intervention is harmful or not eff ective. Table 38 presents some best pract ices for many of the key healt h issues and needs ar eas in TVRH Service Area and are worthy of consideration as community interventions . Some of these best practices may already be in place in the area and need enhancement while othe rs represent new opportunities.

Originally implemented between February 2006 and July 2007, the program included four liaisons who worked with 15 primary care practices in three Michigan communities, referring patients to community preventive health services and offering counseling and encouragement to help patients achieve their health-related goals.

Sessions help to identify diabetes- related concerns and set goals for diabetes management activities, such as dietary changes, exercise, and medication management. Pre- and post-implementation results from two sites show that the program led to enhanced diabetes knowledge; better blood sugar, cholesterol, and weight control; and less absenteeism.

This recommendation is based on evidence that shows these programs increase the number of children who receive sealants at school, and that dental sealants result in a large reduction in tooth decay among school- aged children (5 to 16 years of age). Dental Health Preventing Dental Caries: Community Water Fluoridation The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends community water fluoridation based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing dental caries across populations. Evidence shows the prevalence of caries is substantially lower in communities with CWF. In addition, there is no evidence that CWF results in severe dental fluorosis.

This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of the various psychosocial interventio ns to support pregnant women to stop smoking. It identified 102 trials and assessed the effectiveness of the following types of interventions: counseling, health education, incentives, social support, structured support for physical activity, and feedback. Feedback interventions give pregnant women information about the heal th of their fetuses and the levels of tobacco byproducts in their bodies. Counseling, feedback, and financial incentives appear to reduce the number of women smoking in late pregnancy.

Mental Health Collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders is a multicomponent, healthcare system-level intervention that uses case managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists. These mental health specialists provide clinical advice and decision support to primary care providers and case managers. These processes are frequently coordinated by technology-based resources such as electronic medical records, telephone contact, and provider reminder mechanisms.

In small groups or individually, please complete this Forces of Change Brainstorming Worksheet in preparation for the discussion that will follow. What are Forces of Change? Forces are a broad all-encompassing category that includes trends, events, and factors. Trends are patterns over time , such as migration in and out of a community or a growing disillusionment with government. Factors are discrete elements, such as a community's large ethnic population, an urban setti ng, or a jurisdiction's proximity to a major waterway. Events are one-time occurrences , such as a hospital closure, a natural disaster, or the passag e of new legislation. What Kind of Areas or Categories Are Included? Be sure to consider any and all types of forces, including: social economic political technological environmental scientific legal ethical How To Identify Forces of Change Think about forces of change - out side of CFH's direct control - that affect the local health care system, local health outcomes or overall community health; forces that may hinder or enhance CFH's ability to improve community health outcomes. 1. What has occurred recently that may affect our local public health system or community? 2. What may occur in the future? 3. Are there any trends occurring that will have an impact? Descr ibe the trends. 4. What forces are occurring locally? Regionally? Nationally? G lobally? 5. What characteristics of our juris diction or state may pose an opportunity or threat? 6.

Need to be countered with correct information Long waits or difficulty getting appointments Fear of litigation prevents some physicians from intervening in existing and/or previously treated health conditions People want to come to the ER ra ther than go to urgent care or doctor's office Need to educate people on how t o use health services Need more nurses, med techs, physicians with privileges in lieu of hiring hospitalists Clients don't understand that physicians are not employees of T VRH Discharge process is hindered by physicians who come late in th e day to the hospital THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL APPENDIX | PAGE 90 10. Would you recommend TVRH for heal th care to a family member or friend? Why? TVRH 8 am Group Yes, based on personal experience Yes, have seen improvements unde r the leadership of Mr. Pittman Need more positive public relations to counteract rumors about poor care and outcomes. The squeaky wheel compl ains online but those who are pleased with TVRH don't Communication about the positives should be wider (e.g., reduct ion in infection rates). Example: On exceptionally busy da y in ER when DON made the ext ra effort of going to the waiting room and telling peop le that everyone there is impo rtant, ER is slammed but each and every one will be se rved to the best of their abil ity. Also, change in leadership in ER is beginning to make a differe nce Discharge process is physiciandriven (late in the day discharg es are common) but Mr. Pittman is trying to make changes. TVRH 10 am Group Yes! They pay attention to what is needed You receive competent care The nurses are caring Communication has greatly improved Have good specialists including n eurologists, cardiologists, pu lmonologist, all the -ists! Other: TVRH 8 am Group Seasonal challenges must be handled Some concerns related to training on how to handle security and safety issues, training is not always consistent. Have done drills but sometimes volunt eers aren't included. Should know where written prot ocols are and those protocols sho uld be complete and easy to understand. TVRH 10 am Group Need more Fire/Rescue and EMS to t ransport people to the hospit als, not able to handle current volume and volume is going to increase THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL APPENDIX | PAGE 91 COMMUNITY SURVEY Dear Neighbor, What are the most important health and health care issues in yo ur community?
