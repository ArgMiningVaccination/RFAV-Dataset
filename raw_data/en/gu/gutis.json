[[1]](#cite_note-entrez-1) MiR-155 plays growth, [[8]](#cite_note-pmid22736789-8) [viral](/index.php/Virus) infections, [[10]](#cite_note-pmid21680528-10) and enhance the progression of [cardiovascular](/index.php/Cardiovascular) diseases. [[11]](#cite_note-pmid22715471-11) Discovery The MIR155HG was initially identified as a [gene](/index.php/Gene) that was transcriptionally activated by promoter insertion at a common retroviral integration site in [B-cell](/index.php/B-cell) [lymphomas](/index.php/Lymphomas) and was formerly called BIC (B-cell Integration Cluster). The MIR155HG is transcribed by [RNA polymerase II](/index.php/RNA_polymerase_II) and the resulting ~1,500 [nucleotide](/index.php/Nucleotide) and polyadenylated. The 23 nucleotide single-stranded miR-155, which is harbored in exon 3, is subsequently processed from the parent RNA molecule. [[12]](#cite_note-pmid15738415-12) Biogenesis The MIR155HG RNA transcript does not contain a long [open reading frame](/index.php/Open_reading_frame) (ORF), however, it does include an imperfectly base-paired [stem loop](/index.php?title=Stem_loop&action=edit&redlink=1) that [ncRNA](/index.php/NcRNA)) primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA). [[13]](#cite_note-Tam-13) Once miR-155 pri-miRNA is transcribed, this transcript is cleaved by the nuclear [microprocessor complex](/index.php?title=Microprocessor_complex&action=edit&redlink=1), of which the core components are the RNase III type endonuclease [Drosha](/index.php/Drosha) and the DiGeorge critical region 8 ( a 65 nucleotide [stem-loop](/index.php/Stem-loop) precursor miRNA (pre-mir-155) (see Figure 2). Following export from the nucleus by exportin-5, pre-mir-155 molecules are cleaved near the terminal loop by [Dicer](/index.php/Dicer) resulting in RNA of ~22nucleotides. [[14]](#cite_note-Kim-14) [[15]](#cite_note-Krol-15) Following Dicer cleavage, an [Argonaute](/index.php/Argonaute) (Ago) protein binds to the short RNA duplexes, forming the core of a multi-subunit complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex ( [RISC](/index.php/RISC)). [[16]](#cite_note-Fabian-16) In a manner similar to [siRNA](/index.php/SiRNA) duplexes, one of the two strands, the \"passenger miRNA\" (miR-155*), is released and degraded while the designated the \"guide strand\" or \"mature miRNA\" (miR-155), is retained within the RISC. [[16]](#cite_note-Fabian-16) Recent data suggest that both arms of the pre-miRNA hairpin can give rise to mature miRNAs. [[17]](#cite_note-pmid17506695-17) [[18]](#cite_note-pmid18197166-18) Due to the increasing number of examples where two functional mature miRNAs are processed from opposite arms of the same pre-miRNA, pre-mir-155 products are now denoted with the suffix -5p (from the 5 arm) (e.g. miR-155-5p) and -3p (from the 3 arm) (e.g. miR-155-3p) following their name (see Figure 3). [[19]](#cite_note-pmid14681370-19) Once miR-155-5p/-3p is assembled into the RISC, these molecules subsequently recognize their target messenger RNA ( [mRNA](/index.php/MRNA)) by base pairing interactions between nucleotides 2 and 8 of miR-155-5p/-3p (the seed region) and [complementary](/index.php/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)) nucleotides predominantly in the 3'-untranslated region ( [3'-UTR](/index.php?title=3%27-UTR&action=edit&redlink=1)) of mRNAs (see Figure 4 and 5 below). [[20]](#cite_note-Friedman-20) Finally, with the miR-155-5p/-3p acting as an adaptor for the RISC, complex-bound mRNAs are subjected to translational repression (i.e. inhibition of [translation](/index.php/Translation_(biology)) initiation) and/or degradation following deadenylation. [[16]](#cite_note-Fabian-16) Evolutionary conservation Early [phylogenetic](/index.php/Phylogenetic) analyses demonstrated that the sequence of pre-mir-155 and miR-155-5p was conserved between human, mouse, and chicken. [[13]](#cite_note-Tam-13) Recent annotated sequencing data found that 22 different organisms including, mammals, amphibians, birds, reptiles, sea squirts, and sea lampreys, express a conserved miR-155-5p. [[2]](http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/query.pl?terms=mir-155) Currently much less sequence data is available regarding miR-155-3p, therefore, it is not clear how conserved this miRNA is across species. [[3]](http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/query.pl?terms=mir-155) Tissue distribution [Northern blot](/index.php/Northern_blot) analysis found that miR-155 pri-miRNA was abundantly expressed in the human spleen and thymus and detectable in the liver, lung, and kidney. [[13]](#cite_note-Tam-13) Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction ( [PCR](/index.php/PCR)) experiments demonstrated that miR-155-5p was detectable in all human tissues investigated. [[21]](#cite_note-pmid16675453-21) Sequence analysis of small RNA clone libraries comparing miRNA expression to all other organ systems examined established that miR-155-5p was one of five miRNAs (i.e. miR-142, miR-144, miR-150, miR-155, and [B-cells](/index.php/B-cells), [T-cells](/index.php/T-cells), [monocytes](/index.php/Monocytes) and [granulocytes](/index.php/Granulocytes). [[22]](#cite_note-Landgraf-22) Together these results suggest that miR-155-5p is expressed in a number of tissues and cell types and, therefore, may play a critical role in a wide variety of biological processes, including [hematopoiesis](/index.php/Hematopoiesis) [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) [[4]](#cite_note-pmid18093533-4) Although very few studies have investigated the expression levels of miR-155-3p, Landgraf et al. [[22]](#cite_note-Landgraf-22) established that expression levels of this miRNA was very low in hematopoietic cells. Additionally, PCR analyses found that while miR-155-3p was detectable in a number of human tissues the expression levels of this miRNA were 20-200 fold less when compared to miR-155-5p levels. [[23]](#cite_note-pmid21081842-23) Even though the function of miR-155-3p has been largely ignored, several studies now suggest that, in some cases (astrocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells), both miR-155-5p and -3p functionally from pre-mir-155. [[24]](#cite_note-pmid22170100-24) [[25]](#cite_note-pmid20852130-25) Targets Bioinformatic analysis using TargetScan 6.2 (release date June, 2012) [[4]](http://www.targetscan.org) revealed at least 4,174 putative human miR-155-5p mRNA targets exist, with a total of 918 conserved sites (i.e. between mouse and human) and 4,249 poorly conserved sites (i.e. human only). [[20]](#cite_note-Friedman-20) [[26]](#cite_note-pmid15652477-26) Although the TargetScan 6.2 algorithm cannot be utilized to determine the miR-155-3p putative targets, one would speculate that this miRNA may also potentially regulate the expression of thousands of mRNA targets. A comprehensive list of miR-155-5p/mRNA targets that were experimentally authenticated by both the demonstration of endogenous transcript regulation by miR-155-5p and validation of the miR-155-5p seed sequence through a reporter assay was recently assembled. [[27]](#cite_note-Neilsen-27) This list included 140 genes and included regulatory proteins for myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis (e.g. [TCF12](/index.php/TCF12), [ZNF652](/index.php?title=ZNF652&action=edit&redlink=1), etc.). [[27]](#cite_note-Neilsen-27) in the SPI1 mRNA [[28]](#cite_note-pmid18055230-28) and the validated miR-155-3p binding site harbored in the IRAK3 mRNA [[25]](#cite_note-pmid20852130-25) are shown in Figures 4 and 5 respectively. Physiological roles Hematopoiesis [Hematopoiesis](/index.php/Hematopoiesis) is defined as the formation and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from [hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells](/index.php?title=Hematopoietic_stem-progenitor_cells&action=edit&redlink=1) (HSPCs). [[29]](#cite_note-pmid19778207-29) HSPCs are primitive [common represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that [myelopoeisis](/index.php?title=Myelopoeisis&action=edit&redlink=1) begins. [[29]](#cite_note-pmid19778207-29) During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation [thrombopoiesis](/index.php?title=Thrombopoiesis&action=edit&redlink=1), [granulopoeisis](/index.php?title=Granulopoeisis&action=edit&redlink=1), [monocytopoeisis](/index.php?title=Monocytopoeisis&action=edit&redlink=1). [[29]](#cite_note-pmid19778207-29) CLPs subsequently in a process designated [lymphopoiesis](/index.php/Lymphopoiesis). [[29]](#cite_note-pmid19778207-29) Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells [[22]](#cite_note-Landgraf-22) it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [[30]](#cite_note-pmid17293455-30) This hypothesis was substantiated colonies. [[30]](#cite_note-pmid17293455-30) Additionally, Hu et al. [[31]](#cite_note-pmid20444872-31) demonstrated that the homeobox protein, [HOXA9](/index.php/HOXA9), regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in [SPI1](/index.php/SPI1) (i.e. PU.1), [[31]](#cite_note-pmid20444872-31) a [transcription factor](/index.php/Transcription_factor) and a regulator of myelopoiesis, [[32]](#cite_note-pmid17374502-32) and a validated target of this miRNA. [[28]](#cite_note-pmid18055230-28) It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [[33]](#cite_note-pmid17964546-33) Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [[28]](#cite_note-pmid18055230-28) [[34]](#cite_note-pmid17463290-34) [[35]](#cite_note-pmid17463289-35) Finally, it that ( [Tregs](/index.php?title=Tregs&action=edit&redlink=1)) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown to play a role in Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting [SOCS1](/index.php?title=SOCS1&action=edit&redlink=1), a negative regulator for [IL-2](/index.php/Interleukin_2) signaling. [[36]](#cite_note-pmid19234151-36) [[37]](#cite_note-pmid19144316-37) Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-155-5p is an essential molecule in the control of several aspects of hematopoiesis including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis. Immune system The [innate immune system](/index.php/Innate_immune_system) constitutes the first line of defense against invading [pathogens](/index.php/Pathogens) and is regarded as the major initiator of [inflammatory](/index.php/Inflammation) responses. [[38]](#cite_note-pmid20303867-38) Its cellular [macrophages](/index.php/Macrophages), [granulocytes](/index.php/Granulocytes), and [dendritic cells](/index.php/Dendritic_cells) (DCs), of conserved pathogen structures ( [PAMPs](/index.php?title=PAMPs&action=edit&redlink=1)) by receptors](/index.php/Toll-like_receptors) ((TLRs)). [[39]](#cite_note-pmid15585605-39) MIR155HG (i.e. miR-155-5p) activates a chain of events that lead to the stimulation of the [NF-B](/index.php/NF-%CE%BAB) and [AP-1](/index.php/AP-1_(transcription_factor)) transcription factors, [[39]](#cite_note-pmid15585605-39) it was hypothesized that endotoxin activation of MIR155HG may be mediated by those transcription factors. [[40]](#cite_note-pmid16885212-40) Indeed, MIR155HG expression was found to be activated in LPS treated murine macrophage cells (i.e. Raw264.7) by an NF-B-mediated NF-B dependent up-regulation [[46]](#cite_note-pmid22509021-46) In the context of viral infection vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenge of murine peritoneal macrophages was to result in miR-155-5p over-expression via a retinoic acid-inducible gene I/JNK/NF-B-dependent pathway. [[47]](#cite_note-pmid20937844-47) Support for a role of AP-1 in MIR155HG activation comes from studies using stimuli relevant to viral infection such as TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) or [interferon beta](/index.php/Interferon_beta) (IFN-). [[42]](#cite_note-pmid17242365-42) Downstream of those stimuli AP-1 seems to play a major role in MIR155HG activation. [[42]](#cite_note-pmid17242365-42) [[48]](#cite_note-pmid20622002-48) [[49]](#cite_note-pmid20435894-49) [[50]](#cite_note-pmid19423639-50) Upon its initiation via activation of e.g. TLRs by pathogen stimuli miR-155-5p functions as a post-transcriptional regulator of innate immune signaling pathways. Importantly, miR-155-5p displays a similar responsivenes to pathogen stimuli TLR4 agonist LPS) marker mRNAs. [[51]](#cite_note-pmid23143100-51) Once activated, miR-155-5p suppresses negative include inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D also denoted SHIP1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suppression of which promotes cell survival, growth, migration, and anti-pathogen responses. [[47]](#cite_note-pmid20937844-47) [[52]](#cite_note-pmid19699171-52) [[53]](#cite_note-pmid19359473-53) [[54]](#cite_note-pmid19520806-54) Besides supporting the activation of defense pathways miR-155-5p may also limit the strength of the resulting NF-B dependent inflammatory response, [[51]](#cite_note-pmid23143100-51) suggesting varying functions of miR-155 at different stages of inflammation. Taken together, these observations imply that the activation of the MIR155HG may be context-dependent given that both AP-1- and NF-B-mediated mechanisms regulate the expression of this gene. These studies also suggest that a broad range of viral and bacterial inflammatory mediators can stimulate the expression of miR-155-5p and indicate that there is an intimate relationship between inflammation, innate immunity and MIR155HG expression. Activity and phenotypes There is evidence that miR-155 participates in cascades associated with [cardiovascular diseases](/index.php/Cardiovascular_disease) and hypertension, and was also found to be implicated in immunity, [genomic instability](/index.php?title=Genome_instability&action=edit&redlink=1), cell [differentiation](/index.php/Cellular_differentiation), inflammation, virus associated infections and cancer.[ [citation needed](/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Citation_needed&action=edit&redlink=1)] Protective roles of miR-155 may arise in response to its action on silencing genes thereby regulating their expression time, [mutations](/index.php/Mutation) in miR-155 target site deny it the optimal access necessary to bring about gene silencing, leading to over abundance of delinquent activities that may go [malignant](/index.php/Malignant_transformation), for example, miR-155 role as a protective agent against predisposition to B Cell associated malignancies is emphasized by maintaining ( [AID](/index.php?title=Activation-induced_(cytidine)_deaminase&action=edit&redlink=1)) enzyme. MiR-155 abundance and expression time upon immunological cues however, mutations in the target on AID mRNA result in its unresponsiveness to miR-155 silencing and lead to unbridled expression of its protein causing wild immature B-lymphocyte surges and AID-mediated [chromosomal translocations](/index.php/Chromosomal_translocation). [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) [[4]](#cite_note-pmid18093533-4) Clinical Transfection into human primary lung fibroblasts reduces the endogenous expression of the protein. Furthermore, AT1R mediates angiotensin II-related elevation in blood pressure and contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Defective miR-155 function could be implicated in [hypertension](/index.php/Hypertension) and cardiovascular diseases if the cis-regulatory site on 3` UTR of AT1R (miR-155 target site) was affected due to a [SNP polymorphism](/index.php/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism) in AT1R itself. This mutation is disruptive of miR-155 targeting and thus preventive of AT1R expression down-regulation. [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) In low blood pressure over-expression of miR-155 correlates with the impairment of AT1R activity. [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) Immunity miR-155 is involved in immunity by playing key roles in modulating humoral and innate cell-mediated immune responses, for example, In miR-155 deficient mice, immunological-memory is impaired; making it fall prey to repetitive bouts of invasions by the same pathogen (Rodriguez et al. 2007), maturation and specificity of miR-155-deficient B-lymphocytes are impaired since the process relies on AID enzyme which has a miR-155 target in its 3' UTR end. [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) [[4]](#cite_note-pmid18093533-4) The phenotypic consequences involving deficiency of miR-155 in mice show later in life where the animals develop lung and intestinal [lesions](/index.php/Lesion). [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) Activated B and T cells show increased miR-155 expression, the same goes for [macrophages](/index.php/Macrophage) and [dendritic cells](/index.php/Dendritic_cell) of the [immune system](/index.php/Immune_system). MiR-155 is crucial for proper lymphocyte development and maturation. Details of various manifestations of miR-155 levels and involvement in activities that ascertain optimal immune responses have been the subject of many researches: Reduction of IgG1 Defective T and B cells as well as markedly decreased [IgG1](/index.php/Immunoglobulin_G) responses were observed in miR-155-deficient mice, IgG1 is reduced whereas the expression of the [IgM](/index.php/Immunoglobulin_M) immunoglobulin remains normal in these mice. The change in IgG1 levels maybe explained by the fact that it is a target for miR-155 in B cells, the protein-encoding mRNA for the transcriptional regulator [Pu.1-protein](/index.php/SPI1), elevation of Pu.1 protein predisposes defective IgG1 production. In addition to Pu.1, there are nearly 60 other differentially elevated genes in miR-155 deficient B cells, further inspection revealed possible miR-155 target sites in the 3' UTR regions in these genes. [[4]](#cite_note-pmid18093533-4) Lymphocyte malignancies Mature receptors [affinity](/index.php/Dissociation_constant#Protein-ligand_binding) and specificity of lymphocytes to pathogenic agents underlie proper immune responses, optimal miR-155 coordination is required for manufacturing of normal B lymphocytes, production of high-affinity antibodies and balancing of BCR signalling. It has been demonstrated that miR-155 can be transferred through gap junctions from leukemic cells to healthy B cells and promote their transformation to tumorigenic-like cells [[55]](#cite_note-PN-55) Selection of competent B cells takes place in the [germinal center](/index.php/Germinal_center) where they are trained to differentiate body cells vs. foreign antigens, they compete for antigen recognition and for T cell help, in this fashion of selective pressure those B Cells that demonstrated high-affinity receptors and cooperation with T cells ( [affinity maturation](/index.php/Affinity_maturation)) are recruited and deployed to the bone marrow or become memory B cells, [apoptotic termination](/index.php/Apoptosis) takes place for those B Cells failing the competition. Immature B cells which are miR-155 deficient evade apoptosis as a result of elevated [Bcl-2 protein](/index.php/Bcl-2) levels; a protein that was found to be involved in B Cell malignancies and to be controlled by miR-155. [[4]](#cite_note-pmid18093533-4) Inflammation Inflammatory responses to triggers such as [TNF-](/index.php/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha) involve macrophages with components that include miR-155. miR-155 is overexpressed in atopic dermatitis and contributes to chronic skin inflammation by increasing the proliferative response of T(H) cells through the downregulation of In [Autoimmune disorders](/index.php/Autoimmune_disease) such as rheumatoid expression in patients' tissues and synovial fibroblasts. [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) In multiple sclerosis, increased expression of mir-155 has also been measured in peripheral and CNS-resident myeloid cells, including circulating blood monocytes and activated microglia. [[57]](#cite_note-pmid23818336-57) It was also found that mir-155 is implicated in inflammation. Overexpression of mir-155 will lead to chronic inflammatory state in human. [[58]](#cite_note-58) DNA viruses In [DNA viruses](/index.php/DNA_virus), miRNAs were experimentally verified, miRNAs in viruses are encoded by dsDNAs, [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) examples of such viruses include [herpesviruses](/index.php/Herpes_simplex_virus) such as Humans-Epstein-Barr Virus ( [EBV](/index.php/Epstein-Barr_virus)) and [adenoviruses](/index.php/Adenoviridae), [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) is the oncogenic MDV-1 whose non-oncogenic relative MDV-2 does not, this suggests implication of miR-155 in lymphomagenesis. [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) Viruses can exploit host miRNAs to the degree that they use host miRNAs to encode for viral clones for example: miR-K12-11 in [Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus](/index.php/Kaposi%27s_sarcoma-associated_herpesvirus) has a target specificity region [orthologous](/index.php/Homology_(biology)#Orthology) to that of miR-155's; mimicking the action of miR-155 [[59]](#cite_note-Skalsky-59) and, sharing targets with it, thus it can be thought to suppress miR-155 accessibility to its targets by competition and this in effect downregulates expression of genes playing roles in cellular growth and apoptosis in a manner that defies regulations by miR-155. [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) EBV modulates host miR-155 expression, which is essential for growth of EBV-infected B cells. [[60]](#cite_note-Linnstaedt-60) EBV-infected cells have increased expression of miR-155 thereby disturbing equilibrium of expression for genes regulating transcription in those cells. [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) Cancer Over-silencing by miR-155 may result in triggering oncogenic cascades that by apoptotic resistance, the decreased levels of TP53INP1 in pancreatic ductal [adenocarcinomas](/index.php/Adenocarcinoma) and possibly in other epithelial cancers where TP53INP1 activity is lost thereby resulting in apoptosis evasion and uncontrolled bouts of growth. [[3]](#cite_note-pmid19008191-3) Inactivation of DNA Mismatch Repair ( [MMR](/index.php/DNA_mismatch_repair)) as identified by elevation of mutation rates is the cause of [Lynch Syndrome](/index.php/Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer) (LS), also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), down-regulation of MMR controlling protein is carried out by over-expression of miR-155, MMR is controlled by a group of conserved proteins, reduced activity of these proteins results in elevated levels of mutations in the phenotype triggering a march towards developing this type of cancer. [[61]](#cite_note-pmid20351277-61) Other types of tumors in which miR-155 over-expression was reported include: thyroid carcinoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, and lung cancer, where distinct miR-155 [expression profiles](/index.php?title=Gene_expression_profiling&action=edit&redlink=1) quantification can potentially serve as signals for tumor detection and evaluation of prognosis outcome. [[2]](#cite_note-pmid19268705-2) It is shown in an analysis that miR-155 expression is associated with survival in triple negative breast cancer.
