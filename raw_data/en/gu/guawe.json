We make sure the oil is changed and the tires are rotated, but we don't set aside time to care for our bodies. If your car breaks down you can purchase another one; but you only get one body. Think of your body as your dream car and start taking steps to take better care of yourself. Feed your body with clean healthy food and water to make it run smoothly. Exercise your body to make it limber. And meditate to calm your mind. There are many benefits of using a holistic approach to your health. The mind, body and soul can all affect your overall well being. Chakras are seven points along your spinal cord, each in connection to major organs or glands. They play a role in balancing your life energy; therefore, if they are out of alignment, it can negatively affect your health. Our Chakra Healing Treatment is a wonderful treatment to realign your chakras and rebalance your mind, body and soul. How to Balance Your Chakras Our treatment starts with positive intentions or affirmations. Coupled with the calming atmosphere of our massage room and relaxing music, this step sets the tone for the rest of the treatment and helps you take in as much positive energy as possible throughout the session. \"This step really helps to balance your emotional state of mind. Positive affirmations help to release any fear or emotions we hold in our bodies,\" says Melissa, RELAX The Spa general manager. Next we use our special RELAX The Spa essential oils to open your senses and help you relax even further. At this point you should be ready for chakra alignment. The treatment uses a combination of healing stones, a warm conditioning scalp treatment, and a foot massage. The stones work to balance each of the seven separate chakras, while the scalp and foot massage work to relax the highest and lowest points on your body. Tension is often carried in these areas so special attention is best for full realignment. How to Balance Your Chakras at Home To get the most out of your treatment, continue positive affirmations at home. The way you think about yourself and others can change the outlook on your life and others. Having a strong positive mind and thinking good thoughts brings you more happiness. Taking two minutes every morning before you get out of bed to say a few positive affirmations such as, \"My heart is full of love for who I am\" or \"I bring joy to the world,\" can steer your whole day in a positive direction. When you repeat them often, and believe in them, you can start to make real positive changes in your life.
