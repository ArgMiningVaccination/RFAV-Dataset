The community health improvement process yields two distinct , but connected deliverables: the Community Health Assessment and the Community Health Improvement P lan. The Community Health A ssessment is not a singular activity , but a developmental process that is added to and amended over time. It is not an end in itself , but a way of using information to plan public health programs in the future. The ultimate goal of a Community Health A ssessment is to develop strategies to address the community's health needs and identified issues, providing the foundation for improving and promoting the health of our community . The Community Health A ssessment uses quantitative and qualitative methods to collect and examine health status indica tors and provide an understand ing of health in a community. Risk factors, mortality, morbidity, forces of change, the capacity of the local public health system, quality of life, community assets, social determinants of health, and health inequities were collected to identify the community's key health issues. Ultimately, the Community H ealth Assessment guides the devel opment and implementation of a Community Health I mprovement Plan by justifying how and where resources should be allocated to best meet comm unity needs . 1 The benefits of conducting a Community Health Assessment include: Improved organizational and community coordination and collaboration ; Increased knowledge about public health and the interconnectedness of activities ; Strengthened partnerships within our local public health systems ; Identified strengths and weaknesses to address in quality improvement efforts; and Benchmarks for public health practice improvements .2 Through this process, LCHD/CHC and the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee , engaged a diverse array of community members and broad representation from the local public health system to identify health issues affecting the residents of Lake County. Th ese collaborations are intended to foster shared owners hip for health among our stakeholders. Presented on the following pages are the results of analys es from multiple surveys, focus groups, facilitated discussions, and data sets.

MAPP follows seven guiding principles: 1. Systems Thinking 2. Dialogue 3. Shared Vision 4. Data 5. Partnerships and Collaboration 6. Strategic Thinking 7. Celebration of Successes The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) and the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC) created the MAPP framework as a strategic approach for community health improvement that creates a healthy community and better way of life, increases the visibility of public health within the community, anticipates and mana ges change, creates a stronger public health infrastructure, and engages the community and creates community ownership for public health issues . Since its completion in 2000, MAPP has become the leading tool that he alth departments and their partners use to guide public health planning processes . To begin Lake County's planning process, LCHD/CHC supported community efforts by conduct ing the four MAPP Assessments: Local Public Health System Assessment - Conducted on June 18, 2015, this assessment utilized the National Public Health Standards Program assessment of the components, activities, competencies and capacities of the local public health system and analyzed how well the Essential Public Health Services are delivered. Forces of Change Assessment - Condu cted on October 23, 2015, the assessment identified the forces that affect or will be affecting the community and public health system, as well as the threats or opportunities that result. Community Themes and Strengths Assessment - Conducted from Sep tember to December of 2015, the assessment identified the community 's interest s, perceptions about quality of life in Lake Cou nty, and community assets. Community Health Status Assessment - Throughout 2015, primary and secondary data were gathered to descr ibe the health status, quality of life, demographics, and behavioral risk factors in the community. 3,4 3 http://archived.naccho.org/topics/infrastructure/mapp/framework/upload/MAPP -Brochure -2.pdf 4 http://www.naccho.org/programs/public -health- infrastructure/mapp SELECTED COMMUNITY H EALTH PRIORITIES 6 Selected Community Health Priorities FOUR COMMUNITY HEAL TH PRIORITIES 1. Cardiovascular disease and hypertension 2. Behavioral health 3. Obesity 4. Diabetes While the health improvement priorities were selected based on the most recent data available, the conditions have emerged as driving factors in resident health over longer time horizons. Lake County has experienced upward trends in the prevalence of these key chronic conditions. Historical data supports the growing magnitude of these health issues. HISTORIC TRENDS Hypertension rates have increased dramatically. Between the first round of the I -BRFSS in 1998 and the Lake County Community Health Survey in 2015, the percentage of adults reporting that they have hypertension has increased from 18% to 35%, nearly doubling over the interval. While some demographic shifts such as an aging population can help to explain some of the increase in disease, the burden of the condition is ultimately much higher now than in the past. 15%20%25%30%35%40% ROUND 1 - 1998ROUND 2 - 2001 -2003ROUND 3 - 2004 -2006ROUND 4 - 2007 -2009LCHD SURVEY 2015HYPERTENSION RATESSELECTED COMMUNITY H EALTH PRIORITIES 7 Obesity contributes to an individual's risk of chronic conditions, osteoarthritis, and other health issues that disrupt quality of life. While obesity rates in the county remain slightly lower than the state, obesity has increased by 5% in the past 12 years. The percentage of adults who are overweight has remained relatively stable. 62% of adults in Lake County are overweight or obese. While complete or historical data sets do not exist in Lake County for children, childhood obesity is an emerging national and stat e priority. Diabetes in adults has increased over time from 3.4% to 6% . An additional 14% have been diagnosed with prediabetes and are at greater risk of developing the disease. 15%20%25%30%35%40%45% ROUND 2 -2001 - 2003ROUND 3 -2004 - 2006ROUND 4 -2007 - 2009ROUND 5 -2014RATES OF OBESITY Obesity Overweight Linear (Obesity) Linear (Overweight) 0%1%2%3%4%5%6%7%8% ROUND 1 - 1998ROUND 2 - 2001 -2003ROUND 3 - 2004 -2006ROUND 4 - 2007 -2009ROUND 5 - 2014DIABETES RATESSUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 8 Summary Assessment Results LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT Lake Count y's Local Public Health System Assessment was convened by the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee on June 18th, 2015 at Rosalind Franklin University. The Local Public Health System Assessment (LPHSA) is one of the four assessments Lake County is worki ng on as part of its Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process. MAPP is a community -driven strategic planning framework utilized in community health improvement. This framework assists communities not only in the prioritization of public health issues, but in creating a platform to develop and implement efforts to address them, leading to action. Assessment Instrument The National Public Health Performance Standar ds Program (NPHPSP) is a collaborative effort of seven national partners to enhance the Nation's public health systems. This program has established a local assessment instrument to measure the performance of local public health systems (LPHS) --defined as the collective efforts of public, private and voluntary entities, as well as individuals and informal associations that contribute to the public's health within a jurisdiction (for a list of assessment participants, please see Appendix A on page 148) . The purpose of the NPHPSP local instrument is to improve public health system performance. The instrument assists in doing the following: Complete the local public health system assessment with documented discussion and scores related to each performance meas ure. Enhance the understanding of the public health system. Build relationships within the public health system. Foster an interest and awareness in performance improvement. The instrument is framed around the 10 Essential Public Health Services that are utilized in the field to describe the scope of public health. For each essential service in the local instrument, there are model standards that describe or correspond to the primary activities conducted at the local level. There are a total of 30 model standards in this instrument. For each model standard, there are a series of discussion questions that break down the standard into its component parts. After completing the discussion questions, participants vote on the performance measures of the model sta ndard. A consensus of participant votes is required to finalize the score of each performance measure. The scores of the performance measures determine the final score of the corresponding essential service. The scoring system utilized for the essential services, model standards, and the performance measures is below: SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 9 LPHSA Scoring Chart Optimal Activity (76-100%) Greater than 75% of the activity described within the question is met. Significant Activity (51-75%) Greater than 50% but no more than 75% of the activity described within the question is met. Moderate Activity (26-50%) Greater than 25% but no more than 50% of the activity described within the question is met. Minimal Activity (1-25%) Greater than zero but no more than 25% of the activity described within the question is met. No Activity (0%) 0% or absolutely no activity. Assessment Methodology The assessment began with an opening 60 -minute plenary session to welcome participants, provide an overview of the process, introduce the staff, and answer questions. The opening plenary session also consisted of activities to introduce participants to specific concepts of the assessment process and keep them engaged throughout the day . Participants were then broken into five groups; each breakout group was responsible for conducting the assessment for two essential public hea lth services (EPHS). Throughout the day, participants helped build a connectedness diagram to map the Local Public Health System (Appendix B, page 151). Participants also prov ided a word to describe what makes them passionate about their work. Their responses were used to generate a Wordle (Appendix C, page 152). Each group was professionally facilitated by a trained facilitator and discussion notes were captured by a recorder. The day ended with a plenary session where improvement opportunities of each essential service were reported by participants of each group. During this time, participants were also given an opportunity to provide feedback on the event through a written su rvey. The end -of-day dialogue outlined the next steps of the assessment process and encouraged participants to contact the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee for further involvement in MAPP activities. SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 10 Assessment Finding s 1. Surveillance Capacity and Data Sharing Surveillance is the continuous collection, analysis, and interpretation of health -related data needed for planning, implementation, and evaluation in public health practice. I t is important for the local public health system to have the capaci ty for surveillance of a number of conditions, including chronic diseases, infectious disease outbreaks, mental health conditions, and reportable diseases. The data collected should be accessible and shared within the local public health system and with th e general public. 2. Increasing Health Equity Education Health inequities are differences in population health status and health conditions that are systemic, patterned, unfair, unjust, and actionable. These differences are avoidable, and arise from social an d economic inequalities, including socio -economic status, race/ethnicity, age, and sex/gender. Health equity education helps in reducing health inequities in the community. 3. Public Health System Awareness - General Public To navigate the local public healt h system competently, education and awareness of the system and its activities should be continuously disseminated to the general public. 4. Evaluating Population -Based Health Services Effective evaluations of population -based health services are necessary fo r improving and guiding public health activities; ensuring evidence -based decision -making and action; making efforts outcome -oriented; and ensuring accountability. 5. Public Health System Awareness - Community Partners and Stakeholders A well -functioning publ ic health system has strong partnerships where partners recognize they are part of the public health system through continuous channels of communication, resource sharing, as well as data sharing. 6. Linkage Between Academia and Public Health Practice: Resea rch Infrastructure To improve public health practice, education and research, it is important to coordinate and collaborate with academic and research based institutions. Collaboration is important not only to ensure development of a well -trained, competent workforce, but to strengthen the use of evidence- base practices in public health. 7. Continuous Quality Improvement Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) is a process to ensure programs are systematically and intentionally improving services. CQI is a proce ss-based, data -driven approach to improving the quality of product or service. The ongoing process involves the Plan, Do, Study, Act cycle. 8. Linkage to Personal Health Services Personal health services include all services dealing with the promotion, maint enance, and restoration of health. Provision of services to the general public depends on the availability of key resources as well as effective care coordination. SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 11 FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT The Forces of Change Assessment is designed to help key communit y stakeholders answer the questions: \"What is occurring or might occur that affects the health of our community or the local public health system? \" and \"What specific threats or opportunities are generated by these occurrences? \" Assessment Instrument The L ive Well Lake County Steering Committee began the assessment by brainstorming potential forces of change across five broad categories: political, environmental, legal/ethical, social/economic, and technological/scientific. Within each category, the group w as asked: What forces are occurring or might occur that affects the health of our community or the local public health system? What specific threats or opportunities are generated by these occurrences? Assessment Methodology Participants brainstormed potential forces and shared them with facilitators. Like -minded themes were grouped using an affinity diagram to identify overarching forces that shape or influence the public health system and community. The effects of these force s may have an impact on any part of the public health system, including resources, strategic issues, infrastructure, culture, or the environment. To identify methods to enhance or mitigate the effects of these forces, participants then identified threats posed and opportunities created within each force. Participants also acknowledged additional information that was needed within the system to appropriately address specific forces as well as local organizations that were believed to have experience or know ledge to address barriers. Participants completed this process for each of the five categories and then thoughtfully considered what his/her top priorities were regarding the most influential forces of change for Lake County. The forces perceived to be mos t impactful can be found in the summary of results. Assessment Results Results of the FoCA shed light on potential forces that may affect the local public health system 's capacity to implement the Community Health Improvement Plan and thus improve the health status of those who live, work, play and pray in Lake County. Live Well Lake County will be proactive in leveraging collaborative partnerships to address expected forces through the identification of social, scientific, technological, organizational an d institutional resources. While all identified forces should be considered, those six ranked (see table below) as having the most impact on the county should be given priority when identifying and building system capacity to address strategic issues. Seve ral forces may be unique to the current assessment, while others may also appear during one of the other MAPP assessments.

The CTSA focuses on opinions and perceptions of residents regarding the quality of life and health in the community as well as community assets. It creates a portrait of the community seen through the eyes of the residents. Assessment Instrument The assessment was divided into three categories: 1. Community Strengths Survey 2. Focus Groups 3. Photovoice Assessment Methodology Community Strengths Survey The Community Strengths Survey was conducted to understand the op inions and perceptions of Lake County residents regarding the quality of life and health in their community. The survey was developed through a CTSA workgroup that consisted of members of the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee and LCHD/CHC staff. A t otal of 14 survey questions were developed that focused on demographics, quality of life, health, and strengths in the community ( Appendix D, page 153 ). The survey was distributed online and through paper copies and was available in English and Spanish. The online survey link was distributed to community partners and organizations throughout Lake County through the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee and LCHD/CHC email list -serves, website posts, newsletters, flyers, and social media messages. The link was accompanied by a message that encouraged individuals to forward the link to others to increase the reach of the survey in the community. The primary focus of d istribution for the paper copies was organizations that are able to reach residents who may not have the opportunity to take the survey online. Paper copies were also distributed to organizations that normally have a large amount of residents who visit the ir location on a daily basis. The paper copies were given as a package, with a box for completed surveys, promotional material in English and Spanish, documents that explained how to distribute the survey, and answers to frequently asked questions. SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 14 Focus Groups Using a health equity lens, focus groups were conducted to provide a voice to underserved and underrepresented populations. The results helped to provide further insight into the survey findings through intensive discussions with residents on their perceptions of quality of life and health in their communities. The in -depth questions that were developed for the focus groups were based off of the questions from the Community Strengths survey ( Appendix E, page 159 ). Groups were selected to provide an equitable representation of demographics, including race, ethnicity, language, and socioeconomic status. Four focus groups were conducted: (1) African Americans, (2) persons with physical disabilities and/or visual impairments, (3) Korean Americans conduct ed in Korean, and (4) recent Latino immigrants conducted in Spanish. The Live Well Lake County Steering Committee, along with the LCHD/CHC partnered with community -based organizations to help with participant recruitment and hosting the focus groups. A to tal of 42 adults participated across the four focus groups. The group size for each ranged from 8 -14 participants with discussions lasting between 60 and 90 minutes. One health department staff member facilitated the conversation while another took notes. The conversations were audio recorded to accurately capture all of the ideas and opinions of the participants. Two of the groups were conducted in languages other than English: Korean and Spanish. The organizations that hosted focus groups in Korean and Sp anish provided a staff member to facilitate language translation between the focus group facilitator and the participants. To promote consistency in data collection and reporting, a focus group facilitator guide, note -taker template, and focus group summa ry table were developed. The focus group facilitator guide included: recommendations on how to conduct and record a focus group session; logistics and materials; and a script for the facilitator to follow. In an effort to ensure the anonymity of the partic ipants, names were not collected and all introductions were conducted prior to audio recording. After the focus groups were conducted, the data was transcribed, analyzed, and interpreted. The results of each individual focus group were analyzed separately and then analyzed collectively with the other focus groups. The transcriptions were coded and categorized by question. SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 15 Photovoice Photovoice is a research tool used to gain community -level perspectives from target populations using photography as a mea ns of expression. The three main goals of Photovoice are to (1) enable people to record and reflect their community's strengths and concerns, (2) to promote critical dialogue and knowledge about important issues through group discussion of the photographs, and (3) to reach policymakers1. The Live Well Lake County Steering committee utilized Photovoice to answer the following questions: (1) \"How does your community positively and negatively affect your health?\" and (2) \"How does your community prevent or all ow for behaviors which can lead to obesity?\" High school students in Lake County were selected as participants in this project to provide a platform for youth to voice their opinions on community health; to educate youth on public health concepts; and engage youth in the community health improvement process. Participants were purposefully recruited from schools and youth advocacy groups that were geographically and socioeconomically diverse. The following groups were recruited: Adlai E. Stevenson High S chool's HOSA group (Health Occupation Students of America). Seven students from HOSA participated. Adlai E. Stevenson High School is located in Lincolnshire (South Central Lake County) and provides representation of a middle upper class to upper class soci oeconomic status. Zion -Benton Township High School's photography class. The photography teacher made Photovoice part of the coursework. Thirteen students from the class participated. Zion -Benton High School is located in northeast Lake County, representin g diverse socioeconomics and racial/ethnic composi tion. REALITY Illinois and the Youth Advisory Board groups in the greater Gurnee area and the greater Lake Zurich area. REALITY Illinois and the Youth Advisory Board group are a tobacco and alcohol policy and advocacy group created by and for Illinois teens. It is funded by the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Lake County Underage Drinking and Drug Prevention Task Force. A total of fifteen students participated from REALITY Illinois across the t wo group locations. Both locations provide a broad representation of central and south western Lake County.

The health issues were then ranked based on survey responses, topics that were heavily discussed in the focus groups, and photos taken by students. Rank Priority 1 Poor diet and inactivity 2 Chronic Disease (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer) 3 Substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and drug use) 4 Safe Affordable Housing 5 Older Adult Health (arthritis, hearing/vision, Alzheimer's disease/Dementia) 6 Community Safety (community violence and domestic violence) 7 Food Environment (Availability of affordable, healthy food) 8 Mental Health 9 Cultural Sensitivity and Linguistic Capacity 10 Health Literacy SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 18 COMMUNITY HEALTH STA TUS ASSESSMENT Lake County's Community Health Status Assessment was conducted from July 2015 through January 2016. During this time, LCHD/CHC collected, analyzed, and interpreted a variet y of primary and secondary data from across sectors and sources. Data were used to develop a comprehensive understanding of the health of the community at large and the systems in which Lake County residents live, work, and play. Assessment Instrument Data were collected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the health conditions and behaviors of individuals within the community and systemic features in the community that can help or hinder a person's health or quality of life. The Community Health St atus Assessment focuses on quantitative health information rather than the qualitative or interpretive information of system participants. Community health status measures can be compared against other county, state, and national measures to better underst and a community's strengths and opportunities for improvement. It allows community members to see markers of health for residents and the community as they are at the time of the assessment. Information was organized into 11 distinct categories that capture the defining features of a community: Demographic Characteristics, Socioeconomic Characteristics, Health Resources Availability (General Health and Access to Care), Quality of Life, Behavioral Risk Factors, Environmental Health Indicators, Social a nd Mental Health, Maternal and Child Health, Morbidity and Mortality (Death, Illness, and Injury), Infectious Disease, and Sentinel Events. Assessment Methodology The CHSA contains the essential quantitative indicators necessary for the community health i mprovement planning process. Because community health crosses so many sectors, the data collection strategy and sources must reflect a diverse set of conditions, contributors, and indicators. Indicators were selected to provide a robust assessment of the c ommunity as a whole. Secondary data is any data set that is collected by another entity for purposes other than the immediate project at hand. The more complete, regular secondary data sets are fundamental resources for the planning process. While secondary data resources provide a solid foundation from which to assess community health, these do not provide a complete picture of health in Lake County. Priorities from community partners challenge LCHD/CHC to explore alternatives to capture info rmation on areas not covered by other data sets. Data sets related to mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) are rarely available at the loc al level . Primary data collected by LCHD/CHC is helping to ill the gap.

On average, adults in Lake County exercise 3.5 days per week.7 Only 15% of adults in Lake County eat five or more fruits and vegetables per day. 49% of adults in the county have two or fewer fruits and vegetables per day. On average, adults in the county eat about 2.9 fruits and vegetables per day. Environmental Health Indicators An average of 18 new lead cases were opened annually from 2010 -2015, resulting in a rate of about 2 cases per 1,000 blood draws. From 2010 to 2015, the proportion of \"Good\" days for air quality exceeded 86% for each individual year; from 2013 to 2015, \"Good\" days were 93% or more. In 2012, excessively hot and humid conditions are thought to have reduced air quality in Lake County, resulting in a total of 17 days that were conside red \"Unsafe for Sensitive Groups\" and two days that were \"Unhealthy Days.\" This year was an outlier compared to the other years . Social and Mental Health 36% of adults in Lake County had one or more days of \"not good\" mental health in the past month and 14% of adults had been unable to perform normal tasks because of poor mental health for a day or more in the past month. On average, mental health prevents usual activities for 0.9 days per adult. Maternal and Child Health From 2010- 2013, 74.0% of birth s carried to term in Lake County received care during their first trimester. The ave rage rate of adolescent births wa s 19.6 per 1,000 adolescent women, lower than the 2011 rate in Illinois (29.5) and the United States (31.3). 7.4% of births in Lake County were considered low birthweight (below 2500g ), better than Illinois (8.2%) and United States (8.0%) rates. 9.4% of babies in Lake County were born premature, lower than the overall rates for Illinois (10.1%) and United States (11.4%). 6 County Health Rankings 2016 7 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 21 Death, Illness, and Injury The LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey and Secretary of State records provided the timeliest rates of a variety of health conditions: 8 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 9 Secretary of State, 2010 -2014 Chronic Di sease Percent of Lake County8 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 4% Skin Cancer 8% Some other type of Cancer 6% Arthritis 21% Kidney Disease 3% Heart Attack 3% Heart Disease (Any) 6% High Blood 35% Obesity9 23% SUMMARY ASSESSMENT R ESULTS 22 These are the top ten causes of death in Lake County , from 2010 -2014 : Cause of Death10 Crude Rate per 100,000 Cancer 149.2 Diseases of the Heart 133.6 Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases 30.2 Cerebrovascular Diseases (Stroke) 28.9 Accidents (Unintentional Injuries) 25.1 Diabetes Mellitus 18.5 Alzheimer's disease 16.2 Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis 13.7 Influenza and pneumonia 12.9 Intentional self -harm (suicide) 9.8 Infectious Disease From 2012- 2015, the overall rate of Chlamydia was 28.4 per 10,000 Lake County residents. Rates of gonorrhea across the county were 5.2 per 10,000 residents. Early syphilis was diagnosed in 0.2 per 10,000 residents over this window. This burden is highly dependent on geography, race and ethnicity, age, and sex. Sentinel Events Drug overdose deaths in 2014 (largely driven by opioids) for Illinois occurred at an age -adjusted rate of 13.1 per 100,000 residents.11 In Lake Coun ty, deaths to all drugs in 2015 were 9.8 per 100,000 residents. Of those, 84% were caused by opiates.12 Deaths do not capture the full burden of prescription and illicit opioid use. While county data are not available for rates of opioid abuse, an important risk factor begins with legal use of prescription opioids. In the past year , 15% of adults in Lake County reported that they had been prescribed an opioid drug in the past twelve months.13 If this medication is not managed properly and attentively by the prescribing doctor, individuals prescribed opioids or others in their household can develop dependence or abuse these drugs. 10 CDC WONDER 2010 -2014. 11 Rudd, R.A, Aleshire, N., Zibbell, J.E., (2016) \"Increases Drug and Opioid Overdose Deaths - United States, 2000- 2014.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 23 Contributing Factors HEAL TH BEHAVIORS AND CHRONIC CONDITIONS When identifying gaps in health behaviors and systemic factors that mi ght lead to adverse health outcomes, local data are especially important to understanding the challenges and opportunities that are unique to the Lake County community. For example, obese and not obese individuals were found to have different rates of cert ain health behaviors related to nutrition and physical activity. These gaps drive the prevention and management needs of Lake County. Nutrition Through the Lake County Community Health Survey, we know that community members who are affected by obesity are participating in fewer health -promoting behaviors than those without the condition. Obese individuals were about 25% less likely than individuals who were not obese to have had three or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day and only half as likel y to have had five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Most adults, regardless of weight status, are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables per day, but those with obesity are even less likely to be getting enough. Physical Activity In a similar way, the survey revealed that obese individuals are only half as likely as their not obese peers to get at least three days of 30 minutes of exercise per week and less than half as likely to be active for 30 minutes for five or more days per week. Adults in both categories are not meeting weekly physical activity needs, but the gap is greater among individuals with the chronic condition. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Obese Not ObeseFruit and Vegetable Consumption Among Obese and Not Obese Adults 3 or more fruits and veggies per day 5 or more fruits veggies per day 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% Obese Not ObesePhysical Activity Among Obese and Not Obese Adults 3 or more days physically active 5 or more days physically activeCONTRIBUTING FACTORS 24 SOCIAL DRIVERS Socioeconomic status greatly influences an individual's health status. Th rough the survey tool, educational attainment and income were found to be related to rates of the priority conditions. Improved educational attainment and increased household income reduced overall rates of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. The trends i dentified here do not directly correspond to the overall rates in Lake County because stratifying by educational attainment created comparative populations with a higher average age; however, average age between groups is comparable. EDUCATIONAL ATT AINME NT When c ommunity health surveys were stratified by educational attainment, disparities emerged between groups by highest level of education. Educational attainment has a protective effect that increases with dose, that is, the higher an individual's level o f education, the less likely that person is to experience an adverse health outcome. For hypertension , the condition remains common across all education levels. Individuals with bachelor's and advanced degrees are still affected by the condition, but at rates about 10% lower than their peers with high school or less as their highest level of education. Those with some college or technical degrees fell in the middle of the range. Obesity was also found to be mediated by level of education. Those with less than a bachelor's degree had 8% higher rates of obesity, or nearly 50% more likely to be obese. In a similar way, diabetes was highly mediated by education level, where those with a high school degree or less had 6% higher rates of diabetes, or about 40% more likely than those with a bachelor's to have been diagnosed with the condition. 35%40%45%50% HIGH SCHOOL OR LESS SOME COLLEGE BACHELOR'S DEGREE ADVANCED DEGREEHYPERTENSION RATES 15%20%25%30%35% HIGH SCHOOL OR LESS SOME COLLEGE BACHELOR'S DEGREE ADVANCED DEGREEOBESITY RATES 5%10%15%20% HIGH SCHOOL OR LESS SOME COLLEGE BACHELOR'S DEGREE ADVANCED DEGREEDIABETES RATES High School or Less Some College Bachelor's Degree Advanced Degree High School or Less Some College Bachelor's Degree Advanced Degree High School or Less Some College Bachelor's Degree Advanced Degree CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 25 INCOME Income represents resources that can support health and wellbeing. Lake County's income breaks relatively evenly into three groups: households making less than $50,000 per year, households making between $50,000 and $100,000 per year , and households making more than $100,000 per year . By comparing income bracke ts and relative rates for the priority conditions, patterns emerge for the prevalence of these conditions. For hypertension , individuals from the lowest third of households responding reported rates of the condition at about 18% higher rates. These individuals were about 50% more likely than those in either of the other two brackets to experience hypertension. Individuals in the $50,000 -$100,000 and > $100,000 brackets are still affected by hypertension but with less frequency than those in the lowest income bracket. Obesity follows a different, more linear pattern. Each of the three income brackets had differen t rates of obesity. A gap of 13% was found between those in the lowest third and those in the highest. The middle income bracket nearly split the difference between the two groups. For more information on how household income is related to obesity rates, r efer to the \"Obesity in Lake County: 2015 Status Report.\" Diabetes followed a pattern similar to hypertension. The lowest income bracket faces the highest burden, with relative rates more than double those in the highest two brackets. The middle and high i ncome groups have similar, lower rates. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Hypertension Obesity DiabetesChronic Conditions by Income Bracket < $50K $50-100K > $100KIDENTIFYING TARGET C OMMUNITIES 26 Identifying T arget Communities HOU SING STRESS Safe, affordable housing contributes to overall wellbeing. Housing stress identifies challenges related to the cost a household spends on housing (> 30% of income), o vercrowding in households (more than 1.5 persons per room), or incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities. Some communities in Lake County are faced with a disproportionate burden of housing stress. To get a sense of the housing burden in smaller areas, thi s map displays the percentage of residents of census tracts who pay more than 30% of their income towards housing costs making them financially housing stressed. 14 Severe housing stress includes the physical limits of housing (incomplete facilities or overcrowding) or households that spend over 50% of their income on housing; 18% of Lake County residents face severe housing stress. 15 EDUCATIONAL ATTAINME NT Educati on supports improved health outcomes. Higher levels of education are generally associated with better jobs, higher wages, improved likelihood of having insurance and access to healthcare services, and better literacy and comprehension of health information . Educational disparities perpetuate inequities. While much of Lake County enjoys high educational achievement, certain communities lag behind and are therefore more vulnerable to negative health outcomes. 14 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average (2010 -2014). 15 University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. County Health Rankings 2016.

The most economically vulnerable in the community are disproportionately exposed to stressors and lack the resources to combat these challenges. The highlighted quintile of census tracts represent the highest rates of overall poverty, from 15.8 - 46.1% of residents in each census tract. CHILDHOOD POVERTY Childhood poverty is especially insidious. Childhood poverty is generally higher than the overall poverty rates. Contributing to chronic stress and limiting academic achievement, poverty in childhood has lasting social and health repercussions. Again, children in certain communities are more greatly burdened by poverty than others. Poverty Rate 0.4%5.3% 9.1% TARGET C OMMUNITIES 28 ECONOMIC AND EDUCATION COMPOSITE BY CENSUS TRACT From the Social Drivers section, education and income were identified as key contributors to adverse health outcomes. Different communities bear different burdens of economic hardship and lack of educational attainment. Using data from the U.S. Census's Am erican Community Survey's Five -Year Average (2010 -2014), the bottom quartile of Census tracts (20% of Census tracts with the highest rates of these key factors) were identified and highlighted on this map. Composite score was determined by summing three dr iving factors of health outcomes: rate of overall poverty in the Census tract, rate of childhood poverty (poverty rate of individuals under 18) in the Census tract, and rate of adults 25 and older without high school, an equivalent credential, or higher. S cores were broken into quantiles to identify areas of greatest need. Concentrated poverty and low education levels suggest these communities are more vulnerable to health disparities than peers without these factors. Because these areas face the greatest c hallenges of determinants, it is expected that they will face the highest rates of health challenges and the priority chronic diseases. PERCENT OF POPULATIO N THAT IS OBESE BY Z IP CODE Obesity is the most robust data set available to LCHD/CHC and can be u sed here as a proxy for adverse health outcomes. Though data are available at the ZIP code level rather than by census tract, the burden of social drivers corresponds to the burden of obesity in the ZIP code. For a guide to identifying commu nities by ZIP c ode, please see A ppendix F on pages 160 . PRIORITIZATION PROCE SS 29 Prioritization Process PURPOSE LCHD/CHC used data to guide decision -making during the 2016 community health improvement process. LCHD/CHC adapted the recommended Hanlon Method from materials available through the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO)16 to meet the needs of the Lake County assessment. HANLON METHOD The traditional Hanlon Method considers four criteria of individual health problems: size of the problem, seriousness of t he problem, estimated effectiveness of the solution, and PEARL factors (propriety, economic feasibility, acceptability, resource availability, and legality). For the modified method, there is a focus only on the first two criteria (size and seriousness). B ecause of the variety of potential interventions for any health issue, it is more appropriate to allow participants in the planning process to select effective strategies after the driving health challenges in the community were selected so the priorities would be based on the highest areas of need. By initially utilizing size and seriousness, the data -driven process minimized bias during prioritization of the most impactful health issues in Lake County. SIZE Size is scored on a scale of 1 to 10 and taken directly from the guiding document provided by NACCHO. Percent of population afflicted was either a prevalence or an incidence measure, depe nding on the health issue. 16 \"Tip Sheet: Prioritizing Issues in a Community Health Improvement Process.\" Community Health Assessments and Community Health Improvement Plans for Accreditation Preparation Demonstration Project. Accessed at: http://archived.naccho.org/topics/infrastructure/CHAIP/upload/Final -Issue -Prioritization- Resource -Sheet.pdf SS 30 SERIOUSNESS To remove as much subjectivity as possible from the \"seriousness\" criteria, specific values were enumerated. Morbidity, mortality, and health equity were deemed to be the values that drive seriousness. These designations allowed health equity to be incorporated into all future decisions throughout the process, assuring that vulnerable populations and communities receive the attention they need in order to be healthy. Each criteria is worth one point unless oth erwise noted. The rubric is as follows: SCORING LCHD/CHC developed a comprehensive list of potential health issues using the results of the four community health needs assessments conducted in 2015. Priorities were assessed through literature review to determine the extent to which each health issue met each of the criteria. From this literature review, subscores for both size and seriousness were determined. The values were combined to calculate a composite score an d priorities were ranked based on the following formula, which matches the guidance from the NACCHO document but excludes the effectiveness and feasibility measures: Hanlon Score = Size + (2 x Seriousness) Value Criteria Morbidity (3pts) Does the condition reduce an individual's quality of life? Does the condition cost more than $300 annually in medical expenses? Does the condition cost more than $1000 annually in all related costs? Mortality (3pts) Does the condition contribute to early death in Lake County? Is it one of the identified top 15 rankable causes of death in Lake County? (1-5 rank = 2pts, 6 -15 = 1pt) Health Equity (3pts) Is the condition more prevalent in disadvantaged populations? Is the morbidity burden greater in disadvantaged populations? Are disadvantaged populations more likely to die of this condition? Comparability (1pt) Relative to data available for other geographies (state or national), is Lake County better (0 pts), equivalent (0.5 pts), or worse (1pt)? PRIORITIZATION PROCE SS 31 TOP HEALTH ISSUES IN LAKE COUNTY After assessing all identified potential priorities, LCHD/CHC identified the top eight health issues with their associated Hanlon Scores. These health issues were presented as potential priorities for the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee to discus s and vote. At this point in the process, feasibility and the PEARL factors were taken into consideration. Each health issue was discussed in terms of feasibility (capacity, finances, and resources) and effectiveness (success and impact). In order to assure an inclusive health issue, the Steering Committee selected to change \"Depression and Suicide\" to \"Behavioral Health\" to capture substance abuse issues. Using a prioritization matrix method, each Steering Committee member was given four v otes to select their four top priorities. The Steering Committee members could only vote for each health issues once. Hanlon Score Top Eight Health Issues 27 Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension 25 Obesity 23 Depression and Suicide 23 Diabetes 22 Asthma and COPD 22 Tobacco and Lung Cancer 21 Healthy Pregnancies 21 Kidney Disease LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT 32 Local Public Health System Assessment INTRODUCTION Lake County's Local Public Health System Assessment was convened by the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee on June 18th, 2015 at Rosalind Franklin University. The Local Public Health System Assessment (LPHSA) is one of four assessments Lake County is conducting as part of its Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership s (MAPP) process. MAPP is a community -driven strategic planning framework utilized in community health improvement. This framework assists communities to prioritize public health issues and create a platform to develop and implement efforts to address them. The LPHSA assesses the capacity and the extent to which the local public health system implements the 10 Essential Public Health Services (EPHS). ASSESSMENT INSTRUMEN T The National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP) established a tool to measure the performance o f local public health systems, defined as the collective efforts of public, private, and voluntary entities, as well as individuals and informal associations. Thi s tool supports participants to: Complete the local public health system assessment Enhance the understanding of the public health system Build relationships within the public health system Foster an interest and awareness in performance improvement The instrument is framed around the 10 Essential Public Health Services that are utilized in the field to describe the scope of public health. For each essential service, there are model standards that correspond to the primary activities conducted at the local level. A total of 30 model standards are assessed. Within each model standard, there are a series of discussion questions that break down the standard into its component parts. After discussing the standard, participants vote on the performance measures of the model standard. Consensus is required to finalize the sc ore of each performance measure which is used to determine the score of each essential service. The scoring system is broken into five broad categories: LPHSA Scoring Chart Optimal Activity (76-100%) Greater than 75% of the activity described is met. Significant Activity (51-75%) Greater than 50% but no more than 75% of the activity described is met. Moderate Activity (26-50%) Greater than 25% but no more than 50% of the activity described is met. Minimal Activity (1-25%) Greater than 0% but no more than 25% of the activity described is met. No Activity (0%) 0% or absolutely no activity. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT 33 METHODOLOGY The assessment began with an opening 60 -minute plenary session to welcome participants, provide an overview of the process, introduce the staff, and answer questions. Participants were introduced to specific concepts of the assessment process throug h a presentation and activities (for a list of participants, please see appendix A, page 148 ). Participa nts were then broken into five groups; each breakout group was responsible for conducting the assessment for two EPHS . Each group was facilitated by a trained facilitator and discussion notes were captured by a recorder. The day ended with a plenary sessio n where improvement opportunities for each essential service were reported by participants of each group. The end-of-day dialogue outlined the next steps of the assessment process and encouraged participants to contact the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee for further involvement in MAPP activities. PARTICIPANTS The Live Well Lake County Steering Committee worked with the Lake County Health Department to invite public health system partners from public, private, and voluntary sectors to participate in the LPHSA. The participants were selected with careful consideration to ensure that diverse perspectives were represented in each breakout group as well as balanced participation across sectors and agencies. Forty - eight participants attended; the numbers of attendees by sector are listed below: LPHSA Breakout Group Assignments Group Responsibilities A EPHS 1 - Monitor health status to identify community health problems. EPHS 2 - Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community. B EPHS 3 - Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues. EPHS 4 -Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. C EPHS 5 - Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts. EPHS 6 - Enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensure safety. D EPHS 7 - Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health services. EPHS 9 - Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility and quality of personal/population -based health services. E EPHS 8 - Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce. EPHS 10 - Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems.

The score of each EPHS can be interpreted as the degree to which the local public health system meets the performance stand ards for each Essential Service. The highest ranked of the Essential Public Health Services was EPHS 2 (Diagnose and Investigate Health Problems and Health Hazards) which was assessed as having optimal activity of 82%. The lowest ranked was EPHS 8 (Assure a Competent Public Health and Personal Healthcare Workforce), assessed as having moderate activity of 47%. The average of all Essential Public Health Serv ice scores resulted in the overall LPHSA performance score which was significant activity (62%).

be completed in Lake County's 2015 -2016 MAPP process. The Live Well Lake County steering committee is guiding the completion of the remaining three assessments. Upon completion, the results of the assessments will be analyzed and prevailing health concerns will be identified and strategically prioritized. Following prioritization, goals and action plans to address priority issues will be developed, implemented, and aligned to improve the local public health system and ultimately the health of the community. FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT 56 Forces of Change Assessment INTR ODUCTION Lake County's Forces of Change Assessment (FoCA) was convened by the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee on October 23, 2015 at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science. The FoCA is one of four assessments Lake County conducted as part of its Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process. 17 This framework assists communities to prioritize public health issues and create a platform to develop and implement efforts to address them. PURPOSE The FoCA identifies potential forces or trends that either are currently affecting Lake County's public health system or are expected to impact the system in the next five years. The assessment highlights the specific effects these forces could have on the system; both those that threaten system functionality and those that open doors to new opportunities. The FoCA adds an element of foresight to the strategic planning process as key stakeholders document potential intended and unintended consequences of these forces on the p ublic health system. METHODOLOGY The Live Well Lake County Steering Committee began the assessment by brainstorming potential forces of change across five broad categories: political, environmental, legal/ethical, social/economic, and technological/scientific. Within each category, the group was asked: What forces are occurring or might occur that affects the health of our community or the local public health system? What specific threats or opportunities are generated by these occurrences? Forces were defined as being comprised of the following three components: Trends - patterns over time; Events - one time occurrence; and Factors - discrete elements. 17 \"Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP)\" .

Retri eved from: http://www.naccho.org/topics/infrastructure/mapp. FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT 57 Participants brainstormed potential forces and shared them with facilitators. Like -minded themes were grouped using an affinity diagram to identify overarching forces that shape or influence the public health system and community. The effects of these forc es may have an impact on any part of the public health system, including resources, strategic issues, infrastructure, culture, or the environment. To identify methods to enhance or mitigate the effects of these forces, participants then identified threats posed and opportunities created within each force. Participants also acknowledged additional information that was needed within the system to appro priately address specific forces as well as local organizations that were believed to have experience or knowledge to address barriers. Participants completed this process for each of the five categories and then thoughtfully considered what his/her top pr iorities were regarding the most influential forces of change for Lake County. The forces perceived to be most impactful can be found in the summary of results. FORCES OF CHANGE: SUMMARY The Steering Committee identified sixteen Forces of Change that either currently affect Lake County's public health system or are expected to impact the system in the next five years. These are listed below. A summary of forces of change and corresponding threats posed and opportunities created are included in the foll owing pages.

Live Well Lake County will be proactive in leveraging c ollaborative partnerships to address expected forces through the identification of social, scientific, technological, organizational and institutional resources. While all identified forces should be considered, those six ranked (see table below) as having the most impact on the county should be given priority when identifying and building system capacity to address strategic issues. Several forces may be unique to the current assessment, while others may also appear during one of the other MAPP assessments . Additionally, t he relationship each force has with others should not be ignored. For example, mental health as a force has a connection to economic inequities, government impact on operations and other areas aside from mere increases in the mentally ill population. Through the process of identifying resources to address forces, Lake County will be proactive in positioning itself for the future, rather than reacting to foreseen trends, events and factors. 02468101214 Mental HealthHealthcare AccessElectronic Health Records & the Health Information ExchangeHealth in All Policies ApproachChanges in Lake County's PopulationEconomic Inequities13 8 6 6 5 5 1.

The Community Themes and Strengths Assessment (CTSA) i s one of four assessments Lake County is conducting as part of its Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process. MAPP is a community -driven strategic planning framework utilized in community health improvement. This framework assi sts communities to prioritize public health issues and create a platform to develop and implement efforts to address them. The CTSA focuses on opinions and perceptions of residents regarding the quality of life and health in the community as well as commu nity assets. It creates a portrait of the community seen through the eyes of the residents. The assessment was divided into three categories: 1. Community Strengths Survey 2. Focus Groups 3. Photovoice Overview of the MAPP Process COMMUNITY THEMES & STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT 65 SUMMARY OF COMMUNITY THEMES A ND STRENGTHS ASSESSM ENT The table below contains a summary of the overarching themes found throughout the CTSA.

The health issues were then ranked based on survey responses, topics that were heavily discussed in the focus groups, and photos taken by students. Rank Priority 1 Poor diet and inactivity 2 Chronic Disease (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer) 3 Substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and drug use) 4 Safe Affordable Housing 5 Older Adult Health (arthritis, hearing/vision, Alzheimer's disease/Dementia) 6 Community Safety (community violence and domestic violence) 7 Food Environment (Availability of affordable, healthy food) 8 Mental Health 9 Cultural Sensitivity and Linguistic Capacity 10 Health Literacy COMMUNITY THEMES & STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT 67 METHODOLOGY - SURVEY The Community Strengths Survey was conducted to understand the opinions and perceptions of Lake County residents regarding the quality of life and health in their community. The survey was developed through a CTSA workgroup that consisted of members of the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee and Lake County Health Department staff. A total of 14 survey questions were developed that focused on demographics, quality of life, health, and strengths in the community ( Appendix D, page 153 ). The survey was distributed online and through paper copies and was available in English and Spanish. The online survey link was distributed to community partners and organizations throughout Lake County through the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee and Lake County Health Department email list - serves, website posts, newsletters, flyers, and social media messages. The link was accompanied by a message that encouraged individuals to forward the link to others to increase the reach of the survey in the c ommunity. The primary focus of distribution for the paper copies was organizations that are able to reach residents who may not have the opportunity to take the survey online. Paper copies were also distributed to organizations that normally have a large amount of residents who visit their location on a daily basis. The paper copies were given as a package, with a box for completed surveys, promotional material in English and Spanish, documents that explained how to distribute the survey, and answers to fr equently asked questions. Paper surveys were distributed to all Lake County libraries, several coffee shops, and organizations with resident drop in points.

COMMUNITY THEMES & STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT 82 METHODOLOGY - FOCUS GROUP Using a health equity lens, focus groups were conducted to provide a voice to underserved and underrepresented populations. The results provide further insight into the survey findings through intensive discussions with residents on their perceptions of quality of life and health in their communities. The in -depth questions that were developed for the focus groups were based off of the questions from the Community Strengths Survey ( Appendix E, page 159 ). Groups were selected to provide an equitable representation of demographics, including race, ethnicity, language, and socioeconomic status. Fou r focus groups were conducted: (1) African Americans, (2) persons with physical disabilities and/or visual impairments, (3) Korean Americans conducted in Korean, and (4) recent Latino immigrants conducted in Spanish. The Live Well Lake County Steering Comm ittee, along with the Lake County Health Department partnered with community -based organizations to help with participant recruitment and hosting the focus groups. A total of 42 adults participated across the four focus groups. The group size for each ra nged from 8 -14 participants with discussions lasting between 60 and 90 minutes. One health department staff member facilitated the conversation while another took notes. The conversations were audio recorded to accurately capture all of the ideas and opini ons of the participants. Two of the groups were conducted in languages other than English: Korean and Spanish. The organizations that hosted focus groups in Korean and Spanish provided a staff member to facilitate language translation between the focus gro up facilitator and the participants. To promote consistency in data collection and reporting, a focus group facilitator guide, note -taker template, and focus group summary table were developed. The focus group facilitator guide included: recommendations o n how to conduct and record a focus group session; logistics and materials; and a script for the facilitator to follow. In an effort to ensure the anonymity of the participants, names were not collected and all introductions were conducted prior to audio r ecording. After the focus groups were conducted, the data was transcribed, analyzed, and interpreted. The results of each individual focus group were analyzed separately and then analyzed collectively with the other focus groups. The transcriptions were c oded and categorized by question. COMMUNI TY THEMES & STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT 83 RESUL TS - FOCUS GROUPS The findings of the focus groups proved to be consistent with the overall results of the Community Strengths Survey.

Increased disability awareness is vital, especially among employers, health care providers, local elected officials, and policy makers. \"I use a Hoyer lift. It is at my house for people to lift me , and they cost like $3,000 - $4,000; and right now mine is broken. And I have only Medicaid, and they only pay for certain things. So if Medicaid denies me then there is nothing I can do. I have to figure out another way to come up with the money to purchas e a Hoyer. And same with my chair. If my chair needs repairs, I have to go through Medicaid, and they don't want to pay for diddly. So it's like, if they say no, I'm stuck.\" \"Businesses are not open to hiring people with disabilities, I have interviewed for several jobs, and once they see that I'm in a wheel chair or have a disability they automatically count me out.

Older Adult Health Winter depression was mentioned as a common problem in older adults. Increased activities/programs for older adults in the winter were recommended as a way to alleviate the issue. \" A lot of parents are first generation, and they want to educate and create opportunities for their children, so they can be more successful as second generation Korean Americans. However, there is a lack of parenting support options. Pare nts have difficulty teaching the Korean culture to their children as there are not many external resources in the community outside of the homes.\" \"I try to provide my children with healthy, nutritious food at home. I am worried because the food offered for school lunches is not healthy, and there is a lack of options, especially since my family is vegetarian.

The three main goals of Photovoice are to (1) enable people to record and reflect their community's strengths and concerns, (2) to promote critical dialogue and knowledge about important issues through group discussion of the photographs, and (3) to reach policymak ers1. The Live Well Lake County Steering committee utilized Photovoice to answer the following questions: (1) \"How does your community positively and negatively affect your health?\" and (2) \"How does your community prevent or allow for behaviors which can lead to obesity?\" High school students in Lake County were selected as participants in this project to provide a platform for youth to voice their opinions on community health; to educate youth on public health concepts; and engage youth in the community health improvement process. Participants were purposefully recruited from schools and youth advocacy groups that were geographically and socioeconomically diverse. The following groups were recruited: Adlai E. Stevenson High School's HOSA group (Health O ccupation Students of America). Seven students from HOSA participated. Adlai E. Stevenson High School is located in Lincolnshire (South Central Lake County) and provides representation of a middle upper class to upper class socioeconomic status. Zion -Benton Township High School's photography class. The photography teacher made Photovoice part of the coursework. Thirteen students from the class participated. Zion -Benton High School is located in northeast Lake County, representing diverse socioeconomics and racial/ethnic composition. REALITY Illinois and the Youth Advisory Board groups in the greater Gurnee area and the greater Lake Zurich area. REALITY Illinois and the Youth Advisory Board group are a tobacco and alcohol policy and advocacy group cr eated by and for Illinois teens. It is funded by the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Lake County Underage Drinking and Drug Prevention Task Force. A total of fifteen students participated from REALITY Illinois across the two group locations. Both locations provide a broad representation of central and south western Lake County. 1.

COMMUNITY THEMES & STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT 91 ORIENTATION The Photovoice facilitators were Lake County Health Department staff along with school instructors and student group sponsors. These facilitators conducted an orientation where participants learned about the goals of Photovoice; how to critically look at their communities through a public health lens; and the ethics involved when capturing photographs in the community. The participants were also given an introduction to public health; social determinants of health and health equity. PHOTOS IN COMMUNITY The participants explored their communities and took photographs using their own phones with cameras or professional cameras to capture health -related aspects of their environments. The photographs that were taken were uploaded to FLICKR (a photo -sharing website) that was accessible to all participants and facilitators. The FLICKR link is available here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lakecountyphotovoice/albums . DISCUSSION SECTIONS After the photos were captured, Photovoice facilitators set up group discussions to provide participants an opportunity to elaborate on the meaning behind their photos and what aspects of public health they captured. Using their new knowledge of the social determinants of health and health equity, the participants were able to draw connections between built and natural environments; neighborhood conditions; healthy choices; and community health improvement.

Stevenson High School HOSA COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 102 Community Health Status Assessment MATERIALS AND METHOD S The CHSA contains the quantitative indicators necessary for the community health improvement planning process. Because community health crosses so many sectors, the data collection strategy and sources must reflect a diverse set of sectors and indicators. SECONDARY DATA Secondary data is any data used by an entity that did not generate or collect that data, oftentimes for purposes other than the original purpose. The more complete, timely secondary data sets are fundamental resources for the planning process. For example, the American Community Survey from th e United States Census tracks demographic, economic, education, and other social characteristics of communities at different geographic scales from census blocks to national figures. For this Assessment, data from the American Community Survey 5 -Year Avera ge for 2010- 2014 were used unless otherwise noted. These represent the most complete, timely estimates available on the residents of Lake County. The Illinois State Police publish annual rates of crimes as required by the Uniform Crime Reports system. Illi nois's Department of Children and Family Services reports investigations and cases of child abuse and neglect. Social factors provide context for health outcomes. The most comprehensive health information comes from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). IDPH shares records of birth, death, and hospital discharges that can be used to understand adverse pregnancy outcomes, mortality, and hospital usage patterns. IDPH also administers the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (I -BRFSS ) survey, a questionnaire created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess health conditions and behaviors, typically to describe state -level prevalence rates. In Illinois, the data are available for counties. The results from the I -BRFS S are published intermittently and reflect the priorities of CDC and IDPH but do not capture all the topic areas that would be most useful for Lake County. For other local data, models from major national organizations can be used to assess the relative co ndition of the county. Oftentimes, the County Health Rankings (a program of the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute) will acquire and process other data sets to provide comparative data for individual counties. Feeding America publishes an annu al report that estimates the prevalence of food insecurity by county. These data account for demographic and economic characteristics of the community and estimate the prevalence of health factors and the general burden of a determinant or health condition . Oftentimes, data are collected for other uses and public health information can only be determined through secondary modelling. For example, data acquired from the Illinois Secretary of State was cleaned, corrected, and transformed to determine relative rates and distribution of obesity for communities in Lake County. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 103 PRIMARY DATA While secondary data resources provide a solid foundation for a community health assessment, these do not provide a complete picture of health in Lake County. Community partners challenge LCHD/CHC to explore alternatives options and capture information on areas not covered by other data sets. Most prevalence data, especially for mental health and substance abuse, are only available at the state or national level. Primary data col lected by LCHD/CHC can help to fill the gap. To achieve this, LCHD/CHC conducted a survey to collect health data directly from county residents. Questions were modeled after the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Most questions wer e taken directly from current or previous surveys and were selected because of their importance to LCHD/CHC and its community partners. For new topic areas, questions were written to match language style and reading level of the borrowed questions. Questio ns were tested internally in both English and Spanish by LCHD/CHC staff. Questions were then externally tested for clarity, length, and neutrality by volunteers recruited from the Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center Belvidere Medical Building and Mid -Lakes clinics. Each new question was reviewed at least ten times both internally and externally in both languages to ensure that questions would be understood by community members. Staff at the community partner Mano a Mano Family Resource Center volunteered time to review the Spanish language material to ensure that grammar and phonetics were appropriate. LCHD/CHC utilized a mixed -methods survey to collect responses from the community. Invitations were sent to 5,000 randomly -selected house holds from a near -complete list of occupied residences made available by a query of records from the Lake County GIS Program. Recipients were invited to participate through their method of choice. Participants were able to complete the survey through either an online option or a toll -free, call -in option where individuals would respond to a pre- recorded survey and use the phone's number pad to indicate responses. Both versions of the survey were available in English and Spanish. Households received two remi nder postcards at two and four weeks after receipt of the invitation. The survey accepted responses for ten weeks. The raw results were compiled into a single spreadsheet and reviewed. Responses were categorized by demographic information provided by the r espondents - age and gender - to produce a county figure for responses to each question. The values reported out in this document reflect this weighting strategy and not crude values. Weighting allows for a representative picture of the population to be pr oduced from the responses received.

While the population has remained relatively stable since the 2010 (with 703,462 in 2010 the 2010 Census an estimated 703,170 from the American Community Survey 5-year Estimate from 2010 -2014), many of the demographic t rends that defined the first decade of the twenty -first century have continue d to shape Lake County's population characteristics . 18 Overall, Lake County has a population density of 1 ,462 residents per square mile but varies considerably. Urban areas in eas tern Lake County have census tracts with more than 5,000 persons per square mile while much of northern and western Lake County have fewer than 1,000 residents per square mile. DEMOGRAPHICS About 64.2% of residents are non -Hispanic white. Residents ident ifying as Hispanic or Latino represent about 20.5% of all residents in Lake County. 6.6% of residents are African American. Asian Americans include 6.4% of Lake County residents. 19 The total number of Latino residents has increased by 55.1% since 2000, from 92,716 to 143,841 in 2014. The number of African Americans in the county has increased slightly, by about 4.3%, from 44,741 to 46,644. Over the same interval, the total number of Asian American residents has increased by 81% between 2000 and 2014, from 25,105 to 45,556. The non -Hispanic white population has contracted by about 4.5%, from 472,968 in 2000 to 451,700 in 2014. 20 Changes in population are not uniform across the county and potentially represent pockets of culturally -specific health needs.

The number of Spanish -speaking individuals has grown b y about 5%, an additional 4,888 Spanish - speaking persons in 2014 than 2010. Speakers of other Indo - European languages represent 6% of Lake County and increased by 1,081 since 2010. Asian language speakers also increased to 4% of Lake County's population, growing by 2,203 speakers since 2010. Thes e figures indicate cultural shifts. While 28% of residents speak a language other than English at home, 10.5% speak English \"less than very well.\" 21 Certain communities have higher proportions of individuals who speak English less than very well and might f ace linguistic barriers to health resources if these resources are only available through English language avenues. 21 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average 2010- 2014 Race and Ethnicity Distribution in Lake County by Census Tracts COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 106 Language Spoken at Home 2014 Count 2010 Count Change Percent 2014 Percent 2010 Percent Change Population 5 years and over 659,159 648,261 10,898 - AGE Changes to Lake County's racial and ethnic composition have also been accompanied by shifts in age in the county. Between 2000 and 2014, the median age in the county increased from 33.8 to 37.2. The total number of births annually has declined since 2010. There are almost 9,000 fewer young children (under the age of 5) in Lake County than in 2000, dropping from 52,978 (8.2% of the population in 2000) to 44,011 (about 6.3% in 2014).22 The changes seen in the county totals are not evenly distributed. 22 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average 2010- 2014 Childhood Age Distribution in Lake County by Census Tracts COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 107 Conversely, the proportion of the population in older age groups have seen the largest increases and all groups over 45 years of age experiencing growth. 197,390 residents were between 45 and 64 years of age in 2014, representing 28% of the county's total population. The number of individuals over 65 in Lake County has increased by 24,410 people since 2000 and now totals 79,399 residents or 11.3% of Lake County's population. 23 23 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average 2010- 2014 Adult Age Distribution in Lake County by Census Tracts COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 108 SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS Although Lake County is one of the wealthiest in the state by median household income ($77,873),24 economic disparities in the County are dramatic. A metric of income inequality compares the ratio of income of the 80th percentile of households to the 20th. By this measure, Lake County is the most economically unequal of the collar counties. 25 Some of t he wealthiest communities abut areas that are economically disadvantaged. Because economic factors can drive health outcomes, understanding today's economic landscape and changes over time are vital to understanding the current state of Lake County. EMPLOY MENT26 Comparing the American Community Survey's 5 -year Average rates from 2010 and 2014 for indicators like unemployment and poverty indicate growing hardship for many of the County's residents. Five- year averages were used to better understand chronic eco nomic challenges in the community. Since the 2010 survey, the rate of unemployment in the county has declined, from 7.7% to 6.1%.27 POVERTY Employment among working -age adults is improving; however, rates of poverty are not following the same trajectory and many of Lake County's residents are struggling. The rate of poverty in the county has risen from 7.0% in 2010 to 9.4% in 2014. This change translates to an additional 16,889 persons in poverty over four years and a total of 64,432 residents in poverty. This increase burdens some groups in Lake County more than others. Between 2010 and 2014, youth poverty (for individuals under 18) has increased from 9.6% of children to 13.3%. 28 24 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average 2010- 2014 25 University of Wisconsin Population Health I nstitute.

For Hispanics, poverty has increased from 13.8% to 17.6%. Rates of Asian Americans in poverty has increased from 3.7% to 5.5%. African Americans face the highest levels of economic hardship. Poverty among African Americans in Lake County increased from 18.9% to 26.3%. 29 Increasing po verty rates represent an important burden to the health of residents. Poverty is one of the main social determinants of health , or social factors that can hinder an individual's ability to live a healthy life. Poverty is one of the great challenges in publ ic health. Like many social conditions in Lake County, poverty is more concentrated in some areas than others and representing greater economic and health burden in specific communities. 29 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average 2010- 2014 Poverty by Race and Ethnicity 2010 2014 Hispanic 13.8% 17.6% Asian American 3.7% 5.5% African American 18.9% 26.3% White 5.4% 8.0% Poverty Distribution in Lake County by Census Tracts COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 110 HOUSING A healthy community needs safe, affordable housing. Unfortunately, many things create barriers to adequate housing. Incomplete kitchens, lack of plumbing facilities, overcrowding, and cost of rent can make it difficult to find quality housing. In Lake County, housing problems are primarily related to housing cost. A household is \"housing stressed\" when more than 30% of household income is spent on housing costs. Economic housing s tress affects 38% of households in Lake County, a slightly higher rate than either Illinois or the United States. Rates of housing stress are slightly higher than the state and nation for both homeowners with a mortgage and those without. Over half of all renters in Lake County face housing stress, placing an exceptional burden on communities where homeownership is less common. 30 Housing problems are considered severe in households paying 50% or more of their income on housing, units experiencing overcrowdin g (averaging more than 1.5 persons per room), or units lacking complete kitchen or plumbing facilities. The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development indicates that nearly one in five (18%) of households in Lake County fall into this more extreme category of housing stress. 31 By census tract, the burden of housing stress clearly impacts some communities more than others.

About 37.8% of households in Lake County have children under 18 present; of these, about 5.7% have a single male householder and 16.7% have a single female householder. 21.4% of households with children have only one parent present.32 EDUCATION As a social determinant of health, education influences health outcomes in Lake County. Educational attainment can impact the jobs available to an individual, his or her ear nings, and the level of literacy he or she can apply to health information. For Lake County, the educational influence on an individual's economic situation is summarized in the following chart, demonstrating the difference in median annual income for men and women with different levels of educational attainment. A high school degree, for example, is worth an additional $10,000 in annual income. Inequalities between men and women persist across all education levels but the trend for both genders remains tha t higher educational attainment results in higher income.33 High levels of educational attainment are therefore important to ensuring prosperity among residents.

Certain communities, frequently those facing other barriers to health and social services like language or poverty status, tend to have the lowest rates of high school completion. A map summarizes rates of adults over the age of 25 who do not have a high school diploma or equivalent credential. Across Lake County 10.8% of adults age 25 and older have less than a high school level of education while 42.6% have a Bachelor's degree or higher. Disparities persist across racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic adults in Lake County having the lowest rates of high school completion (40.9%). Hispanic adults are nearly ten times more likely to have not graduated from high school than non -Hispanic whites (4.3%). African A mericans in the county (12.6%) are three times more likely to have not graduated from high school as non -Hispanic Whites. Asians in the county are only slightly more likely to have not completed high school (5.6%). Major gaps persist in graduating from col lege, with non -Hispanic whites (49.1%) about twice as likely to have a bachelor's degree as African Americans (25.0%) and five times as likely as Hispanics (10.9%) in Lake County. Asian Americans in Lake County have the highest rates of college completion, with 68.7% of Asian American adults holding a bachelor's degree or higher. 34 34 American Community Survey 5 -year Averages, 2010- 2014 COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 113 School Enrollment Academic achievement relies on school enrollment. Increasing the rate of children who continue their education through high school and beyond can promote higher levels of educational attainment that, in turn, support better economic and health outcomes. School enrollment by age group has remained relatively stable between the 2006 and 2014 American Community Surveys. Nearly all children ages 5 -17 are enrolled in school (roughly elementary through high school aged -children). Potential gaps in enrollment exist for children ages 3 and 4, where pre- kindergarten is an option that could potentially promote early learning and better prepare these indiv iduals for kindergarten and beyond. About 57.4% of these early childhood learners are enrolled in school, an increase from 2010 (47.8%) and 2006 (50.8%). Educational enrollment drops for ages 18 and 19 as these individuals transition out of high school. On ly 72.2% of these persons were enrolled in school in 2014.35 Because of the considerable economic benefit of each additional level of education, efforts to keep these students engaged in school or training represents a potential opportunity to improve the h ealth and wellbeing of residents of the county. 35 American Community Survey 5 -Year Averages, 2010- 2014, High school or Equivalent Some college or associate's degreeBachelor's degree or higherAdult Educational Attainment by Race and Ethnicity Non-Hispanic White Hispanic or Latino African American Asian % of A ge Group COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 114 HEAL TH RESOURCE AVAI LABILITY Healthcare resources are the tools that individuals can use to treat health problems. The ability to see a doctor when a medical intervention is needed is a basic requirement of being able to live a healthy life. Many factors will impact whether or not an individual will be able to access a doctor in a timely manner, including the total number of doctors available to see patients in an area, the insurance status of an individua l, an individual's knowledge of what an insurance plan might cover, the cost of an appointment, and the ability to secure transportation to an office or hospital. These factors and more will influence how an individual utilizes the available healthcare sys tem. INSURANCE STATUS One of the most important factors determining whether or not an individual will have access to the healthcare system is insurance status. Lack of insurance makes even minor medical issues difficult to treat. The rate of individuals wi th health insurance has increased, in large part due to the Affordable Care Act that requires individuals to carry some type of health insurance or face financial penalties. In 2014, 8.7% of residents lacked health insurance (about a 30% reduction from 201 0). Coverage has improved across all groups, yet Hispanics and Latinos still have the highest rates of uninsured individuals at 23%, down from 2010's 31.1%. 10.4% of African Americans in Lake County do not have insurance, an improvement from 13.8% in 2010.

The proportion of adults age 18 -64 have improved fro m 17.2% in 2010 to 12.7% in 2014. Nearly one in five (18.5%) of the individuals ages 19 -25 are uninsured.37 RATES OF PROVIDERS In order to deliver services to all individuals who need primary, behavioral health, or dental services, communities need to have enough providers to support the population. Lake County has relatively high rates of residents to primary care physicians, with a ratio of 940 residents per primary care physician. Comparatively, the ratio across Illinois is 1,240:1. Lake County is among the top counties nationally and exceeds the 90th percentile mark for national values at 1,040:1. The population to provider ratio for dentists is also exceptional. In Lake County, the ratio of population to dentists is 940:1, while overall Illinois is 1,410:1. The 90 th percentile in the United States is 1,340:1. For mental health providers (including psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage an d family therapists, advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care, and mental health providers that treat alcohol and other drug abuse), Lake County has 429 residents per provider, a better ratio than Illinois's 560:1. Unlike the other provi der ratios, Lake County falls short of the national 90 th percentile of 370:1.38 CARE UTILIZATION While insurance status and rates of providers provide the scaffolding of healthcare, when and how residents use the system also plays an important role.

To maintain good health, individuals should have their primary care physician evaluate them for an annual physical. Overall, 69% of adults had seen a doctor for a physical exam in the past year; however, rates vary by insurance status. Only 44% of individuals without health insurance had seen a doctor for a physical in the past year while 78% of individuals with health insurance had seen a doctor fo r a physical in the past year.39 As a determinant of access to the healthcare system, health insurance status remains an important factor of health. ORAL HEALTH Oral health services are typically not covered by regular health insurance and dental insurance can be acquired separately. Because this type of insurance is not a requirement, coverage rates are lower. In Lake County, 74% of adults have some type of dental insurance coverage. 83% of Lake County adults had seen a dentist in the past year. 86% of adults with dental insurance had seen a dentist within the past twelve months, compared to 77% of adults without dental insurance. Residents were more likely to have seen a dentist in the past year than a primary care physician. 40 39 Lake County Community Health Survey 2015 40 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 117 BARRIERS TO CARE Individuals can face many barriers to accessing the care they need. Cost can make it difficult for residents to see a doctor . In the past year , 10% of Lake County adults did not seek medical attention they needed because of the cost. Individuals without health insura nce were more than twice as likely to report cost as a barrier to care in the past year (25%) than those individuals with health insurance (9%).41 Transportation resources can also be a barrier to accessing medical services. Because Lake is a suburban count y, transportation oftentimes requires a personal vehicle. A doctor's office might be far away or located in a section of the county that does not have adequate public transportation services. In the past year , 4% of residents reported that transportation k ept them from seeing a doctor when they needed one. 42 Of the 241,846 households in the county, 12,000 had no vehicle available (about 5% of households). 43 Household access to a vehicle varies across the county. The transportation barrier might be described by the map of households without access to a vehicle. 89% of residents can identify a regular doctor for their care. Having a regular doctor indicates th at an individual is engaged in the healthcare system and their own health. 44 HEALTH LITERACY Basic knowledge of an individual's health insurance plan can help him or her to navigate a complicated health system and ensure that his or her individual needs ar e met. After the promulgation of the Affordable Care Act, almost all health insurance plans should cover mental health, substance abuse, and preventive services at no cost if the services are received within network. Of adults with health insurance in Lake County, 72% believed that their plans covered mental health services. 54% believed that their insurance plan covered substance abuse services. 67% believed that their health insurance covered prevention services. 45 Appropriate use of medical services lead s to better, less costly health outcomes. When managed correctly, chronic conditions should rarely result in hospitalizations. Assessing preventable hospital stays can indicate how well these conditions are being managed. One of the available metrics is an annual rate of preventable hospital stays per 1,000 Medicare enrollees. Lake County averages 50 preventable stays per 1,000 enrollees, better than the Illinois rate of 59 per 1,000 but not as well as 38 per 1,000 of the 90th percentile of counties in the United States.46 41 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 42 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 43 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average (2010 -2014) 44 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 45 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 46 County Health Rankings 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 118 QUALITY OF LIFE The World Health Organization defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well - being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" As such, metrics assessing more holistic quality of life measur es are necessary to understand health in Lake County. 13% of adults in Lake County describe their health as \"Fair\" or \"Poor,\" slightly better than the overall Illinois rate of 17% and nearly equivalent to the 90th percentile in the United States (12%).47 PHYSICAL HEALTH LIMITA TIONS Days where a person's health problem kept that individual from performing normal activities can be used to measure quality of life. 36% of residents reported that their physical health was \"not good\" for one or more days within th e past month. 12% reported that their physical health was not good for eight or more days. On average, adults in Lake County had 3.2 days of \"not good\" physical health in the past 30 days. 27% of adults reported that physical health had prevented them from carrying out normal activities for at least one day in the past 30 days. 6% said that physical health kept them from normal activities for 8 or more days. On average, physical health prevented normal activity for 1.6 days in the past month. 48 MENTAL HEALTH LIMITATIONS Mental health was also assessed. 36% of residents reported that their mental health was not good for one or more days in the past month. 8% said that their mental health was not good for eight or more days. On average, adults in Lake County ha d 2.6 days of not good mental health in the past month. Mental health prevented 14% of adults from completing normal activities for one or more days. Mental health kept 4% of adults from completing normal activities for eight or more days. On average, adul ts in Lake County reported 0.9 days in the past month where they could not perform normal activities due to their mental health.49 PAIN LIMITATIONS Pain can indicate overall quality of health as well. 39% of adults in Lake County reported that pain had kept them from performing normal activities for one or more days in the past month. 10% of adults were prevented from performing normal activities for eight or more days. On average, pain prevented normal activities for 2.7 days in the past month, costing resi dents more days than poor physical health alone.50 47 County Health Rankings 2016 48 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 49 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 50 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey COMMUNI TY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 119 BUILT ENVIRONMENT Resources in the built environment can signal opportunities for better quality of life. Features of the built environment can improve access to healthy foods, exercise, and recreation. Food environment Feeding America's Food Environment Index assesses two measures of the food environment. First, it assesses those with limited access to healthy foods using the proportion of the population that is low income (less than 200% of the federal p overty threshold) and not living close to a grocery store (in a non - rural county like Lake, this means less than 1 mile). Second, food insecurity is measured as the percentage of the population who did not have access to a reliable source of food during th e past year according to a model using data from the Community Population Survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the American Community Survey. Because this metric looks at county rates, local needs might be overlooked. Lake County food environment pe rforms well with this measure, scoring 8.5 out of a possible 10. Illinois scores 7.8. The 90 th Percentile of counties in the United States score 8.3.51 The US Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as \" lack of access, at times, to enough food fo r an active, healthy life for all household members and limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods. \" In 2014, Feeding America reported that the overall food insecurity in Lake County is 8.0%. About 62% of these individuals qualify for SNAP benefits. 4% of food insecure individuals are at about the 165% federal poverty level and might qualify for some nutrition assistance programs. The remaining 34% are above 185% of the poverty threshold but are still food insecure. 15.5% of children are food insecure. Of these, 65% are in households that would be income eligible for food assistance (below 185% of the federal poverty threshold). 35% of these children come from homes that would not qualify. Food insecurity is, therefore, a broader issue than poverty and affects more residents than the poverty rates would indicate. 52 51 County Health Rankings 52 Feeding America 2014 County Report COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 120 Parks and recreation Parks provide opportunities for exercise. Park density in an area can be an indicator of access to outdoor spaces for recreational use. Overall, there are 1.8 parks per square mile. Park density in Lake County varies considerably, from 6.25 per square mile in ZIP code 60040 to 0.04 in 60083. 53 For a guide to identifying communities by ZIP code, please see Appendix F on page 160 . The County Health Ranki ngs uses a model to estimate the percent of the population with adequate access to locations for physical activity. To determine this metric, researchers map parks, gyms, community centers, YMCAs, dance studios, and pools and then calculates the proportion of individuals who reside in a census block within a half mile of a park or within one mile of a recreational facility. By this metric, 97% of Lake County residents have access to exercise opportunities. This measure of access to exercise opportunities posit ions Lake County as better than the state rate (89%) and the 90 th percentile of counties across the United States (91%).54 53 Lake County GIS 54 University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.

Whether quitting tobacco, eating fruits and vegetables, or getting regular exercise, adopting healthful behaviors can help residents to live healthier lives. TOBACCO, ALCOHOL, AN D OTHER DRUGS As the leading cause of preventable death in the world, tobacco remains a top public health concern. 38.0% of Lake County adults reported having ever been a smoker. 14.4% of adults are current smokers. 23.6% are former smokers.55 53% of adults who had ever been smokers in Lake County started smoking regularly before the age of 18.56 Although legal, alcohol is an important dru g. 80% of adults in Lake County reported having alcohol at least once in the past month. Of the individuals who had consumed alcohol, the average number of drinking events was 10.0 per month. Per event, the average number of drinks consumed was 1.8. About 5% of drinkers' normal drinking events would be classified as binge drinking; that is, four or more drinks for a woman and five or more drinks for a man. 28% of adults who had consumed alcohol had at least one binge drinking event in the past 30 days.57 3% of Lake County adults reported that they had used marijuana in the past 30 days. This rate is lower than the national rate of past month use (8.3% for individuals over 18).58 15% of adults had been prescribed opioids in the past twelve months. 3% of respon dents reported that some type of drug had prevented normal activities for one or more days in the past 30 days.59 Preventing initiation of substance use is an important strategy for preventing abuse. Alcohol is the most popular drug among adolescents in Lak e County, used more frequently across all grade levels than either cigarettes or marijuana. Users of alcohol also include most of the users of other substances, only 1 -3% of individuals who had not used alcohol in the past year but did report some type of substance use. Past year use of all substances increases with grade level.60 Reported Past Year Use 6th Grade 8th Grade 10th Grade 12th Grade Alcohol 55 Illinois Behavioral Risk Factors Survey, Round 5. 56 Illinois Behavioral Risk Factors Survey, Round 4. 57 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 58 Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.

In Lake County, 91% of adults reported that they engaged in some type of physical activity outside of work in the past 30 days. About 68% of adult residents exercise for 30 minute s or more for three or more days per week. 36% of adults exercise five or more days per week. On average, adults in Lake County exercise 3.5 days per week.61 For youth in Lake County, 3% of sixth graders, 5% of eighth graders, 7% of tenth graders, and 8% of twelfth graders report that they did not participate in any physical activity in the past week. Conversely, 35% of sixth graders, 29% of eighth graders, 24% of tenth graders, and 21% of twelfth graders reported that they exercised at least sixty minutes p er day every day for the past week. Physical activity decreases as the students' grade level increases.62 Screen time can distract children from getting the physical activity they need. About one in five students (18% of sixth, 22% of eighth, 19% of tenth, and 21% of twelfth graders) spent an average of three or more hours watching television on a school day. Additionally, about one in four eighth (28%), tenth (25%), and twelfth (24%) grade students spent an average of three or more hours using a screen that was not a television (including computers and videogames not related to school work) on school days. 15% of sixth graders reported spending three or more hours of non -television screen time on school days. 63 SLEEP Sufficient, quality sleep is essential to physical health. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and obesity. It is necessary for proper endocrine and immune system function. In children and adolescents, sleep is necessary for proper growth and development. 64 The National Institutes of Health recommends 7 -8 hours of sleep per day for adults. In Lake County, 30% of adults sleep fewer than seven hours on average, while the average hours of sleep per night for all adults is 7.0 hour s.65 61 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 62 Illinois Youth Survey 2014 63 Illinois Youth Survey 2014 64 National Institutes of Health.

Fruits and vegetables provide vitamins and fiber . Despite their importance, only 15% of adults in Lake County eat five or more fruits and vegetables per day. 49% of adults in the county have two or fewer fruits and vegetables per day. On average, adults in the county eat about 2.9 fruits and vegetables per day. 66 Potential barriers to a healthy diet might involve the cost of produce. 6% of residents report being unable to pu rchase produce within the last six months because of cost. Transportation might also make it difficult to get to a store that sells fresh fruits and vegetables. 2% of adults reported that they had been unable to purchase produce at some point in the past s ix months because they were unable to get to a place that sold these items. 67 Youth in Lake County are not eating enough fruits and vegetables. In sixth grade, 56% of students eat two or more fruits per day and 26% of students eat three or more vegetables per day. Produce consumption drops as grade level increases, with 51% of eighth graders and 44% of tenth graders eating two or more fruits per day and 21% of eighth graders and 16% of tenth graders getting enough vegetables. Only 41% of high school seniors eat two or more fruits per day and 15% eat three or more vegetables per day. 68 66 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 67 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 68 Illinois Youth Survey Vegetable Consumption, 2014 3 or more Vegetables 2 or more FruitsCOMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 124 Beverage choices have an influence on health. Sugar -sweetened beverages like soda have been implicated as key contributors to the rise in obesity. Consumption of these beverages varies greatly. Just over one in three (34%) of adults in Lake County drink at least one sugar -sweetened beverage per day. Just under one in three (28%) do not drink sugar sweetened beverages. On average, adults in Lake County consume 5.5 sugar -sweetened beverages per week or about 0.8 sugar -sweetened beverages per day. Conversely, higher consumption of water as a beverage is a positive health behavior. 19% of adults in Lake County drink less than a glass of water per day, while 37% of adults drin k four or more glasses of water per day. On average, adults in Lake County drink 18.2 glasses of water per week, or about 2.6 glasses of water per day.69 SEATBELT USE 98% of adults in Lake County use seatbelts \"always\" or \"nearly always\" when they ride in cars.70 69 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 70 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 125 ENVIRONMENTAL HEAL TH INDICATORS Where individuals in the community live, eat, work, and play can affect the toxins and pathogens they encounter on a da ily basis. Monitoring environmental exposures like blood lead levels in a sensitive population of children or preventing exposures through active monitoring of food service facilities, water resources like wells and beaches, and wastewater treatment systems all help to protect and promote the health of all Lake County residents. LEAD Because of its potent neurological effects on children, lead remains an important contaminant. Screening and mitigation help to reduce the burden of toxicity. To identify children who might be exposed to lead, all kids between the ages of 6 months and six years of age w ho are enrolled in a public school or licensed day care or receive public assistance are assessed for potential exposure through a Lead Risk Questionnaire included in their Child Health Exams. Children who are identified as being at risk and any siblings t hey have are then screened through a blood test to measure blood lead levels. Action is taken when blood lead levels exceed 10 \u00b5g/dL. From 2010 -2015, an average of 8972 blood draws were tested for lead concentrations. 71 An average of 18 new cases were opened annually, a rate of about 2 cases per 1,000 blood draws.72 Lead 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Average Draws73 26 18 14 22 14 16 18 Rate per 1,000 Blood Draws 2.5 1.7 1.5 2.6 1.7 2.2 2.0 FOOD With Americans eating more meals outside the home than ever before,75 food safety in restaurants is an increasingly important potential source of foodborne illness. Regular inspections of restaurants for foodborne illness factors helps to assure that these facilities are operating in a manner that protects public safety. The Environmental Health program at LCHD/CHC reports that fewer than 25% of facilities inspected have any foodborne illness factors. From 2011 -2015, the LCHD/CHC conducted an ave rage of 7,372 foodservice inspections and educational visits annually. The program has also conducted an average of an additional 1,235 inspections for temporary events. Over the same time period, the program has averaged 109 foodborne illness investigatio ns per year, ensuring that if an issue emerges, the outbreak can be contained.76 71 Illinois Department of Public Health, Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance System (2010 -2015). 72 Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center, Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. 73 Illinois Department of Public Health, Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance System (2010 -2015). 74 Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center, Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. 75 United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Se rvice.

From community utilities and non- community water systems providing safe drinking water to public sewers and properly maintained on-site wastewater treatment systems to protect the environment from effluent, care must be taken to ensure public health. LCHD/CHC supports safe drinking water and the environment by managing the construction and permittin g of well and septic systems. LCHD/CHC conducted an annual average of 249 Non -Community Water System surveys from 2011 to 2015. The program also provided 1493 consultations each year . On average, LCHD/CHC performs 2,688 septic consultations per year . From 2011 to 2015, the total number of permits issued for the construction of new septic tanks has increased from 22 to 71, averaging 46 new permits annually. 77 LCHD/CHC also inspects and evaluates recreational swimming facilities (including beaches and pools), protecting swimmers from exposure to potentially harmful pathogens. From 2011 to 2015, an average of 432 pools, spas, and beaches were inspected annually. On average, an additional 9,442 samples of lakes and technical assistance activities were provided ea ch year. 78 AIR Poor air quality disproportionately burden s sensitive groups. The Air Quality Index Report from the United States Environmental Protection Agency provides nearly daily measurements of ozone levels in the County. From 2010 to 2015, the propor tion of \"Good Days\" for air quality exceeded 86% for each individual year; from 2013 to 2015, \"Good\" days were 93% or more. In 2012, excessively hot and humid conditions are thought to have reduced air quality in Lake County, resulting in a total of 17 day s that were considered \"Unsafe for Sensitive Groups\" and two days that were \"Unhealthy \" days. This year was an outlier compared to the others . 79 77 LCHD/CHC Internal Data 2011 -2015 78 LCHD/CHC Internal Data 2011 -2015 79 United States Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality Index Report (2010 -2015).

On average, mental health prevents usual activities for 0. 9 days per adult. DIAGNOSED MENTAL ILL NESS Diagnosed mental illness can provide some insight into the mental health burden in Lake County. 18% of adults in Lake County report that they have been diagnosed with depression. 10% of adults have been diagnosed with some other mental illness besides depression. In total, 23% of adults in Lake County have been diagnosed with some mental illness.80 On average, there were 28,016 total hospital discharges related to mental health conditions in Lake County per year fr om 2011 -2014.81 SUICIDE Suicide the tenth leading cause of death in Lake County, with 9.8 suicides per 100,000 Lake County residents per year. 82 12% of adults in Lake County have experienced suicidal thoughts, while 2% of adults in Lake County have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. Lake County adults who have been diagnosed with depression are about ten times more likely to have considered suicide (53%) than individuals who have not been diagnosed with depression (5%).83 ADOLESCENT MENTAL HE ALTH Mental health presents unique, acute challenges for adolescents in the county. Over one in four of the students surveyed in the 2014 Illinois Youth Survey reported having a depressive episode within the past twelve months - 27% of eighth, 28% of tenth, and 26% of twelfth graders. Nearly one in six tenth graders (16%) and one in seven twelfth graders (13%) had seriously considered suicide within the past twelve months.84 Social stresses weigh heavily on adolescents. Almost half of middle schoolers (42% of six th graders and 46% of eighth graders) have experienced some type of bullying in the past year. In high school, one in three tenth graders (32%) and one in four twelfth graders (25%) experienced some type of bullying. When asked about their social support s ystems, 12% of sixth, 19% of eighth, 19% of tenth, and 14% of twelfth graders reported that they did not have a non -parent adult that they could talk to about important things. 85 80 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 81 Illinois Department of Public Health.

COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 128 COMMUNITY SAFETY Community safety contributes to overall social health. Lack o f safety, whether real or perceived, can cause stress and reduce mental health of individuals in the community. Annual crime rates, both violent and nonviolent, have been declining since 2011 for both the Lake County and the State of Illinois. In 2014, the rate of violent crime in Lake County was 146.3 offenses per 100,000 residents. For Illinois, there were 361.8 offenses per 100,000 residents.86 Deaths that result from violence are overall low in Lake County, with assault or homicide being responsible for 2.8 deaths per 100,000 residents. However , not all communities within Lake County bear the same burden of violence. African Americans in Lake County experience much higher rates of homicide annually, with 15.0 deaths per 100,000 African American residents, or 38 total deaths from 2010- 2014.87 CHILD ABUSE AND NEGL ECT Child abuse and neglect are negative markers of social health. On average, Lake County has a rate of 1,533 abuse investigations per 100,000 minors annually from 2010 to 2015. The state of Illinoi s has a rate of 2,173 per 100,000 minors. Cases where child abuse is indicated averages 378 per 100,000 minors annually for Lake County, while the figure is 455 for the State of Illinois over the same time period. 88 86 Illinois State Police.

Ensuring that mothers are healthy before, during, and after pregnancy can support better pregnancy outcomes. FIRST TRIMESTER PREN ATAL CARE Pregnant women entering care earlier in their pregnancies generally have healthier pregnancies and babies. Rates of women entering care during the first trimester of their pregnancy remained stable from 2010 to 2013. 74.0% of pregnancies in Lake County receive care during the first trimester . This is b elow the Healthy People 2020 target of 77.9%. Highest rates of first trimester care are among non -Hispanic whites (81.8%) and Asian American (78.4%) women. Rates are lower among Hispanic (66.7%) and African American (52.7%) women. 89 89 Illinois Department of Public Health.

In Lake County, rates have fallen from 23.1 per 1,000 adolescent girls in 2010 to 16.7 per 1,000 in 2013. On average, the rate over these f our years is 19.6 per 1,000, lower than the 2011 rate in Illinois (29.5) and the United States (31.3). Despite progress, disparities remain between racial and ethnic groups. Based on the same years of data, Latina adolescents are the most likely to experience a pregnancy as a teenager (47.0 per 1,000 per year). African American adolescents have the second highest rates with 41.5 per 1,000 per year. Non -Hispanic white adolescents and Asian adolescents are less likely to give birth as teenagers (6.5 and 3.0 per 1,000 per year, respectively). 90 Geography matters for the rates of teen birth as well. Disparities across communities range from 52.7 per 1,000 adolescent girls in ZIP code 60087 to 2.2 births per 1,000 in 60048. In total, 5 ZIP codes exceed the nation al rate of 31.3 (60064 (48.3), 60073 (42.9), 60085 additional ZIP code (60020 (29.9)) exceeds the state rate of 29.5.91 LOW BIRTH WEIGHT Low birth weight puts infants at risk of developmental challenges that persist later in life. From 2010 to 2013, 7.4% of births in Lake County were below 2500g, better than Illinois (8.2%) and United States (8.0%) rates. Overall, Lake County is also below the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8% of births that are low birth weight. Wi thin the county, disparities persist between racial and ethnic groups. 12.2% of African American babies in Lake County are low birth weight, compared to 8.4% of Asian American babies. Non -Hispanic white and Hispanic babies had the lowest rates of low birth weight, at 6.9% and 6.7%, respectively. 92 90 Illinois Department of Public Health.

COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 131 PREMATURE BIRTH Premature birth, or births at less than 37 weeks gestational age, also place babies at greater risk for long -term health issues. From 2010 to 2013, 9.4% of babies in Lake County were born prematu re, lower than the overall rates for Illinois (10.1%) and United States (11.4%). It is also lower than the Health y People 2020 target of 11.4%. African American babies were the most likely to be born premature (11.1%). Non -Hispanic whites had the second hi ghest rates at 9.5%. Asian American and Hispanic babies were the least likely to be born premature (8.8% and 8.5%, respectively). 93 INFANT MORTALITY Infant mortality in Lake County averages 5.9 infants per 1,000 births from 2010 to 2013. Overall, this rat e matches the Healthy People 2020 target of 6.0 infant deaths per 1,000 births. Dramatic disparities exist between groups in Lake County. African American infants are almost two and a half times more likely to die before their first birthday than the count y average, with a rate of 14.6 per 1,000 births. Hispanic infants experience rates slightly better than the county average, with 5.7 deaths per 1,000 births.

COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 132 DEATH, ILLNESS, AND INJURY Chronic conditions affect residents' quality of life every day. Understanding the underlying health issues that impact the wellbeing of Lake County residents or contribute to early death can help LCHD/CHC and its pa rtners to address the systems, policies, and environments that can impact the prevalence or progression of these diseases. Action on these items will help ensure that the residents of Lake County live their healthiest lives. CHRONIC DISEASES From the Lake County 2015 Community Health Status Survey, rates of diagnosis for key chronic conditions were calculated for adults. Rates for these conditions were compared to Illinois rates from the Round 5 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System survey when available. Lake County faces many of the same chronic disease challenges as the state. Cardiovascular diseases, in particular hypertension, affect over a third of adults in the county. Lake County adults are more likely to have been diagnosed with pre- diabetes than Illinois (14% vs. 6.9%) but adults are less likely to have been diagnosed with diabetes (7% vs 10.2% having ever been diagnosed with diabetes). Additionally, about one in six households with children has at least one child who has asthma. 95 African Amer icans in Lake County utilize the emergency room for asthma at rates about four times higher than the overall county rate.96 95 LCHD 2015 Community Health Status Survey 96 Illinois Department of Public Health.

Obesity is a condition where a person 's body fat is too high . Individuals struggling with obesity face greater health challenges and tend to die younger than those with normal weights. People who are obese have a higher risk for many chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, liver and gallbladder disease, respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, and cert ain types of cancer99 that can reduce a n obese person's quality of life. Obesity -related diseases are leading causes of premature death in the United States. Because obesity creates major challenges to living a long and healthy life, addressing obesity is vital to protecting and promoting public health. To better understand local burdens of obesity within Lake County, the Lake County Health Department acquired data from the Illinois Secretary of State to calculate community rates of obesity. The overall rate for Lake County was calculated to be 22.5%, less than Illinois (29.4%)100 and the national rate (34.9%).101 Another 34.4% of adults are overweight, bringing the total of adults who are overweight or obese and at higher risk for chronic diseases up to 56.9%. Weight status represents a health challenge for the majority of adults in Lake County. While the overall obesity rate in Lake County is lower than state and national values, communities experience dramatic disparities in obesity rates. The Health Department calculated obesity rates for individual ZIP codes and identified high - and low -burdened areas. For example, only 11.7% of adults in Lake Forest (60045) are obese, about half of the county rate. The rate in North Chicago (60064) is over three times highe r with 35.7% obese adults. In Lake County, the obesity rates in four ZIP codes (60064, 60099, 60085, and 60087) exceed 30% of adults. Adolescent weight status can persist into adulthood. Through the Illinois Youth Survey, students in the county reported fa irly steady body mass index across grade levels. When the self -reported height and weight values were calculated against the Centers for Disease Control Guidelines for youth BMI, 11% of sixth, 13% of eighth, 13% of tenth, and 12% of twelfth graders were determined to be overweight, with an additional 5% of sixth, 6% of eighth, 8% of tenth, and 6% of twelfth graders were determined to be obese. When asked to describe their weight status, 20% of sixth, 27% of eighth, 28% of tenth, and 28% of 99 \"The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity.\" Office of the Surgeon General (US) (2001). 100 Trust for America's Health.

Annual rates of cancer diagnoses can indicate which particular cancers might be more problematic for residents. The following table expresses the age adjusted rates per 100,000 residents for Lak e County.

Death from all cancers is the leading combined cause of death in Lake County, with an annual crude death rate of 149.2 per 100,000 residents or 155.4 per 100,000 age -adjusted death rate. Certain cancers are more deadly than others. For example, lung cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in Lake County. However, it remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the county. Lung cancer causes nearly one in four cancer deaths but represents about 12-13% of all diagnosed cancers. Pancreatic cancer ranks eleventh in the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer, but is the second leading cause of cancer d eaths. The following table provides an age- adjusted summary of death by cancer site for comparison between both cancer tables.105 Age Adjusted Death Rate per 100,000 by Cancer Site Men Women Lung 44.1 34.2 Pancreas 13.0 11.0 Colorectal 13.9 9.9 Breast ** 20.2 Prostate 17.9 0.0 Leukemia 7.8 4.1 Liver 7.0 3.3 Bladder 7.1 2.7 Non -Hodgkin's Lymphoma 6.2 3.1 Esophagus 7.1 1.6 Brain 4.5 2.6 All Other Sites 56.0 50.0 Total 184.6 142.7 105 CDC WONDER 2010 -2014. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 136 DEATH Information on leading causes of mortality can help to identify key health challenges. Nationally, chronic diseases account for seven of the top ten causes of death. The two leading causes of death in the United States - heart disease and cancer - account for nearly 48% of all deaths.106 Lake County's mortality burden follows a similar profile. The crude annual death rate in Lake County is 601.7 per 100,000 individuals from all causes. 47% of deaths are to heart disease and cancer. Seven of the top ten causes of death in Lake County are also chronic conditions. T he top ten causes of death account for about 73% of deaths in Lake County. 107 Cause of Death Crude Rate per 100,000 Cancer 149.2 Diseases of the Heart 133.6 Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases 30.2 Cerebrovascular Diseases (Stroke) 28.9 Accidents (Unintentional Injuries) 25.1 Diabetes Mellitus 18.5 Alzheimer's disease 16.2 Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis 13.7 Influenza and pneumonia 12.9 Intentional self -harm (suicide) 9.8 All Other Causes 163.6 Total 601.7 Deaths are not equally distributed across all populations in the county. While the crude values are an important starting point, different groups within the county have different burdens of death. Some of these are to be expected. Life stage has a strong influence on an individual's likelihood of death. Early in life, complications associated with birth or that contribute to infant mortality mean that the first year of life has a high level of mortality, but drops and generally remains low through middle age, where it then begins to climb as individuals get older. Individuals 85 years of age and older have the highest rates of death. The following table summarizes death rates by age group. 106 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Death and Mortality. NCHS FastStats Web site. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm. 107 CDC WONDER 2010 -2014. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 137 Age-adjusted death rates allow for an even comparison across geographies and racial and ethnic groups that standardizes the rates to account for differences in age distribution. In Lake County, the death rates between groups can be age- adjusted to compare the mortality burden between groups. Lake County's age- adjusted death rate is 632.4 per 100,000. When all populations are adjusted to a standard population, distinct inequalities emerge. African Americans in Lake County face a much higher burden of death, with a rate of 882.5 per 100,000. Non -Hispanic whites in the County have a death ra te of 650.5 per 100,000. Hispanics and Asian Americans have considerably lower rates of death, with 426.0 and 317.8 per 100,000, respectively. Across all groups, rates of death are lower in Lake County than in Illinois or the United States. 108 Age -Adjusted D eath R ate by Race per 100,000 Lake Illinois US African American 882.5 108 CDC WONDER 2010 -2014. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 138 EARLY DEATH Poor health can determine whether or not someone dies prematurely. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers deaths before age 75 to be premature. About 44% of all deaths in Lake County occur prior to the individual's 75th birthday. Certain causes of early death are preventable, so better understanding this subset of deaths can extend lives of community members. The ten most common causes of early death are highlighted in the following table. Many are the same causes as overall mortality.109 Cause of Early Death Death Rate per 100,00 0 Under 75 Cancer 85.3 Diseases of the Heart 46.5 Accidents (Unintentional Injuries) 20.9 Diabetes mellitus 10.8 Chronic lower respiratory diseases 9.5 Intentional self -harm (suicide) 9.4 Cerebrovascular diseases 7.8 Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis 7.1 Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis 4.3 Septicemia 4.1 To quantify how early in life a death occurs, a metric called Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) was used to calculate an extra dimension of the mortality burden. Each early death contributes a value of some number of years equal to the age of the individual subtracted from 75. The total number of years for each collection of causes was summed and then adjusted as an annual rate of years of potential life lost per 100,000 Lake County residents under the age of 75. A table of the top ten YPLL follows. Depending on how early a death is likely to occur, even less common causes of death can contribute significantly to YPLL. For example, suicide death counts may only be a small prop ortion of the total number of deaths in the County, but because suicide typically occurs at a much younger age than 75, the burden of suicide in years of life lost ranks fourth. Early childhood conditions, such as congenital malformations and conditions or iginating during the perinatal period, are not common enough to make the top ten causes of death for all or under 75; however, because the deaths from these causes are so early, they are quantified and presented in the following table: 109 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. Underlying Cause of Death 1999 -2014 on CDC WONDER Online Database, released 2015.

Overall, about 42% of deaths in Lake County occur before the age of 75. Seven ZIP codes in Lake County (60064, 60073, 60085, 60042, 60051, 60002, and 60096) fewer than 40% of deaths occurring before the age of 75. 110 110 Illinois Department of Public Health. Vital Statistics 2010 -2014. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 140 INFECTIOUS DISEASE Communicable and infectious diseases can create a substantial burden on the community's health. Proper prevention through healthy practices including immunization compliance and handwashing can reduce the likelihood of many outbreaks. Effective surveillance and management of disease can promote health for infected persons and prevent the spread of disease t o others. CHILDHOOD VACCINATIO NS AND PHYSICALS Of the 252 schools reporting to the Illinois State Board of Education on their immunization and school physical compliance rates, eleven have rates of protection from measles lower than 90%. Twelve schools have lower than 90% protection rates for Hepatitis B. 14 schools have rates of protection against chicken pox of less than 90%. 8 schools reported less than 90% of students were protected against polio. Noncompliance for required immunizations or physicals does not reach 90% for 28 schools in the county. Of these, 15 schools are in Waukegan CUSD 60, four are in Round Lake CUSD 116, five are in North Chicago SD 187, one is in Fox Lake GSD 114, and three are nonpublic schools in Gurnee, Waukegan, and Highland Park. Phy sical and immunization compliance rates across the county remain high but students in a subset of schools are not receiving necessary medical attention. 111 ADULT IMMUNIZATIONS Although regular immunizations support health throughout a person's lifetime, adults might not receive the immunizations that are recommended for them. For example, while the tetanus and diphtheria vaccine is recommended every ten years, only 60% of adults reported that they had received the vaccination in the past decade. Of those, only 40% responded that the vaccine included protection against pertussis. 68% of adults reported having had a flu shot in the past year. Older adults (age 65 and older) were the most likely to have had vaccinations against influenza. 112 111 Illinois State Board of Education.

COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 142 Tuberculosis rates fluctuated from 2010 -2015, ranging from 0.99 per 100,000 residents in 2012 to 2.67 per 100,000 residents in 2010. Tuberculosis in Lake County remained below the rates for both Illinois and United States throughout the interval.116 Rate of Tuberculosis per 100,000 by Year Lake County Illinois United States 2010 2.67 2.88 3.62 2011 1.00 2.80 3.38 2012 0.99 2.70 3.17 2013 1.42 2.54 3.03 2014 1.72 2.49 3.00 2015 2.28 2.67 2.98 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS From 2012- 2015, the overall rate of Chlamydia was 28.4 per 10,000 Lake County residents. Rates of gonorrhea across the county were 5.2 per 10,000 residents. Early syphilis was diagnosed in 0.2 per 10,000 residents over this window. This burden is highly dependent on geography, race and ethnicity, age, and sex.117 For example, Chlamydi a rates vary by nearly an order of magnitude. Rates of diagnosis are highest in ZIP code 60064, with a rate of 85.2 per 10,000 residents. Other areas with high burdens of Chlamydia include 60085 the rates of Chlamydia are fewer than ten per 10,000 residents. Similar trends can be seen with gonorrhea. Though the county rate is 5.2, the 60064 area is nearly six times higher with a rate of 29.9 per 10,000 residents. Gonor rhea is especially localized, with only five ZIP codes having rates higher than the county rate: 60064 (29.9), 60099 (21.2), 60085 (16.5), 60087 (9.2), and 60083 (6.3). For early syphilis, 60064 has a rate of 1.4 per 10,000 residents, seven times higher th an the county average.118 116 Illinois Department of Public Health Tuberculosis Maps of Illinois Case Rates, 2010 -2015.

COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 143 Rates of Chlamydia were exceptionally varied between racial and ethnic groups. African Americans were especi ally burdened with rates of 116.7 per 10,000. Hispanic individuals also had higher rates of infection, with 32.3 per 10,000 residen ts. Non -Hispanic whites had rates of 12.1 per 10,000 individuals. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders had the lowest rates with only 6.7 per 10,000 residents diagnosed with Chlamydia annually. Rates of gonorrhea excessively burden the African American co mmunity. Rates average 43.6 per 10,000 African American residents. African Americans are between 16 and 62 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhea than Hispanics (2.8), non -Hispanic whites (1.3), and Asian American and Pacific Islanders (0.7). 119 STI by Race and Ethnicity Annual Rate per 10,000 Chlamydia 28.4 African American 116.7 Hispanic 32.3 White 12.1 Asian 6.7 Gonorrhea 5.2 African American 43.6 Hispanic 2.8 White 1.3 Asian 0.7 119 Illinois Department of Public Health.

Youth ages 15 to 19 have rates of Chlamydia of 93.3 per 10,000. Young adults from 20 to 24 have rates of 191.7 per 10,000. The rate of diagnoses drops for individuals ages 25 to 35 (58.0) and 35 to 44 (10.8) . For gonorrhea, youth age 15 to 19 are diagnosed at rates of 18.1 per 10,000. Infection rates peak from 20 to 24 (29.6) and drop for 25 to 34 (10.9) and 35 to 44 (2.5).120 STI by Age Group Annual Rate per 10,000 Chlamydia 28.4 15 to 19 Years 93.9 20 to 24 Years 191.7 25 to 34 Years 58.0 35 to 44 Years 10.8 Gonorrhea 5.2 15 to 19 Years 18.1 20 to 24 Years 29.6 25 to 34 Years 10.9 35 to 44 Years 2.5 Women (41.8) are nearly three times more likely to be diagnosed with chlamydia than men (14.7). Men (5.3) are slightly more likely than women (5.0) to be diagnosed with gonorrhea. Although a relatively rare diagnosis, men (0.43) are about fifteen times more likely to be diagnosed with early syphilis than women (0.03).121 STI by Gender Annual Rate per 10,000 Chlamydia 28.4 Men 14.7 Women 41.8 Gonorrhea 5.2 Men 5.3 Women 5.0 Early Syphilis 0.2 Men 0.43 Women 0.03 120 Illinois Department of Public Health.

COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT 145 HIV AND AIDS HIV in Lake County was diagnosed at a rate of 7.1 per 100,000 from 2008 to 2015. AIDS was diagnosed at a rate of 3.3 per 100,000 residents across the same time period. In total, there are 401 persons in Lake County living with HIV and an additional 431 persons living with AIDS. The HIV diagnosis rate is slightly higher in Lake County than for the overall collar county rate (including DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties) of 5.0 per 100,000 and AIDS diagnosis rate of 2.4 per 100,000. 122 To prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, appropriate testing can be used to identify new cases of infection and properly manage treatment. About 41% of all adults in Lake County have ever been tested for HIV. Young women (women ages 18 -44) were the most likely to be tested with 66% reporting that they had been tested, followed by young men (men ages 18 -44) who had been tested at rates of 45%.123 122 Illinois Department of Public Health.

Outbreaks of vaccine - preventable diseases, novel pathogens, and other health challenges might require new or additional resources to address. Sentinel events include diseases and deaths that could be prevented with appropriate care or services and might represent areas for improvement in the health system. OPIOIDS Drug overdose deaths in 2014 (largely driven by opioids) for Illinois occurred at an age -adjusted rate of 13.1 per 100,000 residents.124 In Lake County, deaths to all drugs in 201 5 were 9.8 per 100,000 residents. Of those, 84% were caused by opiates.125 Deaths do not capture the full burden of prescription and illicit opioid use. While County data are not available for rates of opioid abuse, an important risk factor begins with legal use of prescription opioids. In the past year , 15% of adults in Lake County reported that they had been prescribed an opioid drug in the past twelve months.126 If this medication is not managed properly and attentively by the prescribing doctor, individuals prescribed opioids or others in their household can develop dependence or abuse these drugs. With a rate of 68 opioid prescriptions per 100 residents in 2012, Illinois is in the bottom quartile of states for opioid prescriptions per person. States range f rom 52 per 100 people in Hawaii to 148 prescriptions per 100 person s in Tennessee. 127 Although the data do not align temporally, if last year's prescriptions in Lake County are similar to the opioid prescriptions per 100 residents in Illinois, a considerable number of individuals being prescribed opioids are being prescribed either multiple opioid prescriptions, are chronically prescribed opioids, or both. These conditions place individuals taking legal medication at greater risk for developing dependency. Fo r individuals taking opioid medications for chronic pain, rates of misuse average between average between 21% and 29%, while rates of addiction range from 8% and 12%. 128 From a public health perspective, the challenge related to opioids is much broader than the tragic early deaths it causes. Legal prescription use is common and misuse is an important concern for healthcare and public health. 124 Rudd, R.A, Aleshire, N., Zibbell, J.E., & Gladden, M.

The 703,170 residents are more racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse than ever b efore.129 35.8% of the county are people of color and 28.0% of people over the age of five speak a language other than E nglish at home.130 Lake County is aging. The median age in the county increased from 33.8 in 2000 to 37.2 in 2014.131 Lake County remains one of the wealthiest counties in the State of Illinois with a median household income of $77,837, yet 9.4% of residents a nd 13.3% of children are in poverty.132 Minority groups have higher rates of poverty than non -Hispanic whites in the county. Housing stress impacts 38% of all households in Lake County and 51% of households that rent. Educational attainment in the county is generally high and 89.2% of adults over the age of 25 have a high school degree or higher, yet only 40.9% of Hispanic adults have completed high school. Health insurance coverage is generally high. 91.3% of residents have some sort of health insurance coverage, yet lack of insurance still burdens 23% of Hispanics and Latinos and 10.4% of African Americans in Lake County. Residents generally report good health at rates nearly equivalent to the 90 th percentile of counties across the United States.133 14.4% of a dults in Lake County are smokers.134 49% of adults in Lake County eat two or fewer fruits or vegetables per day.135 23% of adults in Lake County have been diagnosed with some type of mental illness.136 Generally, Lake County enjoys relatively low rates of advers e pregnancy outcomes, yet African Americans in Lake County experience these outcomes at higher rates.137 Chronic diseases afflict many of the adults in Lake County (22.5% of adults are obese,138 6% have been diagnosed with diabetes, and 35% have been told they have hypertension139) and chronic diseases comprise four of the top five causes of death.140 Opioids represent an emerging health issue beyond the overdose death rate. 129 American Community Survey 5 -Year Average 2010- 2014 130 Ibid. 131 Ibid. 132 Ibid. 133 University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.

Public health system representatives, community leaders, community members, and LCHD/CHC all contributed their kno wledge, values, and expertise to determine the current state of health in Lake County and the challenges, opportunities, and goals for the future. The Local Public Health System Assessment gathered representatives of the entire public health system. These individuals were tasked with assessing how well each of the ten essential public health services are currently being delivered in Lake County and identify actions to improve how well the public health system functions. The Forces of Change Assessment gathe red community leaders to identify trends and emerging issues for the local public health system and plan for ways that the system can proactively prepare for the future. The Community Themes and Strengths Assessment actively engaged the community at large and solicited opinions and priorities from the people served by the Lake County public health system. Lake County residents identified p oor diet and i nactivity and c hronic diseases (including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) as the two most important a reas for improvement. Mental health needs arose frequently in focus groups that engaged historically underrepresented populations. The Community Health Status Assessment (CHSA) confirmed the importance of chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and hypert ension (affecting 22.5%, 6%, and 35% of adults in Lake County, respectively) as well as mental health issues (affecting 23% of adults in Lake County). The CHSA also identified communities facing greater burdens of health conditions like obesity. In the 600 64 ZIP code, 35.7% of adults are obese, while in the 60045 ZIP code, only 11.7% of adults are obese. Disparities in conditions that affect health, social determinants like poverty and educational attainment, are evident between census tracts and identify t he greatest areas of need in Lake County. Taken together, these four assessments informed the prioritization process that lead to the four community priorities for the Lake County Community Health Improvement Plan of 2016- 2021: hypertension and cardiovascu lar disease, obesity, behavioral health , and diabetes.
