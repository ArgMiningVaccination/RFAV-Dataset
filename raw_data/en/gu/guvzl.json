This type of multifunctional detection method will be particularly useful for diagnosis of both acute and convalescent infections, as well as for assessing patient immunization status fol - lowing vaccination. The clinical timeline of SARS-CoV-2 infection consists of an acute phase, when viral RNA is detectable in clinical samples, such as saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs, followed by a con - valescent phase when serology biomarkers, such as IgG antibodies, are present in saliva and serum 1. Therefore, simultaneous analysis of these different biomarkers in clinical samples as the disease pro - gresses could provide more accurate results for disease monitoring and management. Molecular (nucleic acid) diagnostics that detect the presence of viral RNA are key to detecting the virus during the first 5 d of infec - tion, with a viral load peak around day 4 (Supplementary Fig. 1)2-4. Following the first few days of infection, the host produces IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies in a process known as seroconversion. These antibodies often become stable after the first 6 d of seroconversion and their titres can remain stable over months 5,6. The presence of different antibody types varies during infection7 and correlates with disease severity8,9. In particular, extensive cohort studies in hospitalized patients show that IgG antibodies against different viral proteins (for example, nucleocapsid or spike proteins) corre - late with disease severity and outcomes. For example, antibodies against the spike (S) protein are more specific 10 and correlate with virus neutralization8, while antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein have longer clearance rates11 and might appear earlier dur - ing infection12. Therefore, serological assays that detect the host's antibodies developed after an infection can widen the testing win - dow for SARS-CoV-2 beyond the molecular diagnostic timeframe and provide insights into the patient's progression. Such assays may also be used to determine whether titres are maintained over time and thus the effectiveness of vaccination responses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy trials have highlighted a direct corre - lation between the titre of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) found in the S1 subunit of the S protein, the neutral - izing antibody titre and vaccine efficacy13. Thus, the development of serological assays targeted to individual SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens could have important implications for predicting the efficacy of vac - cines and estimating the need for boosters.A lab-on-a-chip for the concurrent electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in saliva and Nolan Durr1, Hani Sallum 1, Galit Alter 5, Jonathan Z. Li 6, Xu G. Yu5,6, David R. Walt 1,7,8, Joseph A. Paradiso3, Pedro Estrela 4, James J. Collins 1,2,9 and Donald E. Ingber 1,7,10,11 Rapid, accurate and frequent detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and of serological host antibodies to the virus would facilitate the determination of the immune status of individuals who have Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), were previously infected by the virus, or were vaccinated against the disease. Here we describe the development and application of a 3D-printed lab-on-a-chip that concurrently detects, via multiplexed elec-trochemical outputs and within 2h, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva as well as anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins in saliva spiked with blood plasma. The device automatedly extracts, concentrates and amplifies SARS-CoV-2 RNA from unprocessed saliva, and integrates of sensors for performing multi- plexed diagnostics at the point of care may facilitate the widespread monitoring of COVID-19 infection and immunity. NATuRE BIoMEDICAL ENGINEERING | VOL 6 | AUGUST 2022 | 968-978 | www.nature.com/natbiomedeng 968Articles Nature Biomedical eNgiNeeriNgMolecular diagnostics, on the other hand, commonly involve methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which require rigorous sample preparation and temperature con - trol, cold storage of reagents, expensive instrumentation (requiring routine maintenance) and trained personnel to run the tests. While there are home diagnostic tests approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), many of these tests either involve self-collection and mailing to a central laboratory or are based on rapid antigen tests, which have shown to be less accurate than nucleic acid tests, such as qPCR 14. During the last few years, pow - erful diagnostic techniques that capitalize on CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology and associated programmable endonucleases have gained interest due in part to their high specificity, programmability and capacity to work at physiological conditions 15-19. CRISPR-based diagnostics capital - ize on endonucleases, such as Cas12a, which has a specific cleavage activity towards double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments match - ing its guide RNA (gRNA) sequence. Once the Cas12a-gRNA com - plex binds to its dsDNA target, it activates and subsequently engages in indiscriminate collateral hydrolysis of nearby single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 20,21. Electrochemical (EC) methods of CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection typically combine nucleic acid probes conjugated on an electrode with CRISPR-Cas effectors and have detection limits in the picomolar to femtomolar (1012-10-15) range22-26. Unfortunately, these detection limits are inadequate for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, which require ultrasensitive RNA detection at the attomolar (10 18) scale. To overcome this limitation, ampli - fication techniques such as loop-mediated isothermal amplifica - tion (LAMP) can be performed before Cas12a detection, which improves the sensitivity of fluorescent CRISPR-based assays by orders of magnitude 15-17,19,27. The combination of serological and nucleic acid diagnostics can improve the overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis28 and pro - vide qualitative data on the patient's disease severity and state of progression. However, workflows for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis that integrate serological and nucleic acid tests are currently limited as these assays require laboratory equipment such as pipettes, cen - trifuges and heating blocks, as well as specialized technical skills. Despite the advances to make SARS-CoV-2 tests as widely avail - able as possible, a lab-on-a-chip (LOC) platform for point-of-care (POC) use that can detect both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serological markers is not yet available. EC biosensors offer a particularly promising solution to achieve ultrasensitive, selective, multiplexed, quantitative and cost-effective LOC detection of both nucleic acids and proteins; they also offer the potential to interface with electronic medical records, integrated cloud systems and telemedicine. Despite their potential, EC diag - nostics have only been used to detect either nucleic acids or pro - teins individually26,29 and have been limited to methods that require multiple liquid handling steps and specialized equipment. Here we describe a low-cost, three-dimensional (3D)-printed, self-contained LOC diagnostic platform that is capable of concurrent detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and host antibodies directed against the virus from unprocessed saliva samples. This device integrates microfluidics that enable automated liquid handling for sample preparation with a simple and sensitive readout for both viral RNA as well as host antibodies. The simplicity of this device makes it user-friendly and should enable its use for POC testing within hos - pitals and in COVID-19 testing clinics. Results Design of the microfluidic electrochemical lab-on-a-chip plat - form. In considering the design of an LOC diagnostic device, we focused on accuracy, ease of use and a capacity to integrate with dig - ital health platforms. Towards this goal, we fabricated a microfluidic chip capable of processing untreated saliva to detect both viral RNA and host antibodies on the same EC sensor chip (Fig. 1). We chose saliva over the more common nasopharyngeal swab specimens on our device due to saliva's ease of self-collection and increased clini - cal sensitivity due to a high viral load30,31. Because unprocessed saliva is viscous and contains nucleases that could inhibit a downstream reaction, viral RNA is typically purified from saliva using costly and complicated nucleic acid purification kits. However, to eliminate the need for purification before reaction, we experimented with vari - ous sample preparation workflows that would allow for viral lysis and nuclease inactivation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Among differ - ent buffers tested, we found that incubating the saliva sample with a proteinase K 32 solution at 55 \u00b0C followed by a 95 \u00b0C inactivation effectively lysed the sample and eliminated false positive signals without inhibiting the performance of the downstream LAMP and CRISPR-based detection steps. Subsequent to the sample prepara - tion step, we needed a method to capture the nucleic acids from the saliva sample. We found that a polyethersulfone (PES) mem - brane was able to concentrate the RNA without inhibiting the downstream reactions33-36. Overall, the device incorporates a 500 \u00b5l sample preparation chamber that is used for the saliva-based RNA detection, a 50 \u00b5l reaction chamber that contains the PES membrane, a 25 \u00b5l LAMP reservoir, a 22 \u00b5l CRISPR reservoir and a 20 \u00b5l reservoir for direct saliva-based antibody detection. The compact design allows for the use of two high-power resistors as heating elements (Fig. 1b), one beneath the sample preparation reservoir and the other beneath the reaction chamber. The LAMP and CRISPR reservoirs are iso - lated from the sample preparation reservoir and reaction chamber to ensure no carryover heating from the heated elements during sample preparation and concentration. To optimize chip functionality, we tested a variety of reservoir and channel dimensions and placements to ensure uniform heat - ing and precise fluid flow (Supplementary Fig. 3). The chip was designed with different channel dimensions to establish resis - tors to the fluid flow, while the fluids were controlled by a small, fingertip-sized DC peristaltic pump with a maximum flow rate of 200 \u00b5l min 1 controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The chan - nels leading to the reservoirs were designed with higher resistance to avoid any backflow or cross-contamination with the reservoirs (400 \u00d7150 \u00b5m) (Supplementary Fig. 4), while the ends of the chan - nels leading to the reservoirs were designed with a stepped stop valve to stop any flow from the reaction chamber to the reservoirs. We tested a variety of reaction chamber geometries to ensure that the PES membrane surface area was adequate for nucleic acid capture and that the chamber had optimal fluid retention over the course of the reaction, settling on a serpentine shape (Supplementary Fig. 3), and designed higher resistance on the flow path to the EC sensor chip to avoid unwanted flow before the desired time point. The workflow of the sample-to-answer microfluidic detection device with fluid flow driven by an Arduino-controlled small peri - staltic pump is as follows. First, the user manually inputs saliva onto the antibody detection reservoir (Fig. 1a(5)) and the RNA sample preparation reservoir (Figs. 1a(1)). In the RNA sample prepara - tion chamber, the saliva combines with a proteinase K solution and is heated to 55 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by 95 \u00b0C for 5 min using integrated high-power resistors to allow for virus lysis and nucle - ase inactivation32. The saliva sample is then pumped over the PES membrane within the reaction chamber, where the RNA binds to the membrane. The reaction chamber is heated to 95 \u00b0C for an addi - tional 3-5 min to ensure denaturation of potential reaction inhibi - tors. The LAMP solution is then pumped from the reservoir into the reaction chamber and incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by the CRISPR mixture and incubation at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 30 min, after which it is pumped over the EC sensor chip to incu - bate. Saliva for antibody detection is then directly pumped over the NATuRE BIoMEDICAL ENGINEERING | VOL 6 | AUGUST 2022 | 968-978 | www.nature.com/natbiomedeng 969Articles Nature Biomedical eNgiNeeriNgEC sensor chip and incubated. The chip is washed with phosphate buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST), followed by the addition of polystreptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a precipitating form of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), after which the chip is read using a potentiostat. A more in-depth visual of the microfluidic chip and its workflow is provided in Supplementary Fig. 5. Integrated CRISPR-based molecular diagnostic assay. The CRISPR-Cas RNA detection experiments reported here capital - ize on Cas12a from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006, which has specific cleavage activity towards dsDNA fragments matching its gRNA sequence. Upon target binding, activated Cas12a-gRNA engages in collateral cleavage of nearby ssDNA 20,21, which can be read optically as an increase in fluorescence due to the hydrolysis of a fluorophore-quencher-labelled ssDNA reporter probe (RP). As a result, the signal obtained from the fluorescent assay will be high in the presence of its SARS-CoV-2 target and low when it is not detected. LAMP primers 37-41 and Cas12a-gRNAs were evalu - ated from a range of conserved regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to determine the most sensitive combinations using commer - cially available synthetic full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. The open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) assay, which targets a highly conserved region in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, had a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.3 viral RNA copies per \u00b5l, with a reaction time of 50 min (Supplementary Table 1, and Figs. 6 and 7). This LOD is comparable to high-performance SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcrip - tion quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays42, with half the time to result. To confirm that the assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 active virus, the ORF1a assay primers and guide RNA were further validated using 11 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR negative patient saliva samples and 19 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive saliva samples with a range of cycle threshold (C T) values (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9, and Table 2). To integrate the CRISPR-based molecular assay onto the EC sen - sor platform, we designed a biotinylated ssDNA RP that partially hybridized to peptide nucleic acid (PNA) capture probes immobi - on surface of antifouling trodes43 (Fig. 2a). were incubated with samples containing the LAMP/Cas12a mix which includes the biotinylated ssDNA RP . In the presence collaterally cleaved the biotinylated ssDNA RP , leading to a reduction in binding of polystreptavidin-HRP and thus, a reduc - tion in the precipitation of TMB deposited locally on the surface of the electrode 43. Reduced precipitation of TMB was recorded as peak current, which was measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) by sweeping the voltage between 0.5 and 0.5 V (Fig. 2b). As a result, the signal obtained from the EC platform demonstrated an inversely proportional relationship with target concentrations. It should be noted that the LAMP amplification before the CRISPR-based sam - ple detection increases the sensitivity of the sensor, allowing for a consistently distinguishable signal from samples that are at or above the LOD of the sensor (Fig. 2c). To optimize the binding efficiency of the PNA-based CRISPR-EC sensor platform, we varied the concentration and incubation time of the RP to obtain a rapid, high signal-to-noise ratio (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Among all the concentrations tested, 1 nM RP and 5 min incubation produced a high signal with no background.

To determine the potential clinical value of the optimized CRISPR-EC sensor platform, we extracted RNA from 19 patient saliva samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT- qPCR with a range of C T values and 11 RT-qPCR negative clinical saliva samples (Supplementary Fig. 8). The current measured in the form of the output signal from the electrodes was clearly distin - guishable (P < 0.0001) when comparing the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples (Fig. 2c). In addition, receiver operating char - acteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated an impressive cor - relation with RT-qPCR and CRISPR-based fluorescent detection, with 100% accuracy and areas under the curve (AUC) of 1 (Table 1).Multiplexed serology electrochemical assay. Multiplexed assays that diagnose disease by combining viral RNA with serology mark - ers can lead to a more robust understanding of the progression of diseases, including SARS-CoV-244. The primary antigens that elicit antibodies during coronavirus infection are the N and S proteins10. The N protein is the most abundant viral protein and is highly con - served among the coronavirus family45, with several studies indi - cating that IgG antibodies targeting the N protein may be more sensitive due to their early appearance and longer clearance rates during and post infection 7,11,12. While the S protein is less conserved than the N protein, it is highly immunogenic due to the S1 subunit that mediates attachment to target cells 46. Studies indicate that IgG antibodies against S1 are more specific and strongly correlate with virus neutralization 47,48. Antibodies targeting Schematic of the CRISPR electrochemical assays and assay performance using clinical samples. a, Schematic illustrating the surface chemistry of the EC assay. Without viral RNA (top row), the biotinylated ssDNA RP probe is not cleaved; therefore, the polystreptavidin-HRP binds to the PNA/biotin-DNA duplex when added to the EC sensor chip and consequently precipitates TMB, resulting in an increase in current. In contrast, the biotinylated RP ssDNA is hydrolysed in the presence of viral target RNA (bottom row), cleaving the biotin group. Consequently, polystreptavidin-HRP does not bind to the surface of the chips, resulting in no TMB precipitation and no increase in current. b, Cyclic voltammogram showing the typical current peak signal achieved after incubation of samples from both SARS-CoV-2 negative (orange) and positive (blue) clinical samples. c, Clinical samples that contained SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (+, blue circles, 19 samples) had low signals in our device and were clearly distinguishable from the high signals obtained for samples that did not contain viral RNA (, orange circles and black line representing the median value, 11 samples).

Therefore, to maximize our assay's accuracy, we leveraged the multiplexing capabilities of our EC sensor and fabricated a mul - tiplexed serology assay capable of measuring antibodies against the S1, S1-RBD and N proteins for detection of a patient's immunity, whether through previous viral infection or vaccination. We began by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to optimize the reagents before assembling the multiplexed serology EC sensor chip (Supplementary Figs. 13-17). Initially, a small set of high-titre and low-titre positive clinical plasma samples were used to optimize the assay over a broad range of IgG titres. The best-performing capture antigens were S1, S1-RBD and the detection antibodies were biotinylated goat anti-human IgG, rabbit anti-human IgM and goat anti-human IgA. We validated the ELISA accuracy with 58 SARS-CoV-2 plasma samples from patients with a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 RT- qPCR result and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Out of the 54 negative SARS-CoV-2 samples, 22 were collected before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The ROC curve analysis of the ELISA results yielded AUC values between 0.68 and 0.89 for IgG, IgM and IgA (Supplementary Figs. 15-17). Next, we used the optimized reagents to develop a multiplexed EC sensor to measure the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 from patient plasma samples. We fabricated an EC sensor with an antifouling coating composed of bovine serum albumin and S1-RBD N or BSA as an on-chip negative control (electrode 4) to perform a multi-antigen sandwich EC ELISA (Fig. 3a). We used an affinity-based sandwich strategy for the EC sensor assay, meaning that when SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present, they bound to both the surface antigen and secondary antibody, leading to an increase in the EC signal. Each immunoglobulin isotype (IgG, IgM and IgA) was detected individ - ually on the multiplexed EC sensor chips. Figure 3b-e show typi - cal CV results obtained with the multiplexed EC sensor chips for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG using SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative clinical samples. We optimized the assay conditions of the serology EC assays to obtain the highest signal-to-noise ratios on both high- and low-titre clinical samples by varying factors such as plasma dilutions, sample incubation times and TMB precipitation times (Supplementary Figs. 18-20). We found that a 30 min sample incubation at a 1:9 plasma dilution with a 3 min TMB precipitation time resulted in the highest sensitivity and specificity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical plasma samples (Supplementary Fig. 19c). We then evaluated the accuracy of the EC serology platform using plasma samples from patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive result. We performed an ROC curve analysis utilizing the 58 SARS-CoV-2 positive plasma samples and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples used to optimize the ELISA assay (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 21a). The clinical samples had a wide range of IgG levels, which fall within the IgG detection sensitivity range of our platform (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23), and there was excel - lent correlation between IgG levels detected and the clinical status of the patients. Overall, the AUC for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Table 1) was higher than that for IgM (Supplementary Fig. 21b), whereas IgA 's AUC was lowest (between 0.57 and 0.78) and did not add diag - nostic value (Supplementary Fig. 21b). The specificity of each indi - vidual sensor modified with either S1, N or RBD was over 95% for IgG. Further analysis of the multiplexed assay's ROC curves showed that S1-RBD was the most accurate capture probe (AUC = 1 for IgG), followed by N and S1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 21a). In addition, we found that combining the results of the three antigens as a multiplexed readout resulted in a slight increase in accuracy when assessing a patient's immune status (AUC = 1 for IgG) (Fig. 3f and Table 1, combined). The combined EC IgG assay had an excellent correlation with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and was shown to be 100% accurate (100% sensitivity and speci - ficity); we therefore used this for subsequent experiments on the multiplexed EC sensor chips. We also found the EC sensor-based serology platform to be more accurate in detecting samples from patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection than the ELISA plat - form. The high specificity of the EC sensor platform may be attrib - uted to the low non-specific binding on our nanocomposite-coated EC electrodes43,49,50. A multiplexed viral RNA and antibody diagnostic in a 3D-printed LOC platform. We next worked to combine both EC sensors to cre - ate a multiplexed assay for simultaneous viral RNA and serological biomarker detection on-chip to facilitate increased sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 detection 44. Saliva is an excellent source of both viral RNA as well as host antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA) in SARS-CoV-2 patients 51, and hence is an ideal sample for a multi - plexed assay for viral RNA and serology. Unfortunately, the patient saliva samples used for this study had to be heat-inactivated before use as saliva from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are of a highly contagious nature. Because high heat denatures the antibodies 1, we spiked a National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) SARS-CoV-2 IgG calibrant into heat-inactivated saliva T able 1 | R oC curve analysis for electrochemical assays Viral RNA Serology (IgG) Electrode oRF1a RNA 19 54 54 54 54 Number of negative samples 11 58 58 58 58 Summary of the numerical values of the ROC curve analysis of the patient sample data collected for the SARS-CoV-2 biomarker assays for detection of (left to right) ORF1a RNA, S1 subunit, S1-RBD, N and a combined assay.

After confirming that the signal outputs from the spiked saliva samples were consistent with the signals generated from the plasma samples (Supplementary Fig. 24), we modified the EC sensor chip so that the four electrodes could be used individually to detect the three antigens (S1, N and S1-RBD) and PNA (Fig. 4a). To study the performance of our multiplexed EC sensor, we first conducted a two-step assay where antibody-spiked saliva was split into two volumes: 15 \u00b5l was incubated on the chip for multi - plexed serological detection of the host's anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti - bodies and 280 \u00b5l was used for RNA extraction followed by the LAMP-CRISPR-based assay and incubation on the same chip. Following incubation of both samples on the electrodes, we simulta - neously measured the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and host antibodies on-chip with the EC sensor readout of precipitating TMB following the addition of polystreptavidin-HRP . We validated the assay per - formance by testing the four possible combinations of serology and RNA-positive and RNA-negative clinical samples (Supplementary Fig 25). We achieved a very high probability (Student's t-test P < 0.0001) of distinguishing positive from negative samples with an ultra-low background signal in all the combinations tested. Taken together, these results showed excellent multiplexing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and host antibodies on the chips, with 100% correlation in specificity and sensitivity. Following these validation experiments, we integrated the multi - plexed EC sensor chip into the compact LOC microfluidic platform (Fig. 1) to test the capabilities for automated viral RNA prepara - tion before the EC sensor readout. Using the same functionalized chip assay as described above, each clinical saliva sample was split between the RNA and antibody reservoirs and the assay was per - formed as described in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 5. Similar to the initial validation of the multiplexed assay, the assay performance of the LOC microfluidic system with integrated EC sensor chip was validated by testing the four possible combinations of serology and RNA-positive and RNA-negative clinical samples (Fig. 4b-e). Clinical IgG negative samples showed no EC signal for the N, S1 and S1-RBD antigen-conjugated electrodes (Fig. 4b,c), whereas clinical samples from patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 showed high IgG loads in all three antigen test areas (Student's t-test for S1 and S1-RBD, P < 0.0001 and for N, P = 0.0004) (Fig. 4d,e). Moreover, we measured high signals on the PNA-conjugated electrode for all clinical samples that were negative for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (Fig. 4b,d) and low or no currents on the PNA electrode for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR RNA-positive samples (Student's t-test, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 4c,e). Taken together, these results show that the LOC system can effectively prepare and deliver unprocessed saliva samples containing both SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and host anti - bodies for on-chip simultaneous multiplexed detection with 100% correlation in specificity and sensitivity. A cost analysis of the LOC multiplexed diagnostic is provided in Supplementary Table 4. Discussion Molecular diagnostics for detection of pathogen RNA and serologi - cal assays for assessment of host antibody responses are comple - mentary tools that provide critical information to respond to disease outbreaks, assess vaccination status, and manage patient care and risks.

Including serological assays can improve understanding of a patient's clinical status following viral infection and can also be used to assess a patient's response to vac - cination13. For example, currently available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 S and S1-RBD proteins, and vaccinated individuals who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are expected to develop measurable antibodies against the S1, but not the N protein 58. Therefore, multiplexed serol - ogy assays that target antibodies against several viral antigens can become key for seroprevalence studies to estimate the proportion of people in a population that have been infected, including those with asymptomatic infection, and/or those immunized with vaccines. This information is key for estimating herd immunity and vaccine efficacy 13, which are critical in deciding to reopen economies59,60. In the present study, we described a sample-in-answer-out diagnostic platform that integrates ultrasensitive and highly spe - cific multiplexed EC sensors within an LOC microfluidic chip to rapidly and simultaneously detect both clinically relevant quanti - ties of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and antibodies within patient saliva samples. This platform incorporates multiple innovations includ - ing: (1) engineering of a high-specificity and high-sensitivity mul - tiplexed EC sensor chip that enables detection of both proteins and nucleic acids with clinically relevant samples of biological fluids perfused through a single microfluidic channel; (2) develop - ment of a CRISPR-based detection assay optimized to function in a multiplexed EC assay in parallel with antibody-based detection assays, the optimized assay being amenable to POC applications; (3) development of methods for automated microfluidic extraction and amplification of RNA from raw patient saliva samples; and (4) fluidic integration of the sample preparation process with the EC sensor chip. While other CRISPR-based diagnostics (for example, for SARS-CoV-2) have been described 61-63, they are typically limited to fluorescence and lateral flow readouts. Similarly, while there have been CRISPR-based EC sensors published 22-26, none have been sen - sitive enough to detect clinically relevant quantities of target nucleic acid. A key difference between our work and that of other recently published POC CRISPR-based electrochemical detection platforms is our use of polystreptavidin-HRP/TMB-based reaction chemistry for readout, which enables further amplification of the EC signal for both the serological and CRISPR-based RNA sensors. Some EC-based sensors, such as the graphene field effect transistor-based EC biosensors for SARS-CoV-2, have displayed similar levels of sensitivity to the 0.8 copies l 1 LOD shown here64; however, those assays were only validated for viral transport media-based nasopha - ryngeal swab samples and more importantly, do not have multiplex - ing capabilities. In this study, we also designed a customized molecular assay for nucleic acid detection that combines isothermal nucleic acid - cation with CRISPR-based enzymatic detection to target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in saliva. This was possible through the development and optimization of RNA-dependent Cas12a cleavage of a the chip-based polystreptavidin-HRP/ TMB-based reaction chemistry that allows for target detection more sensitively than fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas12a assays, but with a similar time to result.

NATuRE BIoMEDICAL ENGINEERING | VOL 6 | AUGUST 2022 | 968-978 | www.nature.com/natbiomedeng 974Articles Nature Biomedical eNgiNeeriNgrGOx/GA-based antifouling surface chemistry allowed for a novel multiplexed sensing system that generates high conductivity and low non-specific binding signals across a variety of biomolecular targets, aided by the sensitivity of the polystreptavidin-HRP/TMB reaction chemistry. Through optimization of reaction conditions, our EC assay has ultra-low background as well as improved sensitivity necessary for clinically relevant diagnostics that detect both nucleic acid and antibody targets 37,49. We validated the EC sensor for serology and obtained an accu - racy of 100% (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity) for IgG as compared with traditional ELISA, with S1-RBD showing the high - est accuracy in detecting IgG in clinical samples. This increased specificity for S1-RBD may be explained by the RBD domain being a highly immunogenic epitope for development of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 during the humoral response 47. In addi - tion, we characterized a multiplexed EC sensor that detects anti - bodies against relevant viral structural proteins (S1-RBD, S1 and N) for a variety of antibody isotypes (IgG, IgM and IgA), and enables a more robust understanding of the humoral response in patients. Importantly, we also found that simultaneous multiplexed detection of different viral antigens led to increased diagnostic sensitivity. Finally, we designed and tested a microfluidic LOC platform that integrates with the multiplexed EC sensor for simultaneous detec - tion of both RNA and IgG in clinical saliva samples. Saliva is an excellent alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, as it is simple to collect, does not require extensive collection equipment, and has been shown to provide both nucleic acid and serological data during and post infection or vaccination 1,30,65. The microfluidic chip eliminates the need for RNA extraction kits by automating raw saliva sample preparation, RNA amplification and CRISPR-based RNA detection steps. With its compact and sealed design, our LOC platform limits user steps to avoid possible sources of contamination or human-introduced error to allow for device use by untrained end-users, further increasing its potential as a POC testing system. With our integrated device, we are able to perform both serological and RNA detection from a saliva sample without requiring specialized collection reagents or equipment, and with results reported concurrently. To our knowl - edge, there has so far been no report of an EC diagnostic device that is multiplexed, highly sensitive and capable of processing raw biological samples such as saliva. We tested our microfluidic LOC platform on four categories of SARS-CoV-2 clinical saliva samples: RNA negative and antibody negative; RNA positive and antibody positive; RNA negative and antibody positive; and RNA positive and antibody negative. Clear differentiation was seen between IgG negative and positive samples for N, S1 and S1-RBD antigen-conjugated electrodes (Student's t-test for S1 and P < 0.0001 and for N, P = 0.0004) as well as between samples positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (Student's t-test, P = 0.0002) within 2 h after inputting the unpro - cessed saliva sample, highlighting the utility of our platform. Limitations to our study include the small set of clinical COVID-19 saliva samples available due to the difficulty in acquir - ing saliva through biorepositories that do not routinely collect this sample type. However, the fact that we were able to obtain 100% accuracy with clinical samples that contained a wide range of viral loads strongly suggests that our CRISPR-based EC sensor platform could become a faster, simpler and cheaper non-invasive strategy compared with RT-qPCR and traditional fluorescent diagnostics. Additionally, to ensure that our multiplexed system was sensitive for clinically relevant levels of the biomarkers in question, we devised a system that would provide simultaneous qualitative results to gen - erate a more robust and accurate estimation of a patient's infectious and immune status. Future work can be directed towards design - ing a multiplexed system capable of providing semi-quantitative or quantitative data on biomarkers of interest.While our LOC platform is promising, there are bottlenecks that need to be addressed before this technology can be readily adopted for clinical POC settings. Currently, our system uses peristaltic pumping for fluid movement and a potentiostat for the readout of the EC sensor chips. Further integration of the electronics, peri - staltic pumping and potentiostat-based readout would allow for a robust reusable system that could make this multiplexed diagnostic tool useful for healthcare and clinical POC settings. Similarly, the 3D-printed microfluidic chips can be made at scale by transitioning to injection moulding techniques, with the LAMP and the CRISPR detection reagents pre-measured, lyophilised and sealed within the cartridge for streamlined assay use. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, there is a critical need to rapidly adapt current testing strategies to more quickly and easily monitor both the infection and immune status of patients. Knowledge of infection stages can help curb disease spread, while insights on antibody titre levels can help with understanding how novel variants may affect individuals with immune protection through infection, vaccination or a combination of both. The streamlined workflow and multiplexing capabilities of our EC sensor represent important steps towards building the infrastructure necessary to provide this information to clinicians and members of the public alike. Methods Chip preparation. Gold chips were custom manufactured by Telic Company using a standard photolithography process with deposition of 15 nm of chromium and 100 nm of gold on a glass wafer. The area of electrodes was controlled by depositing a layer of 2 \u00b5m of insulating layer (SU-8). Before use, gold chips were cleaned by 5 min sonication in acetone (Sigma Aldrich, 650501) followed by isopropanol (Sigma Aldrich, W292907). To ensure a clean surface, the chips were then treated with oxygen plasma using a Zepto Diener plasma cleaner (Diener Electronics) at 0.5 mbar and 50% power for 2 min. Nanocomposite preparation and activation. Nanocomposite coating was prepared using the previously described method 43. Briefly, amine-functional reduced graphene oxide (Sigma Aldrich, 805432) was dissolved in 5 mg ml1 BSA (Sigma Aldrich, 05470) in 10 mM PBS solution at pH 7.4 (Sigma Aldrich, D8537), and ultrasonicated for 1 h using 1 s on/off cycles at 50% power. The solution was then denatured by heating at 105 \u00b0C for 5 min and centrifuged to remove the excess aggregates. The nanomaterial solution was then crosslinked by mixing with 70% glutaraldehyde (Sigma Aldrich, G7776) at a ratio of 69:1, deposited on the glass chip with the gold electrodes and incubated in a humidity chamber for 20-24 h to form a conductive nanocomposite 50. After nanocomposite deposition, gold chips were washed in PBS by agitation (500 r.p.m.) for 10 min and dried with pressurized air. 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC, ThermoFisher, 22980) and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, Sigma Aldrich, 130672) were dissolved in 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.2) at 400 mM and 200 mM, respectively, and deposited on nanocomposite-covered gold chips for 30 min. After surface activation, chips were quickly rinsed with ultra-pure water and dried, and the capture probes were spotted on top of the working electrode area. Clinical samples and ethics statement. De-identified clinical saliva samples from the Dominican Republic were obtained from Boca Biolistics under their ethical approvals. Because the saliva samples were collected from actively infectious patients, saliva samples were heat-inactivated at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virions present in the samples, which denatured the antibodies present within the samples. RT-qPCR was performed by Boca Biolistics using the Perkin Elmer New Coronavirus nucleic acid detection kit. De-identified clinical plasma samples were obtained from the Crimson Biomaterials Collection Core Facility at Partners Healthcare (currently Mass General Brigham). Additional de-identified clinical plasma and saliva samples were obtained through the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness (MassCPR); these samples had been collected by Prof. Jonathan Li and Prof. Xu Yu. Additional pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic samples were obtained from the Walt Laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The Institutional Review Boards at the MGH, MGB and Harvard University as well as the Harvard Committee on Microbiological Safety approved the use of the clinical samples in this study. All clinical plasma samples were collected from convalescent patients and were inactivated by heating at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min before use to denature any potential SARS-CoV-2 virions that might be present in the samples; this lower temperature denaturation method allows us to retain antigenicity of antibodies present within the samples. CRISPR-based RNA assay with fluorescent reporter. CRISPR-based assays require of both LAMP isothermal amplification primers and gRNAs NATuRE BIoMEDICAL ENGINEERING | VOL 6 | AUGUST 2022 | 968-978 | www.nature.com/natbiomedeng 975Articles Nature Biomedical eNgiNeeriNgto detect the LAMP amplicons. LAMP amplification primers (Supplementary Table 3) were selected after testing a range of LAMP primers, including some from the literature 37-41. Cas12a-gRNAs consist of two parts: the handle region (UAAUUUCUACUAAGUGUAGAU) that the Cas protein recognizes and binds, and a user-defined region at the 3' end of the handle that determines the specificity to the target. Spacer regions were selected following established guidelines 20. To synthesize the gRNA (gRNA sequence: UAA ACG CA), synthetic DNA with an upstream T7 promoter sequence (5 GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG 3) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and in vitro transcribed using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA synthesis kit from New England Biolabs (NEB). Reactions were incubated for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C, treated with DNase I (NEB) and purified using the RNA Clean & Concentrator-25 kit (ZymoResearch). gRNA was quantified (ng l 1) on a Nanodrop 2000 (ThermoFisher). Simulated SARS-CoV-2 samples were prepared by serially full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (Twist Biosciences, MT106054.1) in nuclease-free water. Viral RNA extracted from saliva samples was used after purification via the QiAmp viral RNA extraction kit, as explained above. RNA was then amplified by LAMP and further detected by collateral cleavage of the fluorophore-quenched ssDNA RP . Briefly, 5 \u00b5l of the diluted genomic DNA, or clinical sample RNA extract was added to 2.5 \u00b5l of the 10X primer mix (Supplementary Table 3), 12.5 \u00b5l of the LAMP master mix (NEB) and 5 \u00b5l water. LAMP mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 65 \u00b0C. After LAMP amplification, 4 \u00b5l of the amplified LAMP mixture were mixed with 11 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water and 5 \u00b5l of the CRISPR which 1 \u00b5M ssDNA gRNA in 10X NEB 2.1 buffer. Reactions were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min and fluorescence kinetics were measured using a BioTek NEO HTS plate reader (BioTek Instruments), with readings every 2 min (excitation 485 nm; emission 528 nm). Chip functionalization for the CRISPR-based RNA acid was obtained from PNAbio. PNA is a synthetic analogue of DNA with a backbone utilizing repeating units of N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine linked through amide bonds. PNA contains the same nucleotide bases as DNA (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine) but are connected through methylene bridges and a carbonyl group to the central amine of a peptide backbone 66. Stock PNA was diluted to 20 \u00b5M in 50 mM MES buffer and spotted on the working electrode. One electrode was spotted with 1 mg ml1 BSA as a negative control. The spotted chips were incubated overnight in a humidity chamber. After conjugation, chips were washed and quenched in 1 M ethanolamine dissolved in 10 mM PBS at pH 7.4 for 30 min and blocked with 1% BSA in 10 mM PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. CRISPR-based RNA assay with electrochemical reporter. The RP sequence for CRISPR-based EC assays was a ssDNA Upon Cas12a activation, the ssDNA-biotin RP was cleaved in solution, thus preventing binding to the complementary PNA sequence on the surface. Polystreptavidin-HRP was then added and able to bind to the ssDNA reporter-biotin. The concentration of HRP bound to the electrode was read by HRP-dependent oxidation of precipitating TMB (TMB enhanced one component, Sigma Aldrich, T9455). TMB precipitation forms an insulating, non-soluble layer on the electrode surface. Full-length genomic RNA (Twist Biosciences, MT106054.1) was serially diluted and amplified with 2X LAMP master mix (NEB) for 30 min at 65 \u00b0C. Viral RNA was extracted from saliva via purification with the QiAmp viral RNA extraction kit. Similar to the protocol explained above, 5 \u00b5l of the viral RNA was added to 2.5 \u00b5l of the 10X primer mix (Supplementary Table 3), 12.5 \u00b5l of the LAMP master mix (NEB) and 5 \u00b5l water. LAMP mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 65 \u00b0C. After LAMP amplification, 4 \u00b5l of the amplified LAMP product was mixed with 10 \u00b5l nuclease-free water and 5 \u00b5l CRISPR mix, which contained 4 nM reporter, 100 nM Cas and 200 nM gRNA in 10X NEB 2.1 buffer. Mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C, during which time the ssDNA biotinylated reporter was cleaved. After that, 15 \u00b5l of the LAMP/reporter/ Cas mixtures was deposited on the chips for 5 min. Thereafter, the chips were washed and incubated with polystreptavidin-HRP and TMB for 5 min and 1 min, respectively. Final measurement was then performed in PBST using a a CV scan with 1 V s 1 scan rate between 0.5 and 0.5 V vs on-chip integrated gold quasi reference electrode. Peak oxidation current was calculated using Nova 1.11 software. Cyclic voltammetry allowed us to measure attomolar concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 target RNA. Serology ELISA assay. ELISA assays were optimized in a 96-well plate format. A volume of 100 l of 1 g ml 1 antigens S1 (SinoBiological, 40591-V08H), N (RayBiotech, 13010760) and S1-RBD (The Native Antigen Company, REC31849) were prepared in a 10 mM PBS buffer at pH 7.4, added to Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates (BioLegend, 423501) and immobilized on the plates by overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. The plates were washed three times with 200 l PBST, followed by the addition of 250 l 5% Blotto for 1 h. After washing the plates, 100 l of the clinical plasma samples diluted in 2.5% Blotto was added and incubated for 1 h at r.t. Plates were further washed and HRP-conjugated anti-human IgA/IgM or biotin-conjugated anti-human IgG detection antibodies were added for 1 h. The secondary antibodies used were: HRP-conjugated anti-human IgM (human IgM mu chain rabbit antibody, or IgA (AffiniPure goat 100 l streptavidin-HRP (1:200 dilution in l; ThermoFisher, 34022) was added for 20 min, followed by the addition of 100 l sulfuric acid (0.1 M H 2SO4 in water) to stop the reaction. The absorbance of the plates was immediately read using a microplate reader (BioTek NEO HTS plate reader, BioTek Instruments) at 450 nm. Electrochemical serology assay. To translate the ELISA assays to EC readouts, S1, N and S1-RBD were diluted to 1 mg ml1 in the PBS buffer and spotted in three electrodes of the EC chip. An additional electrode was spotted with 1 mg ml1 BSA as a negative control. The spotted chips were incubated overnight in a humidity chamber. After conjugation, chips were washed and quenched in 1 M ethanolamine (Sigma Aldrich, E9508) dissolved in 10 mM PBS at pH 7.4 for 30 min and blocked with 5% Blotto (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2324) in 10 mM PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, P9416). The fabricated sensor was then used to detect immunoglobulins from clinical samples. Each sensor was either used to detect IgG, IgM or IgA against the three antigens that were immobilized on the chips. Clinical plasma samples (1.5 l) were mixed with 13.5 l 2.5% Blotto and incubated on the chips for 30 min at r.t., followed by a rinsing step. Subsequently, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgM/IgA/biotin-anti-human IgG was added for 30 g ml 1; ThermoFisher, N200) diluted in BSA in PBST was added to chips with IgG for 5 min. The chips were rinsed and precipitating TMB was added for 3 min, followed by a final rinse and EC measurement using a potentiostat by cyclic voltammograms with a scan rate of 1 V s 1 between 0.5 and 0.5 V vs on-chip integrated gold quasi reference electrode. Additional antibodies were detection. Multiplexed sensors for both nucleic acid and host antibody detection were prepared by spotting three electrodes of the EC chip with proteins S1, N and S1-RBD, and spotting the amine-terminated peptide nucleic acid (AEEA-ACAACAACAACAACA) reporter on the fourth electrode. The spotted chips were incubated overnight in a humidity chamber. After conjugation, chips were washed and quenched in 1 M ethanolamine (Sigma Aldrich, E9508) dissolved in 10 mM PBS at pH 7.4 for 30 min and blocked with 1% BSA in 10 mM PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, P9416). The fabricated sensor was then used to detect IgGs as well as viral RNA from clinical samples. Multiplexed chips were used to detect viral RNA as well as IgG against the three antigens that were immobilized on the EC sensor chips. Negative control saliva (RT-qPCR negative) was heat-inactivated and spiked with plasma at a ratio of 1:20 to simulate IgG concentrations in saliva. Two experiments were done in parallel on each chip, as follows: (1) 15 \u00b5l of plasma-spiked saliva was used for the serology assays as explained above. Briefly, 0.75 \u00b5l of the plasma sample was mixed with 14.25 \u00b5l of control saliva and incubated on the chips for 30 min at r.t., followed by a rinsing step. Subsequently, biotin-anti-human IgG was added for 30 min at r.t. Chips were then rinsed. (2) In parallel, RNA extracted from RT-qPCR positive and negative clinical samples was amplified by LAMP for 30 min at 65 \u00b0C as explained above. Then, 4 \u00b5l of the amplified LAMP product was mixed with the CRISPR mix, which contained the biotinylated RP , and incubated for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. A volume of 15 \u00b5l of the LAMP/reporter/Cas mixtures was deposited on the chips after the chips had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Thereafter, the chips were washed and incubated with polystreptavidin-HRP and TMB for 1 min. Final measurement was then performed in using a a CV scan with 1 V s 1 scan rate between 0.5 and 0.5 V vs on-chip integrated gold quasi reference electrode. Peak oxidation current was calculated using Nova 1.11 software. Cyclic voltammetry allowed us to measure both the presence of IgG antibodies as well as attomolar concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 target RNA. Microfluidic chip for multiplexed electrochemical serology and CRISPR-based RNA detection. A microfluidic chip for a point-of-care diagnostic that integrated the multiplexed chip was designed using Autocad software and printed on a Formlabs Form 3B 3D SLA printer in grey resin (Version 4; Formlabs RS-F2-GPGR-04). The layer thickness chosen for the 3D printing parameters was 50 \u00b5m. The chip was cleaned in an isopropanol bath for 20 min, then cured in a heated UV chamber for 1 h at 60 \u00b0C (Form wash and Form cure, Formlabs). NATuRE BIoMEDICAL ENGINEERING | VOL 6 | AUGUST 2022 | 968-978 | www.nature.com/natbiomedeng 976Articles Nature Biomedical eNgiNeeriNgThe chip was designed with chambers for saliva, LAMP reagents and CRISPR reagents, as well as a reaction chamber lined with a PES membrane and a waste port. The PES membrane (Millipore, GPWP04700) was laser cut using Epilog Fusion edge 24 laser cutter to fit within the serpentine reaction chamber. The chambers were designed to be connected to the reaction chamber through channels that are closed when under vacuum. Additionally, the chip had a channel and waste port that allow for the integration of the EC sensor chip. The chip was sealed using a clear delayed tack adhesive tape (3M 9795R) to prevent evaporation. Two high-power resistors were used as heating elements for the sample preparation chamber and reaction chamber (Digikey, 355018RJT) and placed in a custom-printed backing to ensure that accurate and repeatable heating was provided. A full list of parts along with cost analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 4. The voltages used for each temperature are provided in Supplementary Fig. 5 and were generated using an Agilent E3631A DC power supply. A complete view of the microfluidic chip can be seen in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5. A small DC pump (Takasago, RP-Q series) connected to an Arduino Uno was used for the pumping. The workflow for the multiplexed EC assay on the microfluidic chip is as follows: (1) The microfluidic chip was sealed with clear delayed tack adhesive tape. (2) Saliva from patient samples (BioIVT) was inactivated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and mixed with 10% (by volume) proteinase K (NEB P8107S) that was diluted 1:10 in nuclease-free water. (3) 450 \u00b5l of the saliva mixture was added into the sample preparation chamber and the chamber was heated to 55 \u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. (4) The sample was pumped over the PES membrane within the reaction chamber at a speed of 50-100 \u00b5l min 1. (5) The reaction chamber was heated to 95 \u00b0C for 3 min. (6) 25 ul of LAMP reaction (12.5 \u00b5l of NEB 2X WarmStart 10 \u00b5l nuclease-free water and 2.5 \u00b5l of 10x LAMP primer mix) was pumped into the reaction chamber and incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min. (7) The heat was decreased to 37 \u00b0C and 22 \u00b5l of the Cas mix (15 \u00b5l nuclease-free water and 7 \u00b5l CRISPR mix, which contained 4 nM RP , 100 nM Cas and 200 nM gRNA in 10X NEB 2.1 buffer) was pumped into the reaction chamber and incubated for 30 min. (8) The LAMP/CRISPR reaction was pumped over the EC sensor chip at 4 \u00b5l min1 for 5 min, followed by 20 \u00b5l PBST at 15 \u00b5l min1. (9) 20 \u00b5l of saliva sample spiked with NIBSC antibody calibrant mixed with anti-IgG detection antibody linked with biotin was flowed through the EC sensor at 4 \u00b5l min 1 for 5 min. (10) The EC sensor chip was washed with 20 \u00b5l PBST at 15 \u00b5l min1, followed by addition of 20 \u00b5l polystreptavidin-HRP at 6 \u00b5l min1. (11) The EC sensor chip was washed with 20 \u00b5l PBST at 15 \u00b5l min1 and 20 \u00b5l TMB at 8 \u00b5l min1. (12) The EC sensor chip was washed with 30 \u00b5l PBST at 15 \u00b5l min1. (13) The EC sensor chip was read on a potentiostat and the cyclic voltammogram was generated. Reporting summary.

Statistics For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Me thods section. n/a Confirmed The exact sample size ( n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section. A description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regress ion coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals) For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P values as exact values whenever suitable. For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above. Software and code Policy information about availability of computer code Data collection Potentiostat measurements: Autolab PGSTAT128N, Metrohm; VSP, Bio-LogicPeak; the oxidation current was calculated using Nova 1.1 1 software. Data analysis Peak oxidation current for electrochemical CRISPR and serology assays was calculated using Nova 1.11 software. All data were pl otted, and statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. ROC-curve analysis was done in GraphPad Prism 8 using a 95% confidence interval and the Wilson/Brown method. The figures were created using PowerPoint, BioRender or Adobe Illustrator. For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published lit erature, software must be made available to editors and reviewers. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Portfolio guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.

If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before m aking your selection. Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf Life sciences study design All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative. Sample size Sample sizes were larger than three biological replicates, as described in Methods. This is a standard sample size in the field . Data exclusions No acquired data were excluded from the analyses. All data are from the most recent set of experiments performed. The electrochemical data could be excluded during acquisition if voltammograms or impedance spectra showed only noise, clearly indicating that the electrodes or electric paths were defective (cut) or that connections were not proper. Electrochemical data could also be eliminated during acquisition owing to human mistake, for instance starting the experiment in the wrong conditions, or owing to accidents during acquisition (for example, touching the electrodes during measurement or spilling the solution). All these issues were al ways confirmed before repeating the experiment. Replication All experimental findings were reliably reproduced. Randomization Positive and negative clinical samples for analysis were selected randomly. Blinding The investigators were blinded to group allocation during data acquisition and analysis. Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods We require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material, system or method listed is relevant to your study.
