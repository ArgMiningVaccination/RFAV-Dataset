The fruit of the capsicum plant contains a chemical called [capsaicin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-4181/capsaicin+topical/details). Capsaicin is what seems to help reduce pain and swelling. A particular form of capsicum causes intense [eye pain](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-pain-causes-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment)and other unpleasant effects when it comes in contact with the face. This form is used in self-defense pepper sprays. Capsicum is commonly used for [nerve pain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/nerve-pain-and-nerve-damage-symptoms-and-causes)and other painful conditions. It is also used for many other purposes, including digestion problems, conditions of the [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart/picture-of-the-heart)and [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood)vessels, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses. Uses & Effectiveness ? Likely Effective for - Nerve pain in people with diabetes ( [diabetic neuropathy](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-neuropathy)). A specific cream containing 0.075% capsaicin ( [Zostrix](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11201/zostrix+topical/details)-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) 4 times daily is approved for treating this condition. Another patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.), which is available by prescription only, is also approved for treating this condition. Creams or gels that contain smaller amounts of capsaicin (less than 0.075%) don't seem to work. [Chronic pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/understanding-pain-management-chronic-pain). Applying creams and lotions containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, can temporarily relieve chronic pain from several conditions. It's FDA approved for this use. [Nerve damage](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/video/diagnosing-treating-nerve-pain)caused by [shingles](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/Shingles-Topic-Overview)(postherpetic neuralgia). Applying a patch containing (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.), the active chemical in capsicum, reduces pain over 24 hours in people with this condition. This capsaicin patch is available by prescription only. Possibly Effective for - Back pain. Applying capsicum or capsaicin to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/teens/teen-skin)seems to help reduce back pain. - Cluster headache. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce the number and severity of [cluster headaches](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/cluster-headaches). It's not clear if it helps treat capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce runny nose in people who do not have allergies or an infection. The benefits might last for 6-9 months. [Osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-basics). Applying 0.025% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-faq)can improve [symptoms of osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-symptoms). - Acute pain. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/nutrients-for-healthy-skin)can reduce pain from trauma. [Nausea and vomiting](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting)after surgery. Applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery. - Pain after surgery. Applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm reduces the need for painkillers within the first 24 hours after surgery. Side Effects [sweating](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hyperhidrosis2), and runny nose. Capsicum is possibly unsafe to take in large doses or for long periods of time. When applied to the skin: Lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are likely safe for most adults. Capsaicin is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx). Side effects can include skin irritation and itching. Capsicum can also be very irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or near the eyes. When used in the nose: Capsicum is possibly safe. But, application in the nose can be painful and cause burning pain, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose. Special Precautions and Warnings [sweating](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hyperhidrosis2), and runny nose. Capsicum is possibly unsafe to take in large doses or for long periods of time. When applied to the skin: Lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are likely safe for most adults. Capsaicin is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx). Side effects can include skin irritation and itching. Capsicum can also be very irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or near the eyes. When used in the nose: Capsicum is possibly safe. But, application in the nose can be painful and cause burning pain, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose. Pregnancy: Capsicum is likely safe when applied to the skin during pregnancy. Capsicum is possibly safe when taken by mouth as a medicine during the second half of the [second trimester](https://www.webmd.com/baby/second-trimester-of-pregnancy)and during the [third trimester](https://www.webmd.com/baby/third-trimester-of-pregnancy). Breast-feeding: If you are breast-feeding, using capsicum on your skin is likely safe. But it is possibly unsafe for your baby if you take capsicum by mouth. Skin problems ( [dermatitis](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/contact-dermatitis)) have been reported in breast-fed infants when mothers eat foods heavily spiced with capsicum peppers. Children: Applying capsicum to the skin of children under two years of age is possibly unsafe. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe for children to use capsicum by mouth as a medicine. Stay on the safe side and stick with the amounts found in foods. [Bleeding disorders](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/blood-disorder-types-and-treatment): While conflicting results exist, capsicum might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Damaged skin: Don't use capsicum on damaged or broken skin. High blood pressure: Taking capsicum or eating a large amount of chili peppers might cause a spike in [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers). In theory, this might worsen the condition for people who already have high blood pressure. Surgery: Capsicum might increase bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using capsicum at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Interactions ? Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs) interacts with CAPSICUM Capsicum might slow blood clotting. Taking capsicum along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding. Theophylline interacts with CAPSICUM Capsicum can increase how much theophylline the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with theophylline might increase the effects and side effects of theophylline. Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs) interacts with CAPSICUM Capsicum might lower blood sugar levels. Taking capsicum along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely. Aspirin interacts with CAPSICUM Capsicum might decrease how much aspirin the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with aspirin might reduce the effects of aspirin. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) interacts with CAPSICUM Moderate Interaction Be cautious with this combination Medications for high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors) interacts with CAPSICUM Some medications for high blood pressure might cause a cough. There is one report of someone whose cough worsened when using a cream with capsicum along with these medications for high blood pressure. But it isn't clear if this interaction is a big concern.
