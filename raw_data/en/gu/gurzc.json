A [study](https://clinicalnutritionespen.com/article/S2405-4577(22)00002-X/fulltext#secsectitle0110) published in January found that vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc\u2014which have long been touted for their immune-boosting properties\u2014didn't decrease people's risk of dying from COVID-19.

He said that if you think you're deficient in any vitamins, you should check with your doctor, and consider eating more [fruits, vegetables](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/multitaxo/topic/vegetables-and-fruit/), and other [healthy foods](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/multitaxo/topic/healthy-diet/), because \"supplements can't take of a healthy diet.\" Read the Health.com article: [Taking Vitamins and Supplements Won't Help Reduce "}
