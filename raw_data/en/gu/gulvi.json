{"title": "Treatment Outcomes of Diabetic Patients With Erectile Dysfunction Prescribed High-Dose Tadalafil", "author": "Antony Condina; Tatiana Lykina", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Objective: To assess the treatment outcome of diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction who are prescribed an alternate daily high dose of tadalafil over a 120-day treatment period. Methods: This was a single-site, retrospective, observational study of 63 diabetic men with erectile dysfunction prescribed an alternate daily dose of 30mg of tadalafil between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Treatment outcomes accessed medication compliance, adverse drug reactions, and patient treatment satisfaction at 60- and 120-days treatment. Results: Mean age of patients was 58.3 years and included patients who suffered from comorbidities ranging from hypertension (54.0%), dyslipidemia (52.3%), and depression (9.5%). At 60 days in the study, 69.8% were satisfied and continued the treatment. However, at the end of the 120-treatment period, a low number of men (17.5%) were satisfied with the treatment and therefore did not remain on the treatment protocol. These patients reported a lack of medication dose efficacy (86.5%), non-compliance with treatment as prescribed (65.4%), and adverse drug reactions (30.8%) as reasons for discontinuing treatment. None of the identified patient demographics were significantly associated with 120-day continuous treatment. Similarly, the odds ratio derived from the logistic regression did not demonstrate an association between the selected variables and the outcome of 120-day continuous treatment retention. Conclusion: This retrospective case series study found that 82.5% of diabetic patients were not satisfied with treatment with alternate dosing of 30mg tadalafil to treat their ED at the end of the 120-day treatment period suggesting an alternative treatment plan.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-02-09", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
