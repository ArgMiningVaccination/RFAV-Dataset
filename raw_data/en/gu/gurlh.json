The system has been used for over 200 years by millions of people worldwide. In his health practice, and as owner of two thriving health and nutrition stores, David Card has consulted with thousands of clients for over 40 years, using homeopathic remedies. People who see him want to take care of their own and their family's health in the most self-sufficient way possible. Since most folks don't have access to a trained homeopathic practitioner at a moment's notice, Dave recognized the need for an easy-access book, free of jargon, that could be their \"go to\" for dozens of conditions. Homeopathy Today is current, interesting to read, and full of common-sense lists to assist any newbie in this field. Yet, it will serve as a standard for seasoned practitioners who will recognize Dave's grounded understanding, coupled with his intuitive sensitivity gained from decades of experience. Homeopathics are natural, low-cost and non-toxic remedies. They can be used by adults and children regardless of age, gender, special conditions like pregnancy, or the use of other medications. From common colds and flu to more challenging situations like anxiety and migraine headaches, homeopathic remedies have a long history of efficacy. In more than 2,000 double-blind scientific studies around the world, homeopathic medicines have been proven to work. The World Health Organization cites that homeopathic medicine should be used alongside conventional medicine to provide adequate global healthcare. Medical professionals in many countries recommend homeopathic medicine first, and most pharmacists in Europe dispense herbs and homeopathics as well as conventional medications. Using homeopathy is as simple as matching the symptoms of the person with the right homeopathic remedy. And this book is designed to make that process easy, clear and immediately applicable. More than symptom relief, however, homeopathic medicine also deals with underlying health issues. Often, when Western medicine has no answers, many people have turned to homeopathy and found significant help. \"We don't always know the mechanisms at work here,\" says the author, \"but we certainly see the results!\" Homeopathy For Today is current, interesting to read, and full of common sense advice to assist any newbie in this field. Yet, it will serve as a standard for seasoned practitioners who will recognize Dave's grounded understanding, coupled with his intuitive sensitivity gained from decades of experience. Over decades, I have seen countless family, friends, and clients find relief to their physical and emotional ailments through the modalities taught in this book. Because of its simplicity, readers will have an opportunity to adopt these principles into their own lives to restore health quickly and easily to themselves and their loved ones. \u2014Heidi L.
