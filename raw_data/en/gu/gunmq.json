Methods This systematic review of the evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening of newborns for detecti ng DDH addressed the following questions: 1. What is the diagnostic ac curacy of ultrasound in scre ening of newborns for DDH? 2. What is the impact of ultrasound in screening of newborns for DDH on the therapeutic decisions and on patient outcomes? 3. What is the cost-effectiveness of ultr asound in screening of newborns for DDH? 4. What is the evidence relating to questi ons 1,2 and 3 for ultrasound screening of newborns with the method of Graf? The review was based on the best ava ilable clinical and economic studies. The literature search involved a wide range of medical, economic and grey literature databases. The searches to retrieve literature published from 1975 to March 2004, were not limited by study design, or language. Further studies were identified by examining the reference lists of all included articles. In addi tion some literature was provided by BSV and by individuals. Using the inclusion and exclusion criteria two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts for relevance and recorded their decision to order or reject. They then appraised each full manuscript received and made a decision wh ether to include or exclude each study. For the evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in screening for DDH in newborns, all studies that had compared ultrasound, usin g any method, versus any reference standard (gold standard), and that allowed the generation of 2 x 2 tables, were eligible for inclusion in the review. A reference standard had to be a measur e of true disease, i.e. clinically relevant DDH. In addition, all comparative studies of newborns that had evaluated the impact of ultrasound in screening for DDH on the thera peutic decisions and on patient outcomes were included in the review. The comparison could be either with another group using a different screening method or the same population prior to the introduction of the ultrasound screening. For the evaluation of the cost-e ffectiveness of ultrasound in sc reening of newborns for DDH, all studies that provided a synthesis of cost and effectiveness data of ultrasound screening for DDH in accordance with the criteria specified for the NHS EED database were eligible for inclusion in the review. The main outcome measure of effectiveness for studies comparing an ultrasound technique with a reference standard technique for the diagnosis of DDH were to be rates of true disease, true non-disease, false disease and false non-disease (accuracy data). For studies that had evaluated the impact of ul trasound screening on therapeutic decisions and/or patient outcomes, and for those that had evaluated the method of Graf in the screening of newborns, the outcomes were to include overall treatment rates, rates of operative intervention, rates of abduction splinting, rate of delayed diagnosis, time to treatment, duration of treatment, rate of treat ment complications, false diagnostic labelling and any long-term functional outco mes e.g. osteoarthritis. For economic evaluations, the outcomes revi ewed were cost-effectiveness and related assessments. Specifically the following types of studies were excluded. Studies in which the population was a select ed one, for example, one that only included infants with clinical signs of DDH or with risk factors for DDH. viii Technical reports describing the technique of ultrasound screening, but containing no clinically relevant outcomes. In addition, descriptions of clinical experience we re excluded from the main analysis. Typically such papers would describe a large screening prog ram with no comparator group, where all cases identified as having ultr asound DDH were treated, wher e no information was obtained on the natural course of the disease or the in cidence of true, clinically relevant DDH. Data from all included studies were extracted and each study was assessed for quality. The data were combined in a narrative synthesis. The completed report was posted on the CR D website in September 2002 and comments were invited. The comments received were incorporated into the final version of the report. This did not result in any major changes. Results The search strategy generated 787 references . A total of 195 papers were of potential interest and of these 188 were obtained and apprai sed for inclusion in the review. A total of 63 references describing 62 studies were incl uded in the review. These comprised 11 papers: one study of diagnostic accuracy, 10 studies on the impact of ultrasound in screening for newborns for DDH, four economic evaluations a nd 47 descriptions of clinical experience. The one study of diagnostic accuracy was a prospective cohort study conducted in the Eastern Netherlands between 1 September 1998 and 30 November 1999. The ultrasound screening programme involved ultrasound imaging at the age of one, two and three months, with a reference test performed at eight months. Only children with sustained physical abnormality were referred for further diagnostic work-up and, where necessary, treatment. This study was flawed due to the choice of reference standard. In addition to those children who had an abnormal result at the reference test at eight months, infants were diagnosed with DDH if they were deemed to require treatment at any stage in the screening process. Thus, an unknown number of children treated during the screening program may in fact have been instances of overtreatment, and the sensitivit y was likely to have been overestimated. The results from this study generated the following values: the sensitivity of ultrasound was 88.5%; the specificity was 96.7%; the positi ve likelihood ratio was 29.1; the negative likelihood ratio was 0.12; the positive pr edictive value (PPV) was 61.6%; the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.4%; and the diagnostic odds ratio was 245.8. The studies that evaluated the im pact of ultrasound in screening newborn infants for DDH on the therapeutic decisions and on patient outcomes were of poor overall quality. Only two were randomised controlled trials (RCT) of limited qual ity, the others were mostly retrospective observational studies with historical controls. The populations included in the studies came fr om seven countries (Austria, Jordan, Norway, Poland, the UK, the Netherlands and Croatia) all from various periods between 1980 and 2001. The findings from one RCT indicated that general ultrasound screening of newborns at birth for DDH appears to result in the overtreat ment at a rate of around 16 infants per 1000 screened. This result was reflected in t he findings of observational studies. General ultrasound screening of newborns at birth for D DH reduced the number of cases of DDH late detected by 1 to 2 per 1000 when this was de fined as diagnosed after one month of age but not when defined as after eight months of age. Both RCTs found that general ultrasound screening was not statistically significantly better at reducing the number of cases of DDH diagnosed after one month of age than was se lective ultrasound screening (in which only those infants with known risk factors for DDH are examined with ultrasound). General ultrasound screening of newborns at birth or one month resulted in 1 to 2 fewer cases per 1000 requiring treatment with ope n or closed reduction or othe r in-patient treatment. The need for an operative intervention may be recognis ed earlier with ultrasound, rather than clinical screening (reduced from 12 months to 7 months in one study) and ultrasound screening may be associated with a shorter trea tment duration (1.74 months in one study). ixOnly one comparative study of Graf's methodology conducted in the context of general newborn screening for DDH was identified. T he findings did not indicate any meaningful difference between the utility of t he two imaging techniques studied. The available economic evaluations are limited by the quality of the clinical data available. Overall the cost of ultrasound screening of new borns for DDH may be comparable with that of other screening programmes. Conclusions Ultrasound imaging performed initially at age one month appears to be a sensitive diagnostic screening test. However, better q uality diagnostic accuracy studies are required General screening of newborns at birth or at one month of age for DDH using ultrasound rather than clinical examination appears to increase overall treatment rates and may be associated with overtreatment. General ultrasound screening of newborns may reduce the severity and invasiveness of the treatments required for DDH. There is no evidence that ultrasound screeni ng reduces the number of clinically relevant cases of DDH diagnosed late. Limited evidence indicates that general ultras ound screening of newborns offers little, if any increased benefit over selectiv e use of ultrasound imaging. There are no reliable data relating to the pos sible adverse consequences associated with general ultrasound screening of newb orns for DDH or any associ ated treatments. Further research is required. Few economic evaluation data are available and these are of limited value due to the quality of the clinical data upon which they ar e based. Overall the cost of ultrasound screening of newborns for DDH may be compar able to or better than that of other screening programmes There is a lack of evidence. Studies that address the questions relating to the true course of DDH, the effects of treatment, and the ac curacy of ultrasound screening are required. Implications for practice The decision on whether or not to implement ul trasound in the general screening of newborns for DDH has to be based on many factors: needs, resources, costs, preferences and evidence of effectiveness and safety. This revi ew highlights the lack of clear evidence in terms of the effectiveness, and to a lesser ex tent the safety of ultrasound in the general screening of newborns for DDH. However, this reflects a lack of evidence per se rather than any evidence that ultrasound sc reening is not effective or safe. Thus any decision at the present time will depend on weighting the prefer ences, needs, costs and lack of evidence. Implications for research Clearly, good quality research is required in th is field. Suggestions for an 'ideal study' and for a re-evaluation of existing screening programmes are described in the review. x 11. BACKGROUND 1.1 Objective The objective of this research was to evaluat e the effectiveness, clinical impact and cost- effectiveness of ultrasound in screening of ne wborns for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). 1.2 Description of disease and current position regarding identification and treatment Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is an all encompassing term for the entire spectrum of hip abnormalities due to an abnormal relationship between the head of the femur and the acetabulum in infants. The term includes dislocation (when the femoral head is completely outside the acetabulum but c ontained within the elongated joint capsule), subluxation (when the femoral head is sitting on the edge of the acetabulum and is prone to dislocation if left untreated), hip joint laxity (when there is an abnormal increase in the mobility of the hip joint as a result of a stre tched capsule, muscles and /or ligaments), plus a whole array of abnormalities that expres s inadequate acetabular development.1 The natural history and long term sequelae of DDH are still a matter of some debate. 2 If established dislocation is left untreated, hip or low back pain, knee pain and deformity may develop. Without treatment, it is uncertain ho w many dysplastic, unstable hips will retain their dysplastic features throughout life.3 The age of symptom onset and roentgenographic degenerative joint disease is related to t he amount of subluxation and dysplasia.3 Hip dysplasia is also considered to be a common cause of osteoarthritis and may be aetiological in a substantial proportion of total hip replacements.4 The benefits of screening for DDH are a topic for debate. 5 Historically DDH has been identified by clinical examination and follow-up in those with known risk factors (family history of DDH, breech birth, female gender) with diagnostic confirmation using radiography, typically at around four months of age. The in troduction of screening of newborn babies by clinical examination using Ortolani and Barl ow manoeuvres did not eliminate the incidence of late presenting DDH. A surveillance study conducted between April 1993 and April 1994 found that the ascertainment-adjusted incidence of a first operative procedure for DDH in the UK was 0.78 per 1000 live births (95% CI 0.72, 0.84). Interestingly, of the 318 children referred to the national orthopaedic surveillance scheme, 222 (70%) had not been detected by routine screening. Similarly, a survey in Germany of infants and young children receiving inpatient treatment for DDH found t hat 51.2% of them had completed a general ultrasound screening program before the age of six weeks 6 Furthermore, screening has been associated with an increase in adverse consequences associated with treatment.5, 7-9 Ultrasound imaging has been proposed and developed by, in particular, Graf10 and Harcke11 (see Appendix 8). The use of ultrasound imaging for the diagnosis of DDH, in screening for DDH, in monitoring of the dev elopment of DDH and in the monitoring of treatment of DDH have been extensively studied and reviewed (for example1,2,4,5,8,12-28). It has been demonstrated that ultrasound imaging may be a useful diagnostic test for DDH with sensitivities of 96% and 98% reported and specificities of 88% and 95%.29,30 However, there is still much debate regarding the appropriateness of this technique in the general screening of all newborn infants. Although the various studies cited by Harcke 19 demonstrate the accuracy of ultrasound imaging in detecting what has been named 'ultra sound DDH,' there is some debate over the relationship between this and clinically rele vant DDH or 'true disease'. Ultrasound imaging at, or shortly after, birth identifies a high number of immature and abnormal hips, most of which are 'false positives'; if left untreated t hey would develop normally. For example in a series of 144 hips found to be abnormal on ul trasound imaging, but which were not treated, follow-up up at around eight months found that only six hips were definitely or mildly dysplastic.31 2There appear to have been three approaches to improving the identification of cases of DDH. One has been to improve the sensitivit y of the screening procedure in newborns by using ultrasound in general newborn screening and follow-up.32 The second has been the use of general screening, but not unt il the age of four to six weeks of age.1 The third has been the use of ultrasound as a diagnostic test (o ften referred to as 'selective screening') in those patients at highest risk, that is, only thos e with clinically identified signs of DDH or with known risk factors for DDH.33, 34 In the approach to screening there is a gulf between those who believe that DDH detected on ultrasound should be treated very early or should be followed-up intensively, on the assumption that untreated cases will have an adverse outcome, 35 and those who believe that the risk of overtreatment is significant. In Switzerland, in 1996, ultrasound screening as described by Graf10,36,37 was introduced temporarily and was covered by health insurance until 31st December 2001. This was later extended to 31st December 2002. In that time period further evaluations were to be commissioned to provide evidence on the effect iveness, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the procedure. Ultrasound performed by me thods other than the one described by Graf have not been covered under this temporary arrangement. This systematic review addresses the questi on \"What is the evidence for the use of ultrasound in screening the general population of newborns for DDH\". 1.3 Importance of evidence for the effectiveness of a screening program Screening is the application of a diagnostic test to asymptomatic people for the purpose of dividing them into two groups: those with a higher probability and those with a lower probability of developing a disease.38 The consequence of screening should be to treat those who can benefit from an early intervention.39 The ideal characteristics in terms of disease, test and intervention to be incorporat ed into a screening program are presented in Table 1. Table 1 Ideal characteristics of disease, test or intervention Ideal characteristics of disease, test or intervention Disease: There is an asymptomatic phase where the disease is undiagnosed but detectable The natural history of the disease must be known as being associated with a significant burden for the individual pat ient as well as for the society. The prevalence of the disease is known as being high. Test: People tested positively develop the disease without an early intervention. That means that the positive predictive value is high. The screening must not miss subjects who are at risk of developing the disease. All subjects who are at risk of devel oping the disease are reached by the screening system Intervention: There is access to early treatment as a result of screening Early treatment has to be more effective t han late treatment. I.e., early treatment must be associated with a reduction of the expected disability when compared to late treatment. Early treatment must be associated with le ss adverse effects than late treatment. Early stage DDH appears to conform with some of these characteristics. There is an asymptomatic phase where DDH is undiagnosed but detectable. There is, as mentioned above, a controversy about how long this phase lasts since there are several definitions of DDH. The natural history of DDH up to absolut e end points like osteoarthritis is not known; 3 thus the prevalence of clinically meaningful DDH can only be estimated.40 In addition a screening program is only justif ied if it does more good than harm to the population. 38 Therefore, benefit and harm of a scree ning program, including the possible harm of the test itself as well as the treatm ent must be assessed. The potential adverse effects for all those tested including 'false posi tives' and 'false negatives' must be weighed very carefully against the predicted benefits of the program. Screening itself can have a 3negative effect by inducing patient or carer anxiety resulting from disease labelling and potential delay of treatment with adverse co nsequences in those tested negative. Treatment, initiated as a result of the screening test, can do harm in two ways: direct adverse effects and iatrogenic effects in thos e falsely tested positive. There must be an effective and harmless intervention so that the disadvantages resulting from disease labelling are outweighed. To assess the effectiveness of screening, t he accuracy of the screening test must be considered: if the accuracy of the screening test is not known, there is no scientific basis for a screening program. Accuracy studies done in symptomatic patient s are studies of diagnostic tests and those results cannot be used to estimate the accuracy of screening tests. Even excellent diagnostic tests have low positive predictive values when the prevalence is low. This results in many false positive results. 41 Thus it is essential that the accuracy of the screening test is assessed in the screening population. To assess the effectiveness of screening, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an intention-to-treat-analysis is the only study design that can adequately evaluate the effectiveness by minimizing possible biases. 38 Controlled trials without randomisation are at risk of selection bias which can lead to an inaccurate estimation of the effectiveness. Another, methodologically even weaker, study de sign represents the comparison between cohorts that were assessed at different time periods. In addition to selection bias, differences between the two cohorts can arise from changing prevalences of the disease, from changing characteristics of the screene d people, from changing attitudes towards health care and different uses of the screening test. If there are reliable data from randomised controlled trials about the effect iveness of a screening program, economic analyses can be built on . To assess the overall effectiveness of ultras ound screening for the detection of hip dysplasia of the newborns in a systematic review, all studies about the accuracy of the screening test and all studies that compare screened with unscreened newborns should be included. If non-randomised trials are included, the conclusions have to be drawn cautiously because of the as sociated methodological flaws associated with such studies. 42. METHODS The current project provides a systematic review of the ev idence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening of newborns for detecting DDH. It addressed the following questions: 1. What is the diagnostic ac curacy of ultrasound in scre ening of newborns for DDH? 2. What is the impact of ultrasound in screeni ng of newborns for DDH on the therapeutic decisions and on patient outcomes? 3. What is the cost-effectiveness of ultr asound in screening of newborns for DDH? 4. What is the evidence relating to questions 1,2 and 3 for ultrasound screening of newborns with the method of Graf? The review was based on the best ava ilable clinical and economic studies. 2.1 Literature searching 2.1.1 Preliminary literature search An initial search was undertaken to estimate the potential size of the liter ature on this topic. The following databases were searched: y Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effe ctiveness (DARE), as part of the Cochrane Library Issue 1:2002 y Cochrane Library Issue 1:2002 y Medline (1999-2002/01) y Embase (1999-2002/01) y National Guidelines Clearinghouse (searched 24.4.02) y ATTRACT (searched 24.4.02) The preliminary Medline strategy is listed in Appendix 1. 2.1.2 Main literature search The literature search was undertaken to locate studies of the use of ultrasound for the detection of DDH. This level of searching in volved searching a range of medical, economic and grey literature databases. The searches were not limited by study design, but were limited to retrieve literature published from 1975 onwards. The following databases were Science Citation Index (1981-2004/03) (Web of Science) y Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (internet) y System for Information of Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) (1980-2004/03) (Silverplatter) y Health Technology Assessment databas e (HTA) (1975-2004/03) (internal CRD interface) y Database of Abstracts of Reviews of E ffectiveness (DARE) (1975-2004/03) (internal CRD interface) y NHS Economic Evaluation Database (N HS EED) (1975-2004/03) (internal CRD interface) y Health Economic Evaluation Database (HEED) (1975-2004/03) (cd-rom) y Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) (1975-2004) on the Cochrane Library cd- rom Issue 1:2004. y National Research Register (BNI) (1994-2004/03) (Silverplatter) y PASCAL (1973-2004/03) (Dialog) y Index of Conference Proce edings (1973-2004/03) (Dialog) 5y National Technical Information Service (NTIS) (1990-2004/03) (www) y MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (www) y GrayLit (www) y Organising Medical Networked Information (OMNI) (www) y Google (www) y Copernic (www) The strategies are listed in Appendix 2. Wh ere appropriate, website addresses for these resources are listed in Appendix 3. Terminology The terms for the search strategies were identified through discussion between an Information Officer and the research team, by scanning the backgro und literature, and by browsing the Medline Thesaurus (MeSH). German language database searching Attempts were made by the CRD Information Officer to identify potentially useful German language databases. Staff of the Horten Zentrum assessed these resources to see if they would contribute extra papers to the search. Due to the degree of overlap with other sources, no further searches were undertaken. Management of references The titles and abstracts of bibliographic records were downloaded and imported into Endnote bibliographic management software. Dupl icate records resulting from the various database searches were removed. Hand searching Further studies were identified by examining the reference lists of all included articles. In addition some literature was prov ided by BSV and by individuals. 2.2 Study/paper selection Two members of the review team assessed the titles and abstracts independently. Decisions were recorded (order or reject) in the Endnote library. All papers identified by at least one of the reviewers as potentially eligible for inclusion were ordered. Two reviewers independently appraised each full manuscript received and made a decision whether to include or exclude each study accord ing to the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified below. Each reviewer's decisions were recorded in the Endnote Library. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with close attention to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Final decisions on papers were then recorded in the Endnote Library. All studies that did not fulfil all of the criteria were excl uded and their bibliographic details listed, with the reason for exclusion. One group of excl uded studies were subjected to some minimal data extraction. This group of studies were those that were of ultrasound screening for DDH of an unselected populat ion of newborns, but which did not address a specific research question, being mainly a description of the author's clinical experience. Typically these studies had no comparator group and provided no information on the natural course of the disease. 2.2.1 Inclusion criteria Interventions Any ultrasound technique for the screening of DDH in newborns. Participants Unselected newborn infants from the general population. Study design For the evaluation of the diagno stic accuracy of ultrasound in screening for DDH in newborns, all studies that had compared ul trasound, using any method, versus any reference standard, and that allowed the genera tion of 2 x 2 tables, were eligible for inclusion in the review. A reference standard had to be a measure of true disease, i.e. 6clinically relevant DDH, and therefore must have included some assessment of the infant at one month of age or older. Thus studies had to have reported numbers of infants with true disease and numbers without true disease accord ing to the reference standard, plus the numbers with positive and negative ultrasound findings. All comparative studies of newborns that had evaluated the impact of ultrasound in screening for DDH on the therapeutic decisions and on patient outcomes were included in the review. The comparison could be either with another group using a different screening method or the same population prior to the introduction of the ultrasound screening. For the evaluation of the cost-e ffectiveness of ultrasound in sc reening of newborns for DDH, all studies that provided a sy nthesis of cost and effectiveness data of ultrasound screening for DDH in accordance with the criteria specified for the NHS EED database were eligible for inclusion in the review. For the evaluation of the method of Graf in ultrasound screening for DDH, all studies of screening newborns for DDH in which Graf's pr otocol was compared with any other protocol (including modified Graf's) were included. Language Studies published in any language were considered for inclusion in the review. In practice no papers were excluded on the grounds of language. Outcome measure For studies comparing an ultrasound technique with a reference standard technique for the diagnosis of DDH the main out come measure of effectiveness were to be rates of true disease, true non-disease, false disease and false non-disease (accuracy data). For studies that had evaluated the impact of ultrasound scr eening on therapeutic decisions and/or patient outcomes, and for those that had evaluated the method of Graf in the screening of newborns, the outcomes were to include overall treatment rates, rates of operative intervention, rates of abduction splinting, rate of delayed diagnosis, time to treatment, duration of treatment, rate of treat ment complications, fals e diagnostic labelling and any long-term functional outco mes e.g. osteoarthritis. For economic evaluations, the outcomes revi ewed were cost-effectiveness and related assessments. 2.2.2 Exclusion criteria Specifically the following types of studies were excluded. Studies in which the population was a select ed one, for example, one that only included infants with clinical signs of DDH or with risk factors for DDH. Technical reports describing the technique of ultrasound screening, but containing no clinically relevant outcomes. In addition descriptions of clinical experien ce were excluded from the main analysis. Typically such papers would describe a large screening program with no comparator group, where all cases identified as having ultrasou nd DDH were treated, where no information was obtained on the natural course of the disease or the incidence of true, clinically relevant DDH. 2.3 Data extraction strategy Data were extracted onto predesigned forms. Data from studies with multiple publications were extracted and reported as a single study. All relevant data were extracted by one reviewer and independently checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. The following information was extracted for all studies: study details (identifier, aim, study design, duration of follow-up, lo cation, setting), participant details (number of participants, 7age, sex and inclusion criteria), and results including adverse effects. In addition data specific to the different study questions were also extracted. For studies comparing an ultrasound technique with a reference standard for the diagnosis of DDH data were to be extracted on: test deta ils (test evaluated, reference standard, test performance, method of ultrasound examinati on, person who performed the examination, interrater agreement) and results (data required to construct a 2 x 2 table). For studies that had evaluated the impact of ultrasound scr eening on therapeutic decisions and/or patient outcomes data on interventions, the outcomes reported and the results were extracted. For economic evaluation studies, the data were extracted in accordance with the set of guidelines developed for the NHS EED database. These guidelines were developed in collaboration with a group of leading health economists (see http://agatha.york.ac.uk/welcome.htm ). In addition some minimal data extraction was performed on papers that described the author's clinical experience of ultrasound scr eening for DDH in an unselected population of newborns. Typically these studi es did not address a specific research question, had no comparator group and provided no information on the natural course of the disease. The data extracted were: author and reference, stud y design, reason for exclusion, population, number diagnosed at screening, number treated , number normal at final follow-up and details of adverse effects. 2.4 Quality assessment strategy Studies of diagnostic accuracy were qualit y assessed using the QUADAS Checklist (see Appendix 4). It was anticipated that studies evaluating the im pact of ultrasound screening on therapeutic decisions and/or patient outcomes would vary in study design. Consequently, a new checklist, addressing very general issues of study quality was created by adapting the checklist for cohort studie s given in CRD Report 4.42 The questions included in the checklist were: Is there a reproducible description of the screening process? Were the groups comparable on all confounding factors? If the groups were not comparable, was ad equate adjustment for the effects of the confounding factors made? Was follow-up long enough for the reported outcomes to occur? Is it reported what proportion of the unselected newborn population was screened? Is it reported what proportion of the screened population was followed-up? Quality assessment was carried out by one revi ewer and checked by a second. The results of the quality assessment were used for descri ptive purposes to provide an evaluation of the overall quality of the included studies. The quality of economic evaluations has been evaluated in accordance with the set of guidelines developed for the NHS EED database (http://agatha.york.ac.uk/welcome.htm ). 2.5 Methods of analysis/synthesis 2.5.1 Diagnostic accuracy studies For studies comparing an ultrasound technique with a reference standard technique for the diagnosis of DDH the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (of both positive and negative tests results), positive and negative predicti ve values (PPV and NPV) and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated. A formal plan for meta-analysis was included in the protocol but was not implemented due to a lack of suitable studies. 82.5.2 Evaluation of impact studies Studies that evaluated the impac t of ultrasound screening on therapeutic decisions and/or patient outcomes have been combined in a narra tive synthesis, as have those evaluating the method of Graf. Similarly, economic ev aluations have also been combined using a narrative synthesis. Within each category of study the heterogeneity of the studies was addressed in terms of the screened population (country, year, time fr om birth, how complete a sample of the selected population was included in the study); the screening procedure (actual technique used, type of equipment, experience of person nel, interrater agreement); and outcomes. 93. RESULTS The search strategy generated 787 references . A total of 195 papers were of potential interest and of these 188 were obtained and appraised for inclusion in the review. Of the unobtainable references, three were unpublished or even unfinished projects for which no information could be obtained.43-45 A list of excluded studies is given in Appendix 8, together with the reason for exclusions. The main reason for excluding studies was that they had not been conducted in a general population of newborn infants. A total of 63 references describing 62 studies were included in the review. These comprised 11 papers: one study of diagnosti c accuracy; 10 studies on the impact of ultrasound in screening for newborns for DDH; four economic evaluations; and 47 descriptions of clinical experience. 3.1 Evaluation of the diagnostic accu racy of ultrasound in screening of newborns for DDH One study of diagnostic accuracy was found.46 Details of this study are presented in Appendix 5. Briefly, this was a prospective coho rt study conducted in the Netherlands. The population consisted of all children born in t he catchment area of two Child Health Care (CHC) centres in Eastern Netherlands between 1 September 1998 and 30 November 1999. The ultrasound screening programme involved ultrasound imaging at the age of one, two and three months, with a reference test performed at eight months. The ultrasound examination was performed using Graf's meth od and hip findings were recorded according to Graf's classifications. At the one-month examination, decentred hips (type D) only were referred. At the month-two or -three examinat ions immature (severe type IIa or worse) and abnormal hips (type IIb or worse) were also referred. Referred children were examined under a standardised assessment pr otocol (identification of risk factors and repeated physical examination (abduction test and Galeaz zi test). Only children with sustained physical abnormality were referred for further diagnostic work-up and, where necessary, treatment. The reference standard was defined by either the decision to treat or by an abnormal ultrasound finding at the age of eight months. 3.1.1 Quality assessment The results of the quality assessment of t he diagnostic accuracy study are given in Appendix 4. This study was flawed due to the c hoice of reference standard. In addition to those children who had an abnormal result at the reference test at eight months, infants were diagnosed with DDH if they were deem ed to require treatment at any stage in the screening process. Although the diagnosis and hence decision to treat, was based on both ultrasound and physical examinatio ns, the researchers failed to ta ke into account that early DDH can resolve without treatment. Thus, an unknown number of children treated during the screening program may in fact have been instances of overtreatment. 3.1.2 Findings from the diagnostic accuracy study The data from the diagnostic accuracy study we re used to generate the following 2x2 table. DDH+ DDH- Total Screen+ 239 149 388 Screen - 31 4751 4782 Total 270 4900 5170 The sensitivity of ultrasound was 88.5%; the sp ecificity was 96.7%. The positive likelihood ratio was 29.1; the negative likelihood ratio was 0.12. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 61.6%; the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.4%. The diagnostic odds ratio was 245.8. These values indicate that when used in an unselected population of newborn infants, ultrasound imaging performed initially at age one month is a sensitive diagnostic test. 10However, the relatively low value for PPV indi cates that a significant proportion of those identified as having DDH by ultrasound imaging would in fact develop normally. It must be remembered, however, that these results were generated using a flawed reference test that may well have accepted cases of overtreatment as 'true' cases of DDH. The higher the rate of overtreatment is, the hi gher the sensitivity. Unfortunately, although the authors readily acknowledge this, they have not given the number of infants treated at the different stages of the screening programme and so we are unable to estimate more accurately the number of possi ble overtreatment cases. This study also compared diagnostic test accuracy between ultrasound screening and clinical screening. The control population was an historical one of 2066 consecutive infants attending CHC clinics in Eastern Netherlands. Screening for DDH comprised a standardised assessment protocol (identific ation of risk factors and repeated physical examination (abduction test and Galeazzi test), with a reference ultrasound examination at the age of six months. The data for the c ontrol population was used to generate the following 2x2 table. DDH+ DDH- Totals Clinically+ 62 335 397 Clinically - 10 1659 1669 Totals 72 1994 2066 The sensitivity of clinical screening was 86. 1%; the specificity was 83.2%. The positive likelihood ratio was 5.13; t he negative likelihood ratio was 0.17. The PPV was 15.6% and the NPV was 99.4%. The diagnostic odds ratio was 30.7. When compared with the values for the ultr asound screening, th e sensitivity and PPV for clinical screening are much lower. 3.2 Evaluation of the impact of ul trasound in screening of newborns for DDH on the therapeutic decisions and on patient outcomes A total of 10 studies that evaluated the impact of ultrasound in screening newborn infants for DDH on the therapeutic decisions an d on patient outcomes were identified.34, 46-54 Details of these studies are summarised in Appendix 5 (data extraction tables). Of the studies eligible for inclusion in this section of the review, two were conducted in Austria,49, 50 three in Norway,34, 47, 53 one in Jordan,48one in Poland,51 one in the UK,52 one in the Netherlands46 and one in Croatia.54 Two of the studies were RCTs34, 53 whilst the others were either retrospective or pr ospective non-randomised studies. 3.2.1 Quality assessment The overall quality of the included studies was po or (Table 2). Of the ten studies included in this section only two were RCTs34, 53 and unfortunately, these studi es were of limited quality. One34 was found to have an allocation to treatment that was not truly random and there was no concealment of allocation or blinding of out come assessors to treatment. Thus, baseline comparability was compromised a nd the risk of bias and conf ounding was not minimised. In the other RCT53 there was no report of blinding of assessors to screening group. Not surprisingly the RCTs34, 53 are rated the best quality on this scale, followed by the Roovers study.46 The Eggl,50 Grill49 and Krolo54 studies scored very poorly. It should be noted that the quality of the Grill study49 appears to be particularly limited, with few details reported and the data sets being compared apparently having been derived from separate possibly unrelated data bases, the validity of comparing wh ich is doubtful. Furthermore, it should be noted that whilst both the Eggl study50 and the Grill study49 claim to be reporting the experience in the whole of Aust ria, they report different dates for the introduction of ultrasound screening. 11Table 2 Quality of the included studies Study Study design Sufficient description of groups and distribution of prognostic factors? Is there an adequate description of the screening process? Were the groups comparable on all confounding factors? If the groups were not comparable was adequate adjustment for the effects of the confounding factors made? Was follow-up long enough for the reported outcomes to occur? Is it reported what proportion of unselected newborn population was screened? Is it reported what proportion of the screened population was followed-up?

Because the Roovers study46 used an historical control group, it is difficult to know how comparab le the populations in that study were. Their analysis did incorporate indirect standardisation on the number of first-born children and the number of affected relatives to adjust for imbalances between the groups in these important risk factors. It was difficult, if not impossible, to appraise t he comparability of the groups in the other studies. All studie s reported the institutions an d the time periods where the patients were included, but the databases us ed in three retrospective studies were not described.47,49,50 The proportion of female and male infants was stated in only two studies34,48 and differences between the results of the clinical examination and between the number of breech births ar e reported only in the RCTs.34,53 Seven studies provided a reproducible des cription of the screening process.34,46-48,52-54 Details of the ultrasound techniques and the equipment are given in five studies34,46,48,52,54 and the level of experience of those performing the ultrasound imaging is described in three studies.34, 46, 52 The length of follow up in the included studies was reported in six studies. 34,46-48,53,54 and was considered to be long enough in four of these. However it should be noted that although not reported as such, follow-up in t he two retrospective Austrian and in the Polish and UK studies did appear to be adequate. The proportion of the unselected newborn sc reened was reported in four studies and ranged from 82.6% to 100%.34,46,48,53 The proportion of the sc reened population followed up was reported in six studies34,46-48,51,53 and a good level of detail was reported for the RCTs.34,53 3.2.2 Clinical diversity of the included studies Details of the included studies are presented in Table 3. The populations included in the studies came from seven countries (Austria , the Netherlands, Jordan, Norway, Poland, Croatia and the UK) all from various periods between 1968 and 2001. As dictated by the inclusion criteria for this review, all study populations are unselected newborns. Since the characteristics (except for gender) of the in cluded newborns are not described, other differences between the populations cannot be as sessed. In all studies the ultrasound examinations were performed with Graf`s basic technique although in three studies a modified technique after Terjesen 55, 56 was used and in another study52 a modified technique after Harcke11 was used. The level of experience of the examiners cannot be compared between the studies because it is described in only two studies.34, 52 The outcomes reported vary across the studies. Those for which data are reported in at least one study are: late-diagnosed DDH, in cidence of DDH, the rate of therapeutic interventions (although the type of intervention for which the rates were reported varied between studies), duration of treatment, sensit ivity, referral rate and surgery related outcomes. None of the inclu ded studies reported rate of treatment complications or any long-term functional outcomes such as osteoarthritis. This clinical diversity limited the extent to which these data could be pooled. Consequently, the findings of the studies are summarised in a narrative, firstly by individual study and then by outcome. 3.2.3 Findings from included studies The findings of the included studies ar e summarised by study in Table 4. 13Table 3 Characteristics of included studies of ultrasound screening in unselected newborns (1 of 2) Study Participants Screening Treatment Possible biases Holen 200253 Norway RCT 16629 newborns at a single centre born between 1988 and 1992 Group US (n= 7840): General clinical plus ultrasound screening (ultrasound technique after Terjesen, third day after birth) Group CS+ (n=7689): General clinical screening, with selective use of ultrasound *.

No effect on treatment rate was seen in the Polish study51 but those results may not be reliable. Krolo et al,54 did not report treatment rates but found a significant incr ease in the incidence of DDH under an ultrasound screening programme compared to an earlier clinical screening programme (difference 15.8/1000 (95% CI: 8.1, 24.9). In the Roovers study46 the referral rate with ultrasound screening initiated at one month of age was 6.9% compared with a rate of 19.2% with clinical screening and the treatment rates were 5.2% and 3.5% respectively (difference 17.2/1000 (95% CI: 6.7, 26.7). Using the authors' value for clinical screening adjusted for confounding factors of 3.8% the difference was still statistically significant (13.8 (95% CI: 3.0, 23.6). The difference between the treatm ent rates can be taken as a measure of the rate of over treatment associat ed with ultrasound screening. Th e figure of 16 infants treated unnecessarily per 1000 screened identified in the RCT is supported by the results of the two observational studies. In contrast Grill et al 49 reported a fall in treatment rates associated with ultrasound screening, however as discussed in the qualit y assessment section these results may not be reliable. In the one study that compared newborn general screening with later screening48 the rates were lower in the later screened group, with a tr eatment difference of -33.6 (95% CI: -45.5, -21.3). The two RCTs that had investigated tr eatment rates with general versus selective screening reported different re sults; one found a statistically significant higher rate of treatment with general screening34 but the other did not.53 DDH diagnosed late The findings of the one RCT34 that made the comparison indicated that the rate of diagnosis after one month of age rather than earlier is lower with general ultrasound screening than with general clinical screening (difference -1.2 /1000 (95% CI -3.4, 1.0). This finding is supported by the large retrospective study47 in which the treatment difference reached statistical significance (difference -1.9 (95% CI -2.9, -0.5). Two RCTs investigated the difference between universal ultrasound screening and selective ultrasound screening on the rate of late-diagnosed DDH. Both studies reported higher rates with selective screening but in neither study was the difference co mpared with general screening statistically significant (differences -0.5/1000 (95% CI -1 .4, 0.2) and -0.7/1000 (95% CI -2.7, 1.4) respectively). While the evidence indicate s that newborn screening with ultrasound can reduce the number of cases of DDH diagnosed after one month of age, the clinical validity of this effect appears to be debatable. DDH identified at one month may not be true disease and even with selective screening most ca ses were identified by six months and all by 11 months. In the Roovers' study in which screening did not start until one month of age, 46 the definition of late detected DDH was different: late diag nosis was after eight months of age. The number of cases of DDH missed by the two scre ening programmes (those identified only at the eight month reference test) was 17 (0.8%, 95% CI: 0.6 -1.3) with clinical screening compared to 31 (0.6%, 95% CI: 0.4 - 0.9) wi th ultrasound screening (difference -2.2/1000 (95% CI -7.5, 1.7). Surgery related outcomes The Roovers study reported a lo wer rate of in-hospital treatment with ultrasound screening (1/1000 compared with 3/1000 with clinical screening), but the difference was not statistically significant (-1.9 /1000 (95% CI -5.4, 0.1) and they do not specify the exact nature of the hospital treatment as surgery.46 The number of patients requiring open or clos ed reduction treatment (which represents the most severely affected or cases resistant to conservative treatment) was compared in only one study.50 The rate of reduction treatment unde r a well-established ultrasound screening 17program was 0.8 per 1000 compared with 2.1 per 1000 under clinical screening, with a significant difference of -1.3/1000 (95% CI -1.9, -0.7). Interestingly, no cases requiring this treatment were reported in the albeit much sm aller study of newborn versus 3-4 month old ultrasound screening.48 The mean number of patients treated surgically per annum, the number of theatre sessions per case and the percentage of procedures requiring hospital admission were all reported in the UK study.52 All these parameters were lower in the ultrasound screening period than in the clinical screening period, although the results are difficult to interpret with confidence since t he size of the earlier population is not reported and no statistical analysis wa s conducted. However, the results do suggest a fall in the frequency of the most serious and invasive treatment modalities. The Polish study51 compared rates of different modalities and found an apparent increase in broad-diapering and decrease in splinting and ov erhead extensions that had a temporal association with the introduction of ultrasound screening. It is however, possible that this change in treatment practice was not attributable to ultrasound screening. Only the UK study52 reported findings for time to operati on. The mean age at the time of first operation was 12.4 months, with clinical scr eening compared to 6.7 months with general ultrasound screening. The data suggest that the need for an operative intervention is recognised earlier with ultrasound, rather t han clinical screening. However, that these percentages are based on only a very small numb er of cases, with only an average of 6.5 operations per year under clinical screening and 2.5 operations per year under general ultrasound screening. Duration of treatment Two studies reported effects on treatment duration. The Polish study 51 reported that there was no change in mean treatment duration over th ree years of clinical examination, but a fall from 11.6 (SD 6.5) months in 1985-86 to 7.8 (SD 3.7) months in 1986-87 after the introduction of ultrasound in May 1986, alt hough the difference was not statistically significant -3.8 (95% CI -4.59, 3.01). T he one study that compared newborn ultrasound screening with later (3 to 4 months) ultrasound screening48 found that ultrasound screening at birth was associated with a shorter mean treatment duration than was later screening (mean of 1.16 months compared to 2.9 months (range 6 weeks to 4 months). Both studies indicate that ultrasound screening at birth may be associated with a shorter duration of treatment than either later ultras ound screening or clinical screening. Unfortunately, both studies are of very poor quality and therefore such conclusions can only be tentative. Adverse effects of screening Only two of the ten studies reported on adver se effects. One RCT of around 15000 infants screened reported one case of avascular necrosis. 53 No information on the incidence of other adverse events was given. Similarly the smaller non-randomised study by Malkawi,48 reported only that there were no cases of avas cular necrosis. Whilst su ch reports indicate that avascular necrosis occurs only very ra rely under any screening programme for DDH, there is a lack of real data. 18Overall conclusions to be drawn from these studies General screening using ultrasound appears to be a more sensitive test than clinical screening but this needs to be confirmed in better quality studies. General screening of newborns at birth or at one month of age for DDH using ultrasound appears to increase overall tr eatment rates when compared to clinical screening. This may represent an over treat ment rate of approximately 16 infants per 1000 screened. Screening initiated later may result in a lower treatment rate. General screening of newborns at birth for DDH using ultrasound reduces the number of cases of DDH diagnosed after one month of ag e. The clinical significance of this is unclear. In the one study where it was tested the number of cases diagnosed after eight months was not higher in a clinical screening programme. The rates of cases of DDH diagnosed afte r one month of age with selective ultrasound screening are higher, but not statistically significantly hi gher, than those reported with general ultrasound screening. General screening of newborns at birth for DDH using ultrasound produces fewer cases requiring treatment with open or closed reduction or in-hospital treatment than earlier screening programs using clinical examination. General screening of newborns at birth for DDH using ultrasound may be associated with a shorter treatment duration and the need for an operative intervention may be recognised earlier than with clinical screening. There are no real data relating to the possible adverse consequences associated with general ultrasound screening of newborns for DDH or any associated treatments. 3.3 Evaluation of the impact of ul trasound in screening of newborns for DDH - clinical experience A total of 47 papers that described clinical ex perience of the use of ultrasound in screening of newborns for DDH were identified. These papers could not be included in the main analysis. Although they included the population of interest, that is a general unselected population of newborn infants, they failed to provide information on the utility of ultrasound in the screening of newborns. This was pr imarily because of a lack of any type of comparator with which the results of the screening program could be compared. They therefore failed meet the inclusion criteria fo r the review. Furthermore all contained one or more of the following flaws: A lack of a clear research question. Confusing and apparently selective reporti ng of the data, with little consistency regarding outcomes across studies Reporting of treatment inconsistent and unclear (for example, in some papers it appears that 'broad-diapering' is not considered a treatment whereas in others it is Often the description follows only those in whom some abnormality was identified at first screening. Treatment algorithms varied widely. Some studies treatment initiated immediately, others it is delayed. In all any sense of t he natural course of the disease is lost. The main findings from these studies are summarised below. The proportion of immature hips identified by ultrasound screening is usually high (mean around 25 - 30%, with huge range reported 0.5% to 88.9%), whilst the proportion of 'abnormal' hips is much lower, with a range of 0.18% to 13.4% (mean around 4%). Treatment rates quoted vary widely with rates fr om 0.25% to 9.5% of the whole screened population being reported. It is not always cl ear what is included as treatment. Higher treatment rates usually appear to include tec hniques such as broad-diapering, whilst lower rates refer mainly to more invasive interventions. There is only one report of operations being used as a treatment option: this was in a UK centre, although there is some discrepancy between the two reports of the same data. 52, 57 Two important measure of the success or failu re of a screening program for DDH are the proportion of normal hips at the end of follo w-up and the number of late cases identified. These outcomes were not well reported in the desc riptions of clinical experience. Of the 47 19papers, only 15 reported the 'success rates' by the end of their 'follow-up' Almost all of these 15 reported that 100% were normal though the follow-up periods varied from three months to one year. Four papers repor ted a less than 100% success rate.57-60 The papers by Falliner 199958 reported that all patients were norm al after treatment at age three weeks but this was followed by some deterioration. This is perhaps not surprising given the extreme brevity of the follow-up period r eported in that paper. Marks et al. 199457 reported that following screening and treatment with Pavlik harness three individuals had not responded and required more aggressive form s of treatment. Similarly Riboni et al.59 reported one unresolved case at one year: this was the single late diagnosed case. Finally Tegander et al. 60 reported that in their series, in whic h no patient was treated before the age of 4 or 5 months, irrespective of earlier findings, no abnormal radiograph was seen at age 6 or 7 years. However, 12/93 individuals did have a less than normal range of movement. Generally these papers did not report how many late cases were identified. Four papers stated there had been none,61-63 One paper reported that 1.6% of all hips (including the hips from the group with infants referred for a diagnostic ultrasound examination) changed from IIa 64 Another very important outcome is the incidence and severity of any adverse effects of screening or treatment. This was hardly reported at all: only four papers actually mentioned complications, one 65 reported there were no complications and the other three stated they had had no cases of avascular necrosis.64, 66, 67 Summary of findings from descriptions of clinical experience 1. Ultrasound screening at birth identifies a high number of immature (Graf Type IIa) hips: around 25-30% 2. The number of abnormal hips (Graf Type IIc or worse) is much smaller, around 4% 3. Treatment rates vary greatly depending upon the algorithm adopted 4. Treatment does not appear to be harmful 5. There is little evidence that lack of treatment is harmful 3.4 Cost-effectiveness of ultrasound in screening of newborns for DDH A total of four economic evaluations were identified for inclusion in the review.52, 68-70 The structured abstracts of each economic evaluation prepa red in accordance with the guidelines developed for the NHS EED database are presented in Appendix 7. The evaluations are based on screening programmes in the UK,52, the Netherlands70 and Norway.68, 69 UK-based economic evaluation The UK study 52 was based on a series of screening programmes that included all children born in Coventry between 1976 and 1996. Three time periods were compared: 1976 and 1986, when a routine programme of clinical screening for DDH was followed (Group A); 1986 and May 1989, when ultrasound plus clinical examination for all infants with risk factors for or clinical signs of DDH (Group B); June 1989 and 1996, when routine ultrasound screening in addition to the statutory clinical examination was used (Group C). Overall there were 65 patients with DDH in Group A, 19 patients in Group B and 19 patients in Group C. The mean number of patients tr eated surgically per year declined from 6.5 (Group A) to 5.4 (Group B) and 2.5 (Group C). The number of theatre sessions per case fell from 2.8 (Group A) to 2.1 (Group B) and then 1.8 (Group C). The percentage of procedures requiring hospital admission was 47 % in Group A, 61% in Group B and 9% in Group C, with only two major procedures perf ormed in the 7.5 years from June 1989 to December 1996. The main costs considered in this evaluation were direct hospital costs, namely: cost of hospital admission (including fixed costs), surg ical implant (Coventry screw and plate), radiological services and contrast material, blood, cost of non-operative treatment using Pavlick harness. The cost of ultrasonogra phers and equipment for one screening session in the outpatient clinic was also considered. Procedures were assessed in terms of units of 20operating theatre time, consumables such as im plants and blood. Quantities and costs were analysed separately. Costs were not discounted as they were incurred in a short period of time. The final overall cost for Group A was \u00a322,188 per year, for Group B it was \u00a321,837 and for Group C, \u00a326,564. The average annual cost of treatment in Group A was \u00a35,110, for Group B it was \u00a33,811, and for Group C, \u00a3468 per 1000 live births. The authors did not provide a summary meas ure of benefit. As such, the study may be regarded as a cost consequences analysis and the health benefits equate to the health outcomes reported above. Conseque ntly a synthesis of costs and benefits is not applicable due to the cost-consequences approach adopted. The authors concluded that when the cost of running the screening programme is added to the expense of treating DDH, the overall cost for the management of DDH is comparable for the different screening policies. Norway-based economic evaluations Both economic evaluations from Norway 68,69 were prepared by the same research group and drew upon clinical effectiveness data from related sources. Rosendahl study The aim of one study 69 was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening using general or selective screening strategies with ultrasound versus routine clinical screening strategy in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. Routine clinical screening alone was regarded as the comparator. Effectiveness data were taken from Rosendahl 1994. 34 In a comparison with infants undergoing clinical screening alone, the addition of an ultrasound examination for all infants resulted in a treatment rate of 3.4% compar ed to 1.8% of early DDH cases. Using ultrasound imaging on high-risk newborns only pro duced a treatment rate of 2%. The rate of late-diagnosed DDH (late defined as after one month of age) for general ultrasound screening, selective ultrasound screening and for clinical screening alone were 0.3, 0.7 and 1.3 per 1000 respectively. The effectiveness measure used in the economic analysis was late-diagnosed DDH. The (expected) total costs of screening, follo w-up, and treatment for general screening with ultrasound were $27.90, for no screening were $29.20, and for selective screening were $29.60 per child. The average cost of a hypothetical programme involving general screening of all girls and sele ctive screening of 12% of boys with a special risk factor for DDH was $20.70 per infant. The discounting rate for the ultrasound equipment was 5%. Threshold analysis found that the general sc reening programme had a net economic benefit if average per diem costs for late treatment exceeded $343.50, or the annual number of deliveries exceeded 3500, or the incidence of late cases exceeded 3.6 per 1000 infants. The author's concluded that application of cost s from other centres to this study's data regarding frequency of clinical outcomes may yi eld different comparative programme costs. If the findings of this clinical study can be generalised to other centres, a strategy of screening all girls and boys with risk factors for DDH may be the most cost-effective approach. Geitung study The second evaluation from Norway 68 aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening compared to that of conventional clinical screening methods (Ortolani's or Barlow's test). The study was conducted in a hospital setting in Bergen, Norway. The effectiveness data relate to previous studies conducted between 1989 and 1992, including the same study used in Rosendahl's economic evaluation above) and were derived from a combination of a 21review of previous literature, the findings of a single study and authors' assumptions. Cost data for the late-treated group relate to 1984-85, and the cost data for ultrasound screening were derived from a study conducted in 1989 and 1990. The price year was 1993. As in the previous economic evaluation, t he effectiveness outcome was number of late- diagnosed DDH (after one month of age). The effectiveness analysis indicated that by introducing an ultrasound screening programme an estimated 2.6 cases of late-discovered DDH per annum would be avoided. The tota l cost of ultrasound screening was NOK 1,375,438 (315,562 - 1,690,000), t he cost avoided for 2.6 fewer cases of late-discovered DDH). The net cost of dete cting 2.6 cases of late-detected DDH would be NOK 275 per new-born baby. The authors concluded that although ultrasound screening would result in fewer cases of late-detected DDH a general screening programm e applied to the total population of new- born infants was not cost-effect ive. However, screening for those identified as being at greater risk (traumatic birth and family histor y of DDH) may bring additional benefits and be cost-effective. Moreover, if the screening programme adopted only ultrasound testing and the clinical examinations were eliminated the programme would become cost-effective. Netherlands-based economic evaluation The Netherlands study 70 was based on the clinical study by Roovers et al. discussed earlier in this report46 and a related Decision Model Analysis.71 This cost-effectiveness study compared thre e screening strategies for DDH: general ultrasound screening at the age of 3 months; select ive ultrasound screening at the age of 3 months, when only infants with recognised risk fact ors (breech position or a family history of DDH in first- or second-degree relatives) or abnormal results on physical examination of the hip were screened; and clinical screening as undertaken under the current screening policy for DDH in the Netherlands (repeated physical ex amination of the infant hip and risk factors in the first months of life, performed as pa rt of the CHC programme). Ultrasound screening at three months was selected rather than at one month because of the risk of overtreatment associated with early screening. The authors hypothesised that, although initially more costly, the implementation of general ultrasound screening could lead to substantial cost- savings due to the significantly lower referral ra te than the actual sc reening strategy. The study was conducted from a societal perspective. The health outcomes assessed from the primary studies were the incidence of DDH in the Netherlands and the probability values for: true cases of DDH (3.1% for general ultraso und screening, 2.4 for selective ultrasound screening and 2.8% for CHC screening); missed cases of DDH (0.006 for general ul trasound screening, 0.013 for selective ultrasound screening and 0.009 for CHC screening); infants treated by the CHC physician (0.33 for general ultrasound screening, 1 for selective ultrasound screeni ng and 1 for CHC screening); infants screened by ultrasound (1 for general ultrasound screening and 0.192 for selective ultrasound screening (NA for CHC screening)); referral for specialist consultation (0.045 for general ultrasound screening, 0.030 for selective ultrasound screening and 0.192 for CHC screening); and early treatment given a positive screening re sult (0.711 for general ultrasound screening, 0.8 for selective ultrasound scr eening and 0.146 for CHC screening). The total cost per child screened was Euro 52.1 with selective ultrasound screening, Euro 82 with CHC screening and Euro 70.6 with general ultrasound screening 22Average and incremental cost-effectiveness rati os were calculated to combine the costs and benefits of the screening strategies. The average cost per screen detected case of DDH was Euro 2,171 with selective ultrasound screening, Euro 2,929 with CHC screening and Euro 2,278 with general ultrasound screening. CHC screening was dominated by general ultrasound screening, which in turn offere d a cost of Euro 2,646 per additional case of DDH detected. The sensitivity analysis showed that the ranking of the alternative scre ening strategy did not change when key inputs were varied; the CHC strategy was always dominated by the general ultrasound strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of general versus selective ultrasound screening ranged from Euro 2,388 to Euro 4,526. Only when patient costs were excluded (and a health care system perspective was adopted), was the general ultrasound screening strategy the overall domin ant cost-effective option, with an average cost-effectiveness ratio of Euro 1,804 per infant detected The authors did not make extensive comparison s of their findings with those from other studies and the findings of the study may not be widely generalisable given the uniqueness of the CHC programme in the Netherlands. The rate of participation represented a critical variable, with the authors expecting near complete participation if ultrasound screening were included in the actual CH C programme, however this might be difficult to achieve with screening at three months of age in a different setting. The authors concluded that general ultras ound screening represented a cost-effective strategy for the detection of devel opmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in the Netherlands. It dominated all other alternative screening options if it were assumed that the patients were willing to pay for the additional time require d to attend outpatient visits and screening procedures. Overall summary of economic evaluations The available economic evaluations are lim ited by the quality of the clinical data available. The UK study indicates that because tr eatment costs are so much lower under a programme of general ultrasound screening of newborns, the overall cost of such a programme is comparable with a clinical screening programme. The Norwegian studies were flawed by thei r use of an effectiven ess measure that has doubtful clinical validity: diagnosis of DDH after one month of age. The Netherlands study demonstrated the co st-effectiveness of general screening at three months of age but only if it were assumed that participation would be near complete and that the patients would be willing to pay for the additional time required to attend outpatient visits and scr eening procedures. It is unclear how generalisable these findings would be outside the CHC programme in the Netherlands. 3.5 Evaluation of the method of Graf in screening of newborns for DDH Only one comparative study of Graf's methodology conducted in the context of general newborn screening for DDH was identified.48 This study has been described earlier in section 4.2 and further details are given in Appendix 5. This was not a randomised study and it is unclear whether it was prospective or retrospective. Thus, any findings have to be interpreted with caution. The study report failed to include an adequate description of the study groups and the distribution of prognostic factors, making it difficult to appr aise the comparability of the groups. The only demographic detail given was the proportion of female and male patients. The description of the screening processes was adequate, with de tails of the ultrasound techniques and the equipment. The follow-up period was reported but it was unclear whether it was long enough. The proportion of the screened population followed up was reported. In this study the infants screened at birth were assigned to either simple sonography (as per Graf) (1823 newborns) or stress sonography (sonography as per Graf, but performed at the same time as a clinical manoeuvre) (1511 newborns). The number of abnormal hips requiring treatment for DDH was 85 (4.7%) in the simple sonography group compared to 88 239 (5.8%) in the stress sonography group. A ll treatment was given by means of the Pavlik harness and was successful as determined at follow-up at one year. The findings of this non-randomised study do not indicate any meaningful difference between the utility of the two imaging techniques studied. 244. DISCUSSION 4.1 Limitations of the systematic review We have attempted to produce a comprehensive and unbiased synthesis of all the available diagnostic and controlled studies of screening programmes of an unselected population of newborns using ultrasound imaging. The review is subject to two main limitations: it was based on published reports of studi es only and the authors of this review are not experts in ultrasound imaging or hip dysplasia. 4.2 The evaluation of ultrasound in general screening of newborns for DDH The importance of conducting good quality studi es to evaluate the effectiveness of any screening test or program was outlined in the background to this review (section 2.2). As described there, whilst DDH is the early stage of a disease that fits some of the criteria for a disease for which screening is appropriate, questions over the benefits of ultrasound screening of newborns are still unresolved. These questions are at the heart of the continuing debate over the introduction of gen eral newborn screening. The main issue is whether infants identified with DDH by ultrasound in the first days of life will develop clinical disease that will result in some degree of disability if they are left untreated. The natural course of DDH is still largel y unknown and different definit ions for when treatment is considered necessary persist and have been tested in very few studies. Even if the disease and the available treatm ent are appropriate for a screening program there is no scientific basis for a screening prog ram if the accuracy of the screening test is not known. Accuracy studies done in symptoma tic patients are studies of diagnostic tests and those results cannot be used to estimate the accuracy of screening tests. The accuracy of the screening prog ramme could not be determined from the vast majority of the available studies because of their selected populations and selective follow-up; a huge number of studies were excluded from this review because they weren't of the general screening population. Where a general populat ion had been studied it was usual for only those infants with some abnormality to be fo llowed-up, with later follow-up only of those treated. Almost no information on the natural course of the disease was available, and it was unclear how many cases of DDH may have been missed by ultrasound. Thus, for all but one study, the number of true and false po sitives and true and false negatives could not be calculated, making it impossible to genera te any 2x2 tables and to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound as a screening test. The one diagnostic accuracy study performed in an unsel ected population of newborns provided only limited information due to its use of a flawed reference standard that may not adequately express true disease because children were treated early. By testing infants at one, two, three and eight months the study did demonstrate that a screening test performed only at one month or earlier is likely to miss some cases of DDH. The study by Malkawi 48 hinted that an initial screen at 4 months might prevent this happening, but unfortunately the quality of that study was limited and the results may not be reliable. Studies that investigated the impact of ultr asound screening were also flawed. The primary failure in the vast majority of the studies reported to date was the lack of any real comparator. Even the few comp arative studies identified for this review relied almost exclusively on historical controls, renderin g the findings unreliable. The one properly randomised study53 utilised selective ultras ound screening as the c ontrol with which general ultrasound screening of newborns was compar ed, and therefore, provided only limited information on the benefits or otherwise of general screening. Data from RCTs indicated that ultrasound screeni ng is associated with an increased rate of treatment compared with clinical screening. However, these RCTs investigated screening conducted in the first few days of life. Data from the most recent observational study by Roovers indicate that ultrasound screening commenced at one month of age is also associated with an increased rate of treatment, but achieved with a greatly reduced referral 25rate. Interestingly all studies, RCT or observ ational, using screening at birth or one month, found similar values for overtreatment of around 16 per 1000 infants screened. The objective of screening for DDH is to prevent it being diagnosed late when treatment is more invasive and can be less successful. The two best designed and reported studies (i.e. the RCTs 34,53) did report this as an outcome measure, but, unfortunately both had short follow-up periods and defined a late-detected case as one detected after one month of age. As a basis for assessing the relative benef its of screening programmes this endpoint presumes that it is essential to detect and treat as many cases of DDH as possible within the first month of life. However, the clinical validity of this outcome appears to be debatable since DDH identified at one mont h is often not true disease.60 When 'late' was defined as at, or after eight months,46 there was no difference between the proportion of cases that were detected late with clinical screening compared with ultrasound screening. There are few data on the impact of ultr asound screening programmes on the types of treatment, the duration and success of treatments for DDH. The use of historical controls in many studies means that the e ffects of ultrasound cannot be diffe rentiated from the effect of changing treatment practice. Also in most of the studies of screening programmes, treatment outcome was not a reported outcome . There is some evidence that early screening for DDH can reduce the requirement for invasive surgery: the Eggl study 50 reported a lower incidence of open or closed reduct ions of the hip joint associated with the introduction of ultrasound screening, but we do not know if this was achieved without an increase in the number of infants treated unne cessarily. The best data on surgery related outcomes came from a UK based study, suggest ing that number and severity of surgical procedures for the correction of hip dysplasia was reduced under a regime of general ultrasound screening. However, these findings are also difficult to interpret with confidence since the size of the earlier population was not reported and no statistical analysis was conducted. The Roovers study is most prom ising having reported a lower proportion of hospital treated cases within an overall increase in treatment rate. 46 It must be noted however, that the effect seen in all three studi es for these very important outcome measure could have been due to a changing fashion in DDH treatment as well as the impact of ultrasound screening. Our review has also been unable to provide in formation on the adverse effects of general ultrasound screening: either of the treatment or of the screening programme as a whole. Of the 10 studies we identified, none properly assessed adverse events and only two mentioned them at all. Our review did not encompass the effectivene ss of the various treatments available for DDH. However, it is acknowledged that the evidence ba se is not strong. 72 Generally abduction therapy (most commonly abduction splinting in the form of the Pavlik harness) is considered to be an effective and benign intervent ion. However, a systematic review of English language studies reported that observati onal studies reported that 20 to 100% of infants who had undergone abducti on therapy eventually required operative intervention.8 Recently published surveillance data collected over 5 years in Germany73 showed that although the incidence of first operative proc edures for DDH was low at 0.26 per 1000 live births, 55% of children undergoing a first ope rative procedure had been detected by the early ultrasound screening program: these chil dren therefore represent a degree of failure of the available conservative treatment.73 This experience is reflected in that reported in a UK study72 that found that all children with abnorma l hip radiographs at age two years had started treatment before the age of 8 weeks and overall 12% of all children treated with abduction splinting before the age of 8 weeks subsequently required surgery.72 These data would suggest some publication bias in observational studies of ultrasound screening in which the reported success rates of treatment are much higher.74 Furthermore, the potential adverse effects of treatment must be consider ed. Avascular necrosis has been reported in 1 to 4% of all treated infants.8 Pressure sores, epiphysitis, femoral nerve palsy, inferior dislocation of the hip and medial instability of the knee joint have also been reported8 and potential psychological problems must be considered.7, 9 26Our review has confirmed the conclusions reached by the Canadian Task Force8 and American Academy of Pediatrics75 that ultrasound screening cannot as yet be recommended. This is due to the lack of evidence. To date we have a huge body of literature which describes the use of ultrasound imaging as a useful and accurate diagnostic tool for DDH, but which fails to provide clear evidence either for or against its use in the general screening of newborn infants. Studies that address the questions relating to the true course of DDH, the effect of treatmen t, and the accuracy of ultrasound screening are required. A recently published decision model acknowledges the lack of evidence to support the implementation of universal screening for DDH in newborns. 76 Values of true and false positives were treated with abduction splinting we re calculated using prevalence estimates based on historical data and treatment rates de rived from observational studies. This decision model predicts that compared to clinical screening or selective use of ultrasound imaging, universal ultrasound screening would achieve the highest number of favourable outcomes and the lowest number of adverse outc omes (occurrence of avascular necrosis). Another decision model 71 considered three different ultrasound screening strategies: general screening at one, two and three m onths; general screening at one and three months; and selective screening at one mont h. These were compared with clinical screening at one month (as current ly practised in the Netherlands) and found that overall general screening at three months performed best. To address the still unans wered questions relating to ultr asound screening in newborns for DDH, a good quality accuracy study should be co nducted first, taking, as suggested by the American Academy of Pediatrics,75 a dislocated hip at one year as the reference standard, with avascular necrosis as the primary co mplication of DDH treatment to be monitored. Importantly, all infants entered into such a study would be followed-up irrespective of the results of screening tests until it was evident t hat true disease has developed or not. If such a study demonstrated that ultrasound is an appropriate screening test, then the effectiveness of ultrasound screening for DDH could be assessed. The ideal study would be conducted in an unselected population of new born infants. All infants would be examined using a standardised, reproducible , but generally accepted technique (Graf's methodology). All ultrasound examinations wo uld be conducted within the first days after birth. All infants would also be examined clinically using the Barlow and Ortolani tests. The ultrasound and clinical examinations would be conducted independently, with no transfer of information between their findings. Furtherm ore both types of examination would be conducted without knowledge of any risk fact ors for DDH (except for female gender and obvious physical signs of DDH, know ledge of which cannot be avoided). All newborns would then be randomised (using cluster randomisation) to one of two management protocols: 1. Follow-up and treatment according to Graf's protocol. 2. Follow-up, with repeat ultrasound (at leas t at months 1, 3 and 12), with treatment instituted only when there was clear evidence of 'true disease': not before three months and preferably not until one year of age. In this management protocol ultrasound imaging would be used as a diagnostic tool to confirm or otherwise a diagnosis of true DDH requiring intervention. Both management protocols would include a specified follow-up scheme (which could incorporate standard practice). All infants would be followed-up irrespective of results of screening tests. The outcome measure would include short term ones such as number treated, duration of treatment, age at which treatment initiated (by type of treatment), type of treatment, adverse effects (all). Data on long term outcomes su ch as functional disability, gait abnormality, osteoarthritis should also be sought, with as long a follow-up as is possible, for example, at age 10, 20 and 30 years or even later. Within this protocol the optimal timing for the initiation of ultrasound screening could be explored. 27Clearly the studies available for review fall shor t of this ideal study. Unfortunately, ideal studies are usually very difficult to do. Prim arily there is the issue of perceived ethics and this in turn is closely entwined with belief in the accepted practice. In Austria, for example it would probably be considered unethical to identify a degree of DDH and then delay treatment. In the USA a similar protocol could perhaps not be followed for fear of future litigation should it transpire that an abnorma lity had been identified but was not treated. In other countries over-treatment might be considered unethical. One possible study that could be conducted would be a prospective comparison of the clinical experiences of two different screeni ng programs. For example the experience in Switzerland or Austria could be compared with that of the screening program in Northern Ireland as described by Maxwell. 33 Importantly such a comparison should consist of data from databases describing newborn populations with follow-up data available on all of the original cohorts; both those without any abnormal sonographic findings as well as those with abnormal sonographic findings. That such a study would be conducted prospectively rather than retrospectively would ensure the direct comparability of the data collected. Analysis of the data should be for all relevant outcomes and reporting should be open and unambiguous. Such a study would still fall far shor t of the ideal, with many differences apart from the screening program itself to account for differences in outcomes. To date we have a huge body of literature wh ich describes the use of ultrasound imaging as a useful diagnostic tool for DDH, but which fa ils to provide clear evidence either for or against its use in the general screening of new born infants. How the available evidence fulfils the ideal characteristics for a screening programme is summarised in Table 5. The current status of the evidence base for the general screening of newborn infants for DDH provides us with a good example of how early acceptance of an intervention or technology can inhibit or even preclude good quality resear ch, resulting in long-term if not permanent uncertainty. 28Table 5 Ideal characteristics of disease, test or interven tion: evidence for ultrasound in screening of newborns for DDH Evidence to support characteristic for DDH? Ideal Characteristics of disease, test or intervention Proponents' interpretation Opponents' interpretation Disease: There is an asymptomatic phase where the disease is undi agnosed but detectable Yes Yes The natural history of the disease must be known as being associated with a significant burden for the individual patient as well as for the society. Yes Unknown The prevalence of the dis ease is known as being high. Yes Unknown Test: People tested positively develop the diseas e without an early intervention. That means that the positive predictive value is high. Yes Unknown The screening must not miss subjects who are at risk of developing the disease.

CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound imaging performed initially at age one month appears to be a sensitive diagnostic screening test. However, further better quality diagnostic accuracy studies are required. General screening of newborns at birth or at one month of age for DDH using ultrasound rather than clinical examination appears to increase overall treatment rates and may be associated with overtreatment. General ultrasound screening of newborns may reduce the severity and invasiveness of the treatments required for DDH. There is no evidence that ul trasound screening reduces the number of clinically relevant cases of DDH diagnosed late. Limited evidence indicates that general ultras ound screening of newborns offers little, if any increased benefit over select ive use of ultrasound imaging. There are no reliable data relating to t he possible adverse consequences associated with general ultrasound screening of newborns for DDH or any associated treatments. Further research is required. Few economic evaluation data are available and these are of limited value due to the quality of the clinical data upon which they ar e based. Overall the cost of ultrasound screening of newborns for DDH may be comparable to or better than that of other screening programmes. There is a lack of evidence. Studies t hat address the questions relating to the true course of DDH, the effects of treatment, and the accuracy of ultrasound screening are required. 5.1 Implications for practice The decision on whether or not to implemen t ultrasound in the general screening of newborns for DDH has to be based on many fact ors: needs, resources, costs, preferences and evidence of effectiveness and safety. This review highlights the lack of clear evidence in terms of the effectiveness, and to a lesser extent the safety of ul trasound in the general screening of newborns for DDH. However, this reflects a lack of evidence per se rather than any evidence that ultrasound screening is not effective or safe. Thus any decision at the present time will depend on weighting t he preferences, needs, costs and lack of evidence. 5.2 Implications for research Clearly, proper research is required in this fi eld. Suggestions for an 'ideal study' and for a re-evaluation of existing screening pr ogrammes are described in the review. 306. REFERENCES 1. Wientroub S, Grill F.

Was the spectrum of patients representative of the patients who will receive the test in practice? Yes The population was an unselected populat ion as is appropriate for screening. 2. Were selection criteria clearly descri bed? Yes Inclusion criteria were very general, with no detailed criteria for exclusion . 3. Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? No Reference test is end of follow-up but as this enc ompasses decision to treat at any age, it is very possible that some treated infants would have resolved spontaneously and therefore such cases represent over treatment. Thus the sensit ivity of the test will be over estimated. 4. Is the time period between reference standard and index test short enough to be reasonably sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests? NA There is a real possibility that the hip dyspla sia will spontaneously resolve between the index text and the reference test if the reference test is c onducted at 8 months. This is an important aspect of the reference test and is not a flaw. Unfortunately, because some infants were treated early rather than receiving the reference test at 8 months some information was lost. 5. Did the whole sample or a random selection of the sample, receive verification using a reference standard of diagnosis? Yes It should be noted that as the reference standard was treatment or reference test at 8 months not all children were exposed to the same reference standard. 6. Did patients receive the same reference standard regardless of the index test result? No As above. 7. Was the reference standard independent of the index test (i.e. the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? No 8. Was the execution of the index test described in sufficient detail to permit replication of the test? Yes 9. Was the execution of the reference standard described in sufficient detail to permit its replication? Yes Clinical judgement and various assessments involv ed so not exactly the same for each infant. 10. Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard? Yes 11. Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test? No 12. Were the same clinical data available when test results were interpreted as would be avail able when the test is used in practice? Yes 13. Were uninterpretable/ intermediate test results reported? Partially Yes All infants followed up until a definite decision made, however, there may have been some uninterpretable results. 14. Were withdrawals from the study explained? Yes 40APPENDIX 5: DATA EXTRACTION TABLES (INCLUDED STUDIES) Author and reference Clegg J, Bache C E, Raut V V. Financial justification for routine ultrasound screening of the neonatal hip.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria All children born in Coventry between 1976 and 1996 were included in the analysis. Group A, born between 1976 and 1986, when a routine programme of clinical screening for DDH was followed. Group B, born between 1986 and May 1989, ultrasonograhic assessment of the hip in addition to clinical examination for all infants within the 'at-risk' categories and those with clinical abnormality of the hip. Group C, born between June 1989 and 1996, routine ultrasound screening in addition to the statutory clinical examination. Number of participants Not stated except for Group C n=14050 Mean age (range) Newborns Males females Not stated Other important demographic factors Not stated Other differences between groups None stated Screening test Clinical screening for DDH was followed, comprising examination at birth by a paediatrician, further examination after discharge by a GP and weekly review in the Orthopaedic Baby Clinic for the babies 'at-risk' Ultrasound by experienced radiographers using Aloaka SSD 500 machine with 7.5 MHz transducer. Technique of Harcke et al. 1984 11 used.and grading system of Terjesen et al. 198955. US initially performed within first few days after birth. Ultrasound used in addition to clinical screening. Treatment and management Pavlik harness used if persistent abnormality on US (grade 3 to 5) with or without clinical instability. If inadequate resolution referred for surgery. Main outcome measure Mean number of patients treated surgically per annum. Number of theatre sessions per case. Percentage of procedures requiring hospital admission Mean age at time of first operation. Statistical methods. Descriptive only Withdrawals No details given - retrospective collection of data Results for main outcomes The mean number of patients treated surgically per year declined from 6.5 (group A) to 5.4 (group B) and 2.5 (group C). The number of theatre sessions per case fell from 2.8 (group A) to 2.1 (group B) and then 1.8 (group C). Results form main outcomes cont. The percentage of procedures requiring hospital admission was 47% in group A, 61% in group B and 9% in group C, with only two major procedures performed in the 7.5 years from June 1989 to December 1996. The mean age at the time of first operation was 12.4 months, 14.2 months and 6.7 months in groups A, B, and C respectively. Comments This comparative study was conducted primarily to provide data for an economic evaluation. 41Author and reference Eggl, Orthopade 1993, 22:277-279 Also published as Krismer M, Klestil T, Morscher M, Eggl H.

Country: Austria Study design Retrospective comparative study Objective To assess if the introduction of a hip ultrasound screening programme has reduced the incidence of hip dislocation. Participants' inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria 89200 newborns born in the Austrian federal state of Tyrol from 1979- 1989. Three groups were defined: Group 1:1979-1983. No ultrasound screening. Only clinical screening. Group 2: 1984-1986. Introduction of ultrasound screening. Group 3: 1987-1989. Ultrasound screening established. Subgroups of 3: Regions with different rates of ultrasound examinations. >85% of newborns screened=high rate; <80% screened=low rate Exclusion criteria: Patients born outside of Tyrol, but treated in Tyrol. Newborn with hip dislocation due to neurological disorders were excluded. Number of participants Group 1: 41500 births. 8300/year Group 2: 24000. 8000/year Group rate (n=4800). Subgroup \"low rate of ultrasound examinations\" (n=3100). Mean age (range) Newborns Males females Not stated Other important demographic factors Not stated Other differences between groups Not stated Screening test Ultrasound examination with Graf`s technique performed within the first few days of life. Ultrasound used in addition to clinical screening. Treatment and management Pavlik harness used for dysplasia and instability. Dislocation treated by closed reduction or open surgery followed by plaster cast Main outcome measure Number of hip dislocation treated by open or closed reduction. Statistical methods. Wilcoxon and Fisher for differences between the three groups Withdrawals No details given (retrospective data collection). Results for main outcomes 136 hip locations were treated by open or closed reductions were performed from 1979 to 1989. Group 1: 86 reductions. 2.2/1000 births Group 2: 32 reductions. 1.3/1000 births Group 3: 18 reductions. 0.8/1000 births Results for main outcomes cont. p for Differences between Group 1 and 2: 0.03 Group 2 and 3: 0.05 Group 1 and 3: 0.00002 Subgroups of group 3: Difference of number of reductions between \"high rate group\" and \"low rate group\": p=0.03: (9 reductions in each group) Adverse effects of treatment or screening: There was no reporting or discussion of adverse effects. Comments Clinical examination, frequency of examinations and treatments were identical in all three groups (unstable or dysplastic hips were treated identically in all three groups with Pavlik harness) No details on clinical examination and period before introduction of ultrasound. Note: the later publication included fewer patients (data up to 1988 instead of 1989) and this resulted in a reduction rate of 0.7 rather than 0.8 per 1000. 42Author and reference Grill F., Mueller D. Hip Screening in Austria.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria (All?) newborns in Austria Number of participants Not stated Mean age (range) Not stated Males females Not stated Other important demographic factors Not stated Other differences between groups Not stated Screening test Newborns screened within first week of life clinically (1985 to 1992) and by ultrasound (1992 to 1994) (Ultrasound used in addition to clinical screening). Data from 1985 to 1992 from insurance companies' form database 1. Data from 1992-1994 from National Health Department form database 2. Total newborns management Conservative or functional therapy used (details not given), followed by surgical reduction if necessary Main outcome measure Number of conservative treatments. Number of surgical interventions Statistical methods. Not stated Withdrawals Not applicable. Results for main outcomes Conservative treatment: In 1985, 13.16% of babies were treated opposed to 6.57% in 1994. From 1992 to 1994 there was no further reduction in the rate. Surgical interventions: In 1991, 0.31/1000 newborns were treated surgically opposed to 0.24/1000 newborns in 1994. Comments It remains completely unclear if the populations of the two periods were comparable. Two different databases for two different periods. No details about databases. The previous screening regime with which the current practice was compared was not described in any detail. No details about therapeutic strategy. Thus, the reduction of conservative interv entions can also be due other reasons than only the ultrasound screening.

Study design RCT, follow-up range 6 to 11 years, mean 8.5 years. Objective To evaluate whether universal (all neonates) or selective (neonates belonging to risk groups) ultrasound screening of the hips should be recommended at birth. Inclusion/exclusion criteria All neonates born between 1988 and 1992 at the University Hospital of Trondheim, whose parents consented to their inclusion in the trial. Infants with a permanent address outside the county were excluded. For the group randomised to selective screening infants were screened with ultrasound only if they had risk factors for DDH: neonatal hip instability, doubtful clinical findings (possible instability in the Barlow test), hip dysplasia in the family, breech position birth and foot deformities. Number of participants 15529 infants included in study. Universal screen group n= 7840 Selective screen group = 7689 Mean age (range) Newborns Males females 51% of infants in both groups were male Other important demographic factors The number of infants with risk factors for DDH was approximately equal in the two groups. Screening test All infants were clinically examined (Ortolani and Barlow tests) on the first day of life by a senior paediatrician (the same one for almost all infants). The ultrasound examination was performed on the third day after birth. The method used was that of Terjesen 55 and Holen.78 Mainly based on measurement of the percentage cover of the femoral head by the acetabular roof plus an assessment of hip stability and acetabular anatomy. A 5mHz transducer was used to obtain one longitudinal and one transverse scan. Ultrasound used in addition to clinical screening. Treatment and management Frejka pillow if clinical instability and femoral head coverage inadequate. Main outcome measures The primary outcome measure was late-detected DDH defined as that diagnosed after one month of age, including dislocati on, subluxation, and acetabular dysplasia. Information on possible late-detected cases was sought from all hospitals in Norway. The rate of treatment with a Frejka pillow was also reported. Adverse events (avascular necrosis) Statistical methods. Student's t-test, the Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used. P was significant at the 5% level. The relative risk of detection of late DDH was calculated as the rate in the ultrasound group divided by the rate in the control group (selective screening group). 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Withdrawals Of all eligible infants 71 were not included because of a lack of parental consent. Of those randomised to universal screening 351 were not examined by ultrasound due to a lack of complete data. Results for main outcomes Number of late detected cases of DDH was: Universal screening group = 1 diagnosed at age 3 months (rate 0.13 per 1000) Selective screening group = 5 diagnosed between 5 and 11 months (rate 0.65 per 1000) Note authors state that the one case in the universal screening group should have been avoided as it occurred only because the protocol was not followed correctly. RR = 0.21 (95% CI: 0.03, 1.45), p=0.22 (Fisher's Exact test) Treatment with Frejka pillow Universal screening group = 0.96% Selective screening group = 0.86% Avascular necrosis occurred in one infant in the selective screening group Comments In this RCT randomisation was achieved by assigning each infant a number according to their birth protocol and randomising to screening group by random number tables. There was no blinding of assessors to screening group. 15% (1153) of the selective screening group had at least one risk factor and an ultrasound examination was performed. 44Author and reference Krolo I, Viskovic K, Kozic S, Marotti M, Klaric- Custovic R, Banak-Zahtila N, et al.

It did not change after the introduction of ultrasound screening. The trend to treat the newborn with broad-diapering started before after the introduction of ultrasound screening. There might be other factors that influenced the treatment beside ultrasound screening. 46Author and reference Malkawi H, Tadros F, Khasawneh Z, AlAsir B.

Country: Jordan Study design Retrospective Comparative study Follow-up: 3 months Objective To ascertain if ultrasound screening is able to detect all abnormal hips and which method (simple or stress sonography) and at what age is the most appropriate. Participants' inclusion/exclusion criteria Newborns delivered at a single hospital (Princess Basma teaching Hospital) One group (Groups 1 and 2) born between August 1988 and February 1989 (n=3334) Another group of unselected infants examined between June 1989 to December 1989 when infants were 3 to 4 months old Number of participants Group 1 n=1823 Group 2 n=1511 Group 3 n=1077 Mean age (range) Newborns for Group 1 and 2; average of 3.4 months for Group 3 Males females Group1 844/1823 females Group2 751/1511 females Group 3 517/1077 females Other important demographic factors None stated Other differences between groups Not Stated Screening test First group (n=3334) Clinical examination and ultrasound performed within 12 hours of birth. All infants were followed-up (clinical and ultrasound) at three months but in addition, those with risk factors or worse than type II hips (Graf classification) were followed up monthly. This group divided into two Group 1 (n=1823; 844 females and 979 males): simple sonography using 7.5 MHz transducer (method of Graf) Group 2 (n=1511; 751 females and 760 males): stress sonography (sonography performed whilst performing clinical examination manoeuvre). Stress sonography was conducted with the baby and transducer in the same position as in simple sonography. The examiner grasps the infants left leg with his free left hand, positioning his fingers on the slightly flexed and adducted knee and the thumb on the sacrum. When examining the right hip the position of the fingers and thumb is reversed. The femoral head is then pushed in the dorsocentral direction by pushing the knee in this direction while the hip is adducted. From the older group at assessment (Group 3) (n=1077; 517 females and 560 males): simple sonography using 5 MHz transducer (according to Graf) performed at age 3 to 4 months. Treatment and management Pathological hips treated using Pavlik harness and monitored for progress and avascular necrosis. Outcome measure Number of infants requiring treatment Statistical methods. Descriptive Withdrawals No details Results for main outcomes Group 1 Abnormal hips requiring treatment n=85 infants (4.7%). Abnormalities identified or predicted at birth in 64 infants but for remaining 21 initial ultrasound screen did not predict abnormality. Group 2 Abnormal hips requiring treatment n=88 infants (5.8%). Abnormalities identified at birth in 33 infants and remaining 55 diagnosed at one to three months. All of these later diagnoses were being followed- up intensively due to existing risk factors including ultrasound results at birth. Average duration of treatment for Groups 1 and 2 combined was 1.16 months (no SD or range reported) Results for main outcomes cont. Group 3 Abnormal hips requiring treatment identified in 14 infants (1.3%). Average duration of treatment 2.9 months (range 6 weeks to 4 months) Where required treatment was given by means of a Pavlik harness and was successful (as determined at one year of age follow-up) in all cases. Adverse effects of treatment or screening: There were no cases of avascular necrosis in the treated patients. Comments Requirement for treatment not defined. Source of unselected 3 to 4 month olds not described. Had they been referred due to risk factors? Had they been screened previously? Overall impression that delaying screening to 3 to 4 months reduces proportion treated but increases duration of treatment required, but interpret with caution 47Author and reference Roovers, E.A., et al., Effectiveness of ultrasound screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip, in Doctoral Thesis 'Post- neonatal ultrasound screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip. A study of cost-effectiveness in the Netherlands'. 2004: University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands. p. 41-53. Study design Prospective cohort study, with historical control group. Follow-up at eight months of age. Objective To investigate the value of ultrasound screening for DDH and to determine the best age at which to perform this screening test. Inclusion/exclusion criteria All children born in the catchment areas of two Child Health Care centres (CHC) in Eastern Netherlands between 1 September 1998 and 30 November 1999. These children were screened by ultrasound examination at the age of one, two and three months and again at eight months. The control population comprised all children born in the catchment area of a CHC in Eastern Netherlands between 1 November 1992 and 31 December 1993. These children were screened according to a standardised assessment protocol (identification of risk factors and repeated physical examination (abduction test and Galeazzi test) plus a reference ultrasound examination at the age six months. Number of participants Intervention population n= 5170 (82.6% of all children). Control population n= 2066 (98.1%). Mean age (range) Newborns Males females Not stated but no difference between intervention and control populations for gender distribution. Other important demographic factors The number of infants with risk factors for DDH was slightly higher in the intervention group: 47.4% vs. 41.1% were first born and 24.8% vs. 17.8% had affected relatives. No significant difference regarding breech position, foot abnormalities, torticollis or neurological disorders. Screening test Intervention screening: The ultrasound examination was performed using Graf's method. A portable sonograph with realtime imaging was used (Hitachi EUB-405 with linear array transducer operating on an ultrasound frequency of 7.5 or 5 MHz (EUP-L33. A location device and a probe- guiding device were used to standardise the infant positioning and the scanning technique. Hips were classified according to Graf's classifications. At the one month examination only decentred hips (type D) were referred. At the month two or three examination immature (severe type IIIa or worse) and abnormal hips (type IIb or worse) were also referred. The one, two and three month imaging made up the screening programme; the eight month imaging was part of the reference test. In addition these children were also examined under the standardised assessment protocol (see control intervention below). Only children with sustained physical abnormality were referred for further diagnostic work up. Treatment and management In the control group the main method of treatment was inpatient traction. For the later intervention group the most common treatment was the Pavlik harness, with traction used only in cases where treatment with the Pavlik harness was unsuccessful Main Outcome measure The primary outcome meas ure was the sensitivity of the screening test defined as the number of cases DDH identified by the screening program divided by the total number of cases of DDH. The reference standard (gold standard) was the decision to treat made during screening programme or final decision after reference US scan at eight months (US programme) or Reference US scan or radiograph at 6 months (CHC programme). Decision to treat based on clinical examination as well an ultrasound imaging and/or radiograph. Other outcome measure: proportion of population referred for treatment; treated; treated early, detected late (not defined) ; and inpatient treatment per 1000 treated Statistical method Differences in prevalence of risk factors between the two populations were tested using Chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact test. Confounding factors (proportion of firstborn children and those with affected relatives) were controlled for by indirect standardisation. Cases of DDH detected by the end of the study follow-up but who had not been detected by the screening program as such were counted as false negatives. The sensitivity with CI was calculated for each screening program (Ultrasound and clinical). Withdrawals Of all eligible infants 1089 from the ultrasound cohort and 39 from the clinical cohort were not included because of a lack of parental consent. In the ultrasound screen group 273 children (5.6%) missed the 8 month reference test as did 4.9% in the clinical screen group. Results for Main Outcomes Sensitivity: Ultrasound = 21.0%) Of those with DDH the proportion referred before 13 weeks was: Ultrasound = 67%; Clinical = 29% Proportion treated as a result of screening programme: Ultrasound = 4.6% - 4.4% When treatment rate in Clinical screening group adjusted for some confounding factors rate was 3.8%. Late detected cases i.e. cases treated but not detected by screening programme. Ultrasound = 0.6% (95% children: Ultrasound = 1 (95% CI: 0 - 2) Clinical = 3 (95% CI: 1 - 7) Adverse effects There was no reporting or discussion of adverse effects. Comments Sensitivity of screening pr ogramme based on reference standard that included treatment. Number of children referred for treatment at different st ages of the screening was not stated so it is not possible to know how many of the treated infants were treated very early and who may have developed normally without treatment. Thus the apparent higher sensitivity of the ultrasound screening programme may simply reflect a higher degree of over treatment. This cannot be discounted from the data as presented. The overall success of the screening programmes in terms of number of infants with normal hips or number who had had to undergo surgery was not reported; the follow-up period of the study was in any case too short for this. Also the standard treatment changed between the assessments of the two screening programmes from traction with the earlier CHC to use of the Pavlik harness with the US programme. 48Author and reference Rosendahl K, Markestad T, Lie RT. Ultrasound screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip in the neonate: The effect on treatment rate and prevalence of late cases. Paediatrics 1994;94(1):47- 52. Country: Norway Follow-up: a minimum of 27 months (mean =42.4 months) Study design Randomised* controlled trial (*Allocation not truly random - see comments) Objective To assess the effect of ultrasound screening on primary diagnosis, management, and prevalence of late cases of DDH (defined as after one month after birth) Participants' inclusion/exclusion criteria Infants born between January 1988 and June 1990 in a single hospital. Neonates weighing less than 1500 g or with severe malformation were not included in the study cohort. Number of participants 11925 (Group 1 = 3613; Group 2 = 4388; Group 3 = 3924). Three study groups: Group 1: all newborns were investigated using ultrasound Group 2: only infants with defined risk factors for DDH (dislocation, dislocatablity or major instability on the Barlow/Ortolani manoeuvre, breech position, or close family history were screened using ultrasound Group 3: no screening with ultrasound Mean age (range) Newborns Males females 47.8 to 49.3% females in all three groups Other important demographic factors None Other differences between groups There is a possibility that there was a higher number of breach presentations (a risk factor for DDH) in the general screening group. Screening test The ultrasound examinations were performed within 24 to 48 hours of delivery, without knowledge of the anamnestic data or preceding clinical findings. Two coronal scans of each hip was obtained for documentation. There was a 90% concordance between two readings. Hips were classified as stable, unstable, dislocat able or dislocated on the basis of sonographic motion during a Barlow manoeuvre. Graf classification used also. Ultrasound was used in addition to clinical screening. Treatment and management The decision to treat (with splints) was based on both clinical and sonographic findings. Clinically stable hips were treated only if the sonographic findings indicated pronounced instability. Main outcome measure Prevalence of early DDH Prevalence of late discovered cases of DDH (late defined as after the first month after birth) Statistical methods. Sample size based on an assumed prevalence of DHH of 2.6 per 1000 and need to detect a sixfold reduction in prevalence of late DDH in screening group (80% power, 5% significance level). Differences in prevalence rates were tested by Chi- squared test. An exact test for linear trend in the prevalence of late DDH from no screening to general screening was used. All p values reported were two sided. Withdrawals Five mothers of full-term babies with normal hips on clinical examination declined to participate. Information on clinical findings was missing for 34 infants in Group 1 and 36 in Group 2. Results for main outcomes No statistically signi ficant differences in sex distribution or positive Barlow/Ortolani test between the three groups. The number of breech births and those with family history of DDH significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. Results for main outcomes cont. A significantly higher number of infants subjected to general screening was judged to be in need of treatment than in the other two groups (3.4% vs. 2.0% and 1.8% (p< 0.0001) The total number of late diagnosed DDH was 10 in Group 3, 9 in Group 2 and 5 in Group 1, giving respective rates of 2.6, 2.1 and 1.4. The difference was not statistically significant (p for trend =0.11) Adverse effects of treatment or screening: There was no reporting or discussion of adverse effects. Comments Allocation to treatment groups 1 and 2 was according to which nursery unit the infants were assigned to. This should not have been influenced by other than random factors except that a higher than average number of caesarean births would be expected to be assigned to ward 2. At certain times ultrasound was not available: infants delivered at these times were assigned to Group 3. Thus allocation to group was not truly random. 49Author and reference Tegnander A, Terjesen T, Bredland T, Holen KJ.

Participants' inclusion/exclusion criteria Newborns at different institutions in Norway Group A (n=15950) (Trondheim University Hospital 1980 to 1985), clinical screening only Group B (n=5403) (Trondheim University Hospital 1986 to 1987), clinical and ultrasound screening Group C (n=6411) (District Hospitals 1980 to 1989) clinical screening only) Number of participants 27764 newborns Mean age (range) Newborn Males females Not stated Other important demographic factors Other differences between groups Screening test Clinical screening consisted of Barlow/Ortolani tests. Ultrasound screening was performed initially as a dynamic examination only but later the coverage of the femoral head by the bony acetabular roof was also measured. Classification was as dislocation, sublocation or acetabular dysplasia after Terjesen et al 56. Treatment and management Method of treatment not reported. Main outcome measures Incidence of late-diagnosed DDH (late defined as after one month of age) Statistical methods Incidences were compared between groups using Chi-squared test of independence, with significance level of 0.05. Withdrawals Not stated Results for main outcomes Incidence of late diagnosed DDH: Group A = 2.6 per 1000 Group B = 0.7 per 1000 Group C = 5.3 per 1000 In group A all the late diagnoses occurred before the introduction of the measurement of the femoral head by the bony acetabular roof. The difference in incidence between Groups A and B was statistically significant (p<0.02). The incidence in Group C was statistically significantly higher than both Groups A and B (p<0.01) Results for main outcomes cont. Adverse effects of treatment or screening: There was no reporting or discussion of adverse effects. Comments No information on whether DDH detected is real DDH or just early DHH that would have resolved without intervention. 50APPENDIX 6: DATA EXTRACTION TABLES (D ESCRIPTIONS OF CLIN ICAL EXPERIENCE) Description of clinical experience - minimal data extraction only Study details Findings Author and reference Andersson JE, Funnemark P-O.

Cost-effectiveness of ultrasonographic scree ning for congenital dysplasia (CDH) in new-borns. Disease Musculoskeletal diseases. Type of intervention Screening. Hypothesis/study question To evaluate the cost-effectiv eness of a programme which utilises ultrasonographic screening to detect congenital hip dysplasi a in new-born infants. Ultrasonographic screening has been shown to reduce the number of late-discovered CDH. The comparator was that of conventional clinical screeni ng methods (Ortolani's or Barlow's test). Economic study type Cost-effectiveness analysis. Study population The study population, for the purposes of asse ssing ultrasonographic screening, consisted of a hypothetical cohort of all new-born inf ants in the hospital in which the study was conducted. A second population consisted of patients who had been treated for late- diagnosed CDH with the following characteri stics: Age when discov ered = 11.9 months (mean), 5 months(median); Number of operations = 0.7 (mean), 0 (median); Age at last visit = 3.8 years (mean), 4 years (median). Setting Secondary care (hospital). The study was conducted in Bergen, Norway. Dates to which data relate The effectiveness data relate to previous st udies conducted between 1989 and 1992. Cost data for the late-treated group relate to 1 984-85, and the cost data for ultrasonographic screening were derived from a study conducted in 1989 and 1990. The price year was 1993. Source of effectiveness data The effectiveness data were derived from a comb ination of a review of previous literature, the findings of a single study and authors' assumptions. Links between effectiveness and cost data For the purposes of the ultrasonographic sample the cost and effectiveness data were derived prospectively from the same hypothetic al cohort. The effectiveness and cost of the comparator were derived from the relevant st udy sample. For the latter group, the costing was conducted retrospectively. Single study Study sample The late-detected (comparator) group consist ed of 26 children who had been referred for 75specialist consultation and were diagnosed as having CDH. Power calculations were not used in determining sample size. Study design The study design for the late-detected group was case series and was conducted on a single site. The duration of follow-up was not specified. The loss to follow-up was not specified. Analysis of effectiveness The analysis of effectiveness was based on int ention to treat. The measure of effectiveness adopted was the sensitivity and specificity of t he screening test in terms of the number of late-detected cases of CDH avoided per annum and the number of false-positives after ultrasonographic screening. Effectiveness results The sensitivity and specificity of current screening practice resulted in an incidence of late- detected CDH of 2.6 cases in 5,000 live births. Clinical conclusions The number of late-discovered cases of CDH was higher in ultrasonographic versus clinical screening. The ultrasonographic screening wo uld have produced 57.5 false-positive diagnoses. Review/synthesis of previously published studies Outcomes assessed in the review The outcomes assessed in the review were the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonographic scr eening and the number of late-discovered CDH cases in Norway. Study designs and other criteria for inclusion in the review No specific study designs were stipulated by the authors as inclusion criteria. The authors emphasised the value of a double-blinded study used to assess the detection rate of ultrasonographic screening. Sources searched to identify primary studies Not stated. Criteria used to ensure th e validity of primary studies Not stated. Methods used to judge relevance and validity, and for extracting data Not stated. Number of primary studies included The authors examined approximately three st udies in determining the effectiveness of ultrasonographic screening. Method of combination of primary studies Not stated. Investigation of differences between studies Not stated. Results of the review The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonographi c screening for all live births in Norway would result in the avoidance of 2 cases of late-detected CDH per annum over 1,000 live births. Estimates of effectiveness based on opinion 76Methods used to derive estimates of effectiveness Authors' assumptions were also used to supply estimates of effectiveness. Estimates of effectiveness and key assumptions The number of investigators needed was based up on the assumption of an even distribution of investigators throughout the country. Economic analysis Measure of benefits used in the economic analysis The benefit measure was the number of la te-detected cases of CDH avoided per annum. Direct costs Direct costs were derived from hospital accounts and estimates based on resource usage and time and included: the cost of treating la te-detected cases of CDH; the cost of ultrasonographic investigation which also incl uded training costs, equipment, personnel time and cost accounting; and the co st of the utilization of hospi tal facilities. The costs of unnecessary treatment due to false positive resu lts of screening were also included. Costs and quantities were analysed separately. The quantity/cost boundary adopted was the hospital. Discounting was not relevant due to t he time scale of the st udy. Direct costs would be met by the Norwegian NHS and the price year was 1993. Indirect costs Not carried out. Currency Norwegian Kroner (NOK). The conver sion rate adopted was 1 US$ = 6 NOK. Statistical analysis of costs Not undertaken. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis was not carried out. Estimated benefits used in the economic analysis By introducing an ultrasonographic screening programme an estimated 2.6 cases oflate- discovered CDH per annum would be avoided. The cost avoided for 2.6 fewer cases of late- discovered CHD was NOK 315,562. Cost results The total average cost of treatment per case of late-detected CDH was NOK 121,370. The extra cost of exchanging one clinical exami nation for one ultrasound examination was NOK 60. The total cost of screening plus one c linical examination was estimated to be NOK 1,650,000 and the cost of false positive over treatment was estimated to be NOK 40,000 for a total cost of NOK 1,690,000. If the clinical ex aminations were eliminated the extra cost of ultrasound would be NOK 285,000. Discounti ng was not applied. The total ultrasonographic screening was NOK 1,375,438 (1,690,000 - 315,562, the cost avoided for 2.6 fewer cases of late-discovered CDH). Synthesis of costs and benefits The costs and benefits were combined by estimating the cost per child screened in order to avoid late-detected cases of CD H. The net cost of detecting 2. 6 cases of late-detected CDH would be NOK 275 per new-born baby. As such an incremental analysis was carried out. The authors also presented the findings in terms of total screening costs minus late- detected treatment costs in monetary terms to produce an incremental cost-benefit measure. Conclusions, commentary and implications 77Author's Conclusions The authors concluded that although ultraso nographic screening would result in fewer cases of late-detected CDH a general screening programme applied to the total population of new-born infants was not cost-effective. Howe ver, screening for those identified as being at greater risk (traumatic birth and family hist ory of CDH) may bring additional benefits and be cost-effective. Moreover, if the screening programme adopted only ultrasonographic testing and the clinical examinations were eliminated the programme would become cost- effective. CRD commentary Selection of comparators: The reason for the choice of the comparator is clear. The ultrasonographic option is a widely used screening technology. You, as a user of this database, should consider whether these are widely used health technologies in your own setting. Validity of estimate of measure of benefit: The estimate of measure of benefit used in the economic analysis is likely not to be internally valid. The data have not been used selectively. Validity of estimate of costs: Resources and costs were reported separately. Adequate details of methods of quantity/cost estimation were given. Important cost items do not appear to have been omitted. Other issues: The authors' conclusions are likely to be justified given the uncertainties in the data. Some confusion was evident concerning the sample si ze of the late-detected treatment group as the text refers to a figure of 26 but is reported in table 1 as n=16. As costings for this group were calculated on the basis of 26 patients the to tal figures would have been different if 16 were, in fact, the true figure. Clearly, this woul d have created a different outcome in terms of the comparison made with alternative screening costs. The issue of generalisability to other setting was addressed in terms of a national sc reening programme. For purposes of clarity the study would have benefited from presen ting values for sensitivity and specificity explicitly, although it is recognis ed that the figures for clinical examinations would have wide variations due to differing levels of expertis e. The authors argued for a centralisation of screening within large hospitals to overcome this limitation. Appropriate comparisons were made with other studies and the results were not presented selectively. Implications of the study The authors recommend further study to assess q uality of life deterioration in cases of late- detected CDH and in patients in later stages of their lives when the condition would become more costly to treat.

Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine 1995;149(6):643-648. Health technology Using general screening (clinical screening combined with ultrasound screening of all infants) or selective screening (clinical screeni ng plus an ultrasound screening of infants at high risk of developing developmental dysplasi a of the hip (DDH)) in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. Disease Musculoskeletal diseases; Neonatal diseases and abnormalities. Type of intervention Screening, diagnosis and treatment. Hypothesis/study question The aim of the study was to assess the cost-effect iveness of using general or selective screening strategies versus routine clinical screening strategy in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. No screeni ng (routine clinical screening alone) was regarded as the comparator. Economic study type Cost-effectiveness analysis. Study population Newborn babies. Setting Hospital. The economic study was carried out in Norway. Dates to which data relate Effectiveness data were derived from a study published in 1994. The date to which the resource use data referred was not specified. All costs were converted to 1993 US dollars. Source of effectiveness data Effectiveness data were derived from a single study. Links between effectiveness and cost data Costing was undertaken (retrospectively) on the sa me patient sample as that used in the effectiveness analysis. Single study Study sample There was no report of the use of power calc ulations to determine the sample size. 11,925 newborn babies were studied in general (n=3, 613), and selective (n=4,388) ultrasound screening programmes compared with clinical screening (n=3,924) alone, to compare differences in the rates of early, borderline, and late cases of DDH. Note: members of the selective group could only undergo ultrasound examination if t hey had high-risk factors (e.g. breech position, close DDH family history, and dislocated/dislocatable/ unstable hips upon examination). Study design Single-centre randomised controlled trial. Duration of follow-up was a minimum of 27 months (mean 42.4 months). Loss to follow up was not reported. 80Analysis of effectiveness The principle (intention to treat or treatment completers only) used in the analysis of effectiveness was not explicitly specified. Timi ng of and rates of treatment for DDH were the primary health outcomes assessed in the analysis. The rate of late subluxation and dislocation was also reported. Effectiveness results In comparison with infants undergoing clinical screening alone, the addition of an ultrasound examination for all infants resulted in a treatm ent rate of 3.4% compared to 1.8% of early DDH cases. Using ultrasound treatment on high- risk newborns only produced a treatment rate of 2%. The rate of late subluxation and dislocation for general and selective screening were 0.3 and 0.7 respectively. The corresponding rate for clinical screening alone was 1.3 per 1000 infants. Clinical conclusions In contrast to other investigators, this study found a higher treatment rate for those subjected to general ultrasound screening than for those subjected to selective or no screening. Economic analysis Measure of benefits used in the economic analysis The benefit measure was late treatments for DDH. Direct costs Costs generally were not discounted (a disc ount rate was applied for the depreciation of ultrasound equipment). Quantities were partially reported separately from the costs. Direct health service costs were used, which incl uded screening costs ( personnel, training, equipment), with ultrasound and clinical ex amination time(s) obtained from a 1 month average of time sheet entries. Overhead costs (hospital administration costs, housekeeping, laundry, heat, inter-departmental resource us e) were obtained from hospital accounts. Overhead costs were assumed to be the same for all three treatments. Early treatment and follow-up personnel costs were obtained from pedi atric outpatient clinic time sheets. Hip ultrasound and x-ray examination costs were obtained from the department of pediatric radiology. Late diagnosis treatment costs were obtained from 24 similar cases at Hagavik Orthopaedic Hospital, as was t he average patient cost of ho spitalisation (from the 1991 accounts, converted into 1993 Norwegian kroner and US dollars). Retrospective personnel time was obtained from the same source. Ou tpatient contact costs (personnel time, departmental administration, hospital facilitie s) were also considered. The perspective adopted in the cost analysis was that of a health care system. All costs were expressed in 1993 dollars. Indirect costs Not considered. Currency Norwegian kroner (NKr). A conversion to US dollars was performed based on an exchange rate of $1 = Nkr7.57. Sensitivity analysis One-way sensitivity analysis was carried out on the discount rate for ultrasound equipment lifetime, overhead costs, hospit alisation costs, screening numbers, and the incidence of late cases of DDH. Threshold analysis was performed to identify the cut-off points. Estimated benefits used in the economic analysis The number of late treatments for DDH was redu ced from 2.6 cases per 1000 with clinical screening to 2.1 per 1000 for selective and 1.4 per 1000 for general screening. 81Cost results The (expected) total costs of screening, follow- up, and treatment for general screening were $27.90, for no screening were $29.20, and for selective screening were $29.60 per child. The average cost of a hypothetic al programme involving general screening of all girls and selective screening of 12% of boys with a spec ial risk factor for DDH was $20.70 per infant. The discounting rate for the ultrasound equipment was 5%. Synthesis of costs and benefits Threshold analysis found that the general scre ening programme had a net economic benefit if average per diem costs for late treatment exceeded $343.50, or the annual number of deliveries exceeded 3500, or the incidence of late cases exceeded 3.6 per 1000 infants. Conclusions, commentary and implications Author's Conclusions Application of costs from other centres to this study's data regarding frequency of clinical outcomes may yield different comparative progra mme costs. If the findings of this clinical study can be generalised to other centres, a stra tegy of screening all girls and boys with risk factors for DDH may be the mo st cost-effective approach. CRD commentary Selection of comparators: The reason for the choice of the comparator is clear. Validity of estimate of measure of benefit: The estimate of benefit is likely to be inter nally valid given the use of a randomised controlled trial. Validity of estimate of costs: Resource use data were partially reported separat ely from the costs and adequate details of methods of cost estimation were given.

Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery - British Volume 1999;81B(5):852-857. Health technology Routine ultrasound screening for develop mental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Disease Musculoskeletal diseases; Neonatal diseases and abnormalities. Type of intervention Screening. Hypothesis/study question The objective of the study was to analyse t he patterns of management of DDH using three different screening policies: clinical examinati on alone, introduction of ultrasound screening for infants with known risk factors; and routine ultrasound scanning for all infants at birth. The reason for the choice of the comparators is clear, as these screening policies were widely used in the authors' setting. Economic study type Cost-effectiveness analysis. Study population New-born babies. Setting Secondary care. The economic study was conducted in Coventry, UK. Dates to which data relate Effectiveness and cost data were collected between 1976 and 1996. The authors stated that all costs were estimated at present-dat e prices, but the price date was not reported. Source of effectiveness data Effectiveness data were derived from a single study. Links between effectiveness and cost data Costing was undertaken retrospect ively on the same patient sample as that used in the effectiveness analysis. Single study Study sample All children born in Coventry between 1976 and 1996 were included in the analysis. The following groups were investigated: group A, born between 1976 and 1986, when a r outine programme of clinical screening for DDH was followed, comprising examination at birth by a paediatrician, further examination after discharge by a GP and weekly review in the Orthopaedic Baby Clinic for the babies 'at-risk'; group B, born between 1986 and May 1989, ultrasonograhic assessment of the hip in addition to clinical examination for all infants within the 'at-risk' categories and those with clinical abnormality of the hip; and group C, born between June 1989 and 1996, rout ine ultrasound screening in addition to the statutory clinical examination. Power calculations were not used to determine sample size. 83Study design This was a non-randomised trial with historical controls, carried out in Coventry. Neither the length of follow up nor any loss to follow up was reported. Analysis of effectiveness The analysis appears to have been based on treatment completers only. The main health outcomes used in the analysis were: incidence of abnormality, succes s rate for treatment with Pavlick harness, number of patients treat ed surgically, number of theatre sessions per case and percentage of procedures requiring hospital admission. Effectiveness results There were 65 patients with DDH in group A, 19 patients in group B and 19 patients in group C. After the introduction of routine screening (g roup C), the incidence of abnormality in first scans was 7.3%. The rate decreased to 0.4% by six weeks, which equates to 129 patients in the 7.5 year period until the end of 1996. In all but 19 patients (0.06% of the total), subsequent treatment in a Pavlick harness was successful. The mean number of patients treated surgically per year declined from 6.5 (group A) to 5.4 (group B) and 2.5 (group C). The number of theatre sessions per case fell from 2.8 (group A) to 2.1 (group B) and then 1.8 (group C). The percentage of procedures requiring hospital admission was 47% in group A, 61% in group B and 9% in group C, with only two major procedures performed in the 7.5 years from June 1989 to December 1996. Clinical conclusions If DDH is identified early it can be treated conser vatively by gentle abduction of the hips by a simple brace. If the diagnosis is delayed, the infant will usually require surgical treatment. Routine scanning for DDH of infants at birth resulted in earlier detection of DDH and fewer children needing surgery. Economic analysis Measure of benefits used in the economic analysis The authors did not provide a summary meas ure of benefit. As such, the study may be regarded as a cost consequences analysis and the health benefits equate to the health outcomes reported above. Direct costs Direct hospital costs were considered namely : cost of hospital admission (including fixed costs), surgical implant (Coventry screw and plate), radiological services and contrast material, blood, cost of non-operative trea tment using Pavlick harness. The cost of ultrasonographers and equipment for one screening session in the outpatient clinic was also considered. Procedures were assessed in te rms of units of operating theatre time, consumables such as implants and blood. Quantities and costs were analysed separately. Costs were not discounted as they were incurred in a short period of time. Indirect costs Not considered. Currency UK pounds sterling (\u00a3). Statistical analysis of costs Not performed. 84Sensitivity analysis Not performed. Estimated benefits used in the economic analysis Not applicable. Cost results The final overall cost for group A was \u00a322,188 per year, for group B it was \u00a321,837 and for group C, \u00a326,564. The average annual cost of treatment in group A was \u00a35,110, for group B it was \u00a33,811, and for group C, \u00a3468 per 1000 live births. Synthesis of costs and benefits This was not applicable due to the cost-consequences approach adopted. Conclusions, commentary and implications Author's Conclusions When the cost of running the screening prog ramme is added to the expense of treating DDH, the overall cost for the management of DDH is comparable for the different screening policies. CRD commentary Selection of comparators: The reason for the choice of the comparators is clear as all three screening policies (clinical examination alone, introduction of ultrasound sc reening for infants with known risk factors and routine ultrasound scanning for all infants at birth) were used in the authors' setting. You, as a database user, should consider if this applies to your own setting. Validity of estimate of measure of benefit: The authors did not provide a summary meas ure of benefit and hence, conducted a cost consequences analysis. The retrospective natur e of the study design may have introduced biases. With the exception of age, groups we re not shown to be comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. No power calculations related to the sample size were reported. Validity of estimate of costs: The analysis of costs is presented in detail, but costs were not analysed statistically. Indirect costs were not considered in the analysis. Other issues: Costs may not be generalisable outside the UK NH S. Appropriate comparisons with costs from other NHS centres and other health systems were made. Implications of the study Further investigation is needed in order to assess the long-term savings which would occur by reducing the risk of developing arthritis seco ndary to acetabular dysplasia or the cost of litigation from missed cases.

Enschede, The Netherlands: Un iversity of Twente 200468-77. This record was compiled by CRD commissioned reviewers according to a set of guidelines developed in collaboration with a group of leading health economists. Health technology Three screening strategies for developmental dy splasia of the hip (DDH) were examined: general ultrasound screening at the age of 3 months; selective ultrasound screening at the age of 3 months, when only infants with recognised risk factors (breech position or a family histor y of DDH in first- or second-degree relatives) or abnormal results on physical examination of the hip were screened; and current screening policy for DDH in the Netherlands. This was based on repeated physical examination of the infant hip and risk factors in the first mont hs of life, and was performed as part of the child health care (CHC) programme. Both ultrasound screening strategies used the Graf's sonographic method. Disease Neonatal diseases and abnormalities; Musculoskeletal diseases. Type of intervention Screening. Hypothesis/study question The objective of the study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of general ultrasound screening, selective ultrasound screeni ng, and current screening for DDH in the Netherlands. On the basis of prior results t he authors hypothesised that, although initially more costly, the implementation of general ul trasound screening could lead to substantial cost-savings due to the significantly lower refe rral rate than the actual screening strategy. The study was conducted from a societal perspective. Economic study type Cost-effectiveness analysis. Study population The study population comprised the general cohort of infants in their first months of life. Setting The setting was CHC centres (primary care). The economic study was carried out in the Netherlands. Dates to which data relate The dates to which the effectiveness and reso urce use data related were not reported. The price year was 2002. Source of effectiveness data The effectiveness evidence was derived from completed studies. Modelling A decision tree model was used to evaluate the costs and clinical outcomes of the three screening strategies. Details of the model were not reported. Review/synthesis of previously published studies 87Outcomes assessed in the review The health outcomes assessed from the primary studies were the incidence of DDH in the Netherlands and the probability values for: true cases of DDH, missed cases, infants treated by the CHC physician, infants screened by ultrasound, referral for specialist consultation, and early treatment given a positive screening result. Study designs and other criteria for inclusion in the review A formal review of the literature was not carr ied out. The authors stated that one of the primary studies was a large prospective study (the Soundchec study) that involved 5,170 infants screened by ultrasound. Sources searched to identify primary studies Not stated. Criteria used to ensure th e validity of primary studies Not stated. Methods used to judge relevance and validity, and for extracting data Not stated. Number of primary studies included The effectiveness evidence came from 2 primary studies. Method of combination of primary studies Not stated. Investigation of differences between studies Not stated. Results of the review The incidence of DDH in the Netherlands was 3.7%. The probability values were: for true cases of DDH, 3.1% for general ultras ound screening, 2.4 for selective ultrasound screening and 2.8% for CHC screening; for missed cases of DDH, 0.006 for general ultrasound screening, 0.013 for selective ultrasound screening and 0.009 for CHC screening; for infants treated by the CHC physician, 0.33 for general ultrasound screening, 1 for selective ultrasound screeni ng and 1 for CHC screening; for infants screened by ultrasound, 1 for general ultrasound screening and 0.192 for selective ultrasound screening (NA for CHC screening); for referral for specialist consultation, 0.045 for general ultrasound screening, 0.030 for selective ultrasound screening and 0.192 for CHC screening; and for early treatment given a positive screening re sult, 0.711 for general ultrasound screening, 880.8 for selective ultrasound scr eening and 0.146 for CHC screening. Economic analysis Measure of benefits used in the economic analysis The summary benefit measure used in the ec onomic evaluation was the proportion of screen-detected cases of DDH. This was obtained from the decision tree. Direct costs Discounting was irrelevant since the costs per patient were incurred during a short time. The unit costs were presented separately from the quantities of resour ces used. The health services included in the economic evaluati on were ultrasound examination (personnel, training, equipment and consumables), medical costs (diagnostic imaging and treatment of DDH) and travel expenses. A breakdown of the costs was provided. The cost/resource boundary adopted in the study reflected the soci etal perspective. The equipment costs were calculated using a depreciation method based on annuities with a discount rate of 4.5%. It was assumed that the equipment had an economic lifetime of 5 years and the costs of maintenance were 8% of the purchase price. Mo st of the resource use and cost data came from the Soundchec study and authors' and expe rts' assumptions. The Dutch guideline prices were also used for medical costs and travel expenses. Distances were based on prior studies. All the costs were adjusted to 2002 values using the consumer price index. Indirect costs The indirect costs were included in the econ omic evaluation to reflect the societal perspective adopted in the study. The unit co sts were not reported, although the authors stated that the patients' time was valued ac cording to Dutch guidelines. However, the method used was not reported. The quantity of ti me spent for screening examination, visits and overnight hospitalisation was estimated us ing authors' assumptions. The price year was likely to have been 2002. Currency Euro (Euro). Statistical analysis of costs The costs were treated deterministically. Sensitivity analysis One-way sensitivity analyses were carried out. These assessed the impact of changes in the costs of ultrasound scr eening, CHC screening and diagnostic imaging in hospital, treatment costs of true-positive infants, pat ient costs, and the incidence of DDH. The authors stated that plausib le changes were made. Estimated benefits used in the economic analysis The proportion of screen-det ected cases of DDH was 2.4% for selective ultrasound screening, 2.8% for CHC screening and 3. 1% for general ultrasound screening. Cost results The total cost per child screened was Euro 52. 1 with selective ultrasound screening, Euro 82 with CHC screening and Euro 70.6 with general ultrasound screening. Synthesis of costs and benefits Average and incremental cost-effectiveness rati os were calculated to combine the costs and benefits of the screening strategies. The average cost per screen detected case of DDH was Euro 2,171 with selective ultrasound screening, Euro 2,929 with CHC screening and Euro 2,278 with general ultrasound sc reening. CHC screening was dominated by general ultrasound screening, which in turn offe red a cost of Euro 2,646 per additional case of DDH detected. The sensitivity analysis showed that the ranking of the alternative scre ening strategy did not change when key inputs were varied, the CH C strategy was always dominated by the general ultrasound strategy. The incremental co st-effectiveness ratio of general versus 89selective ultrasound screening ranged from Euro 2,388 to Euro 4,526. Only when patient costs were excluded (and a health care system perspective was adopted), was the general ultrasound screening strategy the overall domi nant cost-effective option, with an average cost-effectiveness ratio of Euro 1,804 per infant detected. Conclusions, commentary and implications Author's Conclusions General ultrasound screening represented a co st-effective strategy for the detection of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in the Netherlands. It dominated all other alternative screening options if it were assumed that the patients were willing to pay for the additional time required to attend outpatient visits and screening procedures. CRD commentary Selection of comparators: The authors justified their choice of the co mparators. Universal ul trasound screening was the strategy under evaluation, which had been sh own to be cost-effective in other countries such as Austria, Germany and Switzerland. CHC screening represented the strategy currently implemented in the Netherlands. Sele ctive ultrasound scr eening was considered as a further comparator because it was uncl ear from earlier analyses whether it could be more efficient than universal screening. Over all, it appears that all feasible screening alternatives have been considered in the study . You should decide whether they represent valid comparators in your own setting. Validity of estimate of measure of effectiveness: The analysis of effectiveness used data derived from published studies, but it is unclear whether a systematic review of the literature was carried out. Details of the primary studies were not provided and it is not obvious whet her the authors also made some assumptions. Therefore, since the sources of the effectiveness evidence were not reported satisfactorily, it is difficult to assess the validity and re liability of the data used in the analysis. Validity of estimate of measure of benefit: The benefit measure used in the analysis repr esents a disease-specif ic measure that was calculated using a decision tree model. The model was not described and the structure of the tree was not depicted. Hence, the patterns of care under each strategy were unclear. The use of the number of detec ted cases does nothing to fa cilitate comparisons with the benefit measure used for other health care interventions. Validity of estimate of costs: The perspective adopted in the study was explicitly stated. It was the most appropriate as it also included patient costs. A breakdown of the costs was provided , and both resource use and unit cost data were reported for most of the direct costs included in the economic evaluation. The indirect costs were estimated from Dutch guidelines, which were also used to estimate some other medical costs. The pric e year was reported, thus simplifying reflation exercises in other settings. The cost estimate s were specific to the study setting, but the transferability of the results was enhanced by the sensitivity analyses conducted on most key economic parameters. Experts' assumptions were also used for resource use data. Other issues: The authors did not make extensive comparison s of their findings with those from other studies. In terms of the generalisability of the study results to other settings, the authors stated that their conclusions were applicable only to countries with characteristics similar to those observed in the Netherlands. However, the CHC programme represented quite a unique system with nearly complete attendance of all infants. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the robustn ess of the study results to va riations in the parameters 90used. Some limitations to the validity of the study were reported. The long-term costs and effects were not considered and the authors st ated that their inclusion would have favoured the general ultrasound screening strategy. The rate of participation represented a critical variable, but the authors expected near complete participation if ultrasound screening were included in the actual CHC programme. Implications of the study The study results suggested that general ultras ound screening for DDH represents a cost- effective strategy. Policy-makers should devot e more attention to the identification of effective and efficient screening options for infants.
