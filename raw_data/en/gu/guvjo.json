Bibliography and Glossary with Biblio graphy.......................................................................................30 4 Commissioners' Me ssage The Department of Health is pleased to release this condensed version of the Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) Blueprint for Advancing and Sustaining CLAS Policy and Practice . We are aware of the challenges associated with providing healthcare services to the multicultural and ethnic ally diverse communities across the S tate of New Jersey . We recognize that more than 100 foreign languages are spoken as the primary language in the homes of many of our residents. We also know that l anguage and the cultural beliefs are important variables that can impact the delivery of health services . That is why we believe releasing this condensed version of The Blueprint to our community partners will become a best practice for engaging and assisting residents from any culture, race or ethnicity as they access our healthcare system. The Blueprint describes the process for developing and following a standard way to address cultural difference s and effective implementation strategies designed for any setting. It is the intent of the New Jersey Department of Health to raise the awareness of New Jersey's communit y and faith -based organizations, public health agencies , hospitals, federally qualified health centers, (FQHC) and others regarding the important role the CLAS standards play in the delivery of health care . As many of you are aware, Health y New Jersey 2020(HNJ2020 ) is the states' 10-year public health agenda, aimed at improving the overall health of New Jersey's residents. It is compose d of key topic areas which are consistent with New Jersey's priority health areas outlining objectives and measurable outcomes for th e total population including racial/ethnic, age, and gender subgroups. The importance of cultural competency standards is embedded in the goals and objectives of the Healthy New Jersey 2020 (HNJ2020). Additionally , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ' Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health's ' (OASH) enhanced CLAS standards underscore the importance of the Healthy New Jersey 2020 overarching goals : Attain high- quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death. Achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve health for all people. Create social and physical en vironments that promote good health for all. Promote quality of life, healthy development, and healthy behaviors across all life stages. 5 With the goals of the HNJ2020 in mind , we relate the importance of the princip al standard of the CLAS - provide effect ive, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs . We encourage all health care providers and agencies, community and faith -based organizations to consider the differences in culture, language, race, and ethnicity, as we move toward developing new and more culturally appropriate ways to achieve health equity for our residents . The New Je rsey Depar tment of Health strives to ensure that all public health agencies have the most relevant information to meet the health care n eeds of all New Jersey residents regardless of their culture, religion, race, ethnicity, language, disability, age, socioeconomic status, gender and, or sexual orientation. W e, therefore, encourage all public health agencies to consider culture and language as key influences in the delivery of care and the way in which people from different cultures approach and understand health . We believe the adoption of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH ) enhanced CLAS standards and The Blueprint , in this condensed version, will help shape New Jersey's health services into a more accessible healthcare system for all people , particularly those from different cultures with limited English proficiency. The New Jersey Department of Health offer s this condensed version of the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care: A Blueprint for Advancing and Sustaining CLAS Policy and Practice (the Blueprint) . The complete and comprehensive B lueprint can be downloaded from the US OMH website at https://www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov/index.asp . We have elected to publish a condensed version of The Blueprint in table format highlighting each standard, the purpose of the standard and, strategies for implementing the standa rds. A glossary and bibliography are also included . More details concerning components of the standards and resources are available in the original version of the Blueprint . We hope that you will be inspired by the implementation strategies outlined for each of the fifteen standard s and that you will give seri ous consideration to incorporating culturally and linguistically appropriate services within your agency based on the CLAS standards. As recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service s' Office Of The Assistant Secretary of Health, \" adoption of the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care will help advance better health and health care in the United States \" (2013, HHS OMH). Mary E. O'Dowd, M.P.H. Commissioner 6 THE ENHANCED NATIONAL CLAS STANDARDS The Enhanced National C ulturally and L inguistically Appropriate Standards are organized as one Principal Standard and three themes: Principal Standard: 1. Provide effective, equita ble, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs. Governance, Leadership and Workforce: 2. Advance and su stain organizational governance and leadership that promotes CLAS and health equity through policy, practices and allocated resources. 3. Recruit, promote, and support a culturally and linguistically diverse governance, leadership, and workforce that are responsive to the population in the service area. 4. Educate and train governance, leadership, and workforce in culturally and linguistically appropriate policies and practices on an ongoing basis. Communication and Language Assistance: 5. Offer language assistance to individuals who have limited English proficiency and/or other communication needs, at no cost to them, to facilitate timely access to all health care and services. 6. Inform all individuals of the availability of language assistance services clearly and in their preferred language, verbally and in writing. 7. Ensure the competence of individual s providing language assistance , recognizing that the use of untrained individuals and/or minors as interpreters should be avoided. 8. Provide easy -to-understand print and multimedia materials and signage in the languages commonly used by the populations in the service area. Engagement, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability: 9. Establish culturally and linguistically appropriate goals, policies, and management accountability, and infuse them throughout the organization's planning and operations. 10. Conduct ongoing assessments of the organization's CLAS -related activities and integrate CLAS - related measures into measurement and continuous quality imp rovement activities. 11. Collect and maintain accurate and reliable demographic data to monitor and evaluate the impact of CLAS on health equity and outcomes and to inform service delivery. 12. Conduct regular assessments of community health assets and nee ds and use the results to plan and implement services that respond to the cultural and linguistic diversity of populations in the service area. 13. Partner with the community to design, implement, and evaluate policies, practices, and services to ensure cu ltural and linguistic appropriateness. 14. Create conflict and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and linguistically appropriate to identify, prevent and resolve conflicts or complaints. 15. Communicate the organization's progress in implem enting and sustaining CLAS to all stakeholders, constituents, and the general public. 7 The Blueprint The condensed version of The Blueprint has been compiled into an easy to read table format that includes a definition for each CLAS standard along with the identified purpose of the standard, and easy to adopt strategies for the implementation of each standard. T he link to the comprehensive Blueprint for Advancing and Sustaining CLAS Policy and Practice is also included for your reference . https://www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov/index.asp 8 Table 1: PROVIDE EFFECTIVE, EQUITABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, AND RESPECTFUL QUALITY CARE AND SERVICES Standard 1: Provide effective, equitable, understandabl e, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs. Purpose: The purposes of providing effective, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services are: To create a safe and welcoming environment at every point of contact that both fosters appreciation of the diversity of individuals and provides patient - and family -centered care To ensure that all individual s receiving health care and services experience culturally and linguistically appropriate encounters To meet communication needs so that individuals understand the health care and services they are receiving, can participate effectively in their own care, and make informed decisions To eliminate discrimination and disparities Strategies for Implementation: Standard 1 is the Principal Standard because, conceptually, the ultimate aim in adopting the remaining Standards is to achieve Standard 1. Standards 2 through 15 represent the practices and policies intended to be the fundamental building blocks of culturally and linguistically appropriate services that are necessary to achieve the Principal Standard. For this reason, Strategies for Implementation specif ic to Standard 1 are not listed here . If each of Standards 2 through 15 is implemented and maintained, organizations will be better positioned to achieve the desired goal of \"effect, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs.\" 9 Table 2: ADVANCE AND SUSTAIN GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP THAT PROMOTES CLAS AND HEALTH EQUITY Standard 2: Advance and su stain organizational governance and leadership that promotes CLAS and health equity through policy, practices, and allocated resources. Purpose: The purposes of advancing and sustaining governance and leadership that promotes CLAS and health equity are: To ensure the provision of appropriate resources and accountability needed to support and sustain initiatives To model an appreciation and respect for diversity, inclusiveness, and all beliefs and practices To support a model of transparency and communicat ion between the service setting and the populations that it serves Strategies for Implementation: The following are possible implementation strategies for advancing and sustaining governance and leadership that promotes CLAS and health equity: From the National Quality Forum (2009): Create and sustain an environment of cultural competency through establishing leadership structures and systems or embedding them into existing structures and systems. Identify and develop informed and committed champions of cultural competency throughout the organization in order to focus efforts around providing culturally competent care. Ensure that a commitment to culturally competent care is reflected in the vision, goals, and mission of the organization and couple this with an actionable plan. Implement strategies to recruit, retain, and promote at all levels of the organization a diverse leadership that reflects the demographic characteristics of the populations in the service area. Ensure tha t the necessary fiscal and human resources, tools, skills , and knowledge to support and improve culturally competent policies and practices in the organization are available. Commit to cultural competency through system -wide approaches that are articulated through written policies, practices, procedures and programs. Actively seek strategies to improve the knowledge and skills that are needed to address cultural competency in the Organization. From the Joint Commission (Wilson -Stronks & Galvez,2007 ): Provide for internal multidisc iplinary dialogues about language and culture issues. Create financial incentives to promote, develop, and maintain accessibility to qualified health care interpreters. 10 TABLE 3: RECRUIT, PROMOTE, AND SUPPORT A DIVERSE GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP, AND WORKFORCE Standard 3 Recruit, promote, and support a culturally and linguistically diverse g overnance, leadership, and w orkforce that are responsive to the population in the service area. Purpose The purpose of recruiting, promoting, and supporting a diverse go vernance, leadership, and workforce are: To create an environment in which culturally diverse individuals feel welcomed and valued To promote trust and engagement with the communities and populations served To infuse multicultural perspectives into planning, design, and implementation of CLAS To ensure diverse viewpoints are represented in governance decisions To increase knowledge and experience related to culture and language among staff Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implement ation strategies for the recruitment, promotion, and support of a diverse governance, leadership, and workforce: Recruitment Advertise job opportunities in targeted foreign language and minority health professional associations' job boards, publications, and other media ( e.g. social media networks, professional organizations' email Listservs, etc.), and post information in multiple languages (QSource, 2005). Develop relationships with local schools, training programs, and faith - based organizations to expa nd recruitment base (QSource, 2005). Recruit at minority health fairs (QSource, 2005) . Collaborate with businesses, public school systems, and other stakeholders to build potential workforce capacities and recruit diverse staff. In particular, linkages be tween academic and service settings can help identify potential recruits already in the educational \"pipeline\" and provide them with additional academic support and resources necessary to meet job requirements (The Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce, 2004). Assess the language and communication proficiency of staff to determine fluency and appropriateness for serving as interpreters. Promotion and Support The Joint Commission's Advancing Effective Communication, Cultural Compete nce, and Patient - and Family -Centered Care : A Roadmap for Hospitals (2010) provides the following implementation strategies for the promotion and support of a diverse governance, leadership, and workforce: Create a work environment that respects and accomm odates the cultural diversity of the local workforce. Develop, maintain, and promote continuing education and career development opportunities so all staff members may progress within the organization. 11 Cultivate relationships with organizations and instit utions that offer health and human service career training to establish volunteer, work - study, and internship programs. Other strategies for promoting and supporting a diverse governance, leadership, and workforce include (HHS OMH, 2001): Promote mentorin g oppo rtunities. Conduct regular, explicit assessments of hiring and retention data, current workforce demographics, promotion demographics, and community demographics. Monitor work assignments and hire sufficient personnel to ensure a manageable and appro priate workload for bilingual/bicultural staff members. Use nonclinical support staff in cultural broker positions only after providing sufficient training and recognition (e.g., compensation, job title, or description). Promote diverse staff members into administrative or managerial positions where their cultural and linguistic capabilities can make unique contributions to planning, policy, and decision -making. Foster an environment in which differences are respected and that is responsive to the challenge s a culturally and linguistically diverse staff brings into the workplace. 12 Table 4: EDUCATE AND TRAIN GOVERANCE, LEADERSHIP, AND WORKFORCE IN CLAS Standard 4 Educate and train governance, leadership, and workforce in culturally and linguistically appro priate policies and practices on an ongoing basis. Purpose The purpose of educating and training governance, leadership, and workforce in CLAS are: To prepare and support a workforce that demonstrates the attitudes, knowledge, and skills necessary to work effectively with diverse populations To increase the capacity of staff to provide services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate To assess the progress of staff in developing cultural, linguistic, and health literacy competency To foster an individual's right to respect and nondiscrimination by developing and implementing education and training programs that address the impact of culture on health and health care. Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implementation strateg ies for educating and training governance, leadership, and workforce on CLAS: Engage staff in dialogues about meeting the needs of diverse populations (Wilson -Stronks & Galvez, 2007). Provide ongoing in -service training on ways to meet the unique needs of the population, including regular in -services on how and when to access language services for individuals with limited English proficiency (Wilson - Stronks & Galvez, 2007). Take advantage of internal and external resources available to educate governance, l eadership, and workforce on cultural beliefs they may encounter (Wilson -Stronks & Galvez, 2007). Allocate resources to train current staff in cultural competency or as medi cal interpreters if they speak a second language, have completed language assessment s, and show an interest in interpretation (QSource, 2005). Incorporate cultural competency a nd CLAS into staff evaluations (QSource, 2005). Provide opportunities for CLAS training that include regular in -services, brown -bag lunch series, orientation materi als for new staff, and annual update meetings (QSource, 2005). Encourage staff to volunteer in the community and to learn about community members and other cultures (QSource, 2005), and work with community leaders and cultural brokers to create opportunities for such interactions. Evaluate educatio n and training (see Standard 10). Take advantage of live and Web-based health disparities and cultural competency continuing education programs for clinicians and practitioners (Like, 2011) 13 Table 5: OFFER C OMMUNICATION AND LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Standard 5 Offer language assistance to individuals who have limited English proficiency and/or other communication needs, at no cost to them, to facilitate timely access to all health care and services. Purpose The pu rposes of offering communication and language assistance are: To ensure that individuals with limited English proficiency and/or other communication needs have equitable access to health services To help individuals understand their care and service opti ons and participate in decisions regarding their health and health care To increase individuals' satisfaction and adherence to care and services To improve patient safety and reduce medical error related to miscommunication To help organizations comply with requirements such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and other relevant federal, state, and local requirements to which they may need to adhere Strategies for Implementation The following are po ssible implementation strategies for offering communication and language assistance: Ensure that staff is fully aware of, and trained in, the use of language assistance services, policies, and procedures (see Standard 4) (HHS OMH, 2005). Develop processe s for identifying the language(s) an individual speaks (e.g., language identification flash cards or \"I speak\" cards) and for adding this information to that person's health record (QSource, 2005). Use qualified and trained interpreters to facilitate comm unication (Wilson - Stronks & Galvez, 2007), including ensuring the quality of the language skills of self- reported bilingual staff who use their non -English language skills during patient encounters (Regenstein, Andres, & Wynia, in press). Establish contracts with interpreter services for in -person, over -the-phone, and video remote interpreting (HHS OMH, 2005). Use cultural brokers when an individual's cultural beliefs impact care communication (Wilson -Stronks & Galvez, 2007). Provide resources onsite to facilitate communication for individuals who experience impairment due to a changing medical condition or status (e.g., augmentative and alternative communication resources or auxiliary aids and services) as noted in Advancing Effective Communication, Cult ural Competence, and Patient - and Family -Centered Care: A Roadmap for Hospitals (The Joint Commission, 2010) . 14 Table 6: INFORM INDIVIDUALS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Standard Inform all individuals of the availability of language assis tance services clearly and in their preferred language, verbally and in writing. Purpose The purposes of informing individuals of the availability of language assistance are: To inform individuals with limited English proficiency, in their preferred langu age, that language services are readily available at no cost to them To facilitate access to language services To help organizations comply with requirements such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and other relevant federal, state, and local requirements to which they may need to adhere. Strategies for Implementation The follow ing are possible implementation strategies for informing individuals of the availability of language assistance: The HHS Offi ce of Minority Health's A Patient -Centered Guide to Implementing Language Access Services in Healthcare Organization (2005) identified the following strategies to effectively inform individuals of the availability of language assistance: Determine the con tent and language of notices Decide how to communicate or provide notice to individuals Decide where to provide notice to individuals about the availability of assistance In determining the content and languages of the notices, organizations should conside r the following: Notification should describe what communication and language assistance is available, in what languages the assistance is available, and to whom they are available. It should clearly state that communication and language assistance is prov ided by the organization free of charge to individuals (HHS OMH, 2005). Notification should be easy to understand at a low literacy level (HHS OMH, 2005). In deciding how to communicate or provide notice to individuals about the availability of language services, organizations should consider the following: Signage, Materials, and Multimedia: Organizations should reflect the languages regularly encountered in the service area in their signs, materials, and multimedia resources (Berger, 2005; HHS OCR, 200 3). For those who may not be literate, information can be conveyed orally or through signage using symbols or pictures (HHS OMH, 2005; Kashiwagi, 2004). Cultural Mediation: Another method for promoting quality communication is through the development of a cultural mediation program. A c ultural mediator can act as a liaison between the culture of the organization and the culture of the individual. An additional strategy for notifying individuals of language services through mediation is by developing a healt h promotion program (e.g. community health workers and p romotores de salud) that includes bilingual staff who train community members to share health and resource information with other community members (HHS OMH, 2005; Youdelman & Perkins,2005) Community Outreach: Providing notification throughout the community is also important for reaching those who may be unaware of the organization 15 or what services the organization may provide. In accordance with Standard 13, consider sending notification through loca l health departments, community -based organizations, faith -based organizations, schools, or any other stakeholders who would benefit from having information on health services (HHS OCR, 2003; HHS OMH, 2005). Initial Point of Contact: It is recommended that organizations standardize procedures for staff members who serve as the initial point of contact for individuals , whether that is by telephone or in person. It may be appropriate to provide staff with a script to ensure that they inform individuals of the availability of language assistance and to inquire whether they will need to utilize any of the available services. Multilingual phone trees and voice mail should also be used to inform individuals of the available language assistance service and how to access them (HHS OCR, 2003; HHS OMH, 2005). Non -English Media: Organizations should publicize availability of language assistance services in local foreign language media, such as ethnic radio, newspapers, and television (HHS OMH, 2005; Youdelman et al., 2 007). In deciding where to provide notice to individuals about the availability of language services, organizations should consider the following: Points of entry or intake, including: o Registration desks o Front desks o Waiting rooms o Financial screening rooms , where individuals may need to discuss and resolve billing issues o Pharmacy reception, where individuals may pick up prescriptions (HHS OMH, 2005; Kashiwagi, 2004). Areas where clinical work is performed, such as triage and medical exam rooms (HHS OMH, 2005). 16 Table 7: ENSURE THE COMPETENCE OF INDIVIDUALS PROVIDING LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Standard 7 Ensure the competence of individuals providing language assistance, recognizing that the use of untrained individuals and/or minors as interpreters should be avoided Purpose The purposes of ensuring the competence of individuals providing language assistance are: To provide accurate and effective communication between individuals and providers To reduce misunderstanding, dissatisfaction, omission of vital information, misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatment, and patient safety issues due to reliance on staff or individuals that lack interpreter training To empower individuals to negotiate and advocate, on their own behalf, for important services via effectiv e and accurate communication with health and health care staff To help organizations comply with requirements such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and other relevant federal, state, and local requirements to which they may need to adhere Strategies for Implementation Depending upon an organization's size, scope, and mission, its language assistance strategies will differ. Organizations may opt to provide interpretation services through in -person in terpreters and bilingual staff and providers or through technological or electronic means, including telephonic or video remote interpreting. Translation may be conducted primarily internally or may be contracted to external organizations. The following are possible implementations strategies for ensuring the competence of individuals providing language assistance: Assess the individual's language ability. There exist many options for testing an individual's ability to communicate in a foreign language. The following table summarizes two of the leading language proficiency scales, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language scale (ACT FL) and the Interagency L anguage Roundtable (ILR) scale (LinguaLinks Library, 1999): ILR Scale ACTFL Scale Definition 5 Native Able to speak like an educated native speaker 4+ 4 Distinguished Able to speak with a great deal of fluency, grammatical accuracy, precision of vocabulary and idiomaticity 3+ 3 Superior Able to speak the language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations 2+ Advanced Plus Able to satisfy most work requirements and show some ability to communicate on concrete topics 17 2 Advanced Able to satisfy routine social demands and limited work requirements 1+ Intermediate - High Able to satisfy most survival needs and limited social demands 1 Intermediate - Mid Intermediate- Low Able to satisfy some survival needs and some limited social demands Able to satisfy basic survival needs and minimum courtesy requirements 0+ Novice -High Able to satisfy immediate needs with learned utterances 0 Novice -Mid Novice -Low 0 Able to operate in only a very limited capacity Unable to function in the spoken language No ability whatsoeve r in the language Assess the individual's ability to provide language assistance. The American Translators Association upholds standards of practice for translation services (n.d.). S imilarly; the National Council on Interpreting in Health Care has issued standards of practice that define expectations of performance and outcomes for health care interpreters (2005). In addition, the Certification Commission for Healthcare Interpreters and the National Board for Certification of Medical Interpreters provide national certification for interpreters. The standards of practice identified by these professional organizations may offer promising practices in the provision of linguistically appropriate services. Keeping these standards at the core of hiring, training , and evaluating individuals will help ensure their competence in providing language assistance. Employ a \"multifaceted model\" of language assistance. Organizations may provide language assistance according to a variety of models, including bilingual staff or dedicated language assistance (e.g., a contract interpreter or video remote interpreting). A combination of models, or a multifaceted model, offers the organization a \"comprehensive and flexible system [for] facilitating communication\" (National Council on Interpreting in Health Care, 2002, p.4). Under a multifaceted model, for example, telephonic interpreting will supplement the language assistance provided by bilingual staff to ensure that at all times, language assistance is being provided by compete nt individuals. 18 Table 8: PROVIDE EASY -TO-UNDERSTAND MATERIALS AND SIGNAGE Standard Provide easy -to-understand print and multimedia materials and signage in the languages commonly used by the populations in the service area. Purpose The purpose of provi ding easy -to-understand materials and signage are: To ensure that readers of other languages and individuals with various health literacy levels are able to access care and services To provide access to health -related information and facilitate comprehensi on of, and adherence to, instructions and health plan requirements To enable all individuals to make informed decisions regarding their health and their care and services options To offer an effective way to communicate with large numbers of people and supplement information provided orally by staff members To help organizations comply with requirements such a s Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and other relevant federal, state, sand local requirements to which they may need to adhere Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implementation strategies for providing easy -to- understand materials and signage: Issue plain language guidance and create documents that demonstrate best practices in clear communication and information design (HHS ODPHP, 2010). Create forms that are easy to fill out, and offer assistance in completing forms (AHRQ, 2010) Consult local librarians to help build an appropriate collection of health materials (HHS ODPHP, 2 010) Train staff to develop and identify easy -to-understand materials, and establish processes for periodically re -evaluating and updating materials (AHRQ, 2010). Formalize processes for translating materials into languages other than English and for evalu ating the quality of these translations (Wilson -Stronks & Galvez, 2007). Develop materials in alternative formats for individuals with communication needs, including those with sensory, developmental, and/or cognitive impairments as noted in Advancing Eff ective Communication, Cultural Competence, and Patient - and Family -Centered Care: A Roadmap for Hospitals (The Joint Commission, 2010) Test materials with target audiences. For example, focus group discussions with members of the target population can ide ntify content in the material that might be embarrassing or offensive, suggest cultural practices that provide more appropriate examples, and assess whether graphics reflect the diversity of the target community. Organizations should consider providing fin ancial compensation or in -kind services to community members who help translate and review materials (HHS OMH, 2001). 19 Table 9: INFUSE CLAS GOALS, POLICIES, AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION'S PLANNING AND OPERATIONS Standard 9 Establish culturally and linguistically appropriate goals, policies, and management accountability, and infuse them throughout the organization's planning and operations Purpose The purposes of infusing CLAS throughout the organization's planning and opera tions are: To make CLAS central to the organization's service, administrative, and supportive functions To integrate CLAS throughout the organization (including the mission) and highlight it s importance through specific goals To link CLAS to other organiz ational activities, including policy, procedures, and decision -making related to outcomes accountability Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implementation strategies for infusing CL AS goals, policies, and management accountability t hroughout the organization's planning and operations: Engage the support of governance and leadership, and encourage the allocation of resources to support the development, implementation, and maintenance of culturally and linguistically appropriate servic es. Encourage governance and leadership to establish education and training requirements relating to culturally and linguistically appropriate services for all individuals in the organization, including themselves. Identify champions within and outside the organization to advocate for CLAS, to emphasize the business case and rationale for CLAS, and encourage full-scale implementation. Hold organizational retreats to identify goals, objectives and timelines to provide culturally and linguistically appropriat e services. Establish accountability mechanisms throughout the organization, including staff evaluations, individuals' satisfaction measures, and quality improvement measures (QSource, 2005). Utilize the data gathered based on Standards 10, 11, and 12 to guide plan development. In accordance with Standard 13, involve the populations in the service are a in the implementation of CLAS through the strategic plan. 20 Table 10: CONDUCT ORGANIZATIONAL ASSESSMENTS Standard 10 Conduct ongoing assessments of the or ganization's CLAS -related activities and integrate CLAS -related measures into measurement and continuous quality improvement activities. Purpose The purposes of conducting organizational assessments are: To assess performance and monitor progress in imple menting the National CLAS Standards. To obtain information about the organization and the people it serves, which can be used to tailor and improve services. To assess the value of CLAS -related activities relative to the fulfillment of governance, leadersh ip, and workforce responsibilities. Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implementation strategies for conducting organizational assessments: Conduct an organizational assessment or a cultural audit using existing cultural and linguist ic competency assessment tools to inventory structural policies, procedures, and practices. These tools can provide guidance to determine whether the core structures and processes (e.g., management, governance, delivery systems, and customer relation funct ions) necessary for providing CLAS are in place. Use results from assessments to identify assets (e.g., bilingual staff members who could be used as interpreters, existing relationships with community -based ethnic organizations), weaknesses (e.g., no tran slated signage or cultural competency training), and opportunities to improve the organization's structural framework and capacity to address cultural and linguistic competence in care (e.g., revise mission statement, recruit people from diverse cultures into policy and management positions). Following the assessment, prepare adequate plans for developing CLAS (see Standard 9). Subsequent ongoing assessment helps organizations to monitor their progress in implementing the enhanced National CLAS Standards a nd to refine their strategic plans. The following are implementation strategies for integrating CLAS -related measures into measurement and continuous quality improvement activities (QSource, 2005): Implement ongoing organizational assessment of CLAS -related activities Provide individuals with CLAS -oriented feedback forms and include self - addressed, stamped envelopes to improve receipt of feedback Conduct focus groups with individuals to monitor progress and identify barriers to full- scale CLAS implemen tation Assess the standard of care provided for various chronic conditions to determine whether services are uniformly provided across cultural groups Add CLAS -related questions to staff orientation materials and yearly reviews Develop a system of revie wing and incorporating feedback and suggestions received and for monitoring their effect on CLAS implementation and outcomes Identify outcome goals, including metrics, regarding cultural and linguistic competency and assess at regular intervals 21 Table 1 1: COLLECT AND MAINTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC DATA Standard 11 Collect and maintain accurate and reliable demographic data to monitor and evaluate the impact of CLAS o n health equity and outcomes and to inform service delivery. Purpose The purposes of collecting a nd maintaining demographic data are: To accurately identify population groups within a service area To monitor individual needs, access, utilization, quality of care, and outcome patterns To ensure equal allocation of organizational resources To improv e service planning to enhance access and coordination of care To assess and improve to what extent health care services are provided equitably Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implementation strategies for collecting and maintai ning demographic data: When? Ask for data early - ideally, during admission or registration Who? Properly trained admissions or reception staff could collect data What will you tell Individuals? Before obtaining information, develop a script to communi cate that: This information is important. It will be used to improve care and services and to prevent discrimination.

Purpose The purposes of conducting assessments of community health assets and needs are: To determine the service assets and needs of the populations in the service areas (needs assessment) To identify all of the services available and not available to the populations in the service areas (resource inventory and gaps analysis) To determine what services to provide and how to implement them, based on the results of the community assessment To ensure that health and health care organizations obtain demographic, cultural, linguistic, and epidemiological baseline data (quantitative and qualitative) and update the data regularly to better understand the popu lations in their service areas Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implementation strategies for assessing community health assets and needs. Partner with other organizations to negotiate a data sharing agreement, which could faci litate the linking of different types of data. Collaborate with other organizations and stakeholders in data collection, analysis, and reporting efforts to increase data reliability and validity. Conduct focus groups with individuals in the community (QS ource, 2005). Review demographic data collected with local health and health care organizations (QSource, 2005). Use multiple sources in the community to collect data, including faith -based organizations, social workers, and managed care organizations (Q Source, 2005). The HHS Administration for Children and Families' Head Start initiative recommends the following Outline for Assessing Community Needs and Resources (HHS Administration for Children and Families, 2008; University of Kansas, n.d.): 1. Describe the makeup and history of the community to provide a context within which to collect data on its current concerns. Comment on the types of information that best describe the community (e.g., demographic, historical, political, civic participation, key leaders, past concerns, geographic, assets) Describe the sources of information used (e.g., public records, local people, Internet, maps, phone book, library, newspaper) Comment on whether there are sufficient resources available to collect this information (e.g., time, personnel, resources) Describe the methods used to collect descriptive information (e.g., public forums, listening sessions, focus groups, interviews, surveys, observation) 24 Assess the quality of the information Describe the strength s and difficulties identified 2. Describe what matters to people in the community, including a description of: Issues that people in the community care about (e.g., safety, education, housing, health) How important these issues are to the community (e.g., perceived importance, consequences for the community) Methods the organization will (did) use to listen to the community (e.g., listening sessions, public forums, interviews, concerns surveys, focus groups) 3. Describe what matters to key stakehold ers, including: Who else cares about the issue (the stakeholders) and what they care about What stakeholders want to know about the situation (e.g., who is affected, how many, what factors contribute to the problem) Prioritized populations and subgroup s to whom stakeholders are targeting benefits Methods used to gather information (e.g., surveys, interviews) 4. (For each identified problem/goal) Describe the evidence indicating whether the problem/goal should be a priority issue, including: The com munity -level indicators related to the issue (e.g., rate of infant deaths or vehicle crashes) How frequently the problem (or related behavior) occurs (e.g., number of youth reporting alcohol use in the past 30 days) How many people are affected by the pr oblem and the severity of its effects How feasible it is to address the issue Possible impact and/or consequences of addressing the problem/goal 5. Describe the barriers and resources for addressing the identified issue(s), including: Barriers or res istance to solving the problem or achieving the goal (e.g., denial or discounting of the problem) and how they can be minimized (e.g., reframing the issue) What resources and assets are available and how the organization can tap into those resources to ad dress the issue Community context or situation that might make it easier or more difficult to address this issue (Based on the assessment) Select and state the priority issue (or issues) to be addressed by the organization. 25 Table 13: PARTNER WITH THE COMMUNITY Standard 13 Partner with the community to design, implement, and evaluate policies, practices, and services to ensure cultural and linguistic appropriateness. Purpose The purpose of partnering with the community is: To provide responsive and appropriate service delivery to a community To ensure that services are informed and guided by community interests, expertise, and needs To increase use of services by engaging individuals and groups in the community in the design and improvement of serv ices to meet their needs and desires To create an organizational culture that leads to more responsive, efficient, and effective services and accountability to the community To empower members of the community in becoming active participants in the health and health care process Strategies for Implementation The following are implementation strategies for partnering with the community: Partner with local culturally diverse media to promote better understanding of available care and services and of ap propriate routes for accessing services among all community members (Wilson -Stronks & Galvez, 2007). Build coalitions with community partners to increase reach and impact in identifying and creating solutions. For example: Work on joint steering committe es and coalitions. Sponsor or participate in health fairs, cultural festivals, and celebrations. Offer education and training opportunities. Convene town hall meetings, hold community forums, and/or conduct focus groups (Prevention by Design, 2006). Develop opportunities for capacity building initiatives, action research, involvement in service development, and other activities to empower the community (Equality and Human Rights Commission, 2009). Collaborate to reach more people, to share informatio n and learn, and to improve services. Work with partners to advertise job openings, identify interpreting resources, and organize health promotion activities. Successful partnerships benefit all. In addition, the following professionals and volunteers ma y facilitate communication between an organization and the community it serves: Cultural brokers are individuals from the community who can serve as a bridge between an organization and people of different cultural backgrounds. Cultural brokers should be familiar with the health system and with the community in which they live and/or from where they originated. 26 They can become a valuable source of cultural information and serve as mediators in conflicts and as agents for change (Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 2009). Promotores de salud/community health workers are volunteer community members and paid front -line public health workers who are trusted members of the community served or have an unusually close understanding of that community. They generally share the ethnicity, language, socio -economic status, and life experiences of the community members. These social attributes and trusting relationships enable community health workers to serve as liaisons, links, or intermediaries between health and social services and the community to facilitate access to and enrollment in services and improve the quality and cultural competency of services (HHS OMH, 2011). 27 Table 14: CREATE CONFLICT AND GRIEVANCE RESOLUTION PROCESSES Standard 14 Create confl ict and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and linguistically appropriate to identify, prevent, and resolve conflicts or complaints. Purpose The purposes of creating conflict and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and lingu istically appropriate are: To facilitate open and transparent two -way communication and feedback mechanisms between individuals and organizations To anticipate, identify, and respond to cross -cultural needs To meet federal and/or state level regulation s that address topics such as grievance procedures, the use of ombudspersons, and discrimination policies and procedures Strategies for Implementation The following are possible implementation strategies for creating conflict and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and linguistically appropriate: Provide cross -cultural communication training, including how to work with an interpreter, and conflict resolution training to staff who handle conflicts, complaints, and feed back Provide notice in signage, translated materials, and other media about the right of each individual to provide feedback, including the right to file a complaint or grievance Develop a clear process to address instances of conflict and grievance that includes follow -up and ensures that the individual is contacted with a resolution and next steps (QSource, 2005) Obtain feedback via focus groups, community council or town hall meetings, meetings with community leaders, suggestion and comment systems, open hou ses, and/or liste ning sessions Hire patient advocates or ombudspersons (QSource, 2005). Include oversight of conflict and grievance resolution processes to ensure their cultural and linguistic appropriateness as part of the organization's overall quality assurance program 28 Table 15: COMMUNICATE THE ORGANIZATION'S PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING AND SUSTAINING CLAS Standard 15 Communicate the organization's progress in implementing and sustaining CLAS to all stakeholders, constituents, and the general public. Purpose The purp oses of communicating the organization's progress in implementing and sustaining CLAS to all stakeholders, constituents, and the general public are: To convey information to intended audiences about efforts and accomplishments in meeting the National CLA S Standards To learn from other organizations about new ideas and successful approaches to implementing the National CLAS Standards To build and sustain communication on CLAS priorities and foster trust between the community and the service setting To m eet community benefits and other reporting requirements, including accountability for meeting health care objectives in addressing the needs of diverse individuals or groups Strategies for Implementation The following are implementation strategies for b eing accountable to the community by presenting to the public progress in implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Items on which to report may include (HHS OMH, 2001): Demographic data about the populations Utilization and availability statistics related to interpreters and translated materials Level of staff training in cultural and linguistic competency CLAS -related expenditures and cost- benefit data Assessment results based on activities suggested from Standard 10, communi ty data collected in accordance with Standard 12, and the number of complaints and their resolution as co llected pursuant to Standard 14. Results from performance measures, satisfaction ratings, quality improvement and clinical outcome data analyses, and c ost-effectiveness analyses Strategies for presenting CLAS -related progress include: Draft and distribute materials that demonstrate efforts to be culturally and linguistically responsive (QSource, 2005). The materials should be easy to understand and in accordance with Standard 8 Partner with community organizations to lead discussions about the services provided and progress made (QSour ce, 2005); see also Standard 13 Create advisory boards to consult with community partners on issues affecting diverse populations and how best to serve and reach them (National Consensus Panel on Emergency Preparedness and Cultural Diversity, 2011). Engage community -based workers to help craft and deliver messages and implications of data. Community outreach that is cult urally and linguistically tailored and provided by trusted messengers is central to ensuring 29 messages are received, understood, and adhered to by local members of the community. Community -based workers are seen as trusted sources of health information and can help with reaching and educating communities (National Consensus Panel on Emergency Preparednes s and Cultural Diversity, 2011) Convene educational forums. Agencies may consider partnering with well- respected and trusted community -based organizations t o host regional educational forums, inviting local community representatives to participate. Educational forums are intended to provide education, materials, and information on topics of most concern to communities \u2014 whether regarding public health, public safety, or primary care. At the same time, they include feedback sessions, where community partners and representatives can assess and evaluate the validity and application of recommendations, resources, and materials to their communities' cultural, social, and economic circumstances (National Consensus Panel on Emergency Preparedness and Cultural Diversity, 2011) https://www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov/index.asp . 30 Bibliography, Glos sary and Glossary Bibliography The Bibliography is included for your reference and relates to the citations found throughout The Blueprint .

Retrieved from The Commonwealth Fund Acculturation:1 The exchange of cultural features that results when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous firsthand contact; the original cultural patterns of either or both groups may be altered, but the gro ups remain distinct. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Resources:2 Systems or devices that attempt to temporarily or permanently compensate for and facilitate the impairment and disability of individuals with severe expressive or language c omprehension disorders. AAC may be required for individuals demonstrating impairments in gestural, spoken, and/or written modalities. Auxiliary Aids and Services : 3 Devices or services that enable effective communication for people with disabilities. Exam ples include qualified interpreters, note takers, transcription services, written materials, assistive listening devices and systems, telephone communication devices for deaf persons, telephone handset amplifiers, video interpretive services, and open and closed captioning. Bilingual : 4 A term describing a person who has some degree of proficiency in two languages. A high level of bilingualism is the most basic of the qualifications of a competent interpreter but, by itself, does not ensure the ability to interpret. Bisexual: 5 One whose sexual or romantic attractions and behaviors are directed at members of both sexes to a significant degree. Caregiver :6 An individual who assists another person who because of physical disability, chronic illness, or cognit ive impairment is unable to perform certain activities on his/her own. So -called informal care can be offered by family members or friends, often in a home setting. Paid or volunteer professional care, or so -called formal care, can be obtained at home, in the community, or from institutions such as nursing facilities or government institutions. Certification:7 A process by which a certifying body (usually a governmental or professional organization) attests to an individual's qualifications to provide a p articular service. Certification calls for formal assessment using an instrument that has been tested for validity and reliability so that the certifying body can be confident that the individuals it certifies have the qualifications needed to do the job. Certified Interpreter:8 An interpreter who is certified as competent by a professional organization or government entity through rigorous testing based on appropriate and consistent criteria. Interpreters who have had limited training \u2014 or have only taken a screening test administered by an employing health, interpreter, or referral agency \u2014 are not considered certified. Communication Needs :9 Difficulty with some aspects of communicating. This difficulty may be minor and temporary or more complex and long term. The term \"needs\" refers both to the individual's needs and to what society can do to support the individual by examining the individual and the environments in which he/she interacts. Requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act communicatio n needs extend beyond spoken language capability to include barriers imposed by disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and vision.10 Community Health Assessment/Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA):11 Community health assessment is a systematic exa mination of the health status indicators for a given population that is used to identify key problems and assets in a community. The ultimate goal of a community health assessment is to develop strategies to address the community's health needs and identif ied issues. Community Needs Assessment :12 A community needs assessment identifies the strengths and resources available in the community to meet its needs. The assessment focuses on the capabilities of the community, including its citizens, agencies, and organizations. It provides a framework for developing and identifying services and solutions and building communities that support and nurture health and wellness. 35 A community needs assessment may be limited to a compilation of demographic data from censu s records, results of surveys conducted by others, and informal feedback from community partners. Alternatively, assessments may be expanded to include focus group discussions, town meetings, interviews with stakeholders and telephone or mailed surveys to partnership members and the community. Continuous Quality Improvement :13 The complete process of identifying, describing, and analyzing strengths and problems and then testing, implementing, learning from, and revising solutions. It relies on an organizat ional and/or system culture that is proactive and supports continuous learning. Continuous quality improvement is firmly grounded in the overall mission, vision, and values of the agency/system. Perhaps most important, it is dependent upon the active inclu sion and participation of staff at all levels of the agency/system \u2014 children, youth, families, and stakeholders \u2014 throughout the process. CLAS: See \"Culturally CLAS Standards.\" Cultural Broker : 14 Individuals from the community who serve as bridges between an organization and people of different cultural backgrounds. Cultural and Linguistic Competency: 15 The capacity for individuals and organizations to work and communicate effecti vely in cross -cultural situations through the adoption and implementation of strategies to ensure appropriate awareness, attitudes, and actions and through the use of policies, structures, practices, procedures, and dedicated resources that support this ca pacity. Cultural Competency: A developmental process in which individuals or institutions achieve increasing levels of awareness, knowledge, and skills along a cultural competence continuum. Cultural competence involves valuing diversity, conducting self- assessments, avoiding stereotypes, managing the dynamics of difference, acquiring and institutionalizing cultural knowledge, and adapting to diversity and cultural contexts in communities. Linguistic Competency: The capacity of individuals or institutio ns to communicate effectively at every point of contact. Effective communication includes the ability to convey information \u2014 both written and oral \u2014 in a manner that is easily understood by diverse groups, including persons of limited English proficiency, those who have low literacy skills or who are not literate, those having low health literacy, those with disabilities, and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS): 16 Services that are respectful o f and responsive to individual cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy levels, and communication needs and employed by all members of an organization (regardless of size) at every point of contact. Culture: 17, 18 The in tegrated pattern of thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institutions associated, wholly or partially, with racial, ethnic, or linguistic groups as well as religious, spiritual, biological, geographical, or sociological characte ristics. Culture is dynamic in nature, and individuals may identify with multiple cultures over the course of their lifetimes. Elements of culture include, but are not limited to, the following: Age Cognitive ability or limitations Country of origin 36 Degree of acculturation Educational level attained Environment and surroundings Family and household composition Gender identity Generation Health practices, including use of traditional healer techniques such as Reiki and acupuncture Linguistic cha racteristics, including language(s) spoken, written, or signed; dialects or regional variants; literacy levels; and other related communication needs. Military affiliation Occupational groups Perceptions of family and community Perceptions of health an d well -being and related practices Perceptions/beliefs regarding diet and nutrition Physical ability or limitations Political beliefs Racial and ethnic groups include \u2014 but are not limited to \u2014 those defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Religious and sp iritual characteristics, including beliefs, practices, and support systems related to how an individual finds and defines meaning in his/her life. Residence (i.e., urban, rural, or suburban) Sex Sexual orientation Socioeconomic status Determinants of Health:19 Determinants of health care factors that influence health status and determine health differentials or health inequalities. They are many and varied and include, for example, natural biological factors, such as age, gender, and ethnicity; behavi or and lifestyles, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical exercise; the physical and social environment, including housing quality, the workplace, and the wider urban and rural environment; and access to health care. Effective Communicat ion: 20 The successful joint establishment of meaning wherein patients and health care providers exchange information, enabling patients to participate actively in their care from admission through discharge and ensuring that the responsibilities of both p atients and providers are understood. To be truly effective, communication requires a two -way process (expressive and receptive) in which messages are negotiated until the information is correctly understood by both parties. Successful communication takes place only when providers understand and integrate the information gleaned from patients and when patients comprehend accurate, timely, complete, and unambiguous messages from providers in a way that enables them to participate responsibly in their care. Ethnicity: 21 The Office of Management and Budget requires federal agencies to use a minimum of two ethnicities: Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino. Hispanic origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. Gay: 22 An attraction and/or behavior focused exclusively or mainly on members o f the same sex or gender identity; a personal or social identity based on one's same -sex attractions and membership in a sexual -minority community. 37 Gender Expression:23 Characteristics in appearance, personality, and behavior culturally defined as masculine or feminine. Gender Identity :24 One's basic sense of being a man, woman, or other gender. Health:25, 26, 27 Health encompasses many aspects, including physical, mental, social, and spiritual well- being. The World Health Organization also notes that h ealth is \"not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Health Care:28 According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, health care refers to the care, services, or supplies related to the health of an individual, includin g but not limited to, the following: Preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance, or palliative care, and counseling, service, assessment, or a procedure with respect to the physical or mental condition, or functional status, of an i ndividual or that affects the structure or function of the body; and Sale or dispensing of a drug, device, equipment, or other item in accordance with a prescription. Health Care Disparities : 29 Differences in the receipt of, experiences with, and quali ty of health care that are not due to access -related factors or clinical needs, preferences, or appropriateness of intervention. Health Care Organization:30 Any public or private institution involved in any aspect of delivering health care services. Heal th Disparity :31 A particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health ba sed on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socio -economic disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. Health Equity :32, 33 Attainment of the highest level of health for all people. Achieving health equity requires valuing everyone equally, with focused and ongoing societal efforts to address avoidable inequalities, historical and c ontemporary injustices, and the elimination of hea lth and health care disparities. Health Inequality : 34 Difference in health status or in the distribution of health determinants among different population groups. For example, differences in mobility betwe en elderly people and younger populations or differences in mortality rates among people from different social classes. It is important to distinguish between a health inequality and a health inequity. Some health inequalities are attributable to biological variations or free choice, while others are attributable to the external environment and conditions mainly outside the control of the individuals concerned. In the first case, it may be impossible or ethically or ideologically unacceptable to change the health determinants, and so the resultant health inequality is unavoidable. In the second case, the uneven distribution may be unnecessary and avoidable as well as unjust and unfair so that the resulting health inequalities also lead to an inequity in health. Health Inequities : 35 Differences in health status or in the distribution of health determinants among different population groups. Health Literacy: 36 The degree to which an individual has the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Health Numeracy:37 The degree to which an individual has the capacity to access, process, interpret, communicate, and act on numerical, quantitative, graphical, biostatistical, and pr obabilistic health information needed to make effective health decisions. 38 Health Organization:38 Any public or private institution addressing individual or community health and well- being. Individuals and Groups :39 Patients, clients, or consumers, inclu ding accompanying family members, guardians, or companions, seeking physical, mental, or other health -related services. Interpreter :40 An individual who renders a message spoken or signed in one language into a second language and who abides by a code of professional ethics. Types of Interpreters: Ad Hoc Interpreter:41 An untrained individual who is called upon to interpret, such as a family member interpreting for his/her parents, a bilingual staff member pulled away from other duties to interpret, or a self -declared bilingual in a hospital waiting room who volunteers to interpret. Also called a chance interpreter or lay interpreter. Bilingual Provider: 42 An individual with proficiency in more than one language, enabling the person to provide service s directly to limited English proficient patients in their non -English language. Bilingual Worker/Employee:43 An employee who is a proficient speaker of two languages and who may provide direct services in both languages but who, without additional train ing, is not qualified to serve as an interpreter. Dual -Role Interpreter :44 A bilingual employee in health care who has been tested for language skills and trained as a medical interpreter and who assumes the task of part -time medical interpreting willin gly. Qualified Interpreter :45 An individual who has been assessed for professional skills, demonstrates a high level of proficiency in at least two languages, and has the appropriate training and experience to interpret with skill and accuracy while adhe ring to the National Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice published by the National Council on Interpreting in Health Care. Types of Interpreting: Community Interpreting: 47 Interpreting that takes place in the course of communication in the local c ommunity among speakers of different languages. The community interpreter may or may not be a trained interpreter. Community settings include schools, social service agencies, clinics, legal services, and businesses that serve a diverse clientele. Consec utive Interpreting :48 A highly complex cognitive activity that requires the interpreter to listen, analyze, comprehend, convert, edit, and reproduce the original message, after the speaker or signer pauses, in a specific social context. Consecutive interpr etation is likely to take longer than simultaneous, because the interpreter does not interpret while the speaker or signer is speaking or signing. Face -to-Face Interpreting : 49 Interpreting in which the interpreter is present, in person, with both, or at least one, of the persons for whom interpreting is provided. 39 First -Person Interpreting:50 The promotion by the interpreter of direct communication between the principal parties in the interaction through the use of direct utterances of each of the speakers, as though the interpreter were the voice of the person speaking, albeit in the language of the listener. For example, if the patient says \"My stomach hurts,\" the interpreter says (in the second language), \"My stomach hurts,\" not \"She says her stomach h urts.\" Health Care Interpreting:51 Interpreting that takes place in health care settings of any sort, including doctors' offices, clinics, hospitals, home health visits, mental health clinics, and public health presentations. Typically, the setting is an interview between a health care provider (doctor, nurse, lab technician) and a patient (or the patient and one or more family members). Simultaneous Interpretation:52 Highly complex cognitive activity that requires the interpreter to listen, analyze, com prehend, convert, edit, and reproduce in real time a speaker or signer's message while the speaker or signer continues to speak or sign, in a specific social context. Telephone or Telephonic Interpreting :53 Interpreting carried out remotely, with the int erpreter connected by telephone to the principal parties, typically provided through a speakerphone or headsets. In health care settings, the principal parties, e.g., doctor and patient, are normally in the same room, but telephone interpreting can be used to serve individuals who are also connected to each other only by telephone. Video Remote Interpreting (VRI):54 An interpreting service that uses video conference technology over dedicated lines or wireless technology offering a high -speed, wide -bandwi dth video connection that delivers high -quality video images. To ensure that VRI is effective, the Department of Justice has established performance standards for VRI and requires training for users of the technology and other individuals involved with its use so that they may quickly and efficiently set up and operate the VRI system. Language : 55 While the Office of Budget and Management has not established a list of language categories, the collection of language data has been pivotal in determining whe ther there has been discrimination by \"national origin\" under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and federal policies state that \"reasonable steps\" need to be taken so that persons of limited English proficiency can have \"meaningful access\" to programs or activities without charge for language services. Additionally, in 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services released its National Standards on Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services, which encourages all health care organizations and individual providers \"to make their practices more culturally and linguistically accessible,\" including the use of race, ethnicity, and language data in program assessments and incorporation of these data into health records and organizational managem ent systems. Language Assistance Services : 56 Mechanisms used to facilitate communication with individuals who do not speak English, those who have limited English proficiency, and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. These services can include in -person interpreters, bilingual staff, or remote interpreting systems such as telephone or video interpreting. Language services also refer to processes in place to provide translation of written materials or signage, sign language, or braille materials. Languag e Concordance : 57 Occurs when the individual seeking services or care and the provider of said services are able to speak the same primary language well. 40 Lesbian:58 A woman who self -identifies as having an emotional, sexual, and/or relational attraction to other women. Limited English Proficiency :59, 60 A concept referring to a level of English proficiency that is insufficient to ensure equal access to public services without language assistance with respect to a particular type of service, benefit, or encounter. Meaningful Access :61 Recipients of federal financial assistance are required to take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by limited English proficient (LEP) persons. The HHS Office of Civil Rights Guid ance explains that the obligation to provide meaningful access is fact dependent and starts with an individualized assessment that balances four factors: (1) the number or proportion of LEP persons eligible to be served or likely to be encountered by the p rogram or grantee; (2) the frequency with which LEP individuals come into contact with the program; (3) the nature and importance of the program, activity, or service provided by the recipient to its beneficiaries; and (4) the resources available to the grantee/recipient and the costs of interpretation/translation services. There is no one -size-fits-all solution for Title VI compliance with respect to LEP persons, and what constitutes \"reasonable steps\" for large providers may not be reasonable where small providers are concerned. National CLAS Standards: 62 The framework for culturally and linguistically appropriate services issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health. The National CLAS Standards are intended to in form, guide, and facilitate practices related to culturally and linguistically appropriate health service delivery. Numeracy :63 A part of literacy that implies a facility with basic probability and numerical concepts. Plain Language :64 A strategy for mak ing written and oral information easier to understand; communication that users can understand the first time they read or hear it. A plain language document is one in which people can find what they need, understand what they find, and act appropriately o n that understanding. Primary Language :65 The language that a limited English proficient individual identifies as the one that he/she uses to communicate effectively and would prefer to use to communicate with service providers. Race : 66 The Department of Health and Human Services and its agencies follow the racial categories developed by the Office of Management and Budget and used by the U.S. census. These categories generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and are not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as \"American Indian and White.\" People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanis h may be of any race. Racial categories can include national origin or sociocultural groups. Information on race is required for many federal programs and is important for making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights. States use these data to me et legislative redistricting principles. Race data also are used to promote equal employment opportunities and to assess environmental risks and racial disparities in health . Reasonable Steps: For guidance on how to determine whether the steps taken to pr ovide language access are \"reasonable,\" providers or organizations should refer to the Department of Health and Human Services' Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affect ing Limited English Proficient Persons. Sex: 67 The Department of Health and Human Services and its agencies follow the sex categories developed by the Office of Management and Budget and used by the U.S. census. The census operationalizes sex as \"male\" o r \"female.\" The census question regarding sex remains unchanged from the previous census. Information on the sex of individuals is one of the few items obtained in the original 1790 census and in every census since. 41 It is important to note that sex differ s from the concepts of gender, gender identity, and gender expression. Sexual Identity :68 Encompasses attraction, behavior, and identity. Most researchers studying sexual orientation have defined it operationally in terms of one or more of the following components. Defined in terms of behavior, sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of sexual or romantic activity with men, women, or both sexes. Defined in terms of attraction (or desire), it denotes an enduring pattern of experiencing sexual or r omantic feelings for men, women, or both sexes. Identity encompasses both personal identity and social identity. Defined in terms of personal identity, sexual orientation refers to a conception of the self -based on one's enduring pattern of sexual and roma ntic attractions and behaviors toward men, women, or both sexes. Defined in terms of social (or collective) identity, it refers to a sense of membership in a social group based on a shared sexual orientation and a linkage of one's self- esteem to that group . Social Determinants of Health:69 The conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, including the health system. Staff :70 The group of individuals formally affiliated with an institution, including paid employees, contractors, and unpa id volunteers. Threshold Population:71 A threshold population is a linguistic group that makes up 15% or more of a program's clients and who share a common language other than English as a primary language. For example, if program XYZ serves 200 clients and at least 30 of them speak Haitian -Creole as a primary language, that group would be considered a threshold population for that program, and Haitian -Creole would be considered a threshold language. Some programs may target multiple groups and, therefore , may have multiple threshold populations and threshold languages; some programs may have no threshold populations. Traditional Healer Services: 72 The application of knowledge, skills, and practices based on the experiences indigenous to different cultur es. These services are directed towards the maintenance of health, as well as the prevention, diagnosis, and improvement of physical and mental illness. Examples of traditional healers include herbalists, faith healers, and practitioners of Chinese or Ayur vedic medicine. In contrast, allopathic service providers are those trained in western medicine. Transgender : 73 A person whose gender identity and/or expression is different from that typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. Translation:74 The conversion of a written text into a corresponding written text in a different language. Translator :75 A person who translates written texts. TTY:76 TTY stands for text telephone. It is also sometimes called a TDD, or telecommunication device for the deaf. TTY is the more widely accepted term, however, as TTYs are used by many people, not just people who are deaf. Vital Documents : 77 For the purposes of ensuring language access, vital documents are written documents that are \"vital\" to programs or limited English proficient populations. Examples include signs, directions, and notices about the availability of interpreter services, client intake forms, and legal documents (e.g., consent forms, notices of client rights and responsibilities, privacy n otices, complaint forms, grievance policies). 42 Appendix B: Glossary Bibliography 1 Kottak, C.
