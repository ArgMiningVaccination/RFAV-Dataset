Accreditation The college gained admission to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in November 1967. It has also been accorded full institutional membership in the American Association of Community Colleges. Georgia Perimeter College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Scho ols (1866 Southern Lane, Decat ur, Georgia 30033- 4097; telephone number (404) 679-4501) to award Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, and Associate of Applied Science degrees. History Founded by the citizens of DeKalb County and the DeKalb Board of Education under the Junior College Act of 1958, Georgia Perimeter College opened as DeKalb College with its Clarkston Campus in 1964. It was the only public junior college in the state supported and controlled by a local board of education. It was established in order that any resident of the DeKalb School District who held a high school diploma or its equivalent and who desired to seek two years of postsecondary education might have the opportunity to do so. The college's Decatur (formerly kn own as South) Campus opened in 1972. Also beginning in 1972, students enrolled in DeKalb Area Technical School were able to enroll dually in vocational and collegiate programs, and the college was designated DeKalb Community College. As growth continued both for DeKalb County and the college, the Dunwoody (formerly North) Campus was added and began operation in 1979. DeKalb College pioneered in Georgia in open-door admissions, personalized approaches to instruction, and community-related curricula and activities. In 1985, DeKalb Vocational-Tech nical School was placed under th e governance of a new statewide board for vocational-technical schools with daily ope rations remaining under the control of the DeKalb County School System. Students enrolled in specifi c Associate in Applied Science degree programs continued to enroll dually in the college and techni cal school, which is now known as DeKalb Technical College. In 1986, when DeKalb County relinquished its support, the college was accepted by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgi a as the thirty-fourth member institution. 8 2006-2008 During spring 1993, Georgia Perimeter College in cooperation with Clayto n State College, DeKalb Technical College, and Rockdale County Public Schools formed the Rockdale Center for Higher Education, which offers cred it and non-credit courses. In November 1997, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved changing the name of the college from DeKalb College to Georgi a Perimeter College to reflect its expanding mission and its service throughout the metro A tlanta area. As part of changing the college's name, the names of the campuses were changed to identify the cities in which they are located. In December 2001, Georgia Perimeter College's Lawrenceville Campus, along with its partners at the Gwinnett University Center, relocated from its humble beginnings at the MacCleod Industrial Park on Sugarloaf Parkway to its current 177-acre campus at 1000 University Center Lane. The college's academic offerings correspond with curricular content and requirements of the University System of Georgia. Georgia Perimeter College also serves as a community cultural center for the performing arts in music and drama. Curricula feature transfer, learning support, career, continuing and distance education programs as well as joint educational offerings with other system institutions and state- supported technical institutes. Associate degrees ar e awarded to graduates who complete the two-year transfer and career programs. Campuses Georgia Perimeter College has five campus locations. The Clarkston Campus (formerly Central Campus), at 555 North Indian Creek Drive in Clarks ton is the original campus. Its facilities include 14 buildings: Administration, Student Center, Genera l Classroom, Science, Humanities, Fine Arts, P.E./Protective Services, Nursing, Continuing and Co rporate Education, Jim Ch erry Learning Resources Center, Plant Operations, Auxiliary Services/Work-Fa mily Services, and OIT/Student Publications. A new student/conference center is scheduled to open in 2007. The Decatur Campus (formerly South Campus), whic h opened in 1972 at the intersection of Clifton Springs and Panthersville Roads, has three large multi-purpose buildings. It has, in addition, Protective Services, Plant Operations, a greenhouse, and four general classroom buildings. The Dunwoody Campus (formerly North Campus), at 2101 Womack Road, opened as a permanent facility in the fall of 1979. Its facilities include 14 buildings: Administration, Student Center, three classroom buildings, athletic field, four trailer offices, softball field, Protective Services, Plant Operations, and the Library/Learni ng Resources Center. Georgia Perimeter's Lawrenceville Campus (formerly Gwinnett Campus) opened in 1987, as part of the Gwinnett University System Center in response to growing educational needs in Gwinnett County. In December 2001, the campus was relocated from Sugarloa f Parkway to University Center Lane, and in January 2002, the new Gwinnett University Center opened. The center consists of three buildings. One building houses classrooms, a one-st op-shop student services center, science labs, student center, bookstore, coffee shop, computer la b, tutorial center, weight and aer obics rooms, showers and lockers, student government offices, and faculty and staff offices. The second building houses the library, learning labs, study rooms, faculty offices, a technology servi ces center, and an advanced learning technologies division. The third building houses administrative offices and high tech classrooms. The Board of Regents has approved a formal transition for the Lawrenceville Campus of Georgia Perimeter College at the Gwinnett University Center, now Georgia Gwinnett Colle ge, that will be implemented over three years. Based on the current timeline presented by the Boar d of Regents, Georgia Perimeter College will stop offering classes at the Lawrenceville Campus at the end of spring semester 2008. Current students taking courses at that campus should consult with advisors for further information on degree programs and class completion schedules. The Georgia Perimeter College site in Conyers conducts classes in several buildings in the Rockdale Plaza Shopping Center at 1115 West Avenue. This location opened in 1993 as the Rockdale Center for Higher Education and is now known as Rockdale/New ton Campus. As demand for classes increased, the 9 2006-2008 college made plans to build a full-service campus on 100 acres in the region. Ground was broken in March 2005 for a campus in Newton County at Interstate 20 and Georgia Highway 11. This 100-acre site will house a large classroom building with immediate plans for a second student support building. Classes will begin at the Newton campus in the summer of 2007. For college students in the North Fulton area, Geor gia Perimeter College offers classes at Georgia State University's Alpharetta Center, a high-tech facility located off Old Milton Parkway at 3705 Brookside Parkway. Except for students enrolled in highly specialized courses, which may be available on only one campus, students on all campuses choose from essen tially the same programs of study. A student may attend classes on any campus or online th rough the Distance L earning Program. The overall operation of the college is administered from offices located at 3251 Panthersville Road in Decatur. All locations are easily accessible from a neighboring interstate highway. Georgia Perimeter College Foundation In July 1983, with the realization that state funds alone were not enough to provide adequate scholarships and programs for its students, the college created the DeKalb College Foundation to assist in raising funds and promoting the college. That foundation, today known as the Georgia Perimeter College Foundation, is responsible for raising funds for more than 30 endowed scholarships, for academic program support, and for creating community partnerships to support numerous programs for both faculty and students. The Foundation welcomes tax-deductible gifts of cas h, securities, real estate, and life insurance policies from individuals and corporations. The Foundation staff will work with individuals to establish memorial funds or to set up charitable trusts or bequests. Georgia Perimeter College Alumni Association The Alumni Association, originally established in 1970 as the DeKalb College Alumni Association, was reorganized in 1983. Its purpose is to unite graduates and other former students in support of the continued growth and development of the college and to promote the personal, educational, and professional development of alumni. The Alumni Association currently awards a full-semester scholarship each spring semester, recognizes an outstanding facu lty member each year, and awards one alumnus the \"Outstanding Alumnus Award\" at Commencement. 10 2006-2008Admission to Georgia Perimeter College Application Deadlines ......................................................................................................... ..............14 Application Process............................................................................................................ ................14 Categories of Admission ....................................................................................................... ............15 Joint Enrollment .............................................................................................................. ............16 Freshman - Traditional Students ............................................................................................... .17 Transfer - Traditional Students ............................................................................................... ...18 Non-Traditional Students....................................................................................................... ......19 Transient Students............................................................................................................. ...........20 Special (Degreed) Students .................................................................................................... .....20 International Students ........................................................................................................ .........21 Home School Students .......................................................................................................... ......25 Senior Citizen - Prime Timers Program......................................................................................26 Former Students ............................................................................................................... ...........27 Immunization Requirements and Recommendations ........................................................................28 Additional Requirements for Career and Certificate Programs .........................................................30 Awarding Transfer Credit....................................................................................................... ............30 College Preparatory Curriculum (CPC) Requirements .....................................................................32 Classification of Student s for Tuition Purposes ............................................................................... .34 11 2006-2008 ADMISSION TO GEORGIA PERIMETER COLLEGE Georgia Perimeter College seeks to admit qualified students based on standards set by the Georgia Board of Regents.

According to the policies of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, an applicant is a legal resident of the state of Geor gia under the followi ng circumstances: A. (1) If a person is 18 years of age or older, he or she may register as an in-state student upon showing that he or she has been a legal resident of Georgia for a period of at least 12 months immediately preceding the date of registration. Exceptions: i. A student whose parent, spouse, or court-appointed guardian is a legal resident of the State of Georgia may register as a resident providing the parent, spouse, or guardian can provide proof of legal residency in the State of Georgia for at least 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the date of registration. ii. A student who previously held residency status in the State of Georgia but moved from the state then returned to the st ate in 12 or fewer months. iii. Students who are transferred to Georgia by an employer are not subject to the durational residency requirement. (2) No emancipated minor or other person 18 years of age or older shall be deemed to have gained or acquired in-state status for tuition purposes while attending any educational institution in this state, in the absence of a clear demonstrati on that he or she has in fact established legal residence in this state. B. If a parent or legal guardian of a student changes his or her legal residence to another state following a period of legal residence in Georgia, the student may retain his or her classification as an in-state student as long as he or she remains continuously enrolled in the University System of Georgia, regardless of the status of his or her parent or legal guardian. C. In the event that a legal resident of Georgia is appointed by a court as guardian of a nonresident minor, such minor will be permitted to register as in-state student providing the guardian can provide proof that he or she has been a resident of Georgia for the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of the court appointment. D. Aliens shall be classified as nonresident students , provided, however, that an alien who is living in this country under an immigration document permitting indefinite or permanent residence shall have the same privilege of qualifying for in-state tuition as a citizen of the United States. Petitioning for In-State Tuition A student is responsible for registering under the proper residency classification. A student classified as an out-of-state resident for tuition purposes but who believes that he/she qualifies as in-state must file a Petition for In-State Tuition with the campus Enrollment and Registration Services office. This form is available at www.gpc.edu/Request . Residence status for tuition purposes is not changed automatically. The burden of proof rests with the student to demonstrat e that he/she qualifies for in-state tuition under the regulations of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. The completed petition and all supporting documentation must be submitted prior to the semester in which the student is to be considered for reclassification. If the petition is approved, classi fication for in-state tuition is not retroactive to prior terms. 32 2006-2008ADMISSION TO GEORGIA PERIMETER COLLEGE 35 Tuition Differential Waivers Georgia Perimeter College may waive the differential between in-state and out-of-state tuition.

Georgia Perimeter College participates in most major federal and state financial aid programs and offers institutional scholarships as well. There is a District Financial Aid offi ce at each college location (excluding Alpharetta) to assist eligible students in removing the financial barriers that may discourage them from attending college. All students are urged to file an application for financial aid. The Financial Aid office cannot determine eligibility or award financial aid unless the student completes the current Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Renewal Application. The FAFSA can be obtained from all Financial Aid, Advising and Counseling Services, and Enrollmen t and Registration Services offices at Clarkston, Decatur, Dunwoody, Lawrenceville, and Rockdale/Newto n Campuses. The forms are also available on the web at www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Students will need to apply for the HOPE Scholar ship or HOPE Grant by completing one of the following: FAFSA; e-HOPE, electronic application f ound on the GSFC website at www.gsfc.org ; or printable HOPE Scholarship and Grant application found on the GSFC website at www.gsfc.org . Financial aid is available in many forms: grants, scholarships, loans, benefits, and employment opportunities. Federal, state, and local guidelines determine the amounts and types of financial aid offered to individual students. Stud ents must reapply each year for most of these programs. Students usually are offered financial aid packages consisting of some combination of loans, grants, scholarships, and employment. Grants and scholarships are considered \"gift\" assistance and need not be repaid. Loans are offered at low interest rates and can be repaid over an extended period of time beginning six months after students graduate or leave the college. If students are offered aid in the form of a job, they are paid an hourly rate. Eligibility for Financial Aid Eligibility depends on many factors. To receive aid from the student aid prog rams offered at Georgia Perimeter College, students must satisfy the following: Have a financial need, except for some loan programs which do not require proof of need. Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate. Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Have a valid Social Security number. Not owe a Federal PELL or SEOG over-award. Not be in default on a Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Direct Loan Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student workin g toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program of study. Students may not receive aid for correspondence or telecommunications courses unless they are part of an associate degree program. In addition, students may not receive aid for auditing classes. 44 2006-2008 Make satisfactory academic progress. Sign a statement on the Free Application for Fe deral Student Aid (FAFSA) certifying that the student (1) will use federal and/or state student financial aid only to pay for attending an institution of higher learning, (2) is not in default on a federal student loan or has made satisfactory arrangements to repay it, (3) does not owe money back on a federal student grant or has made satisfactory arrangements to repay it, and (4) will notify the school if he or she defaults on a federal student loan. Register with Selective Service, if required. If the student is a male age 18-25 and has not yet registered with Selective Service, he can give Selective Service permission to register him by checking a box on the FAFSA. He can also register through the Internet at www.sss.gov/. How to Apply for Financial Aid Generally, only one Financial Aid Application must be completed to get consideration for all types of grants, scholarships, and work opportunities at Georgi a Perimeter College. Loans and some special awards may require additional forms. To apply, take these steps: 1. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Renewal Application each year. Submit the FAFSA or Renewal Application: Through the Internet by using FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov or By mailing a paper FAFSA or Renewal Application. 2. When completing the FAFSA or Renewal Applica tion, be sure to list Georgia Perimeter College's name and school code, 001562, in step six on the form. The address of the college is 555 North Indian Creek Drive, Clarkston, GA 30021. Mail or transmit the completed and signed FAFSA or Renewal Application to the Central Processor. If applying on the Internet, remember to print and mail the signature page immediately. If completing the paper application, use the envelope attached to the application. 3. Students should receive a Student Aid Report (S AR) within four weeks after submitting their application to the processor. Students should review the SAR to make sure all information is correct. If some information is incorrect, make the correction on the SAR and return it to the processor. If students do not immediately correct a SAR, the app lication will not be processed until the corrections are made. Students should keep a copy of the SAR for their personal files. 4. If Georgia Perimeter College is listed in section si x of the SAR, the District Financial Aid office will receive the student's SAR electronically. 5. If the SAR states that \"your application has been selected for a review in a process called verification,\" then the student must send signed copies of his or her federal tax returns to the Financial Aid office. If the student is claimed as a dependent by his or her parents, signed copies of their returns must be sent as well. If a student is married, signed copies of his or her spouse's return are also required. The student will also have to complete a verification worksheet which can be obtained from the Financial Aid office or on the Georgi a Perimeter College website, www.gpc.edu/~finaide/printableforms.htm . If additional documentation is required, the student w ill receive a tracking letter stating the required documents or the student can check the Georgia Perimeter College website, www.gpc.edu/~finaide . If there are questions remaining, the student can contact the Financial Aid office at his or her campus to answer all of the student's remaining questions. 45 2006-2008 6. Students should respond quickly to all correspondence received from the Financial Aid office. The earlier this required information is received, the earlier an eligibility determination can be reached. After the District Financial Aid office receives a student's SAR and all requested information, the staff will do the following: Review the information. Make an award based on eligibility and availability of funds. Mail an award letter that lists the types and amounts of aid awarded to the student. The award letter may list additional requirements that the stude nt must fulfill before funds can be disbursed. The student should keep this letter with the SAR. Students must keep thei r names, addresses, and telephone numbers current with Enrollment and Re gistration Services or on the Georgia Perimeter College website, www.gpc.edu/Request/ . When students are determined to be eligible for financial aid, tuition and fees may be covered to the extent of the aid, provided the students completed their financial aid files by the priority deadline. If the aid is not sufficient to cover tuition and fees, the student is responsible for the balance, which is due at the time of registration. If the aid exceeds the cost of actual tuition and fees, a check for the difference will be issued and mailed from Student Accounts to the student by the end of the fourth week following registration. Priority Deadlines The FAFSA should be completed and submitted to the central processing center by March 1 every year for which a student plans to request aid. Files that are complete (with SAR and all supporting documents) by April 1 will receive priority co nsideration and should be awarded by May 15. Processing of files completed after April 1 will begin in the order in whic h they were received. Students who apply after April 1 should allow two to four weeks to receive an awar d letter. Students who apply after June 1 should be prepared to pay their fees during registration and be reimbursed based on their eligibility. Applications for spring semester should be completed by October 1. If a student's file is not completed by the deadline, the student must pay his or her fees at the time of registration. The District Financial Aid office cannot process aid applications during registration. Students may be reimbursed once eligibility has been determined. If a student's aid does not cover the full balance, the student must pay any balance due before classes begin. The Financial Aid office will not hold a place for the student in any classes. Award Packages Once students have been awarded aid, they will recei ve an award letter that lists the various types of aid they are eligible to receive during the award year . Awards are based on full-time status; some awards may be adjusted if the student does not enroll as a full-time student. However, aid will automatically be prorated at disbursement if the student is not full-time. If it is determined that the student is not eligible for aid after s/he has been awarded, the Financial Aid office is required to adjust the student's award. Students automatically will be reviewed for Federa l Pell Grants and FSEOG Grants, because they are considered gift aid and do not have to be repaid. Students also will be reviewed for Federal Work-Study. HOPE Scholarships are automatically reviewed for freshmen students who have met the HOPE requirements from high school. Conti nuing students currently receiving HOPE are automatically reviewed. Transfer students must submit a copy of their prior institution(s) academic transcript(s) to the Financial Aid office for HOPE to be reviewed. Students may be awarded grant funds up to the cost of college attendance. If they still have unmet financial needs, students may apply for a loan under the Federal Stafford Loan and/or the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan programs. These loan programs require a separate application in addition to the FASFA. The loan application can be acquired from the Financial Aid office or on the Georgia Perimeter College website, www.gpc.edu/~finaide/printableforms_files/loan%20application.pdf . 46 2006-2008 Students who apply by the priority deadline will be considered for all available funds. Some funds are limited and are awarded to eligible students based on greatest need and meeting the April 1 deadline. Loans will not be automatically awarded. Federal Standards for Satisfac tory Academic Progress (SAP) Federal regulations require institu tions to develop policies that in sure that students who receive financial aid are progressing toward graduation. Th e school's satisfactory academic progress policy must include both a qualitative standard (such as the use of a cumulative grade point average) and a quantitative measure (such as a maximum time-frame for program completion) to track student progress. The SAP policy must be at least as strict as the policy for st udents who do not receive federal student aid funds. Qualitative Standard (The following text appears in the Federal Student Aid Handbook.) Although a school may establish its own satisfactory progress standards, these standards mu st at least meet the minimums required by law and regulations. For the qualitative standard, the law specifies that by the end of the second academic year (measured as a period of time, not by the student's grade level), the student must, in general, have A \"C\" average or its equivalent, and An academic standing consistent with the requirements for graduation from the program. If a school determines that a student has maintained standards even though his or her grade average falls below a \"C,\" the school must be able to docume nt that the student's average is consistent with the academic standards required fo r graduation from the program. Quantitative Measure (The following text appears in the Federal Student Aid Handbook.) To quan tify academic progress, a school must set a maximum time frame in which a student is expected to finish the program. For an undergraduate program, the maximum time frame may not exceed 150% of the published length of the program measured in academic years, academic terms, cr edit hours attempted, or clock hours completed, as appropriate. For instance, if the p ublished length of an academic program is 60 credit hours, the maximum time frame established by the school must not exceed 90 attempted credit hours. Students in the Certificate programs, Fire Management, Library and Information Science Technology, and Sign Language Interpreting, must also make progress toward the completion of their programs. Students will be reviewed after each se mester to ensure that they are progressing toward graduation. The student must maintain a \"C\" average each term and maintain a 67% completion rate. Maximum timeframe may not exceed 150% of any program. The published length of the Fire Management Certificate program is 24 hours, not to exceed 36 hours. The published length of the Library and Information Science Technology Certificate program is 18 hours, not to exceed 27 hours. The published length of the Sign Language Interpreting Certificate program is 48 hours, not to exceed 72 hours. 47 2006-2008 Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) at Georgia Perimeter College Qualitative Standard Any student whose cumulative grade po int average falls below 1.75 after spring term will be placed on financial aid probation. If the cumulative grade point average is below the minimum, the student is no longer eligible for financial aid. The hours used in calculating the cumulative grade point average include transfer hours. Quantitative Measure Georgia Perimeter College offers two-year degrees that require approximately 60 semester hours to graduate. Applying the 150% rule, the maximum credit hours (excluding Learning Support courses and English as a Second Language courses) that a student can attempt at Ge orgia Perimeter College and receive federal and state financial aid are 90 semester credits (60 credits in a program of study \u00d7 150%). Once the student earns 60 semester credits, the student is consider ed to have earned the equi valent of an associate's degree. For a student to be making progress toward graduation, he or she must complete 67% of the courses attempted. The Financial Aid office monitors students' progress and will cancel all financial aid once a student has earned 60 semester credits or completed less than 67% of attempted coursework. Students who wish to earn a second associate's degree may request that their eligibility be extended to a maximum of 120 attempted semester hours or 90 earned hours, whichever comes first. If a student takes courses that are not required for the first or second degree, the student may be liable for all financial aid received for the ineligible courses. Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Evaluation A student's academic progress w ill be evaluated at the end of each semester. Once the Financial Aid office has determined that a student is not making SAP, the office will attempt to notify the student in writing. Notification from the Financial Aid office is not a requirement. It is the student's responsibility to be familiar with SAP and monitor hi s or her own progress each semester to protect financial aid eligibility. Learning Support and English as a Second Language Learning Support (LS) and English as a Second Language (ESL) courses are considered remedial courses. Federal regulations set limits on the maximum hours a student can receive financial aid for taking remedial courses. Financial aid may be used for a maximum of 30 semester credit hours of LS courses. Courses in ESL do not count against the 30 semest er credit hour limit. Once the maximum number of hours is reached for LS, a student w ill not be eligible for financial aid until he or she exits. The LS and ESL courses will not count toward completion rate and maximum hours allowed toward a degree. Appeals Process A student who fails to establish good academic standing or to make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) becomes ineligible for financial aid. If students have mitigating circumstances beyond their control that affects their ability to meet SAP standards, they may appeal the loss of their eligibility. To appeal, a student must complete a Georgia Perimeter College Financial Aid Appeal Form and submit it with appropriate documentation to the Financial Aid office. The Georgia Perimeter College Financial Aid Appeal Form can be obtained either from the Financial Aid office or from the Georgia Perimeter College website, www.gpc.edu/~finaide/printableforms.htm . The documentation must be directly related to the events that affected the student's ability to meet SAP standards. The appeal should also include the steps the student is taking to ensure progress in the future . The student will be notified by mail of the outcome of the appeal. If the appeal is approved, it will list specifi c requirements the student must meet in order to 48 2006-2008 continue to receive financial aid. If the student's appeal is denied, the student may regain eligibility by meeting the conditions listed below. Once the student has met the listed requirements, he or she may submit an appeal form along with a copy of the grade report. Upon receipt of the appeal form and ve rification of the student's grades, the student may be awarded financial aid on a semester-to-semester basis. As long as the student completes all courses attempted with a \"C\" grade or better, he or she may remain eligible for financial aid. Refund Process for Students Receiving Federal Title IV Financial Assistance Students receiving Federal Title IV financial assistance who formally or informally withdraw from school are subject to Federal Return of Title IV Aid Regul ations as specified in the Higher Education Amendment of 1998. The calculation of enrollment length determines the aid earned by the student based on the days enrolled for the semester in relation to the total days in the semester. The aid considered not to be \"earned\" must be returned to the federal programs in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans, Subsidized Federal Stafford loans, Federal PL US loans received on behalf of the student, Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant and other Federal Title IV assistance. Receipt of Federal Title IV aid in excess of aid earned may be subject to repayment by the student if the student has withdrawn from school. The Office of Financial Aid & Veteran Affairs notifies the student if a repayment is due. Failure to repay could result in loss of future Title IV eligibility. All students who fail to repay Georgia Perimeter College within the notified time frame will be reported to the Department of Education or to their guarantor/lender and will become ineligible for future Title IV eligibility. Example: Student received Title IV aid as follows: $1 ,274.00 in Subsidized Stafford Loan and $782.00 in Pell Grant. The student had $844.00 in institutional charges. Student withdrew on day 25 of a semester having 112 days. The student has earned 22.3% (25 days divided by 112 days) of the Title IV aid, which equals $458.49 (loans of $1,274.00 plus grant of $782.00 times 22.3%). The student has unearned aid of $1,597.51 (total aid received of $2,056.00 minus aid ear ned of $458.49) that must be retu rned to the federal programs. The institution must ($844.00 institutional ch arges times 77.7% unearned aid); all of this will be returned to the Subsidized Stafford Loan. The remaining $941.51 (unearned aid of $1,597.51 minus amount institution returned of $656.00) must be returned by the student. The student must repay $618.00 ($1,274.00 received in loan minus $656.00 returned to loan by institution) to the Subsidized Stafford Loan in accordance with the terms of the loan. The student must return $1 62.00 (remaining unearned aid of $941.51 minus $618.00 returned to loan funds by student equals $323.51 multiplied by 50% {students are required to return 50% of unearned gr ant funds} to the Pell Grant Program).* *Copies of the complete refund policy for Federal financial assistance are available from the Financial Aid office on each campus. 49 2006-2008 Financial Aid Available to Students Georgia HOPE Scholarship The Georgia HOPE Scholarship, funded by the Ge orgia Lottery, provides financial assistance to students attending Georgia public and private institutio ns of higher learning.

Accelerated class terms that last ap proximately half the semester are of fered during the 15-week semester on some campuses. The academic calendar for 2 006-2008 may be found in the front of this Catalog . Students who meet published application deadlines may be accepted to enter Georgia Perimeter College at the beginning of any semester or session. Summer Session The summer session operates on an 11-week basis w ith courses offered in two 5-week terms or in the full 11-week term. A student may register for combinations of terms in order to optimize scheduling. Half Semester Classes Some departments offer accelerated classes that meet for seven we eks during the fall and spring semesters and for 5 weeks during the summer session. These classes c over the same material that is covered in the regular full-term 15-week classes in the fall and spring semesters and in the full-term 11- week classes in the summer session so they move very fast. These classes are available for those students who have the necessary time available to satisfy the re quirements of the class. The purpose of these half- semester classes is to allow students to take a sequen ce of classes in one semester. For example, a student could take SPAN 1001 in the first half of the semester and SPAN 1002 in the second half of the semester. However, not all campuses or all departments offer half semester classes in all courses. If half semester classes are offered, they will be listed at the end of th e full semester classes for the course. Be sure to scroll down to the end of the list of classes if you are inte rested in taking a half semester class. Check the Schedule of Classes at www.gpc.edu/~acadaff/Sc hedules/index.php3 carefully to be sure you have chosen the correct class. Academic Credit Units The unit of credit is the semester hour. A semester h our represents one hour of class meeting per week for one semester or its equivalent in other forms of instruction. Two or more hours of laboratory work are considered the equivalent of one semester hour. In the course description section of this Catalog , the number of credit hours is listed beside the title of the course. Classification Students at Georgia Perimeter College are classified as freshmen or sophomores. A student who has completed fewer than thirty hours of college level credit is classified as a freshman. Students are classified as sophomores when they have co mpleted 30 hours of academic work. Catalog Editions Students will normally satisfy the curricular degree requirements of the Catalog in effect at the time they enter Georgia Perimeter College, although revisions to the requirements may be required to provide effective programs. The term \"curricul ar degree requirements\" refers to th e courses and grades required to earn the degree. (Changes in academic regulations affect all students, regardless of Catalog edition. Examples of possible changes include the student discipline policy, procedures for removing incomplete grades, and appeal procedures.) 64 2006-2008 There are instances, howev er, when students are required to change Catalog editions. This means students will be required to satisfy th e curricular degree requirements of the catalog in effect when/if they officially change majors or re-enter the college after a period of one year in which they have earned no academic credit at Georgia Perimeter College, Students may choose to satisfy the curricular degree requirements of the current catalog rather than the catalog in effect at the time they entered GPC. If they choose to do this, they must meet all the requirements of the current catalog; the curricular degree requirements of more than one catalog edition cannot be combined. A degree will be awarded only to students who have satisfied all the academic and administrative requirements of Georgia Perimeter College. Full-time Status Students who enroll in 12 or more hours are considered full-time students. Students who wish to take more than 18 hours and who have demonstrated exceptional academic achievement may apply to the campus Academic Dean for approval for an overload. This approval must be granted before the completion of the registration process. Class Load/Working Students Students who find it necessary to work in order to attend college are reminded that carrying a normal academic load of 12 or more hours is a full-time job. Some students may be able to work part-time and still do satisfactory work. It is strongly recommended that no full-time student work more than 20 hours per week. Students who do find it necessary to work more than this should not try to carry a full load of academic work. Those students who need financial a ssistance should contact the Financial Aid office to inquire about the various opportunities for financial aid. Changes to Students' Records Applicants or currently enrolled students who desire to change their program of study (major), address, phone number, email address, or other information should complete and submit the appropriate Request for Change of Personal Information Form available at an y campus Enrollment and Registration Services office. Documentation to support this change may be required. Academic Placement Since every entering freshman may not need the same series of courses, the level of academic placement may vary. The college makes every effort to determine the appropriate level of beginning instruction for each student by requiring that students take appropriate placement examinations. After the assessment of strengths and weaknesses in English, read ing, and mathematical skills, the student is placed in the proper sequence of course s. Placement examinations are give n throughout the semester on all campuses. Students who have submitted an application for admission to the college will be mailed testing invitations indicating when they are eligible to take the examinations. Non-native speakers of English should take the ESL Placement Tests in English and reading. They may take the mathematics section of the placement ex aminations during the same testing session as the ESL Placement Test. Students with physical disabilities who need special testing assistance should call the District Coordinator of Testing to discuss their needs. 65 2006-2008 English and Reading All entering students must take the English and reading sections of the COMPASS placement examination, except for the categories of students listed below: Non-native speakers of English; Students with national SAT I verbal score of 480 or above or national ACT English score of 20 or above and who do not have a College Preparatory Curriculum (CPC) deficiency in English; Students who have exited Learning Support English and reading at another University System of Georgia institution; Students who have exempted Learning Support English and reading at another University System of Georgia institution within the last three years; Students who have passed (grade of \"D\" or better) a transferable course equivalent to ENGL 1101 at any University System of Georgia institution and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English; Students who have earned a \"C\" or better in a transferable course equivalent to English 1101 at a non-University System of Georgia institution and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English; Students who have begun but not exited Learning Support English or reading at another University System of Georgia institution within the last three years and are not on Learning Support suspension from any USG institution; Students who attended a SACS-COC accredited DTAE college and passed ENG 191 after January 2002, who met the minimum test score requirement for exemption from Developmental Studies at that college, and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English; Students who attended a SACS-COC accredited DTAE college and successfully completed Developmental Studies, who met the minimum test score requirements for exit from Developmental Studies English and reading beginning January 2002, and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English; Students who took a COMPASS or ASSET placement test in English and reading at a SACS-COC accredited DTAE college, who attended that college within the last three years, and have those placement scores recorded on their transcripts.

Honors Program The Honors Program is an academic and student services program for students in all programs of study who have demonstrated outstanding achievement and motivation. The program offers intellectually challenging courses taught by dedicated faculty, inte raction with other students, and opportunities for recognition and service. The purpose of the program is to encourage students to achieve excellence in all areas of their experience at Georgia Perimeter College. Honors courses provide students the opportunity to do in-depth study with enriched content through research projects geared to each discipline. A numbe r of these courses incorpor ate an interdisciplinary feature called \"clustering.\" In these classes, students jointly register for two courses in which the professors have created syllabi and assignments that complement each other. Eligibility Students with a demonstrated history of excelling aca demically are encouraged to participate in the Honors Program.

Though many students qualify to enroll in credit courses along with Learning Support courses, others need a broad spectrum of Learning Support instruction and counseling to prepare them before they enroll in regular college-level course work. Advisement The Learning Support Program provides a sequence of studies and academ ic support services. Consequently, a major purpose of the program is to assist students with developing their personal goals and appropriate curriculum plans. Special academic advisement and coun seling are provided to speed the students' progress toward enrollment in college credit courses. Registration During each semester of enrollment , a Learning Support student must first register for all required Learning Support courses before being allowed to register for other classes. This policy applies to full-time and part-time students. Prerequisites for College-Level Classes Students must exit or exempt Learning Support read ing as a prerequisite for social, natural, and physical science courses; students must exit or exempt Learning Support English and reading as prerequisites for college-level English. Students must exit or exempt Learning Support mathematics as a prerequisite for physics and chemistry. Any science course with a prere quisite of college-level mathematics would also require exit or exemption from Lear ning Support mathematics. For specific course prerequisites, check the course descriptions. 20-Hour Rule Students must be enrolled in required Learning Suppo rt courses before being allowed to take college- level course work, and students may not accumulate more than 20 hours of college-level credit before completing all Learning Support requirements. Credit hours are cumulative within the Regents' System. Transfer students from non-University System of Ge orgia colleges may earn up to 20 additional hours of college-level credit beyond college credit transferred to GPC before being required to take Learning Support courses only. 68 2006-2008 Withdrawal from Learning Support Courses Students with Learning Support requirements who are enrolled in both Learning Support courses and college-level credit courses may not withdraw from th e required Learning Support courses with a \"W\" unless they also withdraw from a ll college-level credit courses. Exit Policy To exit Learning Support, students must exempt or earn a \"C\" or better in ENGL 0099, READ 0098, and MATH 0098 and pass all appropriate exit criteria fo r these courses. Any Learning Support student who does not earn a \"C\" or better in a required Learning Support course must repeat that course. Attempts Students may take a maximum of 12 semester hours or three semesters, whichever occurs first, in any Learning Support area. The only grad e that does not count as an attempt in a Learning Support course is \"W.\" Learning Support Suspension Students who do not complete a Learning Support ar ea (English, reading, or mathematics) in three attempts or twelve semester hours, whichever occu rs first, will be suspended from Georgia Perimeter College and all University System institutions for thr ee years. Attempts are cumu lative within the Regents' System. Learning Support Suspension Appeal Policy - English and Reading Prior to suspending a student who has not exited Learning Support English or reading within the three attempts or twelve-semester hour limit, the student may appeal for one additional attempt. Appeal forms are available through Advising and Counseling Services on each campus. To be eligible for an appeal, the student must be individually evaluated and determined to have a reasonable chance of success, be in an exit level course, and have reached the limit in only one Learning Support area. (This includes English, reading, and mathematics.) If granted the additional attempt, the student may enroll in only the Learning Support course involved. Exception: Students on their fourth attempt may regist er for two activity PE classes or HEDS 1011 in order to have 6 hours for financial aid purposes. Note that students on their fourth attempt may not register for the required Learning Support class in the first half term along with other classes in the second half term to make a full class load. A student who is granted an appeal for a fourth attempt in an area may continue attempting the Learning Support course with grades of \"W\" as long as the attempts are sequential. If a student sits out for more than one term, the appeal is invalid and the student is suspended for three years. A student who does not successfully exit the area afte r the additional attempt will be suspended for three years. A student whose appeal is denied will be suspended for three years. 69 2006-2008 Learning Support Suspension A ppeal Policy - Mathematics Prior to suspending a student who has not exited Learning Support mathematics within the three attempts or twelve-semester hour limit, the student may appeal for up to two additional attempts. For each additional attempt, the student must be individually evaluated and determined to have a reasonable chance of success, be in an exit level course, and have reached the limit in only one Learning Support area. (This includes English, reading, and mathematics.) During the semester of the first additional attempt, the student may enroll in courses other than Learning Support (subject to the 20-hour limit on the number of credit hours a student may earn before exiting Learning Support). If granted the appeal for the second additional attempt in mathematics, the student may enroll in only MATH 0098. Exception: Students on their fifth attempt in mathematics may register for two activity PE classes or HEDS 1011 in order to have 6 hours for financial aid purposes. Note that students on their fifth attempt may not register fo r the required Learning Support class in the first half term along with other classes in the second half term to make a full class load. A student who is granted an appeal for a fourth or fifth attempt in mathematics may continue attempting MATH 0098 with grades of W as long as th e attempts are sequential. If a student sits out for more than one term, the appeal is invalid, and the student is suspended for three years. A student who does not successfully exit the area after the additional attempts will be suspended for three years. A student whose appeal is denied will be suspended for three years. Readmission from Learning Support Suspension Students admitted to GPC after completing a three-y ear suspension from any University System of Georgia institution will be retested for placement (in any unsatisfied Learning Support area) and placed without a Learning Support requirement if they meet the institutional criteria for exemption. Students who do not exempt on the retest may be admitted to GPC for up to three additional attempts per Learning Support area. Students admitted under this provision are subject to the 20-hour limit on college-level coursework and may not take credit work if they have earned 20 credit hours during their previous period(s) of enrollment. Students suspended from the institution without comp leting Learning Support requirements may not be exempted from the Learning Support course requirements through transfer of course credit unless they are eligible for transfer admission under the institution's regular transfer admission po licies. (Note: Transfer students must have 30 hours of college-level transfer credit.) 70 2006-2008 English as a Second Language Students whose native language is not English must show proficiency in English before being admitted to the college as instructed by the Office of International Student Admissions and Advising. Students who graduated from a high school outside the United States must present a satisfactory TOEFL score. Students with scores that admit them to Georgia Perimeter College will be given the ESL Placement Test before advisement and registration. The scor e on this test will be used to determine appropriate placement into ENSL or English courses. Criteria for Determining ESL Placement Entering students who are non-native speakers of English and who score below 480 on verbal section of the national SAT I (or below 20 on the national English ACT) are required to take the ESL Placement Test, unless transfer credit for ENGL 1101 has be en accepted by Georgia Perimeter College and the transfer student has no CPC defici ency in English. Students whose scores on the ESL Placement Test indicate they do not need ESL courses may enroll in ENGL 1101, English Composition I. Students whose scores require placement into the ES L Program must take the appropriate ENSL courses and see an advisor before registration. English as a Second Language (ESL) Program The English as a Second Language Program provides instruction in speaking, listening, reading, and writing for non-native speakers of English. The program is designed to prepare students in the language skills necessary for successful academic work at Georgia Perimeter College. ESL courses are available on the Clarkston, Dunwoody, and Lawrenceville Campuses. The following is a list of the courses that are offered in the ESL Program at Georgia Perimeter College: ENSL 0070 Integrated Skills I 4 hours ENSL 0071 Applied Grammar I 3 hours ENSL 0072 Academic Communication Skills I 3 hours ENSL 0080 Integrated Skills II 4 hours ENSL 0081 Applied Grammar II 3 hours ENSL 0082 Academic Communication Skills II 3 hours ENSL 0090 Academic English 6 hours ENSL 0091 Applied Grammar III 3 hours Prerequisites for College-Level Classes Students who are in enrolled in ENSL courses are re stricted by college policy as to which other courses they may take while taking ENSL courses. Students should consult this Catalog to determine course prerequisites. Students who take courses that violate the prerequisite requirements can be withdrawn from those courses at anytime in the semest er with loss of their tuition and credit hours. This may adversely affect their full-time status. In add ition, students are subject to the student disciplinary procedures as described in the Student Handbook for knowingly violating college prerequisite policy. Registration During each semester of enrollment, ESL students must first register for all required ESL courses before registering for other courses. This policy applies to full-time and part-time students. 71 2006-2008 20-Hour Rule Students in the ESL Program may not accumulate more than 20 hours of college-level credit before completing all ESL and Learning Support mathematic s requirements. Any ESL student who accumulates 20 hours of college-level credit and has not succes sfully completed all ES L and Learning Support mathematics requirements is permitted to enroll only in ESL courses or only in Learning Support mathematics courses until the student has completed all requirements. Transfer Any ESL student who transfers credit hours to Georgi a Perimeter College and who is required to take ESL courses or Learning Support mathematics courses may earn up to 20 additional hours of college-level credit. After earning 20 additional hours at Georgi a Perimeter College without meeting ESL Program exit requirements and Learning Support mathematics requirements, the student may enroll only in ESL courses or in Learning Support mathematics courses. ESL Withdrawal Policy Any ESL student who is enrolled only in ESL or Learning Support mathematics courses may withdraw from one or more of these courses. Students with F-1 visas, however, are required to take at least 12 credit hours per semester and must see the International Student Adviser before withdrawing from any course. Any ESL student who is enrolled in both ESL/Learning Support mathem atics and college-level courses and withdraws or is withdrawn from an y ESL/Learning Support mathematics course before mid-term also will be withdrawn from all college-level courses. Academic Progress Policy Students in the ESL Program are required to earn a grade of \"C\" or higher in each individual ESL course in a maximum of three attempts per course before a penalty is imposed (described below). The only grade that does not count as an attempt in an ESL course is \"W.\" Academic Status Any ESL student who does not earn a grade of \"C\" or higher in an a maximum of three attempts in the course is suspended from Georgia Perimeter College for one semester and is not permitted to take any courses. After three attempts and the suspension of one semester, students will have one additional attempt to pass the course. If such a student does not pass the required course after the fourth attempt, he or she will be excluded from the institution. Exit Policy To exit the ESL Program, students must be exempt from or have earned a \"C\" or better in all required ENSL courses. Any ESL student who does not earn a \"C\" or better in a required ENSL course must repeat that course. Registration Procedure Registration for classes is held prior to the beginning of each semester or term. Registration dates, times, procedures, and deadlines for fee payment are published on the college website. Students are not officially registered for classes until all fees are paid. Prior to registration, continuing/returning students are encouraged to contact an academic advisor for assi stance in selection of coursework that will lead to completion of their chosen degree. After advisement, students will register using the online web registra- tion system. Any student who registers for a course sec tion for which he/she is ineligible will be dropped from the course unless the st udent has received special permission to take the course. 72 2006-2008 Course Schedule Changes Students may make changes in class schedules during registration periods published on the college website, www.gpc.edu. Students who do not need an advisor's assistance may make changes using the online web registration system. Students who need an academic advisor's assistance should see the advisor prior to making any changes. Attendance Students are responsible for regular and punctual attendance at all classes, laboratories, and examinations as scheduled and in accordance with th e class attendance policy of the instructor. Students who do not plan to attend a class that they register for are responsi ble to make these changes to their registration during published registration times. All class attendance policies are on file with the appropriate department chair and ar e part of the course syllabus. Drop/Withdrawal Policies GPC no longer recognizes the practice formerly known as \"Instructor-initiate d withdrawals,\" except for Learning Support, Regents' Test Preparation, English as a Second Language courses and Drops for Non-Attendance (No Show) as described below. Drop for Non-Attendance (No Show) Students who never attend a class and never log-in for a distance learning class by one week past the last drop-add day will be reported for non-attendance, also referred to as \"no show.\" Students who do not drop a class during the schedule adjustment period (dro p/add days) and are reported for non-attendance will be automatically dropped from that course. Neither the course(s) nor any grad e(s) will appear on the student's permanent record. Students reported for non-attendance in a required Learning Support, English as a Second Language, or Regents' Test Preparatio n course will be withdrawn from all collegiate level (1000 or 2000-level) courses in which that student is concurrently enrolled (except HEDS 1011 and activity PE classes) and the grades will be recorded as a \"W.\" Students who fail to attend a science class (BIOL, CHEM, PHYS) with a corresponding co -requisite class will be withdrawn from the co-requisite class with a grade of \"W.\" There will be no reinstatements for st udents who do not attend class during the \"no show\" period. Automatic Withdrawals Learning Support Courses Regents' Test Preparation Courses English as a Second Language Courses Science co-requisites (withdrawal from either lecture or lab will necessitate automatic withdrawal from the co-requisite in BIOL, CHEM, PHYS.) Students enrolled in both required Learning Support courses (those numbered below 1000), English as a Second Language courses (those beginning with ENSL prefix), or Regents' Test Preparation courses (beginning with a RGTR or RGTE prefix) AND collegiate level (1000 or 2000-level) courses must adhere to published attendance policies for Learning Support, English as a Second Language, and Regents' Test Preparation courses in order to remain enrolled in th eir collegiate level courses. Any student who violates the published attendance policy of a required Learning Support, English as a Second Language course or Regents' Test Preparation course before midterm w ill be automatically withdrawn with a grade of \"W\" from that course, along with all collegiate level (100 0 or 2000-level) courses in which that student is concurrently enrolled. 73 2006-2008 Student-Initiated Withdrawals Georgia Perimeter College encourages students to complete all courses for which they enroll in order to achieve their educational goals. If a student is contemplating withdrawal from one or all courses in a given semester, the first action should always be to talk to a faculty member, department chair, or advisor. Alternative solutions may be found in order to avoid the decision to withdraw. If all other options have been exhausted, withdrawal is available as a last resort. Two types of withdrawal processes are described below. The first is for students who are withdrawing from individual courses. The second is fo r students who are withdrawing from the co llege as a whole. Students who reduce their course load may be jeopardizing their financial aid status and must always consult with the Financial Aid office before making any withdrawal decisions. Due to the federal withdrawal calculation, a student could owe money to the Department of Education, Georgia Perimeter College, or to a lending agency/guarantor. Students enrolled in required Learning Support (courses numbered below 1000), English as a Second Language (those beginning with ENSL prefix), or Regents' Test Preparation courses (beginning with a RGTR or RGTE prefix) have additional considerations that may be affected by withdrawal decisions; they ar e described in detail below. Students Attending on Student Visas A student attending GPC on an F-1 (student) Visa /Status may not withdraw from any class unless (a) the student will still remain registered full-time (12 cr edit hours) for courses following the withdrawal, or (b) the student receives permission from an advisor in the International Student Admissions and Advising office. Course Withdrawals The responsibility for withdrawal from courses rests with the student. A withdrawal form cannot be processed if a student has an outstanding balance due to the college. Instructors will not withdraw students except as outlined under the automatic withdrawal s ection of the policy. Students who stop attending a course without formally withdrawing are subject to thei r instructors' published attendance policies as stated in the course syllabus. In most cases, this will result in receiving an \"F\" for the course. In order to avoid grade reductions or failures, students must follow the procedures specified below: Consult the official Academic Calendar for the cu rrent year to determine whether the withdrawal date is before or after the midpoint of the course. Obtain a Withdrawal Form from the campus En rollment and Registration Services office or download from the website at www.gpc.edu/Request . Confer with the course instructor , department chair or a college advisor to determine if withdrawal can be avoided; this individual should sign the Withdrawal Form if withdrawal is found to be the only solution. Obtain a signature from the Financial Aid office if required. Submit Withdrawal Form with all required signatures to the Enrollment and Registration Services office. Prior to midpoint of course Students who officially withdraw from collegiate level (1000 or 2000-level) courses receive a grade of \"W.\" Students taking only Learning Support, English as a Second Language, and Regents' Test Preparation courses who officially withdraw receive a grade of \"W.\" Students taking a mixture of both required Learning Support, English as a Second Language, and Regents' Test Preparation course s and collegiate-level courses w ill not be allowed to withdraw from any Learning Support, Eng lish as a Second Language, and Re gents' Test Preparation course unless they also withdraw from all collegiate level courses. 74 2006-2008 After midpoint of course Students who withdraw after the mid-point have until 7 days prior to the end of the semester to submit a Withdrawal Form for a grade of \"WF.\" During the la st 7 days, no withdrawal forms will be accepted for processing. There are circumstances whereby a studen t can petition for a hardship withdrawal. See section on Hardship Withdrawals in this Catalog . Withdrawal from All Courses Students withdrawing from all courses for which they are registered are considered to be withdrawn from the college for that semester. Students' record s remain active for three consecutive semesters until their status is considered \"inactive.\" Students consid ering withdrawing from the co llege should confer with an advisor. If a decision to withdraw is made, a Wit hdrawal Form must be completed. Course withdrawal policies are also applicable to college withdrawals. Military Withdrawals Students who are called to active military duty during a term may be withdrawn from all courses with a 100% refund. Students in this situation must submit a copy of their orders indicating activation along with the Withdrawal Form. Hardship Withdrawals Hardship Withdrawals are rare and grante d only in extraord inary circumstances. A hardship withdrawal may be requested for all courses in which the student is enrolled (e.g., college withdrawal) or only for a specific course . For example, a serious medical emergency might require a student to withdraw from all classe s for the semester, but a minor medical condition might necessitate withdrawal only from a physical education course or scie nce laboratory section. A request for hardship consideration must be made to the campus Dean of Academic Services after the hardship occurs, but no later than the seventh week of the following semester. Exceptions may be made for extenuating circumstances. All requests for hardship consideration must be in writing, and include appropriate documentation of the hardship circumstance from a verifiable source (e.g. hospital or court records). The Dean of Academic Services in consultation with the department chair(s) and/or faculty member(s) teaching the course(s) for which the hardship withdrawal is being requested must approve all hardship withdrawals. Hardship withdrawals also require review by Financial Aid to determine if any repayment of funds may be required. If the hardship withdrawal is approved, the stude nt will receive a grade of \"W\" in the relevant course(s) for the term requested. The decision on a hardship withdrawal by the campus Dean of Academic Services will be communicated to the stud ent, faculty member(s), departme nt chair, and the Enrollment and Registration Services office. The official date of withdrawal will be the last date the student attended class. If the campus Dean of Academic Services does no t approve the hardship withdrawal, the student may appeal to the campus Provost, whose decision is final. 75 2006-2008 Standards for Academic Honesty In accordance with policies and proced ures regarding Academic Honesty (see Student Handbook ), cheating and plagiarism are un acceptable in attempting to fu lfill academic assignments (see Student Handbook for definitions and examples, pr ocedures followed as a conseque nce of cheating or plagiarism, and possible disciplinary actions). The college has esta blished this policy to ensure due process in such cases. State and federal laws involving computer fraud, soft ware piracy, etc., as well as institutional policy, govern the use of the college's computer systems. Please see the Student Handbook for a full explanation of these standards. Special regulations are listed in the Student Handbook as these relate to usage of the Internet other than in support of research and educational objectives. Academic Records Grades At the close of the semester, students are responsible for viewing their final grades online through the Student Information and Registration System at the website, oscar.gpc.edu . Request for Official Georgia Perimeter College Transcript Upon written request, an official Georgia Perimeter College hand-carried transcript or an official mailed transcript is available to the student as re quired by Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations. Instructions are available online at www.gpc.edu/Academics/transcript/ or in the Enrollment and Registration Services office. Confidentiality of Student Records See Family Education Rights an d Privacy Act (FERPA) in the St udent Affairs section of this Catalog . Grading System The grading system used at Georgia Perimeter College is as follows: A 90-100 Excellent B 80-89 Good C 70-79 Average A grade of \"C\" is the minimum grade required for certain courses, as specified in these sections of this Catalog : Programs of Study and Course Descriptions. D 60-69 Poor A grade of \"D,\" while giving hours credit, will not apply toward the degree in courses requiring a \"C\" or better. F Below 60 Failure WF Withdrawal/Failing \"WF\" indicates that the student withdrew from the course while doing unsatisfactory work. (See Course Withdrawal in this section of the Catalog .) No credit toward graduation is given for a course in whic h a grade of \"F\" or \"WF\" is received. Special Note: All grades issued to Joint Enrollment students will be recorded as letter grades based on the college grading system. College instructors will not issue numerical grades. 76 2006-2008 The following symbols are used in the cases indicated but will not be included in the determination of the cumulative grad e point average: W Withdrawal This symbol indicates that a student was perm itted to withdraw from the course without penalty. WM Military withdrawal - No grade IP In Progress This symbol applies to Learning Support and English as a Second Language courses and under certain circumstances is assign ed in lieu of grades below \"C.\" I Incomplete This symbol indicates the student has satisfactorily completed a substantial portion of the course work, but for non-academic reasons beyond the student's control, the student has not been able to complete some specific part or amount of the work required (for example, the final examination). An \"I\" no t satisfactorily removed by the end of the following semester will automatically be changed to an \"F.\" The time allowed for completing work may be extended to a maximum of 12 months when circumstances prevent the student from completing the work during the following semester. To obtain an \"I,\" the student and his or her instructor must complete the Petition for \"I\", which will include a description of the work to be completed and the completion date. Copies of the Petition for \"I\" will be filed with the instructor, with the appropriate department chair, and with the campus registrar. Learning Support students ma y not receive an \"I\" in any required Learning Support course. S Satisfactory U Unsatisfactory These symbols (\"S\" and \"U\") are not used except for certain courses in the technical programs and other special credits where a gr ade point average is not computed, such as credits by examination. K This symbol indicates credit granted by examination. NR No Grade This symbol is used when no grade is submitted. V Audit No credit is given to a student who audits a course (see Audit Courses). RGTR and RGTE courses only S Pass Regents' Test U Unsatisfactory Audit Courses College-level students may choose to register for a class for an audit grade. Audit is a grade status selected at the time of course regi stration. An auditor of a course must meet all admissions requirements and be officially accepted to the college. A student's pl acement must be college-level to audit a Learning Support course. By registering as an auditor and paying fees and non-resident fees (if applicable), a student is permitted to audit a course and attend classes withou t meeting all requirements of the course and without receiving credit. Exceptions to this policy are clinical courses, certain laboratory courses, and supervised work experience. A student is not permitted to change fr om audit to credit or from credit to audit after the add/drop period. (Note: Students auditing Learning Support courses may be withdrawn for excessive absences. When college-level students audit a Learning Support course, the course is counted as an attempt in that Learning Support area.) 77 2006-2008 Academic Grade Point Average Determinations of scholastic standing are generally based upon a cumulative academic grade point average (GPA), which appears on each student's pe rmanent record. This average is computed by multiplying the credit hours assigned a course by the grade points earned. The sum of grade points divided by the total number of credit hours attempted at Georgia Perimeter College produces the cumulative academic grade point average. Credits earned in L earning Support courses, credits earned at other institutions, credit by examination and other courses wh ere symbols such as \"S\" or \"K\" are assigned are not used in calculating the cumulative academic GPA. Ho wever, these credits may be used to determine Financial Aid and HOPE eligibility. How to calculate term GPA Use the following steps to calculate a term GPA: 1. Multiply the number of credit hours for the course by the number of grade points for the corresponding letter grade to get the number of quality points for the course. (Credit hours \u00d7 Grade Points = Quality Points) Repeat this for each course in the term. Grade Grade Points A 4.0 B 3.0 C 2.0 D 1.0 F 0.0 WF (Withdrawal Fail) 0.0 Note: Courses with any other letter grade (W, V, etc.) or grades followed by % (Learning Support, ESL, Regents' Prep), $ (Transfer Credit), and # (Academic Renewal) are not used in the GPA calculation. 2. Total the credit hours for each course used in the GPA calculation. 3. Total the quality points for each course used in the GPA calculation. 4. Divide the total quality points by the total credit hours to obtain the GPA. (Term Quality Points \u00f7 Term Credit Hours = Term GPA) EXAMPLE Course Letter Grade Credit Grade Hours Points Quality Points ENGL 1101 B 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 MATH 0098 C% 0 \u00d7 0 = 0 (not used) PSYC 1101 C 3 \u00d7 2 = \u00d7 4 =12 PHED 1063 W 0 \u00d7 0 = 0 (not used) Totals 9 27 GPA 27 \u00f7 9 = 3.00 How to calculate cumulative GPA To calculate a cumulative GPA, divide the total numb er of quality points earned by the total number of credit hours using the guidelines in item #1 above. (Total Quality Points \u00f7 Total Credit Hours = Cumulative GPA) 78 2006-2008 Dean's List At the end of each semester, students who have achieved a grade point average of 3.5 or better while carrying an academic load of 9 semester credit hours or more of courses numbered 1000 or higher will be placed on the Dean's List. Grade Appeal Policy Georgia Perimeter College shall provide students with a timely process of appealing grades, which they believe were incorrectly determined. In cases where a student is appealing a grade on the basis of alleged discrimination, the student must elect between the College Grade Appeal procedure and the Student Discrimination Grievance Procedures, but cannot use both for the same grade appeal. (See Student Discrimination Grievance, Georgia Perimeter College Policy Manual, Section 401.02) Grade Appeal Procedure The Grade Appeal Procedure is th e method by which a student may challenge a grade issued by an instructor at Georgia Perimeter College. The following procedure is required: 1. The student must contact the instructor after the grad e is issued to discuss a change in the grade. This contact should occur as soon as possible, but no later than the second week of the term following receipt of the disputed grade. If a student is unable to contact the instructor, the appropriate department chair should be asked for assistance. Under ex tenuating circumstances and with supporting documentation, exceptions may be made by the Dean of Academic Services. 2. If the student disputes the instructor's decision, the student may then initiate the appeal process by obtaining a Student Grade Appeal Statement Form from the appropriat e department chair. The student must complete this form according to the direc tions and provide the necessary documentation and pertinent information. The student should return the complete packet to the department chair within one week. 3. Upon receipt of the st udent's request for a Grade Appeal Form , the department chair will have the instructor complete the Instructor Grade Appeal Statement Form. This form must be returned to the department chair within one week of notification. 4. The department chair will render a decision regard ing the grade appeal. Prior to making a decision, the department chair may schedule a meeting with the student and/or the instructor. After making a decision, the department chair will notify in writing both the instructor and the student. 5. Either the instructor or the stud ent may appeal the decision of the de partment chair. This appeal must be made in writing, directed to the Dean of Academic Services and delivered within 5 working days from the receipt of the department chair's decision. 6. The Dean of Academic Services will determine the validity of the grade appeal. If the Dean of Academic Services rules that the issu e is not a valid grade appeal issue, the appeal goes no further. If the Dean of Academic Services rules that the i ssue is valid, then the grade appeal procedure will continue according to the following steps. The decision of the Dean of Academic Services regarding continuation of the grade appeal procedure is final. 7. The Dean of Academic Services shall ap point a Grade Appeal Committee comprised of: Voting Members (five members): (1) A committee chairperson appointed by the Dean of Academic Services. (2) The campus Dean of Student Services or his/her designee. (3) A faculty member appointed by the department chair to represent the department/discipline involved in the appeal. 79 2006-2008 (4) A faculty member appointed by the Campus Dean of Academic Services. This person should be from an academic division/discipline other than the division/discipline in which the appeal is made. The selection will be from a pool of faculty, each member elected by and representing a department on campus. (5) A student representative from the Ca mpus Student Government Association. (Note: If the appealing party holds an SGA office, then the committee member will be from a campus other than the one on which the appealing party holds office.) Non-Voting Members (two members): (1) The student making or involved in the appeal may choose someone (faculty/staff) from the college to represent him or her on the Grade Appeal Committee. (2) The faculty making or involved in the appeal may choose someone (faculty/staff) from the college to represent him or her on the Grade Appeal Committee. 8. Recognizing that the Grade Appeal Committee is an in-house procedure, and not a court of law, no legal counsel or any other person may be present besides the student, the instructor, and appointed members of the committee. Exceptions to this would be granted by the Dean of Academic Services and only for the following reasons: (1) students with disabilities requiring some highly extraordinary assistance that could not be routinely provided by the chair or another member of the committee; and (2) a student whose first language is not English and wh ose English is not sufficiently fluent so as to allow him/her to represent himself/herself adequate ly at a committee hearing. In these cases, the appointment will be left to the discretion of the Dean of Academic Services. 9. After receiving the student's or instructor's written appeal, the Dean of Academic Services will schedule a meeting of the Grade Appeal Committee. It is the intent of the college to process all grade appeals in a timely manner. Grade appeals will be pro cessed no later than the end of the term in which the appeal was filed. a. The committee examines written materials presented by both the student and the instructor. The voting committee members will also discuss the case with both the instructor and the student. During this discussion, the non-voting committ ee members will advise and consult with the individual they represent. The committee may call other witnesses. The student and instructor have the right to be present at all meetings where ev idence is presented. The committee chair will be responsible for recording the session. b. The voting committee members will meet privately to confer and arrive at a decision. Every effort should be made to reach a consensu s finding. If not, then a priv ate ballot shall be taken with the chair of the committee voting only in the event of a tie vote. This decision is reported to the Dean of Academic Services who presents the findings and the decision to the student, instructor and department chair. The Dean of Academic Services will implement the decision of the Grade Appeal Committee unless one of the parties wishes to appeal the grade appeal procedure. c. The committee maintains and fo rwards informal minutes of all proceedings to the Dean of Academic Services. These shall be available to the Discipline Dean, the Vice President for Educational Affairs and the President. 10. If the parties are not satisfied with the procedur e followed by the Grade A ppeal Committee, they may appeal, in writing , within 5 working days to the Vice President for Educational Affairs. The Vice President for Educational Affair s will determine if the grade appeal procedure was followed appropriately. The Vice President for Educational A ffairs may at his/her discretion return the grade appeal to the committee for further consideration. The decision of the Vice President is final. 80 2006-2008 Repeating Courses If a student repeats a course, both grades count to ward the GPA, and both appear on the transcript, even though the course can be counted for credit only once. The grade received on the final attempt will be used for the purpose of graduation requirements. Academic Renewal Policy This policy allows degree-seeking students who have experienced academic difficulty to make a fresh start and have one final opportunity to earn an as sociate degree at Georgia Perimeter College after an absence of 5 calendar years. Former Developmental Studies/Learning Support st udents may apply for academic renewal only if they successfully completed all Developmental St udies/Learning Support requirements prior to the commencement of the five-year absence. Implementation A. All previously attempted coursework continues to be recorded on the studen t's official transcript. 1) A renewal GPA is begun when the student resumes taking coursework following approval for academic renewal. 2) The academic renewal GPA will be used for determining academic standing and eligibility for graduation. a) To earn a degree, a student must meet a ll graduation requirements after acquiring academic renewal status. b) At least 50% of work toward a degree mu st be completed after the granting of academic renewal status for a student to be eligible for honors at graduation. 3) Academic credit for previously completed cour sework, including transfer coursework, will be retained only for courses in which an \"A,\" \"B,\" or \"C\" grade has been earned. a) Retained grades are not calcu lated in a renewal GPA. Such credit is considered in the same context as transfer credit, credit by examin ation, and courses with grades of \"S.\" b) Courses with \"D\" or \"F\" grades must be rep eated at Georgia Perimeter College if they are required in the student's degree program. Further, all remaining courses for the current degree objective must be completed at Georgia Perimeter College. In other words, no transient credit will be accepted. c) Applicability of retained credit to degree requirements will be determined by the degree requirements currently in effect at the time academic renewal status is conferred on the student. Specific program regulations must also be met. B. A student can be granted academic renewal status only one time at any University System of Georgia institution. C. Transfer Credit 1) Students on exclusion: a student who has been on exclusion from Georgia Perimeter College and has attended one or more University System of Georgia institution during the period of exclusion will not be eligible for academic renewal. 2) Non-excluded students: a student who has not been on exclusion from Georgia Perimeter College but who has been absent five years or more and who has attended a school other than Georgia Perimeter College may choose only one of the following options: 81 2006-2008 a) A student may return to Georgia Perimeter Colle ge subject to all relevant transfer and reentry policies. No renewal GPA is calculated, and tr ansfer credit will be gr anted for applicable courses taken during the absence. b) A student may apply for academic renewal. If academic renewal status is approved, no transfer credit will be granted for coursework completed during the absence. D. Any exclusion that occurred in the past shall rema in recorded on the student' s permanent record. If an exclusion (either first or second) is on the record and the student encounters subsequent academic difficulty after having been granted academic renewal, the next exclusion would subject the student to dismissal. E. If a student does not request academic renewal status at the time of re-enrollment after a five year or greater period of absence, the stud ent may do so within three semesters of re-enrollment or within one calendar year, whichever comes first. The renewal GPA begins with the semester following re-enrollment. F. Reentry into any program is not automatic. G. If a student is denied academic renewal and subsequently does not re-enroll, he/she may resubmit an academic renewal application after no fewer than three semesters have passed since the initial petition. H. The granting of academic renewal does not supe rsede financial aid policies regarding Satisfactory Academic Progress. I. The granting of academic renewal does not supersede the admissions requirements of certain programs, e.g., Dental Hygiene and Nursing, whic h require a specific minimum grade point average based upon all coursework. Academic Status Students attending Georgia Perimeter College are expected to meet cer tain academic standards. These standards stress the importance of successful performan ce by students to maintain an academic status of good standing at the college. Students are considered to be in good standing if they are not on academic probation or academic exclusion. Students who hold office in any college club or organization or who participate in athletics must be in good academi c standing. Students can ch eck their academic status through the Student Information & Registration System at the end of each semester. Academic Warning Students who have failed to achieve a term grade point average of 2.0 or better shall be given an academic warning and alerted that further deterioratio n in academic performance may lead to probation. Students should see an advisor to implement a plan for improvement. Academic Probation Students are placed on academic probation if (1) they are on academic warning and their cumulative grade point average is less than 1.75 or (2) if they pass no collegiate-level course work and have one or more \"F\" or \"WF\" during a term and their cumulative grade point average is less than 1.75. Students on academic probation should see an advisor to plan fo r improvement and should take a reduced academic load. Students remain on probation until they earn a cu mulative grade point average of 1.75 or better. Academic Exclusion Students on probation shall be excluded if the cumulative grade point average is less than 1.75 and the term grade average is less than 2.0. Students on academic exclusion for the first and second time can appeal the exclusion. 82 2006-2008 Returning from Academic Exclusion For the first exclusion, students will be eligible to re quest to return after one semester. After the second exclusion, students will be eligible to return after one calendar year and reapplication to the college will be required. Academic Exclusion Appeal Policy and Procedures Academic Exclusion Appeal Po licy and Procedure for Students Students on academic exclusion fo r the first and second time may a ppeal the exclusion as follows: Upon notification of the exclusion, the student should report to the Enrollment and Registration Services office, complete an Exclusion App eal Form and receive further instructions. The student is informed when to return to learn the status of the appeal. The student will receive a copy of either the Ap peal Approval or the Appeal Denial Form. The student will receive written notification fr om the chairperson of the Appeals Committee outlining the disposition of the appeal. The Registrar will be responsible for processing approvals or denials from the committee. Academic Exclusion Appeal Policy and Procedures for the Registrar The Registrar will proceed as follows: Each student will be notified of his/her exclusion status via a card or letter. After submitting an Appeal Form at the Enrollment and Registration Services office, the student will be informed when to return to learn the decision on the appeal. The Registrar will keep an appropriate file each term regarding exclusion. The Registrar will alert the chairperson of the Appeals Committee to the number of students seeking appeals and will provide the committee with the students' completed Appeal Forms and academic records. Upon receipt of an Approval Form from the co mmittee, the Registrar will remove the exclusion hold and will process the student's registration for the current term. The committee will send the Exclusion File to the Registrar. Academic Exclusion Appeals Committee The Academic Exclusion Appeals Committee will cons ist of at least three persons who will perform the following: The committee will review all written appeals and will see in person any student wishing to appear before the committee. The committee will render all decisions no later than the first day of class. The chairperson will complete an Appeal Approval or Denial Form for ea ch written appeal form. One copy of the form is given to the student, and one copy is given to the Registrar for processing and filing. The committee will return the Exclusion File to the Enrollment and Registration Services office. Readmission for Health Sciences Students should see the Program of Study section of this Catalog for information on readmission to the Dental Hygiene and Nursing Programs. 83 2006-2008 Graduation Students are encouraged to fulfill all requirements fo r graduation to earn an associate degree in arts, science, or applied science. Students who earn associ ate degrees enhance their chances of being accepted into the senior institution of their choice. Students w ith associate degrees also enhance their employment opportunities after they graduate. Students who are within a few hours of earning an as sociate degree but transfer to a senior institution before completion may, in many cases, transfer the necessary hours back to Georgia Perimeter College from the senior institution and earn the associate degree. Students should consult the campus Enrollment and Registration Services office to explore this option. The annual formal commencement ceremony is held at the end of the academic year. Students who graduate during any of the preceding semesters of the academic year or the upcoming summer session are encouraged to participate in this commencement ceremony. Graduation Requirements Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, and Associ ate of Applied Science degr ees and certificates are awarded each semester to those students who meet all graduation requirements. All students who have earned 30 semester hours are eligib le for a graduation evaluation or a degree audit. An evaluation is an official review of course work completed toward graduation and any outstanding courses still needed to complete the Program of Study for graduation. A graduation evaluation or degree audit is done once the student applies for graduation. A student must apply for graduation in order to graduate. It is recommended that the application for graduation occur at least two semesters prior to the an ticipated semester of graduation to allow adequate time for completion of course work based on the graduation evaluation. Students should apply for graduation by the following dates: Fall Semester July 1 Spring Semester November 1 Summer Session March 1 The Application for Graduation Form is available in the campus Enrollment and Registration Services office or by downloading from www.gpc.edu/Request/ . A separate application must be submitted for each Program of Study in which a degree audit is sought and a $25 (non-refundable) graduation application fee is required per application. To graduate, students must do the following: Successfully complete an approv ed Program of Study, including the basic physical education requirement. Earn an overall grade point av erage of \"C\" or better in courses presented for graduation. File an application for graduation with the campus Enrollment and Registration Services office by the appropriate deadline. Complete at least 18 semester hours at Georgia Perimeter College and be enrolled during the semester of graduation. Students who transfer their final 3 courses or 11 semester credit hours of approved courses back to Georgia Perimeter College to complete their associate's degree requirements can be exempt fro m the enrollment requirement. Demonstrate a satisfactory knowledge of United States and Georgia history and Constitutions. Settle all financial obligations to the college befo re a degree, certificate, or transcript will be issued. Pass both the reading and essay sections of the Regents' Test if required by the Program of Study. NOTE: Students seeking a degree will not be cred ited with the completion of the requirements for graduation while on probation. To be eligible for graduation in Nursing or Dental Hygiene, a student must make a minimum grade of \"C\" in all professional courses and in all basic science courses required by the program. 84 2006-2008 Second Degree Graduates seeking a second degree from Georgia Perimeter College must complete all degree requirements for the second degree to include a minimum of 18 semester hours above the hours submitted for the first degree.

The Regents' Test is a two-part test that measures competency in reading and composition. All students enrolled in transfer degree programs must pass the Regents' Test as a requirement for graduation. There is no charge for taking the test. Students re questing special accommodations must do so through the Center for Disability Services. Who Should Take the Regents' Test? Students enrolled in all A.A. and A.S. degree programs must pass the Regents' Test as a requirement for graduation. Students enrolled in A.A.S. degree programs may not be required to pass the Regents' Test. Students are strongly encouraged to take ENGL 1101 and ENGL 1102 the first two semesters of enrollment. Students are also encouraged to take the Regents' Test for the first time while enrolled in ENGL 1102. Students must take the test in their first semester of enrollment after earning 30 semester credit hours if they have not taken it previously. Students who have not passed both parts of the test by the time they have earned 45 semester credit hours must take remediati on each semester of enrollment until they have passed both parts. A Georgia Perimeter College student who attempts the Regents' Test twice and is unsuccessful in one or both parts must enroll in remediation regardless of the number of credit hours the student has accumulated. Students with 45 semest er credit hours who have not passe d the test may enroll in college- credit courses only if they also enroll in required remediation. Institutions may further restrict enrollment in college-credit courses. At Georgia Perimeter College, once students have earned 54 semester credit hours, they may not enroll in any course work other than remediation until they have taken and passed the test. Students entering Georgia Perimeter College with AP credit, credit from other advanced placement programs or examinations, and/or joint enrollment credit have at least two semesters of enrollment to take the Regents' Test. Students transferring from outside the System with 30 or more semester credit hours should take the test during their first semester of enrollment at a Sy stem institution. Transfer students with more than 45 semester credit hours who have not passed both parts of the test before entering their third semester at a System institution must take remediation each semester of enrollment until they have passed both parts. Students who are not enrolled at Georgia Perimeter College are strongly encouraged to take the test at their home institution. However, non-enrolled students who are eligible to take the test and are not subject to a remedial requirement may be permitted to take the test at GPC. 85 2006-2008 Exemptions Students with SAT-I Verbal scores of at least 51 0 or ACT Reading scores of at least 23 will be considered to have fulfilled the reading comprehension re quirement of the Regents' Test and do not need to take the reading portion of the Regents' Test.

Clarkston Campus day students should inquire at the District Tes ting office and Clarkston Campus evening students at the Enrollment and Registration Services office. Options for ESL Students Non-native speakers of English (N NS) who have successfully completed ENGL 1101 are eligible to take the Regents' Essay Test in an extended time format during a scheduled ESL test session and are not required to take the Regents' Reading Test. However, NNS who have waived the ESL placement test and/or ESL courses are required to take the regular Regents' Essay and Reading Tests with no extended time. Students have two attempts to pass the Regents' Essay Test before accumulating 45 semester hours of collegiate credit. Students who do not pass the essay part of the test before earning 45 hours will be required to take RGTE 0199 (essay) every semester until they have passed the essay part of the test. Transfer students who have not taken ESL classes at GPC are also eligible to exempt the Regents' Reading Test by taking the Regents' Essay Test in an extended time format if their first language in not English, they have either transfer credit for E NGL 1101 or have taken the ESL placement test and exempted out of ESL, and have not previously attempted the Regents' Test at another institution. Transfer students must be enrolled for one term at GPC prior to registering for the Regents' Test unless it is required in their first term. Once students have earned 54 semester hours of collegiate credit and still have not passed the Regents' Essay Test they may not enroll in any courses other than the remediation course until they have passed the essay part of the test. This option is for degree-seeking students only. 86 2006-2008Student Affairs Statement of Nondiscrimination ................................................................................................ ........90 Student Discrimination Grievance .............................................................................................. ......90 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) .....................................................................92 Campus Security Act Information................................................................................................ ......93 87 2006-2008 STUDENT AFFAIRS Statement of Nondiscrimination Georgia Perimeter College supports the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order #11246, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the American with Disabilities Act. No pers on shall, on the basis of age, race, relig ion, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, disability or veteran status, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity of the college. Any individual with a grievance related to the enforcement of any of the above provisions should contact the Assistant Director of Human Resources, Ombudsperson. Student Discrimination Grievance Policy Discrimination as prohibited by law is a matter of particular concern to Georgia Perimeter College. The college's policies and procedures for dealing with discrimination have been designed to protect all individuals while ensuring academic freedom to teach , learn and work. The policy is in accordance with the University System of Georgia Board of Regents Policy 401.02 and the law. The policy has the support of the college's President and administration. Discrimination means to treat a person adversely becau se of race, color, gende r, sexual orientation, religion, creed, national origin, age, disability or vete ran status, or to implement policies or practices that intentionally or uninte ntionally adversely impact a person on th e basis of race, color, gender, religion, creed, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status. Confidentiality will be maintained insofar as it does not interfere with the college's legal obligation or ability to investigate allegations of misconduct when brought to its attention, and to take corrective ac tion when it is found that misconduct has occurred. Throughout the process, every effort will be made to protect the complainant from reprisals and to protect the accused from irresponsible complaints. The Student Discrimination Grievance procedure encourages and provides guidelines for informal resolution of disputes by communication between the parties involved. Procedure This procedure provides a means by which students who are aggrieved by actions taken by college personnel (faculty, staff or administration) which they feel are discriminatory, including assignment of grades so long as the basis of the grade appeal is alleged discrimination, can voice their grievances and be heard in a meaningful manner. This procedure is in no way intended to discourage or supplant the informal resolution of disputes by communication between the parties involved, and in fact, no written grievance will be considered and no hearing will be granted by the Grievance Co mmittee unless an aggrieved party can show that he or she had made genuine efforts to resolve the dispute informally, by means specified herein. Neither is this procedure intended to supplant Georgia Perimeter College procedure section 304.50 entitled \"Student Appeal Regarding Grades\" in cases where a student is appealing an assigned grade on grounds other than alleged discrimination by a faculty member. In cases where a student is appealing a grade on the basis of alleged discrimination, the student must elect between the College Grade Appeal procedure at Section 304.50 of the Georgia Perimeter College Policy Manual and the Student Discrimination Grievance Procedure, but cannot use both for the same grade appeal. (See Student Appeal Regarding Grades, Georgia Perimeter College Policy Manual , Section 304.50 or Academic Policies and Procedures section in this Catalog .) All proceedings pursuant to this procedure will be co nducted as confidentially as is practical. All time limitations are not to exceed the specified number of days. All references to days are to working days. 88 2006-2008 Campus Dean of Student Services' Role An aggrieved student shall meet with the campus Dean of Student Services at the earliest opportunity after the most recent incident, which is the subject of the grievance. The student should be prepared to explain to the campus Dean of Student Services all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the grievance. The Dean will determine the appropriate action necessary, perform an investigation, and assist the student in th e filing of a formal grievance. This procedure will be followed if an informal resolution can not be reached thr ough intervention. Filing of Written Grievance The student and any other party in interest shall file any written grievance with the Ombudsperson within ten working days after the aggrieved student's meeting with the campus Dean of Student Services. Such grievance must contain specific factual allegations of the discriminatory practice(s) or incident(s), and a statement of the alleged basis or bases of the discrimination, which must be one or more of the following: race, color, gender, religion, age, persons with disabilities, national origin, or veteran's status. Appointment of Grievance Committee An Ad Hoc Grievance Committee will be appointed by the Ombudsperson no later than ten working days after the filing of a written gr ievance and will consist of five members: a student, a faculty member, and a student affairs professional, plus two other individuals, either staff, administrative or faculty, corresponding to the position of the individual against whom the grievance is brought. All committee members will be from the campus on which the grievance originated. The Ombudsperson will name one of the five members as chair of the committee. Duties of Grievance Committee a. The chair shall issue a written Notice of Hearing within ten working days of the appointment of the committee, to the student and any other party in interest. The notice shall set forth the date, time, and place of the hearing, the issue(s) as they are unde rstood by the committee, and a statement that the parties are responsible for the attendance of th eir own witnesses and the presentation of any documentary evidence they wish to make part of the record, including the sworn statements of any witnesses who are unable to attend the scheduled hearin g. The date of the hearing shall be within ten working days of the notice. b. Hearing Procedure - The parties will not be perm itted representation by attorneys at the hearing, but they will be permitted to be accompanied by an advisor from the college with whom they may confer during the course of the hearing. The burden of pr oof of the allegations raised in the written grievance shall rest with the aggrieved student. The student shall have the first opportunity to present his or her case by narrative, testimony of witnesses, and pres entation of documentary evidence. The party against whom the grievance has been brought will then have an opportunity to present his or her case, in the same manner. All testimony shall be taken under oath administered by the chair of the Grievance Committee. Both parties shall have the right to cr oss-examine adverse witnesses. The committee shall not be bound by legal rules of evidence, but shall hear all relevant evidence presented. The chair of the committee will rule on any challenge raised to the admissibility of evidence, as well as any other objections made during the course of the hearing. c. Determination of Committee - Within five working days of the hearing, the committee, through its chair, shall present to the Ombudsperson a written determination for disposition of the grievance. The determination shall include specific findings of fact based on evidence presented at the hearing and a course of optional courses of action for the ins titution. The determination may include a dissenting opinion or opinions if the committee me mbers are unable to reach consensus. The Ombudsperson will then report th e results of the hearing to the parties involved in writing or in person. The Ombudsperson will advise the parties at that time of their right to a ppeal the determination of the committee to the campus Provost within five working days of the issuance of the determination. 89 2006-2008 Appeal to the Campus Provost Within five working days of the receipt of an app eal, the campus Provost sha ll issue a decision based on review of the record.

The decision shall apprise the appealing party of the right to further appeal to the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia pursuant to Paragraph IX of the Bylaws of the Board of Regents or any other applicable provision of the Policies of the Board of Regents. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights are listed here. 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educa tion records within 45 days of the day the college receives a request for access. Students should submit to the Director of Admissions and Records a written request that identifies the record(s) they wish to inspect. The Director of Admissions and Records will make arrangements for access and notif y the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the college to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the Director of Admissions and Records, clearly identifying the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the college decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the college will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the he aring procedure will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the college in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement personnel); a person or company with whom the college has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educationa l interest if the official needs to review an educational record in order to fulfill his or her pr ofessional responsibility. Upon request, the college discloses education records without consent to offici als of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. 90 2006-2008 4.

Depending on program objectives and the number of se mesters required, a degree or certificate is awarded upon the successful completion of all required courses. Although many of the programs of study are available on all campuses, each campus has programs not offered on other campuses. In addition, a program may not be available because of insufficient enrollment. Students should inquire about particular program offerings before enrolling. Program requirements are subject to change. Please see an advisor or www.gpc.edu/~acadaff/advi sement/AdvisingForms.htm for the most current Programs of Study. Transfer Programs Transfer programs are designed for students who plan to transfer to four-year colleges or universities upon the completion of two years of academic work at Georgia Perimeter College. In additi on to variations in general education requirements, senior colleges and universities vary in the nature and number of professional courses that should be taken during the freshman and sophomore years. When planning a program with an advisor, students who have determined which profession or occupation they plan to enter should study the catalog of the institution to which th ey plan to transfer. Students who change their major upon transfer to a University System of Georgia college or university may have to complete additional hours of coursework beyond those required for comple tion of the baccalaureate degree program. Students who complete a transfer program are eligible for an Associate of Arts degree or an Associate of Science degree. Associate of Arts The Associate of Arts degree represents freshm an and sophomore requirements for baccalaureate degrees granted in senior institution schools of Arts and Sciences. These degrees have a foreign language or higher mathematics requirement. The college urges studen ts to confer with the senior institution to which they plan to transfer and to take the required foreign language and mathematics courses here. The Associate of Arts degree is offered in the following areas: Anthropology Foreign Language with a Philosophy Art Concentration in Business Physics Biology Geology Political Science Chemistry History Psychology Communication Journalism/Professional Writing Sociology English Mathematics Theatre Foreign Language Associate of Science The Associate of Science degree represents freshm an and sophomore requirements for baccalaureate degrees granted by senior institutions in schools other than Arts and Sciences. These degrees generally have no foreign language requirement. The Associate of Science degree is offered in the following areas: Art Business Administration Music Computer Science Pre-Dentistr y/Pre- Medicine/Pre-Pharmacy Criminal Justice Psychology Engineering Social Work General Studies Teacher Education Health & Physical Education 110 2006-2008 Other Transfer Programs of Study Although Georgia Perimeter College does not offer associate's degree pr ograms in other transfer areas, students may complete a portion of the requirements for other programs offered at four-year colleges and universities while attending GPC. Students should co nsult with advisors in Advising and Counseling Services regarding coursework which may be taken at Georgia Perimeter College to be applied toward these programs. Core Curriculum Areas A - F Common to transfer program degrees is a core curriculum in (A) Essential Skills, (B) Institutional Options, (C) Humanities and Fine Arts, (D) Science, Mathematics, and Technology, (E) Social Sciences, and (F) Courses Appropriate to the Program of Study. These courses are the prescribed fr eshman and sophomore requirements for the University System of Georgia baccalaureate (4-year) degrees . Some minor variations in the choice of acceptable courses exist from one senior institution to the next, depending upon major. Students are advised to obtain a catalog from the senior institution to which they plan to transf er and carefully select courses acceptable to that institution. Students may not use any course to fulfill requirements in more than one core Area (A - F). If the same course is listed in more than one core curriculum area, the student completing the course to meet the requirements in one core area must take another course in the second core area to meet the requirements of the second core area. In other words, no course may be used more than one time in any Program of Study. Majors that do not have a higher mathematics re quirement are considered non-math-based majors. Students in these majors should follow the Core I as listed below. Other majors have a higher mathematics requirement and are considered math-based majors. St udents in these majors should follow the Core II. General Education Outcomes A student who completes the core curriculum at Georgia Perimeter College will be able to do the following: Communicate effectively through speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Demonstrate effective problem solving and critical thinking skills. Understand, interpret, and communicate quantitative data. Locate, organize, and analyze information through the use of a variety of computer applications. Demonstrate an understanding of the importance of the arts and literature in the human experience. Recognize and apply scientific inquiry in a variety of settings. Identify, analyze, and evaluate global econom ic, political, historical, and geographic forces. Identify and apply the basic concepts of wellness.

Academic courses are offered in a variety of modes: Online over the Internet, Teleweb courses using videotapes as part of the basic delivery system with added options of computer use and electronic communication, Hybrid classes combining onlin e and in-class teaching, and Courses using a two-way interactive video network. Students enrolling in ONLY off-campus distance learning courses are exempt from the immunization requirements. If a student later chooses to register for courses offered on campus, the exemption becomes void and the students will be required to provide proof of immunizations. Online Courses Online courses are offered over the Internet. Us ing a computer and the WebCT Vista course management tool, students can access course notes and assignments on the World Wide Web. These may be supplemented with CD-ROMs and videotapes in some courses. Students can communicate with the instructor and classmates using e-mail, online chat, el ectronic bulletin boards, or a combination of methods, including face-to-face meetings. Computer access and literacy are necessary for success in onlin e courses. Teleweb Courses Teleweb courses are academic, college-credit courses th at use videotapes or DVD's as part of the basic delivery system. These courses combin e videos or DVD's with printed materials that have been prepared by professional educators, instructional designers, and producers. A faculty member at GPC facilitates the course and is the students' primary contact by telephone or through e-mail. Students can use computers to help with assignment preparation, notes, questions, attachments, and communication with faculty and other students. Computer access and liter acy are necessary for success in completion of teleweb courses. Hybrid Courses Hybrid courses are courses in which a significant portion of the learning activities have been moved online and the time spent in a classroom is reduced, but not eliminated. The goal of the hybrid course is to join the best features of in-class teaching with the be st features of online learning and reduce class seat time. Using computer-based technologi es, instructors use the hybrid model to redesign some lecture or lab content into new online learning activities, such as cas e studies, tutorials, self-testing exercises and online group collaborations.
