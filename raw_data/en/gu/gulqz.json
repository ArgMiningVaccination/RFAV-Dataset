These sacred gatherings are held and facilitated in the beautiful tradition as taught by our dear teacher, healer, brother & friend, Ger Lyons of Ireland. This work offers a very simple, yet profound practice of dismantling all that is obstructing our innate relationship to truth, to healing and to love. A releasing and dissolving occurs of anything that blocks us from thriving in our fullest connection with Source, with ourselves, and with others. This is an incredible journey into the inherent Wisdom of the Heart. The effects of this transformational alchemy have the potential to touch our past, present, and our future. It works on a cellular level with our DNA and our ancestral lineage, as well as with our soul's memory and all of our incarnations. It moves into our families, our communities, the collective consciousness and into the Universe. This energy and grace becomes exponential as we come together in an intentionally deep, and highly Sacred way. "}
