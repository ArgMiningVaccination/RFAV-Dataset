Sincerely, Maurice SmithDRAFTGB16 HCSCGRANDFATHERED HEALTH PLAN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT This group health plan believes this is a \"grandfathered health plan\" under the Affordable Care Act. As permitted by the Affordable Care Act, a grandfathered health plan can preserve certain basic health coverage that was already in effectwhen that law was enacted. Being a grandfathered health plan means that your Certificate may not include certain consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act that apply to other plans, for example, the requirement for the provision ofpreventive health services without any cost sharing. However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other consumer protections in the Afford\u00ad able Care Act, for example, the elimination of lifetime dollar limits on benefitsfor any individual. Questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not ap\u00ad ply to a grandfathered health plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status can be directed to your Employer or the Plan Administrator. You may also contact the Illinois Department of Insurance at (877) 5279431 or http://insurance.illinois.gov. If your health plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act(ERISA), you may also contact the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor at 18664443272 or www.dol.gov/ebsa/healthre \u00ad form. This Web site has a table summarizing which protections do and do not apply to grandfathered health plans.

(Contact your Group or Member Ser\u00ad vices at 18008922803 for information regarding service area.); and, \u2014 If Medicare eligible, have both Part A and B coverage. REPLACEMENT OF DISCONTINUED GROUP COVERAGE When your Group initially purchases this coverage, if such coverage is purchased as replacement of coverage under another carrier's group policy, persons who are Totally Disabled on the effective date of this coverage but who otherwise meet the definition of an Eligible Person under this coverage and who were covered underthe prior group policy will be eligible for coverage under this Certificate. Totally Disabled dependents of an Eligible Person will be considered eligible de\u00ad pendents under this Certificate provided such dependents meet the description of an eligible family member as specified below under the heading Family Cover\u00ad age. Depende nt children who have reached the limiting age of this Certificate will be considered eligible dependents under this Certificate if they were covered un\u00ad der the prior group policy and, because of a handicapped condition, are incapable of self sustaining employment and are dependent upon the Eligible Person or oth\u00ad er care providers for lifetime care and supervision. Such Totally Disabled persons will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Certifi\u00ad cate. Benefits will be coordinated with benefits under the prior group policy andthe prior group policy will be considered the primary coverage for all services rendered in connection with the disability when no coverage is available under this Certificate due to the absence of coverage in this Certificate. The provisions of this Certificate regarding Primary Care Physician referral remain in effect for such Totally Disabled persons. INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE If you have Individual Coverage, only your own health care expenses are cov\u00ad ered, not the health care expenses of other members of your family. FAMILY COVERAGE Under Family Coverage, your health care expenses and those of your enrolled spouse and your (and/or your spouse's) children who are under the limiting age specified in the BENEFIT HIGHLIGHTS section will be covered. All of the pro\u00ad visions of this Certificate that pertain to a spouse also apply to a party of a CivilUnion unless specifically noted otherwise. A Domestic Partner and his or herchildren w ho have not attained the limiting age specified in the BENEFIT HIGH\u00ad LIGHTS section are also eligible dependents. All of the provisions of thisCertificate that pertain to a spouse also apply to a Domestic Partner unless specifi\u00ad cally noted otherwise.DRAFT10 GB16 HCSCIn addition, enrolled unmarried children will be covered up to the age of 30 if they: /C0083Live within the Plan's service area; and /C0083Have served as an active or reserve member of any branch of the ArmedForces of the United States; and /C0083Have received a release or discharge other than a dishonorable discharge. Coverage for unmarried children will end on the limiting age birthday. If you have Family Coverage, newborn children will be covered from the moment of birth as long as the Plan receives notice of the birth within 31 days of the birth.Your Group Administrator can tell you how to submit the proper notice. Children who are under your legal guardianship or who are in your custody under an interim court order prior to finalization of adoption or placement of adoption vesting temporary care, whichever comes first, will be covered. In addition, if you have children for whom you are required by court order to provide health carecoverage, those children will be covered. Any children who are incapable of selfsustaining employment and are dependent upon you or other care providers for lifetime care and supervision because of a handicapped condition occurring prior to reaching the limiting age will be cov\u00ad ered regardless of age as long as they were covered prior to reaching the limitingage specified in the BENEFIT HIGHLIGHTS section. This coverage does not include benefits for foster children or grandchildren (un\u00ad less such children have been legally adopted or are under your legal guardianship). MEDICARE ELIGIBLE COVERED PERSONS A series of federal laws collectively referred to as the \"Medicare Secondary Pay\u00ad er\" (MSP) laws regulate the manner in which certain employers may offer group health care cov erage to Medicare eligible employees, spouses, and in some cases, dependent children. The statutory requirements and rules for MSP coverage vary depending on the basis for Medicare and employer group health plan (\"GHP\") coverage, as well ascertain other factors, including the size of the employers sponsoring the GHP. In general, Medicare pays secondary to the following: 1. GHPs that cover individuals with endstage renal disease (\"ESRD\") during the first 30 months of Medicare eligibility or entitlement. This is the case regardless of the number of employees employed by the employer or w hether the individual has \"current employment status.\" 2. In the case of individuals age 65 or over, GHPs of employers that employ 20 or more employees if that individual or the individual'sspouse (of any age) has \"current employment status.\" If the GHP isa multiemployer or multiple employer plan, which has at least oneparticipating employer that employs 20 or more employees, the MSP rules apply even with respect to employers of fewer than 20 em\u00adDRAFT11 GB16 HCSCployees (unless the plan elects the small employer exception under the statute). 3. In the case of disabled individuals under age 65, GHPs of employers that employ 100 or more employees, if the individual or a member of the individual's family has \"current employee status.\" If the GHP isa multiemployer or multiple employer plan, which has at least oneparticipating employer that employs 100 or more employees, theMSP rules apply even with respect to employers of fewer than 100employees. Please see your employer or Group Administrator if you have any questions regarding the ESRD Primary Period or any other provisions of the MSP laws and their application to you, your spouse or your dependents. Your MSP Responsibilities In order to assist your employer in complying with MSP laws, it is very important that you promptly and accurately complete any requests for information from the Plan and/or your employer regarding the Medicare eligibility of you, your spouseand covered dependent children. In addition, if you, your spouse or covered de\u00ad pendent child becomes eligible for Medicare, or has Medicare eligibility terminated or changed, please contact your employer or your group administrator promptly to ensure that your claims are processed in accordance with applicableMSP laws. YOUR IDENTIFICATION CARD You will receive an identification (ID) card from the Plan. Your ID card contains your identification number, the name of the Participating IPA/Participating Medi\u00ad cal Group that you have selected and the phone number to call in an emergency. Always carry your ID card with you.

This includes, but is not limited to, loss of coverage due to: a. Legal separation, divorce, dissolution of a Civil Union, cessation of dependent status, death of an employee, termination of employ\u00adment, or reduction in number of hours of employment; b. In the case of HMO, coverage is no longer provided because an in\u00ad dividual no longer resides in the service area or the HMO no longer offers coverage in the HMO service area in which the individual resides; c. Reaching a lifetime limit on all benefits in another group health plan; d. Another group health plan no longer offering any benefits to the class of similarly situated individuals that includes you or your de\u00adpendent; e. When Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage is terminated as a result of loss eligibility; or f. When you or your dependents become eligible for a premium as\u00ad sistance subsidy under Medicaid or CHIP. \u2014 Termination of employer contributions towards your or your dependent's other coverage. \u2014 Exhaustion of COBRA continuation coverage or state continuation cover\u00ad age.

Benefits will not be provided for any treatment of an illness or injury to a newborn child unless you have Family Coverage. (Remember, you must add the newborn child within 31 days of the date of birth.) CHANGING FROM FAMILY TO INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE You can apply to change from Family to Individual Coverage at any time.

It is your Gr oup's responsibility to inform you of the termination of the Group Policy but your coverage will be terminated regardlessof whether or not such notice is given. Upon termination of your coverage under this Certificate, you will be issued a Certificate of Creditable Coverage.

NOTE: Certain employers may not be affected by CONTINUATION OF COV\u00ad ERAGE RIGHTS UNDER COBRA. See your employer or Group Administrator should you have any questions about COBRA. Introduction You are receiving this notice because you have recently become covered under your employer's group health plan (the Plan). This notice contains important in\u00ad formation about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is aDRAFT15 GB16 HCSCtemporary extension of coverage under the Plan. This notice generally explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect the right to receive it. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose your group health coverage. It can also become available to other members of your family who are covered under the Plan when they would otherwise lose their group health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's Summary Plan Description orcontact the Plan Administrator. What Is COBRA Continuation Coverage? COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Spe\u00ad cific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become quali\u00ad fied beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifyingevent. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If you are an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: /C0083Your hours of employment are reduced; or /C0083Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: /C0083Your spouse dies; /C0083Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; /C0083Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; /C0083Your spouse becomes enrolled in Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, orboth); or /C0083You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverageunder the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happen: /C0083The parentemployee HCSC/C0083The parentemployee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; /C0083The parentemployee becomes enrolled in Medicare benefits (under Part A,Part B, or both); /C0083The parents become divorced or legally separated; or /C0083The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \"dependentchild.\" If the Plan provides health care coverage to retired employees, the following ap\u00adplies: Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the UnitedStates Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to your employer, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired employee covered under the Plan, the retired employee will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired employee's spouse, surviving spouse, and dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under the Plan. When Is COBRA Coverage Available? The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has oc\u00ad curred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the employee, in the event of retired employee healthcoverage, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the em\u00ad ployer, or the employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A,Part B, or both), the employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the qualify\u00ad ing event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. Contact your employer and/or COBRA Administrator for procedures for this notice, including a description of any required information or documentation. How Is COBRA Coverage Provided? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficia\u00ad ries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation cov\u00ad erage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuationcoverage on behalf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. When the qualifying event is the death of the employee, the employee's becoming en\u00ad titled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), your divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child's losing eligibility as a dependent child, COBRA continuation coverage lasts for up to 36 months.DRAFT17 GB16 HCSCWhen the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the em\u00ad ployee's hours of employment, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries other than the employee lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee be\u00adcomes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date on which his employmentterminates, COBRA continuation coverage for his spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 monthsafter the date of the qualifying event (36 months minus 8 months). Otherwise, when the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the em\u00ad ployee's hours of employment, COBRA continuation coverage generally lasts foronly up to a total of 18 months. There are two ways in which this 18month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended. Disability Extension of 18Month Period of Continuation Coverage If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by the So\u00ad cial Security Administration to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60thday of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18month period of continuation coverage. Contact your employer and/or the COBRA Administrator for procedures for this notice, including a description of any required information or documentation. Second Qualifying Event Extension of 18Month Period of Continuation Coverage If your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maxi\u00ad mum of 36 months, if notice of the second qualifying event is properly given to the Plan. This extension may be available to the spouse and dependent children receiving continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies, be\u00ad comes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or gets divorced or legally separated or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child, but only if the event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Plan or your COBRA continuation coverage rights, should be addressed to your Plan Administrator.

The provisions which apply to you will depend upon your status at the time of termination. The provisions described in Article A will apply if you are the Eli\u00ad gible Person (as specified in the Group Policy) at the time of termination.

The provisions described in Article C will apply if you are the dependent child of anEligible Person who has died or if you have reached the limiting age under this Certificate and not eligible to continue coverage as provided under Article B. Your continued coverage under this Certificate will be provided only as specified below. Therefore, after you have determined which Article applies to you, please read the provisions very carefully. ARTICLE A: Continuation of coverage if you are the Eligible Person If an Eligible Person's coverage under this Certificate should terminate because of termination of employment or membership or because of a reduction in hours below the minimum required for eligibility, an Eligible Person will be entitled to continue the Hospital, Physician and Supplemental coverage provided under thisCertificate for himself/herself and his/her eligible dependents (if he/she had Fam\u00ad ily Coverage on the date of termination).

Prior to your admission, your Primary Care Physician or Woman's Principal Health Care Provider must obtain approval of your admission from the Participating IPA/Participating MedicalGroup with which he/she is affiliated or employed. The P articipating IPA/Partici\u00ad pating Medical Group may recommend other courses of treatment that could helpyou avoid an Inpatient stay. It is your responsibility to cooperate with any recom\u00ad mendations made by the Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group. CONCURRENT REVIEW Once you have been admitted to a Hospital as an Inpatient, your length of stay will be reviewed by the Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group. The pur\u00ad pose of that review is to ensure that your length of stay is appropriate given your diagnosis and the treatment that you are receiving. This is known as Concurrent Review. If your Hospital stay is longer than the usual length of stay for your type of condi\u00ad tion, the Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group will contact your Primary Care Physician or Woman's Principal Health Care Provider to determine whether there is a medically necessary reason for you to remain in the Hospital. Should it be determined that your continued stay in the Hospital is not medically necessary, you will be informed of that decision, in writing, and of the date that your benefits for that stay will end.DRAFT65 GB16 HCSCEXCLUSIONS \u2014 WHAT IS NOT COVERED Expenses for the following are not covered under your benefit program: \u2014 Services or supplies that are not specifically stated in this Certificate. \u2014 Services or supplies that were not ordered by your Primary Care Physician or Woman's Principal Health Care Provider except as explained in the EMERGENCY CARE BENEFITS section, SUBSTANCE USE DIS\u00adORDER TREATMENT BENEFITS section, HOSPITAL BENEFITS section and, for Mental Illness (other than Serious Mental Illness) or routine vision examinations, in the PHYSICIAN BENEFITS section of this Certi\u00adficate. \u2014 Services or supplies that were received prior to the date your coverage be\u00ad gan or after the date that your coverage was terminated. \u2014 Services or supplies for which benefits have been paid under any Workers' Compensation Law or other similar laws whether or not you make a claimfor such compensation or receive such benefits.

COB does not apply to the Outpatient Prescription Drug Program Bene\u00ad fits. The order of benefit determination rules should be looked at first. Those rules de\u00ad termine whether the benefits of this Benefit Program are determined before or after those of another Benefit Program. The benefits of this Benefit Program: 1. Shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, this Benefit Program determines its benefits before another Benefit Pro\u00adgram; but 2. May be reduced when, under the order of benefits determination rules, another Benefit Program determines its benefits first. This reduction is de\u00adscribed below in \"When this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program.\" In addition to the Definitions Section of this Certificate, the following definitionsapply to this section: ALLOWABLE EXPENSE.....means a Covered Service, when the Covered Service is covered at least in part by one or more Benefit Program covering the person for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private Hospital room and the cost of a semiprivate Hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense underthis definition unless your stay in a private Hospital room is medically ne\u00ad cessary either in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or as specifically defined in the Benefit Program, or if a private Hospital room is the only room available. When a Benefit Program provides benefits in the form of services, the rea\u00ad sonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. BENEFIT PROGRAM.....means any of the following that provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (i) Individual or group insurance or grouptype coverage, whether insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individualpractice coverage. It also includes coverage other than school acci\u00ad dent-type coverage. (ii) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (Title XIX of the Social Security Act). Each contract or other arrangement under (i) or (ii) above is a separate bene\u00ad fit program. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply onlyto one of the two, each of the parts is a separate Benefit Program. CLAIM DETERMINATION PERIOD.....means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage un\u00adDRAFT69 GB16 HCSCder this Benefit Program, or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. PRIMARY PROGRAM or SECONDARY PROGRAM.....means the order of payment responsibility as determined by the order of benefit determination ru\u00adles. When this Benefit Program is the Primary Program, its benefits are deter\u00admined before those of the other Benefit Program and without considering the other program's benefits. When this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program, its benefits are deter\u00ad mined after those of the other Benefit Program and may be reduced because of the other program's benefits. When there are more than two Benefit Programs covering the person, this Benefit Program may be a Primary Program as to one or more other pro\u00ad grams, and may be a Secondary Program as to a different program orprograms. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION When there is a basis for a Claim under this Benefit Program and another Benefit Program, this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program that has its benefits deter\u00ad mined after those of the other program, unless: 1. The other Benefit Program has rules coordinating its benefits with those of this Benefit Program; and 2. Both those rules and this Benefit Program's rules, described below, require that this Benefit Program's benefits be determined before those of the otherBenefit Program. This Benefit Program determines its order of benefit payments using the first of the following rules that applies: 1. NonDependent or Dependent The benefits of the Benefit Program that covers the person as an employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than a dependent) are determined before those of the Benefit Program that covers the person as dependent, exceptthat, if the person is also a Medicare beneficiary, Medicare is: a. Secondary to the Benefit Program covering the person as a dependent; and b. Primary to the Benefit Program covering the person as other than a de\u00ad pendent, for example a retired employee. 2. Dependent Child if Parents not Separated or Divorced Except as stated in rule 3 below, when this Benefit Program and another Be\u00adnefit Program cover the same child as a dependent of dif ferent persons, (i. e., \"parents\").DRAFT70 GB16 HCSCa. The benefits of the program of the parent whose birthday (month and day) falls earlier in a calendar year are determined before those of the program of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but b. If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the Benefit Pro\u00ad gram that covered the parents longer are determined before those ofthe Benefit Program that covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other Benefit Program does not have this birthdaytype rule, but instead has a rule based upon gender of the parent, and if, as a result, the Benefit Programs do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other Benefit Program will determine the order of benefits. 3. Dependent Child if Parents Separated or Divorced If two or more Benefit Programs cover a person as a dependent child of di\u00advorced or separate parents, benefits for the child are determined in thisorder: a. First, the program of the parent with custody of the child; b. Then, the program of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and c. Finally, the program of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obli\u00ad gated to pay or provide the benefits of the program of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that program are determined first. The program of the other parent shall be the Secondary Program. This doesnot apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Benefit Pro\u00ad gram year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the entity has that actual knowledge. It is the obligation of the person claiming benefits to notify the Plan and, upon its request, to provide a copy of the court decree. 4. Dependent Child if Parents Share Joint Custody If the specific terms of a court decree state that the parents shall share jointcustody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the Benefit Programs covering the child shall fol\u00ad low the order of benefit determination rules outlined in 2 above. 5. Young Adults as a Dependent For a dependent child who has coverage under either or both parents' plansand also has his or her own coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, rule 8, \"Length of Coverage\" applies. In the event the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the dependentchild's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined by applying the birthday rule of rule 2 to the dependent child's parent or parents and the dependent's spouse. DRAFT71 GB16 HCSC6. Active or Inactive Employee The benefits of neither a Benefit Program that covers a person as an employ\u00ad ee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent) are determined before those of a Benefit Program that covers that person as alaidoff or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the other Benefit Program does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Benefit Pro\u00ad grams do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule shall not apply. 7. Continuation Coverage If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation pur\u00adsuant to federal or state law also is covered under another Benefit Program, the following shall be the order of benefit determination: a. First, the benefits of a Benefit Program covering the person as an em\u00ad ployee, member or subscriber (or as that person's dependent); b. Second, the benefits under the continuation coverage. If the other Benefit Program does not contain the order of benefits deter\u00admination described within this section, and if, as a result, the programs do not agree on the order of benefits, this requirement shall be ignored. 8. Length of Coverage If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits ofthe Benefit Program which covered an employee, member or subscriber lon\u00ad ger are determined before those of the Benefit Program which covered that person for the shorter term. WHEN THIS BENEFIT PROGRAM IS A SECONDARY PROGRAM In the event this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program as to one or more other Benefit Programs, the benefits of this Benefit Program may be reduced. The benefits of this Benefit Program will be reduced when the sum of: 1. The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under this Benefit Program in the absence of this COB provision; and 2. The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other Benefit Programs, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this exceeds those Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of this Benefit Program will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other Benefit Programs do not total more than those Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of this Benefit Program are reduced as described, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this Benefit Program.DRAFT72 GB16 HCSCRIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. The Plan has the right to de\u00ad cide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. The Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under this Benefit Program must give thePlan any facts it needs to pay the Claim. FACILITY OF PAYMENT A payment made under another Benefit Program may include an amount that should have been paid under this Benefit Program. If it does, the Plan may pay that amount to the organization that made the payment under the other Benefit Program. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this Benefit Program. The Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of payments made by the Plan is more than it should have paid un\u00ad der this COB provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of: 1. The persons it has paid or for whom it has paid; 2. Insurance companies; or 3. Other organizations. The foregoing not withstanding, you will only be responsible for any applicable Copayments, deductibles and/or Coinsurance as described in this Certificate. The \"amount of payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any bene\u00ad fits provided in the form of services. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS \u2014 SA VINGS The amount by which your benefits under this Benefit Program have been re\u00ad duced is called your \"savings.\" Savings can be used to pay for services that are not covered under this Benefit Program provided that the services are covered un\u00ad der another Benefit Program and were not completely paid for under that BenefitProgram. Savings can only be used to pay for services rendered in the same calen\u00ad dar year in which the Claim that earned the savings is actually processed. Please notify the Plan, by calling customer service, if there are expenses incurred during this calendar year which may entitle you to these additional benefits.DRAFT73 GB16 HCSCHOW TO FILE A CLAIM When you receive care from your Primary Care Physician or from another Pro\u00ad vider who is affiliated with your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group, or from your Woman's Principal Health Care Provider, a Claim for benefits does not have to be filed with the Plan. All you have to do is show your Plan ID card to your Provider. However, to receive benefits for care from another Physician or Provider, you must be referred to that Provider by your Primary Care Physician or Woman's Principal Health Care Provider. When you receive care from Providers outside of your Participating IPA/Partici\u00ad pating Medical Group (i.e. emergency care, medical supplies), usually all you have to do to receive your benefits under this Certificate is to, again, show your Plan ID card to the Provider. Any Claim filing required will be done by the Pro\u00ad vider. There may be situations when you have to file a Claim yourself (for example, if a Provider will not file one for you). To do so, send the following to the Plan: 1. an itemized bill from the Hospital, Physician or other Provider (including the Provider's name and address, the patient's name, the diagnosis, the date of service, a description of the service and the Claim Charge); 2. the Eligible Person's name and Plan ID number; 3. the patient's name, age and sex; 4. any additional relevant information. Mail all of that information to: Blue Cross and Blue Shield 300 East Randolph Street Chicago, Illinois 606015099 In any case, it is your responsibility to make sure that the necessary Claim in\u00ad formation has been provided to the Plan. Claims must be filed no later than December 31st of the calendar year following the year in which the Covered Ser\u00ad vice was rendered. For the purposes of this filing time limit, Covered Servicesrendered in December will be considered to have been rendered in the next calen\u00ad dar year. If you have any questions about a Claim, call Member Services at 18008922803. FILING OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM CLAIMS In certain situations, you will have to file your own Claims in order to obtain benefits under the Outpatient Prescription Drug Program. This is primarily true when you did not receive an identification card, th e pharmacy was unable to transmit a claim or you received benefits from a nonParticipating PrescriptionDrug Provider. To do so, follow these instructions:DRAFT74 GB16 HCSC1. Complete an Outpatient Prescription Drug Program Claim Form. These forms are available from your Employee Benefits Department or from the Plan. 2. Attach copies of all pharmacy receipts to be considered for benefits. These receipts must be itemized. 3. Mail the completed Claim Form with attachments to: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of IllinoisP. O. Box 64812 St. Paul, MN 551640812 In any case, Claims must be filed no later than one year after the date a service is received. Claims not filed within one year from the date a service is received, will not be eligible for payment. INTERNAL CLAIMS DETERMINATIONS AND APPEALS PROCESS INITIAL CLAIMS DETERMINATIONS The Plan will usually process all Claims according to the terms of the benefit pro\u00ad gram within 30 days of receipt of all information required to process a Claim. In the event that the Plan does not process a Claim within this 30day period, you or the valid assignee shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 9% per year, from the 30th day after the receipt of all Claim information until the date payment is actuallymade. However, interest payment will not be made if the amount is $1.00 or less. The Plan will usually notify you, your valid assignee, or your authorized represen\u00adtative when all information required to process a Claim in accordance with the terms of the benefit program within 30 days of the Claim's receipt has not been re\u00ad ceived. (For information regarding assigning benefits, see \"Payment of Claims and Assignment of Benefits\" provisions in the OTHER THINGS YOU SHOULDKNOW section of this Certificate.) If a Claim Is Denied or Not Paid in Full If the claim for benefit is denied in whole or in part, you or your authorized representative shall be notified in writing of the following: a. The reasons for determination; b. A reference to the benefit plan provisions on which the denial is based, or the contractual, administrative or protocol for the determination; c.

Contact information for applicable office of health insurance consum\u00ad er assistance or ombudsman. INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS An \"Inquiry\" is a general request for information regarding claims, benefits, or membership. A \"Complaint\" is an expression of dissatisfaction by you either orally or in writ\u00ad ing.The Plan has a team available to assist you with Inquiries and Complaints. Issues may include, but are not limited to, the following: Claims Quality of care When your Complaint relates to dissatisfaction with a Claim denial (or partial de\u00adnial), then you have the right to a Claim review/appeal as described in the CLAIMAPPEAL PROCEDURES.DRAFT76 GB16 HCSCTo pursue an Inquiry or a Complaint, you may contact Customer Service at the number on the back of your identification card, or you may write to: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois 300 East RandolphChicago, Illinois 60601 When you contact Customer Service to pursue an Inquiry or Complaint, you willreceive a written acknowledgement of your call or correspondence.

If the Plan needs more information, you will be contacted. If a response to your Inquiry or Complaint will be delayed due to the need for additional informa\u00ad tion, you will be contacted. If an Inquiry or Complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction, you may appeal to the Plan. Timing of Required Notices and Extensions Separate schedules apply to the timing of required notices and extensions, de\u00ad pending on the type of Claim. There are three types of Claims as defined below. a. Urgent Care Clinical Claim is any preservice claim for benefits for medi\u00ad cal care or treatment with respect to which the application of regular time periods for making health Claim decisions could seriously jeopardize thelife or health of the claimant or the ability of the claimant to regain maxi\u00admum function or, in the opinion of a Physician with knowledge of theclaimant's medical condition, would subject the claimant to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment. b. PreService Claim is any nonurgent request for benefits or a determination with respect to which the terms of the benefit plan condition receipt of thebenefit on approval of the benefit in advance of obtaining medical care. c. PostService Claim is notification in a form acceptable to the Plan that a service has been rendered or furnished to you. This notification must in\u00adclude full details of the service received, including your name, age, sex,identification number, the name and address of the Provider, an itemizedstatement of the service rendered or furnished, the date of service, the diag\u00adnosis, the Claim charge, and any other information which the Plan mayrequest in connection with services rendered to you.

Concurrent Care For benefit determinations relating to care that is being received at the same time as the determination, such notice will be provided no later than 24 hours after re\u00ad ceipt of your Claim for benefits. CLAIM APPEAL PROCEDURES Claim Appeal Procedures - Definitions An \"Adverse Benefit Determination\" means a denial, reduction, or termination of, or a failure to provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for, a benefit, in\u00ad cluding any such denial, reduction, termination, or failure to provide in response to a Claim, PreService Claim or Urgent Care Clinical Claim or make payment for, a benefit resulting from the application of utilization review, as well as a failure to cover an item or service for which benefits are otherwise provided because it is de\u00ad termined to be experimental or investigational or not medically necessary or appropriate. If an ongoing course of treatment had been approved by the Plan and the Plan reduces or terminates such treatment (other than by amendment or ter\u00admination of the Group's benefit plan) before the end of the approved treatmentperiod, that is also an Adverse Benefit Determination. A rescission of coverage is also an Adverse Benefit Determination. A rescission does not include a termination of coverage for reasons related to nonpayment of premium. In addition, an Adverse Benefit Determination, also includes an \"Adverse Deter\u00ad mination.\" An \"Adverse Determination\" means: a.a determination by the Plan or its designated utilization review organization that, based upon the information provided, a request for a benefit under theDRAFT79 GB16 HCSCPlan's health benefit plan upon application of any utilization review tech\u00ad nique does not meet the Plan's requirements for medical necessity,appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness or it is de\u00ad termined to be experimental or investigational and the requested benefit istherefore denied, reduced, or terminated or payment is not provided ormade, in whole or in part, for the benefit. b.the denial, reduction, or termination of or failure to provide or make pay\u00ad ment, in whole or in part, for a benefit based on a determination by the Plan or its designated utilization review organization that a preexisting conditionwas present before the effective date of coverage; or c.a rescission of coverage determination, which does not include a cancella\u00ad tion of discontinuance of coverage that is attributable to a failure to timely pay required premiums or contributions towards the cost of coverage. For purposes of this benefit program, we will refer to both an Adverse Determina\u00ad tion and an Adverse Benefit Determination as an Adverse Benefit Determination, unless indicated otherwise.

An expedited clinical appeal is an appeal of a clinically urgent nature related to health care services, including butnot limited to, procedures or treatments ordered by a health care provider, as wellas continued hospitalization. Before authorization of benefits for an ongoing course of treatment is terminated or reduced, Blue Cross and Blue Shield will pro\u00ad vide you with notice at least 24 hours before the previous benefits authorization ends and an opportunity to appeal. For the ongoing course of treatment, coverage will continue during the appeal process. Upon receipt of an expedited preservice or concurrent clinical appeal, the Plan will notify the party filing the appeal, as soon as possible, but in no event more than 24 hours after submission of the appeal, of all the information needed to re\u00ad view the appeal. The Plan will render a decision on the appeal within 24 hours after it receives the requested information, but in no event more than 48 hoursafter the appeal has been received by the Plan.

The Plan shall have the right to first reimbursement out of all funds you, your covered dependents or your legal representative, are or were able to obtain for the same expenses the Plan has provided as a result of that sick\u00ad ness or injury. For the purposes of this provision, the cost of benefits provided will be the charges that would have been billed if you had not been enrolled under this bene\u00ad fit program. You are required to furnish any information or assistance and to provide any doc\u00ad uments that the Plan m ay request in order to obtain its rights under this provision. PLAN'S SEPARATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS The Plan has contracts with certain Providers and other suppliers of goods and services for the provision of and/or payment for health care goods and services to all persons entitled to health care benefits under individual and group policies orcontracts to which the Plan is a party, including all persons covered under your Group's Policy. Under certain circumstances described in its contracts with such Providers and suppliers, the Plan may: \u2014 receive substantial payments from Providers or suppliers with respect to goods, supplies and services furnished to all such persons for which the Plan was obligated to pay the Provider or supplier, or \u2014 pay Providers or suppliers substantially less than their Claim Charges for goods or services, by discount or otherwise, orDRAFT93 GB16 HCSC\u2014 receive from Providers or suppliers other substantial allowances under the Plan's contracts with them. Your Group understands that the Plan may receive such payments, discounts, and/ or other allowances during the term of the Policy. Neither you nor your Group are entitled to receive any portion of any such pay\u00ad ments, discounts, and/or other allowances. Any Copayments and/or deductibles payable by you are predetermined fixed amounts, based upon the selected benefit plan, which are not impacted by any discounts or contractual allowances which the Plan may receive from a Provider. INTERPLAN ARRANGEMENTS OutofArea Services The Plan has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans and their Licensed Controlled Affiliates (\"Licensees\"). Generally, these re\u00adlationships are called \"InterPlan Arrangements\". These InterPlan Arrangements work based on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield As\u00ad sociation (\"Association\"). Whenever you obtain health care services outside of your Plan's service area and your Participating IPA's/Participating Medical Group's service area (collectively referred to in this section as \"the service area\"), the Claims for these services may be processed through one of these InterPlan Arrangements. When you receive care outside the service area, you will receive it from one of two kinds of health care Providers. Most Providers (\"participating Providers\") contract with t he local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some Providers (\"nonparticipating Providers\") do not con\u00ad tract with the Host Blue. The Plan's pa yment practices in both instances are described below. The Plan covers only limited health care services received outside of the service area. As used in this section, \"OutofArea Covered Healthcare Services\" includeemergency care, urgent care and followup care obtained outside the geographic area of the service area. Any other services will not be covered when processing through any InterPlan Arrangements, unless authorized by your Primary Care Physician (\"PCP\") or Women's Principal Health Care Provider (\"WPHCP\"). BlueCard /C0082 Program Under the BlueCard Program, when you receive OutofArea Covered Healthcare Services, as defined above, from a health care Provider participating with a Host Blue, the Plan will remain responsible for what we agreed to in the contract.However the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating healthcare Providers. The BlueCard Program enables you to obtain OutofArea Covered Healthcare Services, as defined above, from a health care Provider participating with a Host Blue, where available. The participating health care Provider will automaticallyfile a Claim for the OutofArea Covered Healthcare Services provided to you, soDRAFT94 GB16 HCSCthere are no Claim forms for you to fill out. You will be responsible for the Co\u00ad payment and/or Coinsurance amount, as stated in this Certificate. Emergency Care Services: If you experience a medical emergency while traveling outside the service area, go to the nearest emergency facility, urgent care facility, or other health care Pro\u00ad vider. Whenever you receive OutofArea Covered Healthcare Services outside the ser\u00ad vice area and the Claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for Covered Services, if not a flat dollar Copayment, is calculated based on the lower of: \u2014 The billed charges for your Covered Services, or \u2014 The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to the Plan. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare Provider. Sometimes, it is an es\u00ad timated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcareProvider or Provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive pay\u00ad ments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, also take into account adjustments to cor\u00ad rect for over or underestimation of pa st pricing of Claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price the Plan use[s] for your Claim because they will not be applied after a Claim has already been paid. NonParticipating Healthcare Providers Outside The Service Area Liability Calculation a. In General: Except for emergency care and urgent care, services received from a nonparticipating Provider outside of the service area will not be covered. For emergency care and urgent care services received from nonparticipat\u00ad ing Providers outside of your Participating IPA's/Participating Medical Group's service area, but within the Plan's service area, please refer to the EMERGENCY CARE BENEFITS section of this Certificate. For emergency care and urgent care services that are provided outside of the service area by a nonparticipating Provider, the amount(s) you pay for such services will be calculated using the methodology described in the EMER\u00ad GENCY CARE BENEFITS section for nonparticipating Providers located inside the service area. Federal or state law, as applicable, will govern pay\u00ad ments for outofnetwork emergency services.DRAFT95 GB16 HCSCb. Exceptions: In some exception cases, the Plan may, but is not required to, in its sole and absolute discretion, negotiate a payment with such nonparticipating Pro\u00ad vider on an exception basis.

Inpatient Services In most cases, if you contact the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center for assist\u00ad ance, hospitals will not require you to pay for covered inpatient services, except for your cost-share amounts/deductibles, coinsurance, etc. In such cases, the hos\u00ad pital will submit your claims to the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center to begin claims processing. However, if you paid in full at the time of service, you must submit a claim to receive reimbursement for Covered Services. Outpatient Services Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient Providers located outside the United States , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will typically require you to pay in full at the time of service. You must submit a Claim to obtain reimbursement for Covered Services. Submitting a BlueCard Worldwide /C0082 Claim When you pay for Covered Services outside the BlueCard service area, you must submit a Claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professionalClaims, you should complete a BlueCard Worldwide International Claim form and send the Claim form the Provider's itemized bill(s) to the BlueCard World\u00ad wide Service Center (the address is on the form) to initiate Claims processing. Following the instructions on the Claim form will help ensure timely processing of your Claim.

PLAN'S SEPARATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS REGARDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Plan's Separate Financial Arrangements with Prescription Drug Providers The Plan hereby informs you that it has contracts, either directly or indirectly, with Prescription Drug Providers (\"Participating Prescription Drug Providers\") toprovide prescription drug services to all persons entitled to prescription drug be\u00ad nefits under health policies and contracts to which the Plan is a party, including all persons covered under this Certificate. Under its contracts with Participating Pre\u00ad scription Drug Providers, the Plan may receive from these Providers discounts for prescription drugs dispensed to you. Neither the Group nor you are entitled to re\u00ad ceive any portion of any such payments, discounts and/or other allowances. For the 90day supply prescription drug program and Specialty Pharmacy pro\u00ad gram owned by Prime, Prime retains the difference between its acquisition cost and the negotiated prices as its fee for the various administrative services provided as part of the 90day supply prescription drug program and/or Specialty Pharmacy program. The Plan pays a fee to Prime for Pharmacy benefit services. A portion of Prime's PBM fees are tied to certain performance standards, includ\u00ading, but not limited to, Claims processing, customer service response, and home delivery processing. \"Weighted Paid Claim\" refers to the methodology of counting Claims for pur\u00ad poses of determining the Plan's fee payment to Prime. Each retail (including Claims dispensed through PBM's Specialty Pharmacy program) paid Claimequals one Weighted Paid Claim; each extended supply or home delivered order paid Claim equals three Weighted Paid Claims. However, the Plan pays Prime a Program Management Fee (\"PMF\") on a per paid claim basis. \"Funding Levers\" means a mechanism through with the Plan funds the fees (net fee, ancillary fees and special project fees) owed to PBM. Funding Levers always include manufac\u00adturer administrative fees, home delivery utilization, Participating Pharmacy transaction fees, and, if elected by the Plan, may include rebates and retail spread. The Plan's net fee owed to Prime for core services will be offset by the Funding Levers. The Plan pays Prime the net fee for core services, ancillary fees and spe\u00ad cial project fees, offset by all applicable Funding Levers as agreed upon under the terms of its agreement with Prime. The net fee is calculated based on a fixes dollar about per Weighted Paid Claim. The amounts received by Prime from the Plan, Pharmacies, manufacturers or oth\u00ad er third parties may be revised from time to time. Some of the amounts received by Prime may be charged each time a Claim is processed (or, in some instances, requested to be processed) through Prime and/or each time a prescription is filled, and include, but are not limited to, administrative fees charged by Prime to the Plan (as described above), administrative fees charged by Prime to Pharmacies, and administrative fees charged by Prime to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cur\u00ad rently, none of these fees will be passed on to you as expenses, or accrue to the benefit of you, unless otherwise specifically set forth in this Certificate. Addition\u00adDRAFT97 GB16 HCSCal information about these types of fees or the amount of these fees is available upon request. The maximum that Prime will receive from any pharmaceutical manufacturer for certain administrative fees will be 3% of the total sales for all rebatable products of such manufacturer dispensed during any given calendar year to members of the Plan and other Blue Plan operating divisions. Plan's Separate Financial Arrangements with Pharmacy Benefit Managers The Plan owns a significant portion of the equity of Prime Therapeutics LLC and informs you that the Plan has entered into one or more agreements with Prime Therapeutics LLC or other entities (collectively referred to as \"Pharmacy Benefit Managers\") to provide, on the Plan's behalf, Claim Payments and certain admin\u00ad istrative services for your prescription drug benefits. Pharmacy Benefit Managers have agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to receive rebates for using their products. The Pharmacy Benefit Manager may share a portion of those re\u00ad bates with the Plan. Neither the Group nor you are entitled to receive any portion of such rebates as they are figured into the pricing of the product. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS All benefit payments may be made by the Plan directly to any Provider furnishing the Covered Services for which such payment is due, and the Plan is authorized by you to make such payments directly to such Providers. However, the Plan re\u00ad serves the right to pay any benefits that are payable under the terms of this Certificate directly to you, unless reasonable evidence of a properly executed and enforceable Assignment of Benefit Payment has been received by the Plan suffi\u00ad ciently in advance of the Plan's benefit payment. The Plan reserves the right to require submission of a copy of the Assignment of Benefit Payment. You will not receive any notices regarding Covered Services received from your Primary Care Physician (or other Providers who are part of your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group) because Claims do not have to be filed forthose services. Once Covered Services are rendered by a Provider, you have no right to request that the Plan not pay the Claim submitted by such Provider and no such request will be given effect. In addition, the Plan will have no liability to you or any other person because of its rejection of such request. Except for the assignment of benefit payment described above, neither this Certif\u00ad icate nor a covered person's Claim for payment of benefits under this Certificate is assignable in whole or in part to any person or entity at any time, and coverage under this Certificate is expressly nonassignable and nontransferable and will be forfeited if you attempt to assign or transfer coverage or aid or attempt to aid anyother person in fraudulently obtaining coverage. COVERED SERVICES EXPENSE LIMITATION If, during any calendar year, you have paid Copayments, deductibles and/or any Coinsurance amount for Covered Services under this Certificate the total amount of which equals $1,500 per enrollee or $3,000 per family, your benefits for any additional Covered Services that you may receive during that calendar year, in\u00adDRAFT98 GB16 HCSCcluding any Copayment, deductible and/or Coinsurance amounts, will be reimbursed by the Plan.

In the event your Physician or the Hospital requires you to pay any additional Co\u00ad payments, deductible and/or Coinsurance amounts after you have met the above provision, upon receipt of properly authenticated documentation, the Plan will re\u00ad imburse to you, the amount of those Copaym ents, deductibles and/or Coinsurance amounts.

YOUR PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS The choice of a Hospital, Participating IPA, Participating Medical Group, Prima\u00ad ry Care Physician or any other Provider is solely your choice and the Plan will not interfere with your relationship with any Provider.
