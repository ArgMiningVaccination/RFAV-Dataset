To make a sound decision on treatment, the cancer patient needs to understand the different approaches undertaken by these cultures.Michael Lerner, Choices in Healing: Integrating The Best of Conventional and Complementary Approaches to Cancer At a glance Several medical approaches are available in pursuing cancer care. Each approach has a different focus and treatment approach. These may include treating cancerous cells and tissues with standard therapies or going beyond this to a more holistic view of disease using therapies to address body terrain imbalances and psychosocial contributors. An integrative approach combines both treatment approaches. Most people start with conventional medicine, which focuses on chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and more, and is described in Conventional Care. Beyond conventional care, many further choices are available in several distinct medical systems. Beyond conventional care, many further choices are available in several distinct medical systems. Along with further information below on this page, we provide links to directories of professionals and practitioners for each of these medical systems. Integrative medicine includes combining conventional medicine with evidence-based complementaryin cancer care, complementary care involves the use of therapies intended to enhance or add to standard conventional treatments; examples include supplements, mind-body approaches such as yoga or psychosocial therapy, and acupuncture and lifestyle medicine. Integrative oncologists are trained in conventional medicine, with additional training in integrating conventional and complementary approaches. Naturopathic medicine emphasizes prevention, treatment, and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances. Naturopathic oncologists with a \"FABNO\" designation are licensed in naturopathic medicine as well as certified in naturopathic oncology care. They are skilled at collaborating with conventional oncologists to bring an integrative approach to your cancer care. These practitioners can prescribe natural therapies and lifestyle approaches as well as recommend and coordinate your use of other complementary therapies within their areas of training in collaboration with your primary oncologist. Traditional medicine draws from centuries of experience and knowledge, often using local plants and natural substances to promote wellness and healing. Traditional medicine practitioners, such as within traditional Chinese medicine or Ayurveda, can bring added approaches and therapies to your cancer care. Many of these therapies are not typically used by naturopathic or functional physicians trained in Western approaches. Anthroposophic medicine pays equal attention to the body, soul, and spirit of the patient and includes a holistic understanding of humans and nature and of disease and treatment. It is integrated with conventional medicine in large hospitals and medical practices worldwide, but mostly in Europe. Anthroposophic health care is provided by medical doctors, therapists, and nurses. Homeopathic medicine is based on the theory that \"like cures like\"\u2014a very small dose of a substance that causes a symptom in a healthy person may cure the illness. Additional certifications and training: Any of the medical professionals described above may complete special training and certifications to enhance their cancer care. - Functional medicine practitioners work especially to identify imbalances in nutrition, hormones, and other factors that drive disease. - Terrain-certified practitioners are trained in determining appropriate therapies, including prescribing and monitoring off-label drugs, as part of an integrative cancer care plan. - Health professionals can also obtain advanced training in nutrition, yoga, herbal medicine, and other topics. In your community, you may also be able to find practitioners of specific therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, yoga, nutrition, physical therapy, and more. These therapies can assist with many side effects of cancer treatment and promote healing and wellness. When selecting professionals, we recommend that you start by finding and narrowing your candidates for your primary oncology provider. But wherever you start, within each type of medical system that you plan to use, ideally you'll want to find a professional who is willing to collaborate with professionals in your other chosen systems.

The health care system delivers to all people evidence-based, patient-centered care that prioritizes prevention, reduces cancer morbidity and mortality, and improves the lives of cancer survivors, including people living with cancer. Throughout our discussion of integrativein cancer care, a patient-centered approach combining the best of conventional care, self care and evidence-informed complementary care in an integrated plan cancer care and therapies, we discuss four medical benefits that align closely with this goal: - Improving treatment outcomes - Optimizing your body terrain - Managing side effects and promoting wellness - Reducing risk of recurrence or of cancer Different medical systems focus on each of these benefits to different degrees and with different approaches. You probably won't find one approach or professional who is strong in all these areas. Conventional (Western) medicine is strongest in treating cancer, using mainly chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and immunotherapy. For managing side effects, the most common approach is prescription or over-the-counter medications. Complementary medicine systems focus more on the other three medical benefits beyond improving treatment outcomes, although some complementary systems also have therapies that treat cancer effectively. Approaches include natural medicines from plants, minerals, and animals; mind-body and body-manipulation approaches; off-label drugs; involvement with your self-care practices; and other approaches. The different complementary systems each have their own philosophy and principles. We'll introduce you to these, but you'll need to interview any professionals to understand their approaches and goals and determine if those align with yours. You may need to start with one strategy, assess its strengths and weaknesses, and then find other approaches that will fill in some of those weaknesses. Most people start with conventional oncologists for their primary cancer care. Wherever you start, and within each type of medical system that you plan to use, ideally you'll want to find a professional who is willing to collaborate with professionals in your other chosen systems.

Integrative professionals in conventional cancer care We discuss conventional care and professionals in more detail in [Conventional Care ](https://cancerchoices.org/your-choices/choices-in-conventional-care/) We include our recommendations for sites with information about conventional treatments. A small but growing number of conventionally trained oncology physicians have recognized the need for a holistic, integrative approach to cancer care. Known as integrative oncologists, they have received additional training in integrative medicine, traditional medicine, or other approaches. These physicians can vary greatly in their training and specialization, including: - Their conventional training and specialization, such as radiation oncology or internal medicine - The cancer(s) they are skilled in treating; some generalize and others specialize in a specific cancer such as breast or colorectal - The integrative approach in which they have been trained, such as integrative medicine or traditional Chinese medicine - The integrative care that they provide, for example: - Whether they provide consultations on integrative approaches or the primary oncology care themselves - Their approach to complementary care, whether more conservative or more exploratory; some integrative oncologists may advise primarily on lifestyle approaches, incorporating supplements and mind-body practices, while others may support the use of off-label drugs Similarly, hospitals, cancer centers, and cancer care clinics offer integrative approaches, but integrative programs can vary from one location to another. Some offer a modest level of integrative care while others offer more depth by providing therapies requiring greater practitioner knowledge and skill. These may include therapies involving greater risk, requiring closer supervision and monitoring. Examples of degrees of integrative cancer care at hospitals, centers, and clinics: - Some may offer integrative cancer care with relatively light offerings such as yoga classes, dietary counseling, and perhaps some exercise classes. - Several more offer these plus acupuncture, a fuller range of mind-body therapiesapproaches that enhance your mind's capacity to positively affect your body's function and symptoms. Some interventions focus on calming your mind, improving focus, enhancing decision-making capacity, managing stress, or resolving conflict. Other interventions have a goal of relaxing both your mind and your body., massage therapy, and more. - Few offer the full range of complementary therapies that we discuss on this site: natural products, herbs, supplements, off-label prescription drugs, targeted timing of therapy, and more. See our database of [National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers ](https://cancerchoices.org/your-choices/how-to-integrate-your-choices/cancer-centers/) where you can browse or search by location or by the types of integrative care offered. Creating your cancer care team If you choose an integrative approach, you may need to take some time to assess your options for physicians and other practitioners, which can vary according to your location. Selecting a conventional oncologist will be a critical choice. Above all else, you want an oncologist who is skilled at caring for your specific cancer. If they are open to an integrative approach. that will be a plus. An integrative oncologist would be ideal in this role, but integrative oncologists are still rare. But if one is not available for you, and if you want to use an integrative approach to your care, you'll want to check that your oncologist candidates are open to collaborating with your choice of integrative and complementary medicine professionals (many are described on the rest of this page). If the best available oncologist for you is not open to collaborating, you may want to prioritize finding an integrative health professional trained in managing and combining conventional, complementary, and self-carelifestyle actions and behaviors that may impact cancer outcomes; examples include eating health-promoting foods, limiting alcohol, increasing physical activity, and managing stress approaches to cancer care. This person can oversee your choices to be sure you're selecting complementary therapies wisely to coordinate with your conventional treatments.

Evidence supports the use of many specific TCM therapies in cancer care to support or complement conventional treatments\u2014especially chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery\u2014mostly by managing side effects and improving your quality of life. Various certifications are available for TCM practitioners. These designations certify that a practitioner has undergone training and passed any certification requirements: - Diplomate of Oriental Medicine (Dipl OM) - Diplomate of Acupuncture (Dipl Ac) - Diplomate Chinese The term \"traditional Chinese medicine\" may be misleading, as this label is based on modern Western medical approaches and interpretations. Some healthcare professionals, including Chinese medicine practitioners and licensed acupuncturists, argue that Chinese medicine practices cannot be studied and interpreted within the framework of Western research methods. Western methods may not provide a clear or complete evaluation of therapies used in this medical approach. The term \"classical Chinese medicine\" is preferred by some to indicate a complete medical system guided by ancient classical texts and based on the traditional arts and practices of the naturalist philosophies of Daoism and Confucianism. In the introduction to Classical Chinese Medicine, Heiner Fruehauf states, \"Classical Chinese Medicine represents a fervent call for respecting the art of Chinese medicine as a science in its own right.\" [3]Lihong L.

If I were to get cancer now and need conventional oncology treatments, I would not have local access to an integrative oncologist. So what I would do is let the very competent local oncology center take care of the conventional side of treatment and pull in others to be part of my team. I am very fortunate to have a functional medicine-trained primary care doctor. Over my 20-plus years with her, she has helped get to the root of some complex medical problems and helped me resolve, or at least control, them. This has led to me having an extraordinary level of health and quality of life. Should I ever have cancer, I would ask her to help me figure out if I had imbalances that could drive cancer processes and see how we bring them back into balance. In functional medicine, they call these the \"Core Clinical Imbalances.\" These core imbalances are very similar to what Dr. Keith Block and other integrative oncology practitioners call terrain imbalances, such as in immunity, inflammation, hormones, and others. I know she would want to look at \"antecedents\", that is, triggering events and mediators which may have played a role in causing, triggering or perpetuating my imbalances: Was I exposed to toxics in my environment growing up? Have I had significant stressors at vulnerable times? She would want to know my whole story, physical, mental, spiritual, not just about pieces and parts of my body. She once told me that for her patients with cancer who wish to include complementary therapies in their treatment, she suggests they buy the [Moss Report ](https://www.mossreports.com/) for their specific cancer. I appreciate her familiarity with this evidence-based resource and know we're on the same wavelength. Once I would complete conventional treatments, I'd ask my functional medicine doctor to help me regain balance as I recover from treatment. Finally, we would work for long-term health and remission maintenance, knowing that restoring balance in my body functions will likely prevent or at least stave off recurrence. Her functional medicine approach would fit right in with my idea of holistic integrative care: \"Using the most natural means possible, including, but not limited to, diet (using a functional nutrition approach), nutritional supplements, botanicals, lifestyle changes, and if necessary, in specific cases, the limited use of pharmaceutical medications. In functional medicine, the whole person is addressed, not just a collection of symptoms.\" [17]Cantor-Adkins SL.
