The NIS 25 admission fee entitles visitors to a day's worth of talks held simultaneously in four halls of Jerusalem's Binyanei Ha'uma, from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. The fair will feature over 60 lectures and performances in all. Many of the talks focus on both Jewish thought and healing techniques. Lectures include \"Medicine and the Link Between Body and Soul According to Jewish Tradition,\" by Rabbi Yohanan Fried, and \"Jewish Healing for Treatment,\" by Devora Kroliner Hazan. Other workshops focus specifically on diagnosis, including \"Diagnosing Body and Soul in Therapeutic Drawing,\" by Ramit Alkarif. Different healing techniques range from \"Laugh Workshop\" with Dr. Ota Liment to \"Light, Color, and Sound Frequency Therapy,\" offered by Dr. Estit Hoter Geza. Healthy food, Israeli-made aromatic oils, music, food and other products will be available to peruse or purchase at the fair. Two performances, at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, cap the day's events and put the festival's philosophy of holistic health into practice.
