Long recognized in Europe, halotherapy is a way of life. With the help of a salt generator device and tons of Himalayan crystal salt, we are able to create a very special, healing microclimate. Infrared Sauna $45/25 min or $65/55 min Relax and enjoy detoxifying in our private Infrared Sauna. Unlike traditional saunas, which operate at extremely harsh temperatures, infrared is a gentle, soothing and therapeutic heat that promotes relaxation and relieves stress. Not only will you leave feeling fully refreshed and rejuvenated after each session, you will have burned up to approximately 600 calories! Steam Room Complimentary with service Inhale sweet eucalyptus, and let all your tension go as you detoxify your lymphatic system in our steam room before or after any treatment. Therapeutic steam has been used since ancient times and doctors today continue to stand by these benefits. Steam will not only help ease muscle tension, but it has been known to cure and prevent cold and flu symptoms. Ice Fountain Complimentary European spas have long used ice after a steam or sauna visit as a natural gentle exfoliant, to stimulate circulation, tighten skin, and strengthen the immune system. The ice flakes you will find falling into a golden vessel at Riviera Spa are perfect after any one of our thermal experiences. Refreshing "}
