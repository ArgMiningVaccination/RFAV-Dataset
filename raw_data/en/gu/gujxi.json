Treat AllerFocus provides a broad spectrum immunotherapy compounded pharmacy product. This product can be administered sublingually with the use of drops underneath the tongue or subcutaneously by shots. The therapy injections can be delivered in the office once or twice a week at increasing doses until the maintenance dose is achieved. Sublingual immunotherapy is done by the patient at home after receiving the first dose in the office. Since treatments are done at home, the patient will follow the dosing schedule sent with the prescription. Treatment Options For Allergies in Redmond WA For allergy and asthma patients who are seeking a more long term solution, AllerFocus immunotherapy has options to desensitize and modify the body's immune response over the long term. Sublingual Drops First, allergy testing must confirm that the patient has sensitivities. A specific allergen extract is formulated for that patient. The drop is then held underneath the tongue for 1 to 2 minutes and swallowed. This is repeated once a day. It is recommended that for 3 to 5 years this therapy should be maintained to develop a lasting immunity. A path towards better health is created as the immunotherapy vaccine builds the bodies tolerance as the sensitivity to allergens decreases. Over the past 20 years, sublingual immunotherapy drops have been proven to be a relatively safe and effective treatment for environmental allergens. These allergens include ragweed, cat dander, grass, tree pollen and dust mites which cause rhinitis and asthma. Allergy Shots Allergies caused by airborne allergens like pollen, dust and mold have been effectively treated by subcutaneous immunotherapy. Following the allergy test which confirms the patient has allergies, a very small amount of each allergen is injected into the patient's arm. This then triggers the immune system which can block the allergy symptoms. As the dose is increased gradually, the patient will have the ability to be exposed to the allergen without symptoms occurring in the body. After about 4 to 6 months, this immunity process will begin to work. It is recommended that this treatment is continued for 3 to 5 years for the most favorable results. Until the maintenance dose is reached, the patient must come in weekly or bi-weekly for their injections. Following the maintenance dose, visits are then on a monthly basis.
