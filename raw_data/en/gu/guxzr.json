The Smithsonian Folklife Festival offers a platform for culture bearers to share their stories and skills on the National Mall each summer Smithsonian Folkways Recordings shares \"music of, by, and for the people\" as the institution's nonprofit record label Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives holds audio, video, photo, and paper collections from our programs as a public resource Cultural Vitality Program supports domestic and international communities in effort to maintain and develop cultural expressions Research and Education projects create resources for folklorists, anthropologists, teachers, and students Thank you for joining us, and we invite you to continue exploring. A GREEN FESTIVAL We are committed to making the Folklife Festival a green event by providing free filtered water stations, fueling generators with biodiesel, serving food in compostable containers, and collecting and sorting waste at resource recovery stations. Each year, together, we divert over 88% of Festival waste from landfills. Let's keep it up! READY FOR AN ADVENTURE?

Murphy Director, Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage Sabrina Lynn Motley Director, Smithsonian Folklife Festival This is my first Folklife Festival as the new director of the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, but it's not my first Festival. I've attended, and sometimes presented, annually since 2008, and it's the privilege of a lifetime to work with the team that curates, produces, and presents this iconic national event. The first time I heard of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival was a kind of premonition of the Creative Encounters program. I was sitting in a back pew of St. Thomas More in Durham, New Hampshire, when the priest called up one of the parishioners, who was headed to D.C. to tell French Canadian stories at the 1999 Festival's program on New Hampshire. I became aware of two things in that moment: that the Smithsonian had a Folklife Festival, and that our state participation was a sign that we really did have our own culture. Until that point, I thought culture was something to be found in other places. On my first trip through the Ozarks\u2014also around 1999\u2014I learned that rolls could be \"throwed\" (only at Lambert's Caf\u00e9 in Missouri) and that there were places called \"lightbulb clubs\" (at least one: a music venue in Fayetteville, Arkansas). In all three cases, I found that venues that house music, food, and worship are often classrooms where we can learn about one another's cultures. On that note: my introduction to cultural heritage work came by chance in high school. It was in the form of an album called Woody Guthrie Sings Folk Songs, Vol. 2., first released on Folkways Records in 1964. This year marks the label's seventy-fifth anniversary of documenting the world's sounds, and we are thrilled to mark their birthday at this year's Festival! On behalf of the Center, I thank you for joining us on the National Mall and celebrating the cultural practices that bring vitality and distinction to our many communities. Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives A recent article described this year's Folklife Festival as comprising a region and \"an idea,\" something I found jarring and, ultimately, accurate. Every one of our programs is chock-a-block with suppositions, hunches, and assumptions. The collaborations that drive this work are as grounded in ideas and questions as they are in relationships and networks. What makes us human? How does cultural knowledge and practice help us contend with the \"already\" and the \"not yet\"? Upon reflection, the country, region, state, and occupational model the Festival has historically used is little more than shorthand for the innumerable ideas that bind and separate us. So, what would happen if we leaned into the Festival being as much about ideas as about the stories that hold them, the individuals and communities who cherish them, and the cultural practices that give them shape? Creative Encounters: Living Religions in the U.S. and The Ozarks: Faces and Facets of a Region offer beautifully rendered answers. Those programs, along with special presentations from Kazakhstan and Ukraine, seek to better articulate the ideas animating them and increase curiosity about the people, practices, and geographies residing at their core\u2014definitely worthy pursuits given the times in which we live. No matter the country, region, state, occupation, or idea, the Festival continues to be a place for enthusiastic, respectful exploration of what lifts, challenges, and matters to us. The generous culture bearers we host guarantee that we never shy away from the complexity of lived experience. Our dedicated staff, interns, and volunteers ensure that abstract ideas are made both concrete and accessible. You, in concert with our partners, sponsors, and donors, make it possible to manifest the Festival's purpose and Smithsonian's mission. Time is a precious thing. My sincere thanks for sharing yours. May your visit be filled with moments of connection and wonder that enrich your own ideas about what constitutes a creative, just world. 4Welcome to Creative Encounters: Living Religions in the U.S. Participants from numerous religious, spiritual, and ethical communities spanning the United States and territories have come together to celebrate the abundant creativity that emerges from shared experiences and values. The landscape of belief is vast and multifaceted\u2014it would be impossible to capture it all. Here, through a series of case studies, we offer a snapshot of the diversity and dynamism of belief in the United States today. The heart of this program is the encounter. We invite you to ask questions and share stories, to dance and sing, to smell and taste, to try your hand at a craft or dig in a garden bed. Moments of encounter sometimes generate friction, but they also open paths toward deeper relationships and possibilities to create something new. FIVE INTERLOCKING THEMES ANIMATE THE PROGRAM: On the Crossroads Stage, experience Sound Religion, an exploration of the rhythms, harmonies, recitations, poems, and stories that make up the expressive soundscapes of various communities, from gentle mantras to spirited gospel. What do Americans create from their religious, spiritual, and ethical traditions? In a diverse and changing religious landscape, how does creativity enrich understanding and nurture mutual respect? Photo courtesy of Calvin Hoe 7With Body and Spirit, practitioners and teaching artists engage the physical dimensions of spiritual experiences, sharing moments of movement and stillness, gestures and processions, that embody beliefs and profound memories. Spanning the west and east program areas, Makers of Faith highlights the artisans and artists whose works adorn places of worship and family homes alike, lifting up the cultural stories and sacred inspirations that bolster the artists' creative gifts. Visit the kitchen and wander in the garden of Kitchen Theology, which honors these spaces, along with the cooks and farmers who cultivate them, as vital sources of recipes, wisdom, cultural knowledge, and ethical values. At the Encounter Stage\u2014and throughout the program area\u2014engage with Futurisms, which opens conversations and tests new visions for a shared future in the United States and global communities. Americans are reimagining their relationships to religion and spirituality: drawing from ancestral knowledge, grappling with new technologies, and, for some, transforming to become more socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. One constant is the human need to connect with something beyond oneself. 6For cooks: Elena Terry takes a fresh approach to Native cuisine with Ho-Chunk foodways. Aaron Rovan recreates a Slovak Catholic Christmas , led by Liz Alpern and Jeffrey Yoskowitz, explores traditional Ashkenazi Jewish foods like pickles and blintzes.

For printed daily schedules, visit the Information Booth 10 112023 FESTIVAL PARTICIPANTS\"W elcome to the Ozarks, an American region with no single story to tell, a place more complex than you imagined but maybe just as colorful as you hoped.\" \u2014Dr. Brooks Blevins Arcansas. Aux arcs. Ozarks. The name has its historic origins in the language the Native Illini peoples of the Mississippi River Valley used to refer to their southern neighbors. Geographically, it's a place abundant with streams, rivers, and lakes, marked by rock formations, caves, and mineral deposits. Culturally, the Ozarks is characterized by movement and change, and yet it can feel timeless. It beckons with a promise of solitude and then coaxes resilient and diverse networks into being across its hills and hollers. Each holler's community is separate yet connected. So come pull up a rocking chair and visit with us. This is a safe space to be nosy and ask questions of your neighbors. Let's take time to talk with\u2014and learn from\u2014one another. 13This map is one attempt to define the cultural Ozarks of today, and it may not be the one that will be drawn tomorrow. It is the result of long drives and hours of conversations with those who live and have lived here, both newly arrived and with generational ties to the land. The program is organized into four overlapping themes: CELEBRATIONS AND GATHERINGS Ozarkers create community across sacred and secular spaces, coming together in times of celebration and loss. Food is a constant companion, whether front and center at a family dinner or accompanying a music jam. Learn treasured recipes in the Outdoor Cooking and Foodways demonstration kitchens, watch the process of making moonshine at Distilling, and gather with artisans in the Quilting Corner. STORIES, SOUNDS, AND SHOW BUSINESS Storytelling and music are vital tools in the Ozarks, for both everyday interactions and cyclical celebrations and gatherings. At the Pickin' Parlor and the Ralph Rinzler Main Stage, enjoy old-time music, bluegrass, shape-note singing, and gospel music, as well as comedy, storytelling, and jig and square-dancing workshops. Daily jam sessions are hosted outside the Guitar Workshop. MIGRATIONS, MOVEMENTS, AND PATHWAYS The Ozarks is home to historical and modern pathways that build on each other, from mountain bike trails that follow abandoned railways to the legendary Route 66. On The Front Porch, hear from the people who call the region home, including families who have been there for generations and newer arrivals from other parts of the world. Watch expert mountain bikers at the Trail Building track and try your hand at Marshallese Crafts. CONNECTIONS TO LAND AND PLACE The Ozarks' evocative landscape of caves and ridges, rivers and lakes supports a culture of wild foraging and natural healing. In the Teaching Garden and nearby tents, farmers, foragers, herbalists, and spiritual leaders concoct herbal remedies, lead foraging walks, and share their deep knowledge of plants. Artisans in White Oak Basketry, Cherokee Crafts, and Stories in Fabric bridge the need for cultural and ecological sustainability, while fishermen connect to their environment through Gig-making and graffiti artists through Muralism. festival.si.edu/schedule The schedule is subject to change.

Although nomadism is no longer practiced in Kazakhstan, the rich heritage and worldview it gave birth to continue to evolve, thrive, and influence daily life. The community of artisans presenting Soul of Tengri will discuss how they persist and transmit knowledge from one generation to the next, both within their home country and to the diaspora in the United States. Each morning, visitors can experience the cleansing ritual of alasau in the Pergola. Throughout the day, the artisans offer demonstrations and hands-on workshops on felting, weaving, musical instrument carving, embroidery, and more. Visit the Encounter Stage to learn more about Kazakh traditions and contemporary collaborations. In the Garden and Remembrance Space, enjoy traditional music played with the largest shamanic kobyz (bowed string instrument), a jaw harp, and a clay flute. Soul of Tengri is made possible by the support of Chevron. Mereke Aidarsha works on a narrow loom to weave basqur (colorful bands).
