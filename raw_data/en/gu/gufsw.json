[[3]](#cite_note-Hansen2017-3) In the 16th century CE, [Paracelsus](/wiki/Paracelsus) wrote: \"The art of healing comes from nature, not from the physician.\" [[4]](#cite_note-call-to-wild-4) Scientists in the 1950s looked into why people chose to spend time in nature. [[5]](#cite_note-:5-5) The term [Shinrin-yoku](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shinrinyoku) () or forest bathing was coined by the head of the [Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries](/wiki/Ministry_of_Agriculture,_Forestry_and_Fisheries_(Japan)), Tomohide Akiyama, in 1982 to encourage more nature weekly could improve health and well-being.

[[27]](#cite_note-27) Spending time in forests demonstrated positive health effects, but not enough to generate clinical practice guidelines or demonstrate [causality](/wiki/Causality).
