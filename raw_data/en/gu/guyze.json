Interest in the discipline and direction of functional medicine has been growing. With its emphasis on addressing the cause of an ailment rather than treating the symptoms, functional medicine has important implications for the future of health care. The discipline has especially impacted the study of nutrition as practitioners consider food as medicine. But what does functional medicine mean, and how can we better understand this holistic practice? A background on functional medicine The word holistic is derived from the Greek word \"holos\" meaning entire. It's the belief that everything is connected and that a problem in one area can cause a problem in another. Providing individualized support for each person is what holistic functional medicine is all about. Functional medicine is a branch of health care that focuses on the root cause of an illness and considers a patient's whole body rather than simply addressing the symptoms they experience, as in conventional medicine. Jeffrey Bland, Ph.D., is most often credited with introducing [the concept](https://www.ifm.org/about/profile/jeffrey-bland/) of functional medicine. Dr. Bland was curious about how gastrointestinal health, immune health, and hormone balances interacted with each other, and he began to use functional medicine to treat patients with chronic health problems. Functional medicine, sometimes referred to as alternative medicine, is based on the idea that disease begins with an imbalance. The body systems and their related organs all work together to make up a person's collective health\u2014the foundation of your overall health and well-being. By focusing on more than just the symptoms of an illness, functional medicine practitioners can completely reverse disease-causing behavior and positively create a healthy lifestyle for their patients. For example, an ill person can use exercise and mindfulness techniques to decrease stress, improve sleep, strengthen bone and muscle structure, or quit smoking or other unhealthy habits. Those techniques can also boost overall physical and mental health. Because diet can greatly affect overall health, supporting balanced nutrition is a large focus of functional medicine. As a result, functional nutrition has become an increasingly in-demand field within functional medicine. Functional nutrition: a holistic approach to health and nutrition Functional nutrition focuses on one of the most important parts of the body\u2014the stomach. It examines how food affects genes and how those genes affect health. But that's only the beginning. Functional medicine places nutrition at the heart of its approach because nutrition and diet have played a major role in the overall health and well-being of humans throughout history, including the evolution of our earliest ancestors. Historians estimate that cooking has been around for approximately 1.5 million years. Over time, early humans supplemented their diet of berries and nut with meat, and the first hearth appeared at least [790,000 years](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/hearths-shelters) ago. In a way, cooked food helped define what early humans would become. We are what we eat, after all. With extra time to develop societies rather than gather food, humans became smarter and continued to evolve. While cooking enabled the industrialization of society, it also meant less nutritious foods. The fruit, berries, and meat of our ancestors transformed into processed foods\u2014which meant less time hunting and preparing food but more consequences for our bodies. Six in 10 Americans have a chronic disease, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm). Often practitioners quickly resort to medication or surgery to remedy their patients' pain. A holistic practitioner, however, aims to treat the patient, not the disease and seeks different treatment options.. To determine what is causing the body's discomfort, holistic practitioners will delve into the patient's medical history and supplement advanced lab testing to fill in the gaps.
