The discipline of health economics co nceived as a particular branch of economic science is defined as the \"application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated with health.\" 1 Typically, Kenneth Arrow's seminal study of 1963 marks the start of the discipline of health economi cs.2 Economists have, however, thought about health for centuries, even put the is sue at center stage of their expositions (Justi). Since Paracelsus, the first so cial scientist systematically discussing the economics of health related institut ions and services, lived 500 years ago, the focus of this book is not only broader, bu t primarily different from writing a history of health economics. The leading question of the study is: what are the early economic ideas on health in the German and Austrian thought? A history of the t heoretical development of health economics cannot be a whig history written as if the current state of health economics were a necessary and logical outcome of w ork that had been done as far back as centuries ago. 3 To the contrary, the added value of a history of t hought on the economics of health issues is to emphasize diff erent points of view and departure, different approaches, different methods, and different results from what is currently available in the professional literature in health economics. In his presidential address before the meeting of t he History of Economic Society in Riverside (1978), George Stigler said about the his tory of economic thought that it is either forgotten, because it has been integrated in to the mainstream and need no longer be remembered, or it is not history of thoug ht, because it is a classic, but looking at these rightfully forgotten authors is ju st something for economists, who have not mastered their trade. 4 In this book, I am looking at classical authors, w hich 1 Anthony J.

December 1963, 53 (5), pp. 941-73. For the viewpoint that Arrow's seminal paper has been t he main impetus for health economics as a modern scientific discipline compare e. g. the contributions in the special issue edited by Mark A .

There are some interpretations not realizing the irony in the argument that Stigler in his lecture meant to be 12 have been selected to make the point about the negl ect of the history of economic thought in modern economics of health. No attempt h as been made to cover all subjects of economic thought on health issues. I am in particular looking at those classical works that are not easily available, since they are locked into the German language. \"English is the lingua franca of the academic world these days, and knowledge that is no t transmitted in it becomes lost, certainly in economics and most other social scienc es.\" 5 Primary sources are used and relevant health issues and quotes are selected and analyzed in context in order to make these classical works accessible to English based scholars. 6 The topic I have chosen for my expedition into the history of thought is health from an economic point of view. The reader might ask why a history of ideas on the economics of health is relevant today. The issues r aised in the earlier literature are hardly mentioned in health economics today, althoug h they have not lost their relevance. For instance, Paracelsus and half a cent ury later Oppenheimer looked at the relationship between environment and health, Ju sti focused on development and health, Althoff saw a connection between university reform and health, Schmoller pointed towards the interaction between the develop ment of markets and health, or B\u00fccher focused on the quality aspect through non-ma rket provision. As will be pointed out in the final chapter, these issues do n ot figure prominently in modern health economic texts. The shortcomings of current health care systems are well-publicized, and so are the prescriptions for reform. Short term prescriptions follow each other in rapid succession. It is unclear, where we go to, but coul d we take a step backwards in order to find the basic principles that underlie ou r health care systems? As the timetable given below shows, the authors selected i n this study responded to the needs of their time. The advice they gave was polit ically relevant in their time. 7 provocative. He was blasting against economists of historian thought, who concentrate on irrelevant authors for their own sak e.

Oxford: Clarendon Press. A gap, however, remains as to the political impact of the authors. This area has not been researched very well. 13 The relation between economic analysis of health an d health policy cannot be clarified within the scope of this study. The focus here is on the economic analysis of health; it is assumed that research influences heal th policy. Health policy can also influence health economics. For instance, health ec onomics as it is taught now largely reflects the different national institution s such as the British or Canadian Health Service, the differing institutions in the U nited States, Germany or France. This is why these textbooks differ. This nationally defined teaching agenda can very well exclude relevant policy options which are then in turn not presented to policy makers. Because of the strong interrelationship bet ween theory and policy, both are discussed in the same chapter on the different auth ors. The chapters of this study are roughly in chronolog ical sequence, but there are some chronological overlaps. The timetable below shows h ow the authors selected relate to each other in time. The starting point of this s tudy is set about five hundred years ago, when Theophrast Bombast von Hohenheim, called Paracelsus, (1493-1541) laid the groundwork for pharmaceutical medicine. On ly recently, his social science readings have been discovered. By following a holis tic approach to health care, he also included the social scientific point of view i nto his studies, which is the focus of the first chapter. Timetable: Authors Selected for a History of Thought on the Ec onomics of Health Issues Around 1520 the Plague raged through Europe. Paracelsus (1493-1541) tried to find solutions. After the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) Cameralism emerged. Cameralism became a university science in 1727 at the Prussian Universities of Halle and Frankfurt on the Oder. The desperately bad health states of the populations after the Thirty Years' War led the Cameralists to propose early health policy measures. Wolff (1679-1754) suggested a bottom-up approach to health care. In accordance to Wolff's principles, Justi (1717-1771) devised encompassing health policy measures. Early industrialization moved more and more people into the labor force for longer hours than farm labor required. Women and children were also recruited. Roscher (1817-1894) identified the health related problems and looked for guidelines to protect the working population. 14 Medium industrialization and agglomeration coupled with the depopulation of the land produce desparate sanitary and health conditions. Wagner (1835-1917) defined an entire catalogue of new tasks of the state emphasizing cultural and technological progress. Cultural and industrial development led to a new post-feudal upper class with new attitudes and diseases. Menger (1840-1921) explored issues of perception and education as determinants of better health. Rapid industrialization produced deep crises with massive insecurity, often involving poverty and infirmity of large segments of a mostly urban population. In this period the threat of a class-war was imminent. It is referred to as the First Founders' Crisis . Schmoller (1838-1917) designed and suggested market-based social institutions to address three basic risks of life: health insurance, cooperative accident insurance (Berufsgenossenschaft), and provisions in the case of the loss of the breadwinner. Loss of the work place is not yet compensated for. The social welfare state is still in an early stage of development and insufficiencies are gaping wide open. B\u00fccher (1847-1930) emphasized non- market, but exchange-based relationships to supplement state provision and market exchange. As Schmoller had diagnosed, urban agglomeration produced significant debasement of health. Althoff (1839-1908) designed and implemented structures for the development of scholarship and science to address the conditions determining health. For instance, the three Nobel prizes by Behring, Koch, and Ehrlich were attributed to his enabling efforts. The Second Founders' Crisis raging in the late 19 th and early 20 th century led to the economic downfall of large segments of the population, both urban and rural. Oppenheimer (1864-1943) defined economics as social medicine. He emphasized cooperative forms of living and working in order to alleviate conditions leading to poverty and poor health. Schumpeter (1883-1950) emphasized in his early writings the social consequences of boom and bust in their many social repercussions, including health. 15 Paracelsus traveled widely, acquiring medical knowl edge from various sources. He learned in Italy and Spain, and became familiar wit h Spain's rich experience from the colonies. His medical, philosophical and theologica l contributions are well-known, but his social-economic contributions have not received much attention. Paracelsus posed critical questions concerning the organizatio n of health care and monopoly structures herein. He pondered about the just price of health care and proposed an early concept of income prices. He investigated int o the connection between medical conditions and working conditions when he studied t he medicinal uses of minerals in the mines of the Fuggers. He established the connec tion between causes of (professional) diseases, the circumstances of the w ork, and conceivable treatment, both in terms of prevention and in terms of care. Paracelsus was part of the early tradition of publi c health on the Continent, which emerged in the late middle ages, when cities, duchi es, and territories governed by the church, appointed city and county physicians in order to control infectious diseases. As a military surgeon, Paracelsus was not only in charge of the cure of the wounded, but also of sanitary conditions and contro l of infectious diseases. He studied camps for the treatment of the plague, whic h raged during Europe at his time. When Paracelsus became the city physician of Basel, he was in charge of disease control. This position was combined with a professorship at the university. He showed that a concentrated effort at curing or c aring for particular illnesses opens opportunities for improved efficiency, but al so the opposite such as infections in hospitals or military camps. He emphasized this aspect, and can thus be seen as part of the early public health tradition, a tradit ion, which later was advanced by the Cameralists. As Kenessey has shown, the role of statistics was c rucial in introducing the economic perspective into health care. 8 Early roots of health statistics can indeed be traced back to the time of Paracelsus, but this was before statistical methods had been developed leading to the concept of health ins urance. Already in medieval times hospitals were set up as municipal foundation s, which maintained record- keeping. Hospital data bases later allowed the appl ication of methods of accounting and the introduction of principles of organization into hospitals. In upper Italy and upper Germany large foundations with social purpose s continued sometimes for centuries and left records, which can be mined so a s to construe long time series on mortality, morbidity and health states. Schmoller r eferred to guild records as yet another data base on health. The guilds provided ea rly institutions of health insurance to their members on the basis of extensiv e data bases that included the death and health statistics of their members. 9 Military concerns and the concern to 8 Compare Zoltan Kenessey. 1995. \"The Emergence of Q uantitative Thinking about Mortality and Life Expectancy.\" International Review of Comparative Public Policy. Vol. 6, pp. Jahrhundert . (Towards a History of Small German Crafts and Ind ustry in the 16 control infectious diseases were two main reasons f or individual states to set up data bases and evaluate them by statistical methods. Eco nomic concerns also played a role in the development of statistical methods. An example is the evaluation of a human life. The concept of probability, which turne d out to be particularly important to the introduction of health insurance and social security, has certain roots in the sixteenth century, the age of Paracelsus, but clear ly evolved a century later in connection with marine and life insurance underwrit ing (Kenessey, op. cit. , p. 292). The public health tradition on the Continent was sy stematically advanced by the Cameralists. The existence of monopolies in health care has already been a problem to Paracelsus, who saw the possibility of fraud and low quality of health care provided. Veit Ludwig von Seckendorf (1626-1692), a n early Cameralist, also demanded the abolishment of monopolies and gave gui delines for the improvement of the health of the population, which he recommend ed to write into the state's constitution. 10 He described an early territorial public health po licy in Gotha, where he was the advisor to Duke Ernest II. 11 Other interesting plans such as Krug's proposal of an early health insurance can be found by digging into the archives. 12 Cameralism received a strong impetus during and aft er the Thirty-Years'-War in response to the economic devastation, poor health s tates of people and depopulation of the countries. The Cameralists fear ed that the provision of health care to the population would be insufficient and po ssibly of low quality. They proposed public health measures and established hea lth boards, which gathered data on particular illnesses and deaths. Cameralist s interpreted the health of the populace as capital of the states. The third chapter is devoted to Christian Freiherr von Wolff (1679-1754), who appears in Schmoller's Blueprint in the context of and as a precursor of the Cameralist sciences. 13 Desperately bad health states of the population a fter the Thirty-Years'-War led Wolff to suggest a bottom-up approach to healt h care.

This is important since many healths related services can b est be provided within the immediate vicinity of the person to be treated. Eve n today, many such services are provided by the family directly. Conversely, many c onditions depend directly on the lifestyle of the family. Wolff is the founder of ec onomics within his general system of natural law ( jus gentium ). The subsidiarity principle, which gained new rel evance today, is attributed to him. The most prolific writer of the Cameralists was Joh ann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi (1717 - 1771), whose proposals with respect to heal th and health care are discussed in the fourth chapter. Since the happiness of the p eople is the focus of Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi's analysis, their health is his central concern and he considers every conceivable aspect in which the sta te through policy and administration can improve the health state of the populace. 14 For instance, he focused on agricultural policy in order to prevent starvation and starvation-related diseases. He tried to improve sanitary conditions a nd initiated public health laws. He suggested that war should not to be led in winterti me in order to minimize human losses. Justi proposed to set up a board that syste matically studies the causes, including social and environmental reasons, of illn esses and epidemics. On the basis of these statistics, appropriate public health meas ures could be devised and implemented. Wilhelm Roscher (1817-1894), (chapter five) stood s till firmly in the tradition of Cameralism. He studied the consequences of the peri od of early industrialization, which moved more and more people including women an d children into the labor force for longer hours than farm labor required. Ro scher, who introduced the historic method to economics, saw the family unit as the beg inning of a nation's economy, and not the individual. In line with the Cameralist s he wanted to educate people in order to lead them out of poverty, and thus improvi ng health. He proposed public regulation of factories and the institution of soci al welfare services and, in the Kingdom of Saxony, he was politically active in the ir implementation. While Roscher provided a documentation of early insurance program s, he did not systematically base the social economy on insurance principles as Schmoller did later (compare chapter eight). From today's point of view his cont ribution lies in building institutions for health care services and in his reflections on what could be called, parallel to constitutional public finance, constitutional healt h economics. Adolph Wagner (1835-1917), (chapter six) was politi cally engaged in the same sense as Roscher and Schmoller. Wagner witnessed a time of medium industrialization and agglomeration, which was coup led with the depopulation of the land. He defined an entire catalogue of new tasks o f the state emphasizing cultural and technological progress. He predicted that the s tate will become more influential 14 Ursula Backhaus.

J\u00fcrgen Backhaus and Frank Stephen, eds. New York: Springer. 18 over time with an increase in cultural and technica l development and the general sophistication and interconnectedness of a complex society. This prediction is referred to as Wagner's Law . Wagner also provided an early formulation of the public goods theory by formulating the conditions under wh ich the state can and should play a role in the provision and finance of goods a nd services. He thus created a basis for legislation. The current explosion of hea lth care expenditures is partly due to factors identified by Wagner, but partly also to deficiencies in health care organization. Policy relevance requires a distincti on between these two sets of causes. The cultural and industrial development had led to a new post-feudal upper-class with new attitudes and new diseases. Carl Menger (1 840-1921), (compare chapter seven) emphasized issues of perception and educatio n as determinants of better health. While Schmoller and Menger had basic method ological differences, they shared the same basic values with respect to their perspective on health. Menger tried to explain why some people make more and larg er investments in health than others, a thought which is central to explaining th e effects of individual life styles on health. 15 This awareness has only recently led to an orienta tion towards social medicine in the curricula of medical sciences. Gustav von Schmoller (1838-1917), (chapter eight) w as engaged in both, research and organizational activities in order to pursue hi s research program. He was the founder of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik , whose research and debates entered the political discussion surrounding the introduction o f a social security system in Germany. 16 The social legislation Schmoller proposed tried to root out the social causes and in particular economic causes of poor he alth. In a time of rapid industrialization, which led to deep crises with ma ssive insecurity ( First Founders' Crisis ), often involving poverty and infirmity of large s egments of a mostly urban population, the threat of a class-war was imminent. As a solution, Schmoller investigated insurance solutions for preventing har dships for families. He designed and suggested market-based social institutions to a ddress three basic risks of life: health insurance, cooperative accident insurance (B erufsgenossenschaft), and provisions in the case of the loss of the breadwinn er, but in his proposal he excluded compensation for loss of the work place. Prince Bismarck (1815-98) introduced compulsory hea lth insurance in Germany in 1883, compulsory accident insurance in 1884, and co mpulsory old age insurance followed in 1889. 17 Although William II facing the industrial crisis s hortly after having 15 Ursula Backhaus. 2005. \"Austrian Aspects to Health Economics.\" Modern Applications of Austrian Thought. London: Routledge, pp. 175-194. 16 The activities of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik surrounding this legislation have been interpreted as an important root of the introd uction of the economic perspective to health issues.

Inaugural Lecture , University of Limburg, 10-21-1993, pp. 4-9. 17 Bismarck's social welfare legislation is at the ba sis of a health care system in 19 ascended to the throne, very much wanted to establi sh a system of unemployment insurance, Bismarck intervened and prevented the me asures, which the young Emperor had already proclaimed in his famous Easter Messages. This led to Bismarck's dismissal. The economic reasoning underl ying the Chancellor's confrontation with the young Emperor was sound, how ever. Under the conditions then prevailing, a bust always affected all industr ies alike, so the only conceivable buffer was the then very small public sector. An un employment insurance system could therefore not be based on actuarial principle s, as the rest of the \"new social institutions\" (Schmoller) had been. The risks were not unevenly distributed and therefore could not be pooled, the basic idea behin d any insurance system. 18 Schmoller laid the basis for an insurance system ba sed on actuarial and, by implication, market principles, but guaranteed by t he state. 19 In building on the medieval institutions such as monasteries, charitab le city foundations, guilds, etc., the new social institutions were designed in terms of constitutional design. This means that they would be independent agents not req uiring constant political attention. On the other hand, the same principle im plied that they would not be available for \"economic manipulation for political profit.\" 20 Modern discussions about such issues as care for the elderly, catastrophic i llnesses and epidemics, although in principle open to an insurance based approach, are often dealt with by specific tailored programs. The insurance based approach has the advantage of creating incentives to reduce risks and losses. This is not true for most program based projects. Based on Schmoller's work, his successor at the Uni versity of Berlin, Heinrich Herkner (1863 - 1932) devised the social legislation in Ger many. Both authors are important to what is specific about the German deve lopment, for instance as Europe, which is best described as health care \"fro m cradle to grave.\" The United States has adopted only some of Bismarck's p roposals. The United States owes the standard retirement age of 65 to Bi smarck. Many of his reforms have never been established in the United States. T his accounts for the main differences between the European and the American h ealth care systems 18 Only the terms of the Treaty of Versailles led to a different situation. Now the Reich had every incentive to run deficits, and it used a ll available surplusses to let them disappear in disguised social programs. Examples include the introduction of the eight-hours workday, generous r egulations in a contract regulating compensation in the form of wages and n on-wage components for civil servants ( Reichsangestelltentarifvertrag ), and of taxes and levies Reichsabgabenordnung, RAO ), which contains many social components. Herkner took a leading role in achievin g these contracts. 19 Ursula Backhaus. 1997. \"Historical Approaches to H ealth Economics.\" Essays on Social Security and Taxation .

Wagner. 1977. \"Economic Manipulation fo r Political Profit: Macroeconomic Consequences and Constitutional Impli cations.\" Kyklos, Vol. 30, pp. 395-410. 20 compared to England which had the Poor Laws . Specific about Germany is that the social legislation tried to root out social causes and in particular economic causes of poor health and this can be attributed to Schmoller and Herkner. The beginnings of the social welfare state were lai d, but great insufficiencies remained. In this situation Karl B\u00fccher (1847-1930) (compare chapter nine) investigated the role of exchange in nonmarket situ ations. He formulated the conditions under which charity can lead to an effic ient provision of health care. 21 An example where his conditions have been instituted i s the organization of blood donation in Germany, the Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States. The current political debate on health care focuses on the question whether health care should be provided by the state or by the market or a combination thereof. B\u00fccher, by pointing towards the nonmarket elements in healt h care, showed that under certain conditions nonmarket exchange can supplemen t state provision and market exchange. Building on Roscher, Schmoller, and Wagner, Friedri ch Althoff (1839-1908), the legendary Prussian administrator in the Ministry of Culture and Science, took a holistic approach to health policy (compare chapter ten). Friedrich Althoff (1839- 1908) was a Prussian administrator in the Ministry of Culture and Science, who through his skillfully designed science policy crea ted an institutional environment in which science and scholarship could thrive. His att empt to modernize the Prussian university system through the foundation of Technic al Universities and the insistence of granting them equal academic privileges at a par with traditional Universities was supported by Emperor William II. This partly enable d the Universities to conduct technological research and brought about many innov ations, including some in the field of medicine. This innovative push was brought about through a change in the incentive structures. 22 The industrial development had significant effects in relation to disease, for instance new diseases emerged among th e proletarian class of the cities, and this required new ways to view and trea t these diseases. Building on Schmoller, Althoff took a holistic approach to heal th policy. He viewed health policy as an independent policy that systematically builds on other sciences. Science development led to new insights for more livable ci ties, improved architecture, and better infrastructure. Althoff founded institutes a nd hospitals to further experimental and diagnostic research in health care. He gave exc ellent researchers a chance, even if they were outsiders in the traditional syst em. Under Althoff, Germany introduced public health legislation, as in the cas e of combating tuberculosis.

Is it to be preferred to cut back on development and implementa tion of new technology in health care in order to keep a check on raising cos ts, or is it rather to be preferred to set optimal incentives for innovation? The Second Founders\u00b4 Crisis raging in the late 19th and early 20th century sha ped Franz Oppenheimer\u00b4s (1864-1943) social economic app roach to health (compare chapter eleven). Oppenheimer worked as a physician in rapidly industrializing Berlin. He realized that many diseases were caused by the s ocial environment. Hence, he felt that it was the economy that had to be cured. Confronted with massive unemployment in the industrial quarters of Berlin, he designed a scheme to buy out defaulted large rural estates and turn them into sm all agro-industrial farms. The small business farmers took their unemployment insu rance claims as down payments for these small business agricultural ente rprises. Traces of these colonies survived the Communist regime and can be still foun d in Berlin and Brandenburg, even Mecklenburg. Oppenheimer tried to found the ap propriate institutions in order to remove the causes of illness. He developed a new order of society, so that people would be able to lead a healthy life, both from a m edical and a social point of view. He sees the two as the two necessarily linked sides of the same coin. Oppenheimer was the author of several major works. Die Siedlungsgenossenschaft (The Cooperative Settlement for Development), 1896, 1922 (3), forms the starting point of his work and can serve as the basis for an analysis of health economic implications of his plan. 23 Oppenheimer also developed a new approach to sociol ogy, but this part of his work cannot be considered here. Apparently, at the time, when sociology was at its infancy, medical analogies of different kinds playe d an important role. While Oppenheimer saw himself as the physician of an econ omy, Goldscheid insisted that neither capital, nor labor, nor natural resources, but the human being in its entirety should be the focus of economic and sociological an alysis. 24 Schumpeter's early German work fell into roughly the same time frame a s that of Oppenheimer and Goldscheid, at the crossroads of sociology and econ omics. The connection between the empirical (historical) a pproach of Schmoller and the more general issues, including health had been work ed out by Joseph Schumpeter (1883-1950) (compare chapter twelve). The analysis is based on a work by Schumpeter, which has been untranslated and hard to get by. This part of Schumpeter's work appears only in the first edition of his Theory of Economic Development in the German language and has been omitted from f uture editions and from the English translation. 25 In the \"Seventh Chapter,\" Schumpeter sketched the 23 Franz Oppenheimer. 1896, 1922(3) Die Siedlungsgenossenschaft.

Looking at this broader picture, we find many details with important implications for health policy. Schumpeter tried to integrate the discipline of economics into a larger social-economic context. He widened his scope to encompass innovation in other social realms, in political, artistic, or scientific processes. In chapter thirteen, the historical authors' perspe ctive is summarized with respect to three major themes: cultural development and health , the principle of subsidiarity, and the role of the state in public finance. These cont ributions concern both, economic theory and policy of the time when they have been w ritten. With respect to the principle of subsidiarity, Paracelsus, Wolff, Roscher, and Sc hmoller highlight issues of care provided within and outside the family. Nonmarket e xchange as discussed by B\u00fccher also has its roots in the principle of subsidiarity . The second major theme refers to economic and social conditions with respect to cult ural development and health as discussed by Justi, Roscher, Schmoller, Oppenheimer , and Schumpeter. Different aspects are pronounced. For instance, Menger focuse d on health and errors in a culturally developing society and the role of time preference; Schmoller introduced the idea of insurance as a basic principle of a market economy in response to the needs of increasing industrialization and urbanization. Dive rsity is also present with respect to the third major theme, the role of the public secto r: public preventive health care measures were addressed by Justi and Wagner; health care legislation was discussed by Justi, Roscher, and Schmoller; government as a s ource of finance, as well as the limits of government, were stressed by Wagner; an i nnovative role of government was realized by Althoff, who created efficient incentiv es in the organization of medical research; and the introduction of mandatory catastr ophic health insurance for basic needs was proposed by Schmoller. The chapter ends w ith final remarks. The difference in perspective between the old and t he new health economics is described in chapter fourteen. The field of health economics has proliferated over the last few years. The handbook by Culyer and Newhouse provides an overview over the field,26 as well as recent textbooks, the most important be ing those by Breyer and Zweifel,27 the reader by Fuchs, 28 Folland, Goodman, and Stano, 29 Getzen, 30 Mooney. 31 Websites by professional associations and the majo r professional journals 26 Anthony J.

The description of the historic perspective in chapter fourteen is based on basic health economic terms, which are derived from the chapters of the book. Most of these terms can also be found in any current textbook of the field. This approach solves a methodological problem; historical contributions sh ould not be compared to modern terms, which were not present at the time. In this book, care has been taken to identify early ideas on economic issues of health, to unlock this knowledge from a foreign lan guage or a hidden source, and to show how health economic issues can be approached f rom the point of view of historical authors. The study ends with a summary a nd propositions which transmit the central message of each chapter.

Liber Amicorum 63-87. 28 2.1 Introduction: Paracelsus, his Life and Holistic Approach More than five hundred years ago, Theophrastus Bomb astus von Hohenheim (1493- 1541), who called himself Paracelsus, was born at E insiedeln (Switzerland) as the son of a German physician and chemist, Wilhelm Bomb ast von Hohenheim. Today, his achievements in the areas of medicine, philosop hy, linguistics, and theology are widely acknowledged. Many of the works by Paracelsu s have been published posthumously. Only between 1549 and 1658, 175 editi ons appeared. The research by Karl Sudhoff, who edited fourteen volumes of his medical and philosophical work created a scientific basis for further investigatio n. 1 For his social-political writings he is less well known, because this work has been foun d very late in order to be included in the complete Paracelsus edition. 2 It contains his contributions to comprehensive health sciences and health economic a spects, which are the focus of this chapter. Paracelsus received his early education from his fa ther. At the age of sixteen he went to Basel University, but soon abandoned his st udies at Basel for the study of chemistry and alchemy under Withemina, the Bishop o f W\u00fcrzburg. He continued his studies in T\u00fcbingen, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Vienna an d Ferrara. In 1515 or 1516 he received his doctorate in both medicines (i.e., int ernal and external) in Ferrara. 3 From 1516 until about 1524, he traveled widely thro ugh Europe. He sustained himself by his continually moving practice as he no rmally did not stay longer than three months at the same place. He cured the famous as well as the poor; among his famous patients was Erasmus of Rotterdam. Parac elsus collected a vast amount 1 1922 (Medical, Scientific Philosophical Writings). Karl Sudhoff.

He served so me time as a military surgeon in the Low Countries, Denmark, and Italy, and learned practical metallurgy at the mines in Tirol. The mines belonged to the Fugger family, who took patronage of Paracelsus' work. In the mines he studied the proce sses of preparing metals and conducted experiments as to their medicinal virtues . He also found out that particular diseases of miners were caused by the metals they w ere exposed to in the mine. 4 Between 1520 and 1522, he wrote early monographs on the diseases of miners. Around 1525, 1526 he wrote the draft towards an Alchemia medica with the goal to separate the effective medicine from its ineffectiv e part. 5 In 1527, Paracelsus was appointed city physician at Basel. Related to that position was a professorship of medicine at the University o f Basel. He introduced fundamental changes in the way and method of teachi ng. It was the tradition to teach in Latin, but Paracelsus gave his lectures in the G erman language. The study of medicine used to be theoretical. Paracelsus however required his students to actually see patients and to become practical physi cians. Basing the knowledge of students on experience meant a revolution in the wa y of teaching. 6 Paracelsus was compelled to leave Basel in 1528. He had made enemies in Basel, among them the guilt of the pharmacists, because he fought against high prices of medicine. The issue that led to his dismissal was a n unsettled question about his honorarium. When he treated successfully a dignitar y of the church, the cured patient did not want to pay him the full amount of the pre-negotiated honorarium, but only a small portion of it. He went to court in ord er to get the full honorarium, but the judge decided the case in favor of the church digni tary and he ordered Paracelsus to leave town. (Hanel, 1995, op. cit ., p. 12.) Paracelsus resumed his wanderings mostly through the South of Germany, Switzerland, and Aust ria. In 1541, Paracelsus returned to Salzburg, where he died in 1541. The ci rcumstances of his death were related to payment. When he went to a patient's hou se to gather his honorarium for a treatment that he had performed, but for which he n ever had been paid, he found that the patient, in the meantime, was treated by a nother doctor. Paracelsus became his victim, because that doctor ordered the servant s to throw him out of the window. Paracelsus work not only had an influence on medici ne, but also on disciplines such as theology, philosophy, astronomy, linguistics and psychology. Often, Paracelsus would invent new names, because the words he found in the established systems 4 \"Paracelsus.\" 1923 2. The New International Encyclopaedia . Vol. XYIII.

Vol. 6, pp. 3-128, p. 5. 30 were inadequate to describe the facts he observed. His vocabulary is studied by linguists, who focus on the development of the Germ an language. In the fragmentary Valumen Paramirum , which belongs to his early writings around 1520, his holistic approach becomes clear. Paracelsus distinguished be tween five different spheres, which have an influence in causing illness: the cos mic sphere; the environment; factors of heritage; spiritual disturbances; and Go d's will. God is thought to send illness as a way of punishment. Three major medical works by Paracelsus can be dist inguished. In his book Paragranum , written around 1529/30, he devised a program of a new medicine based on four pillars: \"Philosophia,\" the natural s ciences and natural philosophy; \"Astronomia,\" the cosmic influence on humans; \"Alch emia,\" the teachings of medicine based on chemistry; and \"Proprietas,\" the duties of the physician derived from a Christian ethically point of view. His Opus Paramirum , written around 1531, contains basic observations on the causes of illnes s, as well as philosophical ideas. The Grosse Wundtartzney (Large Handbook for the Healing of Wounds) was pr inted in two parts in 1535. In the first part, he advised for a conservative treatment of wounds, supporting the self-healing capability of p atients; the focus of the second part was on internal medicine. Paracelsus exerted a profound influence upon the me dical beliefs of his time and found followers who continued his work. He destroye d the \"humoral pathology,\" which was founded on the belief that diseases depen d upon an excess or deficiency of bile, phlegm, or blood and taught instead that d iseases were actual entities and were to be combated with specific remedies.7 Paracelsus denounced the medicine of the Arab physicians, whose teachings were then gene rally followed. 8 He laid the 7 Paracelsus publicly burned the works of Galen. Gal en (c. 129-200) was a Greek physician, whose main work has been translate d into the Arab language. He was the physician to several Roman emperors and learned about the organs from dissection of animals. He was the first physic ian to describe diagnosis from the pulse. \"Galen's writings were regarded as almos t infallible both in the East and the West until well into the sixteenth century ... He believed strongly in pneuma , a word untranslatable by any single English word, but which strongly resembles \"spirit\" or \"breath of life\" ... In addit ion to doctrine of the pneuma , Galen held the Hippocratic view of the four humors and their accompanying types of emotion: blood (sanguine), phlegm (phlegma tic), black bile (melancholy), and yellow bile (choleric). These Gal en related to the classical doctrine of the four elements: earth, air, fire, an d water.\" \"Galen,\" Collier's 1995. New York: Collier's. Vol. 10, p. 538. 8 Based on the Greek medicine, Arab medicine had a s trong impact on the course medicine took, and looks back at a long history. Fo r instance, Arab physicians were experts at distillation and developed many dru gs for treatment of illnesses. Rhazes (c. 850), an alchemist from Baghdad, disting uished between measles and smallpox. He founded a hospital in Baghdad and wrote a Graeco-Arabic medical encyclopaedia. See Norris McWhirter. 1999. \"Medicine and Health.\" The Book of Millenium Records . London: Virgin Publishing Ltd., pp. 90-97. p. 90. 31 groundwork for pharmaceutical medicine; he introduc ed new remedies, for instance opium, mercury, sulphur, iron, arsenic, etc. and st rove to reduce the overdosing then practiced. A famous follower of Paracelsus was Joha nn Baptist von Helmont (1579- 1644), who improved his work on pharmaceutical chem istry. 9 Paracelsus' holistic approach had an important infl uence on Goethe and C. G. Jung. Goethe read Paracelsus in a time when he suffered f rom a serious illness. He \"recognized medicine's indebtedness to the traditio n of \"holism\" when he commented in his autobiography \"Medicine employs the whole ma n, because it is occupied with the whole man.\" 10 Paracelsus not only saw the physical side of an il lness, but also the soul of a patient and the social circumstances, the patient lived in. Paracelsus' holistic approach also inspired C. G. J ung: \"When Carl Gustav Jung in our century explained his analytical psychology, wh ich treated the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of the person, he referred to the writings of Paracelsus as a helpmeet in articulating his per spective.\" (Blum, op. cit. , p. 250). The results of C. G. Jung's analytical psychology a re still relevant in the cure of some mental disorders such as drug addiction. A promisin g area of application of this line of research lies in the outpatient treatment of men tally ill persons. Blum has developed and implemented such an out-patient progr am, which allows drug addicts to delineate the cultural variables, which impact t heir life. In an out-patient program, the patients can maintain their social and economic activities, and by relying on facts from the patients' environment, the therapist can p rovide them with better guidelines than in an in-patient program. From a cost-effectiv eness standpoint, out-patient programs tend to be preferred to in-patient program s. 11 During his lifetime, Paracelsus continuously had th e problem that competitors would reprint and alter his medical texts. There were, of course, no copyrights. His social science related writings were not subject to the sa me plagiarism and vandalism as they have more the character of a public good and h ence were not subject to stealing. This is why his social science writings h ave remained more authentic and also shed light on his medical writings. He was a h olistic author who saw the practice of medicine always in the context of societal circu mstances, in which it had to occur.12 The context with economic issues is the main focus of this chapter (2.2). 9 Keil, Gundolf. 1995. \"Paracelsus und die neuen and C.

For an overview of Paracelsus' social writings 32 Economic consequences of monopolies in health care are the subject of the third section (2.3). The chapter ends with a summary and conclusions. 2.2 Economic Thoughts in Paracelsus' Social Writ ings Paracelsus was a devoted physician, theologian and philosopher, who distinguished among several realms of which a society is composed . Therefore there are four estates (ordine, monarchi as), as there are one agriculture, another crafts, a third the liberal ar ts, a fourth the government (authority, magistracy). 13 According to Paracelsus, medicine and medical care belonged to the third monarchia, the liberal arts. Now in the third monarchia, there are many arts an d sciences, which God revealed, as astronomia, medicina. These arts and l abor cannot be paid. For who can pay a good physician who brings you back lo st health and keeps you alive, until the last minute comes? 14 Paracelsus oftentimes pondered about the nature of medicine. On the one hand, he considered medical care a priceless service, but on the other hand, he noted that patients faced a high risk of treatment, because th e medical scientific knowledge of his time was uncertain, medical cures were not reli able and physicians were frequently not able to help. All the time, and with great and unrelenting effor ts I have tried to understand the basic reason of medicine, in order to understan d whether medicine can really be called an art, or not, and what basically it consists in. I have been driven in this by various causes. Among them are th e uncertainty with which our treatments are wrought, which is reflected in t he low esteem and the lack of applause of our daily practice: likewise, that s o many patients perish: that they die, remain paralyzed, or are abandoned by the ir doctors. And this is not only the case with respect to just particular condi tions; it is true for pretty much all the conditions. Our entire practice is unr eliable. In my time, there is not a single doctor who would be able to heal a too thache with certainty, nor compare Johannes Hanel. 1995. \"Paracelsus' Social W ritings from a Modern Social Science Point of View.\" International Review of Comparative Public Policy .

This quote by Paracelsus and the transla tion is according to Johannes Hanel, 1995, op. cit ., p. 3. 33 an even smaller illness, not to speak of a serious illness at all. 15 The struggling physician even wanted to give up his career, because he thought that the medical practice could never become a reliable art. Never have I made the experience that I can ever b e completely sure about the effect of a medical practice and cure, no matte r what kind of illness it was. I have thought about it a lot, that medical practic e is an unreliable art, which cannot be used adequately, the right cure is hard t o find, even under the best of circumstances and with luck heals one, but makes ten others ill. This gave me a reason to think that it is a betrayal of spiri ts in order to deceive men and to make them small. 16 At other times, Paracelsus was able to overcome the se feelings; then, he decided that medicine and medical practice was an art, inde ed, \"... that the art is true, just, reliable, perfect and a unity, in times of need a r eliable indispensable art, useful for all the ill, and helpful for them to become healthy .\" 17 The following examples show that despite this decision, the nature of medicine kept occupying his thinking. On the one hand, Paracelsus thought that physicians were n ot able to provide adequate treatment, because they lacked the knowledge requir ed, or the risk of treatment involved was too high, or a medical cure did not ex ist. On the other hand, dishonest 15 Translation by J\u00fcrgen Backhaus (1995, op. cit. , p. xvi). The original German quote reads as follows: \"Allerw\u00e4rts die Arzneikunst erforscht. Ich hab F\u00fcrnehmens His Life and Truths of Life in Autobiographical Notes). Edited and with an introduction by Karl Bittel. Leipzig: Verlag Philipp Reclam. (10:19) 16 This hat, es sei ein Betr\u00fcgnis von Geistern, op. cit ., (10:19). 17 The original German quote reads as follows: ie cit ., (10:19). 34 doctors could take advantage of the uncertain natur e of medicine, because patients could not control them. Paracelsus wondered how patients could tell whether a treatment was good or bad, if even physicians did not know the effect of a tre atment with certainty. This was aggravated by the fact that some illnesses would di sappear after a while without treatment and others despite of the wrong treatment . Moreover, the effects of medical cures varied among different patients. In t his situation, patients could not control physicians' behavior. Therefore, doctors we re able to become rich, while oftentimes providing bad treatment. A lack of patie nts' control, resulting from the nature of medicine, opened the opportunity to fraud for deceitful physicians and, so Paracelsus, the medical profession was therefore no t honored more highly. Paracelsus despised of book knowledge, because he f elt that the books did not teach about the risks involved in treatment. As wil l be shown later in this section, Paracelsus wanted to lower the risk of treatment by learning more about cures and illnesses at different locations and from various h ealth care providers. He thought that book knowledge opened another opportunity to p hysicians' fraud and this he considered foolishness. He accused the well-establi shed physicians, who relied on book knowledge, of not primarily being interested i n providing good medical care, but in gaining a high status and income. Such foolishness I have also found in the writings of all the old. And this despite the fact that at the courts, in the large c ities, at the rich - who had been willing to pay so much (!) and yet have not be en able to be helped by any of the physicians - I am talking about the well -dressed physicians wearing silk, golden rings, etc., not the unimportant ones, but those with pomp and kind words. 18 Those physicians took advantage of the fact that th e rich patients in the cities and at the courts who are in poor health are not able to c onduct their daily business as usual. They have much more to lose than any of the poor patients. Consequently, they are willing and also able to pay a higher sum in order to gain their health back than the poor. Paracelsus observed many different ways of dishones ty and fraud among physicians which damaged the reputation of medicine. He noted that some physicians were able to increase their income by not admitting that the chance of healing was very small. They made the patients believe that they wou ld get better with continued medical treatment. While those physicians were eage r to take their patients' 18 This quote reads in the original German as follows : \"Auch bei allen Alten 1944, op. cit. , (10:19). 35 payments, they did not provide adequate treatment i n return. Paracelsus scorned those physicians, who for monetary reasons concentr ated on the diagnosis and forgot treatment and all limitations of life. 19 He also described physicians who abandoned patients, because they could not help the m any longer, or because a patient was no longer able to pay for treatment. Some of his colleagues applied bad and ineffective cures. As a physician, Paracelsus was better able to recognize such bad an d ineffective cures than the patients. His fellow physicians, however, did not a ppreciate that kind of control. They criticized the alternative treatment Paracelsus pro vided; in other cases they copied his procedures or stole his medicine. Paracelsus re ported the following case: when his family doctor was not able to help a patient, P aracelsus, who happened to be in the vicinity, was called in. He was promised a gene rous honorarium, reimbursement for his travel expenses, as well as free room and b oard. Paracelsus accepted the offer and performed a chiropractic treatment in ord er to help the patient. While he performed the treatment, the other doctor looked on , partially learning the treatment. Later, his room was broken into and his medicine wa s stolen. He did not get paid, neither for his travel expenses, nor did he get the honorarium that was promised to him. Paracelsus considered those physicians as fool s, whom he fought fiercely, and concentrated on the patients who did appreciate his cures. The sick liked me. I wrote this letter, because I do not want to insult any of the honest physicians by my bad-tempered writing. I hop e to live with them in peace and to get their praise. The other fools I do not honor. Their scolding is my praise, it is to my benefit, and it fills my pur se. For I know so many of those evildoers that among thousand physicians, the re will not be a single one, who will say: thank you, Theophraste, but you are a fool! The war between us has been going on for so long. They forced me to leave Lithuania, thereafter Prussia, thereafter Poland, t his was not enough. Neither did the Dutch like me, nor the universities, nor th e Jews, nor the monks. But thank God: the sick liked me. 20 Paracelsus was forced by his enemies to leave the c ountry, university, or monastery. 19 In his theological and philosophical contributions , Paracelsus addressed the question of the limitations of life; he even foresa w the possibility of genetic modifications. Compare Johannes Hanel, 1995, op. cit. , p. 4. 20 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Den K ranken ., (6:180). 36 They tried to exclude him on the basis of admission regulations and accused him of not being a physician. Paracelsus responded by citi ng his battlefield experience: 21 According to your judgment, I am a surgeon, not a physician. How do you arrive at such a judgment? This is despite the fact that I have evidently healed eighteen princes - who had been abandoned by you - and you have not even acknowledged this. And also despite the fact that I have treated and healed large numbers of the feverish, for about forty diff erent illnesses that had been found, in the Low Lands, Romania, Naples, and in th e wars of Venice, Denmark, and the Netherlands. 22 Facing hostility around him and inspired by a high sense of responsibility for God and towards his fellow men, Paracelsus' strategy wa s to extend and deepen his medical knowledge, thereby improving medical cures, and to apply his knowledge widely. He noted that the success of a medical cure also depended on the persons close to the patient. In order to succeed in healin g a patient, the patient's family and friends have to be supportive. It depends on their intentions and behavior, whether a physician will be able to help a patient. According to Paracelsus, any treatment remains ineffective, if the family or friends do no t want a recovery of the patient. In that case, the best medicine \"gets spilled, the pat ient dies, the recipients of a bequest become lucky, the physician gets insulted, and the art of medicine dishonored.\" 23 21 In treating the wounded at the battlefield, it was important to prevent the outbreak of an epidemic. Paracelsus cures were not only directed towards healing single wounded soldiers, but towards preven tion of infection. In the case of infectious diseases, he tried to reduce the dang er of infection. At times, however, it seems that Paracelus was more concerned with the development of social medicine than with individually effective tr eatment. An example is his treatment of syphilis with quicksilver. Much later it became obvious that treatment with quicksilver was perhaps not the best method of helping the individual patient, but it prevented the disease fr om spreading. Decades later, the syphilis treatment with quicksilver was replace d by a method that was based on the former heat therapy Paracelsus had rejected. For individual treatment, the heat therapy turned out to be the better method . Gundolf Keil. Steiner Verlag, pp. 17-46, p. 44. 22 The original German reads as follows: \"Ich s ., (7:374). 23 The original German quote from a footnote by Parac elsus reads as follows: \"... 37 As has been mentioned above, Paracelsus did not fin d reliable medical knowledge in the books. Therefore, he decided to gather the know ledge of effective cures through extended wanderings, by using \"his eyes as his prof essors.\" He visited various practitioners of health care, such as barbers, midw ives, etc., and investigated home remedies in order to develop reliable alternative c ures. This was not without personal hardships and sacrifices. Paracelsus noted: \"Thus I wandered through the countries and led a vagrant life - alone, and foreign, and di fferent.\" 24 Paracelsus wanted to improve the knowledge of medic al practice and treatments, thereby making cures more reliable. He insisted tha t the only way of gaining the experience needed was to wander through the differe nt countries with their varying conditions of climate and geography. Only then, suf ficient comparison between medical cures could be achieved. Thus I have studied at the Universities for many y ears, in Germany, in Italy, in France, in search for the nature of the medical art . I did not want to rely on the same teachers and to base my knowledge on their wri tings and books only, but wandered further to Granada, to Lisbon through Spain, through England, through the Mark Brandenburg, through Prussia, thro ugh Lithuania, through Poland, Hungary, Walachia, Transylvania, Croatia, t he Wendian Mark, also other countries, not necessarily to be mentioned he re. And in all the places and locations I inquired busily and diligently, did research in order to find the art of medical practice that was surely working and really experienced. I got this knowledge not only from the doctors, but also from barbers, bath keepers, learned physicians, women, from witches, as far as they have concerned themselves with caring, from alchemists, I went to the monasteries, to the noble and common people, to the bright and to the s imple-minded. 25 dann wird 1944, op. cit. , footnote, p. 58. 24 The German quote reads as follows: \"Also bin ich g Hanel, 1995, op. cit ., p. 9, note 13. 25 This quote reads in the original German as follows : \"Hab also die Hohen Schulen erfahren lange den Grund op. cit. , (10:19). 38 Paracelsus wandered through Europe, but limited the application of his medical knowledge to this continent. He considered it not t o be useful to go to Africa and America. He believed that the cures had to be found in the immediate vicinity of the disease. One had to adapt therapies to individual n eeds. According to Paracelsus, climate and other environmental conditions would in fluence the course of a disease. (Hanel, op.cit ., p.10.) Paracelsus often developed medicine himself in orde r to adapt it to an individual patient and his immediate environment. If the effec tive ingredient was cheap to produce, this easily caused a problem with pharmaci sts, who did not want to sell Paracelsus' medications as fees and consequently th eir incomes would obviously depend on the materials provided. In order to make it more expensive, he sometimes added precious ingredients such as ground pearls or spices to medicine that would not be damaging to the patient. He did this only in the case of rich patients. Poor patients just got the basic formula which he prepar ed himself, so he did not have to send them to the apothecary. In a letter of complaint to the council of the city of Basel, where he was the city physician and at the same time had the position of a professor, Paracelsus demanded stronger controls of apothecaries. He aske d for professional visitations of apothecaries, demanded an oath of pharmacists, and wanted a city physician to control patients' recipes. He further demanded inde pendency between pharmacists and physicians and an evaluation of a pharmacist's experience and knowledge. 26 He recognized that this letter of complaint could have adverse consequences for him, as well as for his patients. The pharmacists' guild wa s the driving force behind the city's decision that Paracelsus had to leave town. Another monopoly criticized by Paracelsus was that of the influential Fuggers, who at one point in time funded his research in their mine s. The first medical work by Paracelsus that was published during his lifetime w as \"On the thorough Healing Power of the Wood Guajak,\" 1529. He criticized the use of the wood that was imported around 1514 from South America to Europe a nd sold by the Fuggers for healing syphilis. An incidence is reported, where P aracelsus accused the Fuggers of selling an ineffective and expensive cure against s yphilis. \"... Their wood ... had no other effect than that it added to their own benefi t, while they knew that in their own country houses and alleys were full of the ill, who se illness has been made worse by 26 Paracelsus, 1944, op. cit. , 4 : 141, p. 45. Paracelsus was probably aware of the edict issued by Frederik II in 1240 that prohibited combining the functions of physician and pharmacist. With this edict, Frederik II achieved a higher differentiation of the medical profession and preve nted that physicians would have an immediate interest in increasing their own income by prescriptions. Compare Philipp Herder-Dorneich. of Health Care: History of the F ield, Relevant Areas, and Theoretical Bases). Baden-Baden: Nomos-V erlag. 39 the wood.\" 27 The Fuggers established large trade monopolies; th eir business encompassed the trade in basic ingredients of medic ine. Measures against the monopolies of large trade houses had been decided b y the Imperial Diet, but remained ineffective, because the emperor depended on the Fuggers' money in order to finance the budget. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 60.) Paracelsus thought that monopolies could be prevent ed by a supreme government. He wanted the Emperor to keep the power to himself. The Emperor should be inspired by God and act only according to God's wil l. Then, clergy, nobility, and traders could not acquire and misuse power. Trade h ouses could not, with the help of courts and governments, establish monopolies and charge high prices. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 68.) Another concern by Paracelsus was the question of t he honorarium of the physician. His thought sometimes overlaps with what has been d iscussed above because of the physician's position as a local monopolist. Par acelsus noted that the services of a good physician are of immense value, but that it can be extremely difficult to collect the payment once the patient has recovered. As soon as patients get better, they would only want to pay a small amount and some even tried to avoid payment. They cheated by not paying the physician's honorar ium. It is the manner of the patients that they try to deceive the physician . If one of them is healed, then he does not want to pay anymore. But not only the patients, also at court one judges about a physician's honorarium as if he would \"make shoes,\" despite the fact that one faces the risk for ones o wn life. If a treatment is not successful, then one wants to pay nothing at all; i f it is successful, then the patients hide so that they do not see the doctor an y more; this is worse than the devil. They like him if he charges nothing. But they start to scold and shame him if his services are not for free. No mone y is just earned und given less willingly than the doctor's fee (honorarium). Money is given willingly for playing games, prostitution, and drinking. But peop le are reluctant to pay in the case that they are helped with a bodily need; a ll sick people are of the same opinion. 28 27 The German quote reads as follows: \"Vom Holtz Guai aco gr\u00fcndlicher heylung.\" op. cit ., p. 104, note 185. 28 The German quote reads as follows: \"Um das Arzthon orar Teufel. Paracelsus reported that patients did not want to p ay for an unsuccessful treatment. When it was successful, some patients would hide, w hen it came to paying. In Basel, Paracelsus made a bad experience with a judge. When he went to court in order to get his pre-negotiated honorarium (as noted above), he was ordered to leave town. Paracelsus complained that courts did not realize t he difference between a shoemaker and a physician. He argued that the physi cian needed a risk premium for risking his own life, while the shoemaker would not be confronted with such a risk. Why, so asked Paracelsus, did people willingly pay for playing, prostitutes, and drinking and not for medical services? We can only speculate about the answer. Due to his wanderings, Paracelsus might not have been a round long enough to build up long term relationships with patients. In a long te rm relationship, it would not make sense for a patient to hide, when it comes to payin g. The patient would pay voluntarily, because in case of illness, he wanted to be treated again in the future. As Paracelsus moved around so often, he could not buil d up trust in a long term relationship, but had to rely on a short run input evaluation. Paracelsus observation that patients only want to m ake a small payment or no payment at all upon recovery refers to the subjecti ve evaluation of health lost, health gained back, and death avoided, which can be explai ned in a human capital framework. One could expect that no amount of money could compensate a person for dying if is assumed that the person 1) derives a positive utility from living, 2) does not have a very strong bequest motive, and 3) does not want to give up life in order to fulfill a particular mission for society. That p erson should be willing to spend all of her or his resources in order to avoid death, becau se the value of life is infinite to her or him. In the case of immediate death, those resou rces have lost all value, since the person cannot use them anymore. This means that the resources have no opportunity costs. Therefore, the subjective cost o f spending all money is zero to the person, who wants to avoid immediate death. Similar ly, in the case of a severe illness, the opportunity costs of resources can be expected to be relatively low. 29 In the extreme case of death avoided, the subjectiv e evaluation of life is very high, but the patients' subjective evaluation changes whe n their health improves. With better health they have gained a more promising fut ure, which makes their resources more valuable. Opportunity costs of resources are n o longer zero or very low as in the case of immediate death. Due to the recovery, p atients face much higher opportunity costs of resources. Consequently, recov ered patients might try to reduce or even avoid the payment that they were originally willing to make. Paracelsus has huren, saufen, das op. cit . (6:180). 29 These conclusions can only be drawn under the assu mption that patients behave rationally. Richard A. Posner. 1995. Aging and Old Age . Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. Compare \"T he Dread of Death,\" pp. 108-115, p. 110. 41 observed this phenomenon, but without providing the explanation that can be obtained in a human capital framework. He offered t wo main causes as an alternative explanation why a physician, in his own words, is \"not honored more,\" in other words, not considered worth the \"honorarium\" or payment. Paracelsus' first explanation referred to what is c alled today an asymmetry in information on the side of the patients. He had obs erved the paradox that patients, who are very ill, have a high willingness to pay, b ut if they become healthy, their willingness to pay is low. Therefore, he concluded that patients cannot evaluate the services of a good doctor. He argued that patients do not know how much effort and scholarship is involved by a physician, who wants t o arrive at a good therapy. In his own case, the effort consisted in his wanderings, t hrough which he gained empirical evidence and arrived at effective therapies; and be cause of this asymmetry in information, Paracelsus proposed to charge the pati ents according to their income or wealth. His second explanation of the paradox that patients wanted to pay less upon recovery than before concerned the risk involved in treatment and the possibilities of fraud this offered to a deceitful doctor. Paracelsu s thought that the physician was not honored more by the recovered patients, and consequ ently his treatment not thought to be worth the payment, because of the risk involv ed in treatment. Due to the unreliability of medical knowledge, the risk of tre atment was very high at the time. Paracelsus described some \"fools,\" fellow physician s, who for reasons of self- interest would even aggravate the risk of treatment . He considered their behavior as despicable. Paracelsus demanded that one should help the poor b y sharing available means; they should not be treated as beggars, but as honor able people. 30 In his payment practice, Paracelsus treated poor patients for free . He wanted people to make voluntary charitable contributions in order to fina nce the provision of health care to the poor. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 7.) His own testament is an example for this practice. After his death, he wanted most of his wealth to be distributed among the poor. 31 During his lifetime, Paracelsus' books got censured and he thought it was because he demanded to provide health care to the poor for free. After the censorship of Nuremberg prohibited publishing his works, he could for a long time not find print houses and publishers for his writings. (Paracelsus , 1944, op. cit. , p. 64.) He sold his writings through markets, where they oftentimes got plagiarized. He therefore wanted an author's copyright. Paracelsus input-based explanation of the physician 's fee is not incompatible with an 30 Ren\u00e9 Bernoulli. 1995. \"\u00dcber die Sozialethik des Ar ztes Paracelsus.\" Physician 14 5. 31 , \"Testament of September 21, 1541,\" pp. 120- 124. 42 alternative, the explanation according to the oppor tunity cost principle. He treated people according to the opportunity cost principle. Let us assume that he could only ask for payment, if the treatment was successful. T hen, he set the price according to how important recovery was to the patient. The rich er a patient, the higher his opportunity costs of illness could be expected to b e, because he was not able to look after his daily business. This principle is consist ent with Paracelsus ethical approach. Those patients, who could not afford payment, do no t lose much by being ill. Therefore, their opportunity cost of illness, in mo netary terms, can be assumed to be zero. This is consistent with no payment at all. On the other hand, by treating the poor, Paracelsus himself gained additional experien ce and knowledge, thereby making treatments more reliable. Not charging the p oor caused problems with some local doctors and the more affluent patients. For i nstance, they forced Paracelsus to leave Salzburg, when he helped peasants, who could not afford a physician. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 5.) In this section, we have seen that more than 500 ye ars ago, Paracelsus has made important contributions to economic issues of healt h. Next to his thoughts about the honorarium, he showed that not only the medical pra ctice is relevant for the performance of medicine, but also the way how the p rovision of health care is organized. Paracelsus has shown that monopolies in health care can have negative consequences. For instance, he fought against the p ractices of pharmacies who charged patients prices higher than necessary for a medicine prescribed. He criticized powerful local physicians, who would con centrate on the diagnosis and not try to gain additional knowledge in order to improv e the quality of health care provided. He criticized the Fuggers for excluding e ffective therapies. They had formed a monopoly through which they provided only particular ingredients for medical uses. He suffered from censorship of his wr itings; and he criticized the language monopoly. By lecturing in German, he made it possible for those students to study medicine, who did not know the Latin langu age. 2.3 Monopolies in Health Care Paracelsus criticized the exclusion of therapies an d talents by the organization of health care provision. Similar effects of monopolie s in health care can also be seen in more modern examples. 32 The consequences of monopolization in health care services will typically take the form of restrictin g supply in order to increase physicians' fees. This was shown empirically by Reu ben Kessel for specific chapters of the American Medical Association (AMA) and their overall, i. e. national approach of licensing medical schools. 33 Only licensed schools according to their standard 32 Compare the contribution by Andries Nentjes, 2002. \"The Structure of Dutch Health Care.\" Presentation at the 15th Workshop in Law and Economics, March 27-28, Erfurt. 33 Reuben A. Kessel. 1970. \"The A.M.A. and Supply of Physicians.\" Editors: Ronald H. Coase and Merton H. Miller. 1980. Essays in Applied Price Theory by 43 could graduate physical doctors. The analysis of the organization of the AMA by Kess el is an example of rent- seeking. 34 Rents are defined as \"a return in excess of a reso urce owner's opportunity costs.\" 35 Rents can either arise in the price system, and th en, they are equivalent to profit seeking, or rents can be contrived artificia lly through regulatory government actions transferring wealth from one group to anoth er. If there is competition for these artificially contrived rents, then the proces s of using resources to contrive the rents is referred to as rent-seeking. Resources use d in the competitive process to win a transfer are wasted from a society's point of view. Rent-seeking refers to this wasteful process. It does not lead to productive ga ins. On the normative side, rent- seeking theory specifies and estimates the costs of rent-seeking behavior to the economy. Positive rent-seeking theory as applied in the analysis by Kessel addresses the question of why contrived rents exist in the economy, or more specifically, in certain sectors of the economy suc h as the health care sector, and not in others. In the United States, physicians can only be licens ed if they have graduated from an accredited medical school. The accrediting authorit y is the AMA, a private institution. If accreditation is withheld, fewer students will b e trained and therefore, the supply of physicians will be curtailed. With the help of gove rnmental powers, the AMA restrained the output of physicians. Kessel showed empirically that the practice of admission with respect to accreditation of medical schools led to an artificial shortage of physicians. This made it possible for p hysicians to demand above average fees. Instrumental to the reduction of the number of physicians was the Flexner report of 1910. On request of the AMA, the influential Carnegie Foundation commissioned Abraham Flexner to evaluate proprietar y medical schools. (Kessel, op. cit ., p. 38.) Flexner discredited many medical schools . This did not occur on the basis of quality considerations. The criterion rath er was whether the medical training program of a particular school was similar to that of Johns Hopkins University. Graduates from discredited schools were not allowed to participate in the state licensure examinations. Therefore, many of the disc redited medical schools were forced to close. As a consequence, the number of ph ysicians declined. At the remaining universities, it became more expen sive for students to acquire the degree of \"Medical Doctor.\" The higher costs for st udents made it more difficult for minorities to become physicians. In particular to b lack students the requirement of internship in a hospital posed a barrier, because t hey often were not hired for reasons of discrimination. Kessel noted a sharp dec line in the number of black doctors and the closure of many black medical schoo ls. Another result of the implementation of Flexner's report was that the med ical training of students exhibited Reuben A. Kessel . Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Pre ss, pp. 37-53, p. 37. 34 Gordon Tullock. 1967. \"The Welfare Costs of Monopo lies, Tariffs and Theft.\" Western Economic Journal . 5.3, pp. 224-232. 35 Robert Tollison. 1982. \"Rent Seeking: A Survey. \" Kyklos . 35.4, p. 575. 44 relatively little variation from school to school. This training pattern of medical students was frequently written into state laws. (K essel, op. cit ., p. 39.) Kessel noted that most of Flexner's work had been d one by the AMA before, but that they had hidden their self-interest by implying the influential Carnegie Foundation. There was evidence of discrimination: the higher st andards of quality did not apply to the majority of practitioners already in existence; there were no re-examination requirements for doctors; appointment decisions in hospitals were not simply made on the basis of quality; and there was great intern al solidarity and cohesion within the medical profession, which made it unlikely that one doctor would testify against another one. (Kessel, op. cit ., pp. 44, 45.) The example of the AMA shows that organized medicin e used the power of government by successfully lobbying for a system of state licensing, which allowed setting up a practice only to physicians from accre dited school. Moreover, the AMA used litigation by bringing suit against some pract itioners who lacked the required education. Before the Flexner report was issued, me dical educators could license their own graduates. The introduction of state lice nsing allowed a reduction in the number of physicians in order to increase the fees of individual physicians. State laws fixing the training pattern of medical student s are evidence for rent-seeking as well. The effects were a less diversified student b ody and the exclusion of certain therapies. It took until the 1960s before the polic y changed. The number of electives open to students increased and the costs to become a medical doctor decreased, but Kessel noted that the number of physicians trai ned was still not allowed to increase significantly. (Kessel, op. cit ., p. 46.) The AMA systematically excluded other therapies suc h as homeopathy, osteopathy, and chiropractic treatment. While homeopaths were i mportant competitors to American physicians in the mid nineteenth century, they virtually disappeared during the first decade of the twentieth century. The medi cine used and prescribed by homeopaths became subject to regulation. 36 Regulation of ethical drugs ( i. e. drugs that require prescription) is part of the mission o f the American Food and Drug Administration. With the help of pure food and drug legislation, organized physicians were able to suppress competition from unpatented m edicine vendors. Chiropractic treatment survived the attacks of the AMA by forming its own Association and organizing a counter lobby exposing the restrictive practices of the AMA. Chiropractors cited boycotts of newspapers con taining advertisements of alternative medicine by the AMA as well as a strong increase of press releases written by organized physicians. They protested aga inst the use of the Latin language: \"By requiring collegiate training before medical school and the use of Latin prescriptions, the AMA had erected artificial barri ers designed to elevate the physician and intimidate the patient.\" (Martin, op. cit. , p. 166). Chiropractors cited the requirement of Latin for physicians as an additiona l barrier of entry posed by 36 Steven C. Martin. 1995. \"A History of Chiropractic .\" Editor: Kenneth F. Kiple. The Cambridge World History of Human Disease . Pp. 164-170, p. 164. 45 theAMA. Five hundred years earlier, Paracelsus foug ht against the knowledge of Latin as an entry requirement for physicians. The v ictory for the chiropractors came in 1987 with the defeat of the AMA in a major lawsu it. 37 Graphically, the rent-seeking situation can be depi cted as follows: In the diagram, q represents the total supply of ph ysicians and p stands for the price of medical services; p * is the price for medical services, which would pre vail in a market where physicians have to compete for patient s. Suppose the market for medical services is characterized by a downward slo ping and linear demand curve. The AMA artificially restricted the number of physi cians from q * to q m. The number of physicians, q m, is smaller than that of a competitive market, q *, and the price charged, p m, is higher than that at the competitive market, p *. The rent to be captured and/or dissipated by the costs of rent-seeking cons ists of monopoly revenue minus revenue if no monopoly is present. It amounts to th e price difference (pm - p*) multiplied with the restricted number of physicians /quantity of services (q m), pmMNp*. 37 Wilk v. American Medical Association. 1987. 671 F.

D D C pm p* M q m q * 0N q p Excess fees and services forgone Figure: Rent-Seeking in a Monopoly 46 The Harberger triangle MNC describes the welfare lo ss to society, when moving from a competitive situation to a monopoly, but the welfare loss to society from monopoly is much bigger than depicted by the Harber ger triangle. 38 Tullock denoted the rectangle pmMNp* as the potential rent to the monopolist, which is used up as costs of rent-seeking. The rectangle p mMNp* denotes the potential for waste to society, if mon opolists spent resources to capture the rent. Harberger's an alysis is in a static context, whereas Tullock refers to a dynamic process. With t he theory of rent-seeking he developed an instrument to analyze this dynamic pro cess. When moving from a competitive industry to a monopoly, then we can ass ume constancy of the cost curve only in the first step; beyond, the cost curves wil l change. Once a monopoly has been established, the external pressure to keep costs low is weakened and X-inefficiency may and probably will c reep in. This can also be considered as a type of rent dissipation. Further i nsights on the dynamics of monopoly creation can be gained from Schumpeter. 39 The AMA caused the decline of the number of physici ans, which allowed an increase in physicians' incomes. The AMA also pursued the ex clusion of certain therapies by practitioners other than physicians; and it restrai ned the diversity of students trained as physicians. We can speak of a case of rent-seeki ng, because the organized physicians took advantage of the help of government and of the legal system. In the case of the AMA, the gains of rent-seeking consiste d in the fee-revenue enjoyed by physicians in excess of the market clearing fees. T he losses to society, represented by the dead-weight loss MNC, consisted in these ext ra fees, including the cost of that slack which a monopoly structure brings about, as well as in the reduction of the level of care, both quantity and quality, and in th e non-availability of certain therapies. Under normal conditions of rent-seeking, Tullock's rectangle is a sheer waste to society; the case discussed, a reduction in the sup ply of physicians, can hardly qualify as a cost-containment measure. The theory o f rent-seeking also contains a different case, however. It is possible to use Tull ock's rectangle as a prize in order to 38 Instead of using the term \"profit,\" Tullock used t he term \"rent\" to describe the return to the monopoly. By creating a sphere of exc lusivity, the factor over which exclusive use has been defined becomes the subject of a monopoly. By implication, the owner of this artificially scarce factor enjoys the monopolist's rent. The rent can be turned into a pure monopoly p rofit or else be used for other purposes. In the case of the AMA, a side effe ct was the introduction of \"professional medical practices\" at the expense of the traditional medical practices, partly owed to the Indians. Compare Robe rt D. Tollison, op. cit ., p. 579. 39 Joseph A. Schumpeter. 1961. The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry into Profit, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle . New York: Oxford University Press. 47 stimulate a desired outcome. In that case, the rect angle is not a societal waste. It could therefore be possible to design cost-containm ent measures in terms of a rent- seeking game by giving the rectangle in the form of a prize for better treatments achieved at lower costs. Patents for drugs are the standard example of such a rent- seeking arrangement in society's interest. 40 Paracelsus' oftentimes idiosyncratic musings are by no means as far fetched as they have been depicted in the literature over the last several centuries. Without stepping into the details of specific member states of the E uropean Union, the following set of constellations can readily be found. They all illus trate Paracelsus' concerns in simple microeconomic terms. We have seen that professional groups can exploit the legal system and form a monopoly. This leads to volume re strictions and a higher price. Next to such examples of market failure we also obs erve government failure in health care. In a nationalized health care system, or in a highly regulated health care system, the state itself can act as a monopsony and appropriate the monopsony rent. Health care fees are kept low and volume of h ealth care services provided is restricted. Neither health care providers, nor pati ents can easily circumvent government controls. Under these conditions, waitin g lines are likely to result. As Buchanan and Tullock have variously pointed out, ma rket failure cannot be construed as a cause for government to intervene. O ne first has to show that governments can perform better than the market. 2.4 Summary and Conclusions Why it is useful to dig out an author who has writt en some five hundred years ago? After five hundred years have passed, Paracelsus of fers such a fascination that his social-economic work is still being edited. He iden tified the structure of the medical profession not only in relationship to the nature o f medicine, but also in relationship to local circumstances, such as city regulations, r egulations by guilts or requirements by universities. His examples of the honorarium of the physician, as well as early forms of crime and misconduct by medical doctors an d pharmacists highlight the tension between the practice of medicine as a profe ssion and as a business. His approach is holistic. In particular, he tried to in tegrate pharmacology and medical science, but in a broader context is is also seekin g the integration with what today are the social sciences. Paracelsus' put the medical science on an empirical footing. He overcame Aristotelian medicine and showed that the functioni ng of bodies relies on a chemical basis. An example is his early research on miners' diseases where he looked at the environment as a factor causing illness. Through hi s research in the mines of the 40 Backhaus, J\u00fcrgen. 1983. \"Competition, Innovation a nd Regulation in the Pharmaceutical Industry.\" Managerial and Decision Economics . Vol. 4, Nr. 2, pp. 107-121. 48 Fuggers, Paracelsus laid the basis for pharmaceutic al chemistry. In his holistic approach, he went beyond pharmacy and tried to inte grate physical, chemical, and economic variables. Paracelsus' holistic approach to health had an impa ct on Goethe and C. G. Jung. It found application in the treatment of certain menta l illnesses, for instance by the concept of an out-patient treatment for drug addict s (Blum). Holistic medicine seeks to make the patients participants in their own cure . They become agents, who share responsibilities with the health professional. This takes off part of the pressure of the health care professional. The patients monitor the variables in their conditions and will be guided to make changes in their behavior an d environment that facilitate healing. Comparisons by health economists of in-pat ient and out-patient programs show that for some mental illnesses out-patient pro grams tend to be less costly and more successful than in-patient programs. The immediate environment of the patient mattered t o Paracelsus. He adjusted therapies to individual needs and tried to find the effective ingredient for medicine in a patient's immediate environment. If the medicine was inexpensive, this caused problems with apothecaries, because pharmacists did not want to sell his medicine. As has been shown in the chapter, Paracelsus recogn ized the problem as one of organization and demanded controls and the abolishm ent of monopolistic structures. The question of honorarium received Paracelsus' att ention on several occations. He thought that no one could pay a physician the true value for what a treatment was actually worth. This thought is expressed by the te rm \"honorarium,\" because more is at stake than an exchange of money for certain serv ices; the physician is honored for his work; the value of his services is recognized. However, a dilemma occurred when patients, who recovered, did not want to pay much o r did not want to pay at all. Paracelsus explained this dilemma with two major re asons. On the one hand, he thought that the honorarium sho uld reimburse the physician for his scholarship and his efforts required to arrive at effective cures. The patients could not really know how much effort was needed to becom e proficient. Paracelsus improved the quality of health care provision by ad vancing the knowledge of medical art and practices, as well as by pointing out decei tful practices. Instead of book knowledge, he concentrated on other typically not d ocumented sources such as barbers' experience, healers' practices, and midwif es' knowledge. Therefore, Paracelsus charged the patients according to income and wealth. On the other hand, Paracelsus thought that the medi cal profession was not honored more due to the uncertain nature of medicine. In hi s time, knowledge was not always proven, cures were unreliable or there were no cure s at all, and there was a high risk of treatment. This opened the door to fraudulent be havior of deceitful doctors, who were more interested in gaining a high income and g etting the status of a doctor than in helping patients. Through his wanderings, he not only found useful experience, but also many deceitful practices in the supply of heal th care. 49 It was the Fuggers, who provided Paracelsus with th e means to conduct his path breaking research in their mines. Paracelsus critic ized them for making profits by selling ineffective medicine, such as the wood Guaj ak, thereby excluding the more effective therapies. As has been noted above, the p harmacists, acting as a monopoly, often did not want to sell Paracelsus' me dicine, because it was too cheap and would not generate enough income. He accused th e pharmacists' guilt of Basel of exploiting the situation. Ironically, research r esults today show that the competitive process of large pharmaceutical industry goes throu gh innovations. Here, a monopoly offers the security to develop and carry t hrough an innovation. This does not take away that in a monopoly inefficiency can c reep in. How much progress have we made in five hundred year s? The honorarium of the physician is still an issue that keeps health econo mists busy. Monopolies in health care are still present. They are justified by the p resence of increasing returns, for instance in the case of highly specialized treatmen t, or, as we have seen in the case of the pharmaceutical industry, in order to facilit ate innovations. But have we found the appropriate means to deal with the disadvantage s of monopolies? The introduction of diagnosis-related groups in hospita ls or pre-paid practices have increased competition in health care, but waiting l ines, a decrease in health care quality, and non-availability of certain therapies can still be observed in modern, European health care systems. From the point of view of modern health policy, Par acelsus cannot be overlooked as he overcame the deductive Aristotelian tradition in medicine and put the practice on a thorough empirical footing. This provides the bas is for sensible statistical investigations that can lead to equally sensible an d helpful policy solutions. The downside is even more important. Many politicians i n Sub-Saharan Africa claim to see a correlation between poverty and AIDS. In thei r view, the therapy would be financial aid to their (perhaps corrupt) government s. 41 From the point of view of Paracelsus, there is no empirically testable theory that can provide a link between poverty and the incidence of AIDS. The current disc ussion about the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa is based on the spurious noti on of a correlation between poverty and AIDS. This basically Marxist reasoning is not helpful for current health policy as it neglects Paracelsus' advice to look fo r the causes of a disease at its roots. Claims that the root of a particular disease lies in a socioeconomic aggregate such as poverty can have disastrous effects on both health and economic policy if they are believed. Five hundred years ago, Paracels us tried to overcome such prescientific approaches by establishing relationsh ips between physical, chemical, and economic variables. 41 Governments that are not controlled by a court of audit. 50 References Backhaus, J\u00fcrgen. 1983. \"Competition, Innovation an d Regulation in the Pharmaceutical Industry.\" Managerial and Decision Economics .

No. Wp/95/004, University of Limbu rg, pp. 7-43. 56 3.1 Introduction : Christian (Freiherr von) Wolff, his Life and Appro ach Christian Freiherr von Wolff (1679-1754) was a scho lar who is primarily known for his contributions to theoretical and applied philosophy , natural law, and logic. 1 By founding economics within the general system of natural law ( jus gentium ), he connected legal and economic analysis and thus created the field of political economy. 2 This allowed analyzing administrative practices and developing m ethods of economic policies. Wolff thus created the intellectual background for the de velopment of Cameralism. 3 In 1727, the first chairs for Cameral Sciences had been crea ted at two Prussian Universities, Halle and Frankfurt on the Oder. While Wolff propos ed a systematic pattern for the organization of the social sciences and their metho dology, he did not deal as extensively with economic or social problems as the Cameralists did later. (Compare chapter 3 on Justi). From the point of view of an economic analysis of h ealth issues his concept is challenging. For every aspect of life, his focus wa s on the household and not on the individuals. This is important, since much health r elated services can best be provided within the immediate vicinity of the person to be t reated. Even today, many such services are provided by the family directly. Conve rsely, individuals' health often depends directly on the lifestyle of the family. Wo lff introduced the principle of subsidiarity. It is relevant in questions of occupa tional and environmental health that go beyond the control of individual households; there is a case of application when young people make provisions for old age; and it became a n important principle in the health care policy of the European Union. Born in Breslau (Silesia), Wolff attended the Luthe ran School, where his intellectual capabilities became obvious early on, when he enter ed into discussions with pupils of 1 Wolff's complete works have been published by the publishing house of Olms which continuously takes care of Wolff research. Ne xt to the works themselves, there is a series of works on Wolff. (The proceedin gs from the European Journal of Law and Economics have also been published there as a reprint.) In h is general system of science, the relevant work on iss ues of health can be found in his Natural Law ( Jus Naturae , 1740). This has entered the economics literature through Roscher, Schmoller, and others. 2 Christian Wolff. 1754 Halle. 1980 Reprint. Grunds\u00e4tze des Natur- und V\u00f6lkerrechts .

A History of Economic Reasoning. Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 94. 57 the rival Jesuit School. Wolff studied Divinity at the University of Jena, but after a brief stay, he went to Leipzig to study Mathematics and N atural Sciences. After graduating, he became a staff member of the first scholarly jou rnal in Germany. He soon expanded his field by venturing into other areas within the Faculty of Arts. Upon recommendation of the universal scholar Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), Wolff was offered the chair of Mathematics at the University of Halle in 1706. He accepted the offer and in addition he got the chair of Physics in 1715. Wolff received international recognition for his scholarly work by being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, upon which he was also honored at home by being nominate d a member of the Berlin Academy. 4 In 1723, Wolff was expelled from Prussia after he h ad given his farewell address as vice rector. In this lecture, he described the prin ciples of Chinese philosophy and ethics, mainly those of Confucianism, as basically being in line with his own moral judgments. By way of example, he referred to the Ch inese as people who do not believe in one God, but whose lives and morals are based on natural principles. 5 This was perceived a provocation and gave his scholarly adversary, a pietist at the University of Halle, the opportunity to denunciate him. The pietists succeeded to convince the King of Prussia, Frederick William I ( 1688-1740), of Wolff's gross impiety and unsuitability. In an abrupt manner, the King di smissed Wolff, forcing him to leave the city of Halle and all Prussian lands within 48 hours. Wolff went to Marburg in the state of Hesse, where he was offered a chair in Mathematics, Physics, and Philosophy. He was a gift ed lecturer, doubled matriculation figures within five years, and also attracted inter national students. (Drechsler, op. cit. , p. 115). In Marburg, Wolff started rewriting his previ ous books in Latin in order to reach a wider audience. Among other honors that were bestow ed upon him, Empress Catherine made him Honorary Professor of the Academ y of St. Petersburg. During 1733, Wolff was elected one of eight foreign member s of the Royal Academy of Paris. In the meantime, Frederick William I took back his Anti-Wolffian orders, but he could not get Wolff to trust him. Only his successor Fred erick II was able to persuade Wolff to return to Prussia in 1741. Wolff went back to the U niversity of Halle as a Professor of Public Law and Mathematics. He received the title o f a Privy Councilor and became Vice Chancellor, later Chancellor of the University . On the basis of his scholarly work, he was the first to become a \"Reichsfreiherr\" (Impe rial Baron of the Roman Empire) in 1745. (Drechsler, op. cit. , p. 117). Wolff's scientific approach can be traced back to L eibniz, but the extent to which 4 These biographical notes are mainly based on the b iography by Wolfgang Drechsler, 1997, \"Christian Wolff (1679-1754). A Bi ographical Essay.\" European Journal of Law and Economics. Kluwer. 4, 5 eigene (Christian Wolff's own eatise on Wolff. Leipzig: Weidmann'sche Buchhandlung. 58 Leibniz has influenced Wolff is still a matter of d ispute. 6 At first, Wolff accepted Leibniz' work such as the theory of (individualistic) monads , but later, he developed his own concepts. For example, Leibniz considered the monad s as the smallest indivisible units of life. This was in contrast to the atoms in physi cs, which he rejected on the ground that atoms having extension must be divisible. Leib niz considered the monads as organisms which he ranged on a continuous scale fro m conscious to unconscious. Their relation to each other was determined accordi ng to the idea of a preestablished harmony. (Pribram, op. cit. , p. 94). In contrast to Leibniz' theory of the mon ads or smallest elements, Wolff's emphasis was on the hous ehold as the smallest viable entity of production and consumption. 7 He systematized Leibniz' work, but went beyond in developing his own system of thought, thereby creat ing the basis of empirical social sciences. Wolff is the founder of the natural law tradition o f the modern welfare state. He thought that the state was preceded by an era of natural ex istence. This was a state of individual freedom regulated by the principles of n atural law. The state arose out of a rational contract in order to provide for its citiz ens the greatest welfare and security. 8 Schmoller showed that Wolff and other authors of hi s time crafted systems of natural law that systematically displayed the entire legal and economic knowledge of their time. 9 He criticized that the historical dimension was mi ssing in their work, but remarked that Wolff, Althusius, Pufendorf, and othe rs took into account the reality of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While Wol ff's notion of the state is that of an abstract definition of contracts, we have to keep i n mind that it also grew out of the phenomenon he witnessed in his time, namely many in itiatives by small foundations, churches, the guilds, and other groups of persons. 10 The goal of the state is to maximize the welfare of its citizen. Central to his thought is the principle of subsidia rity which he developed in the context 6 According to Senn it is still controversial to whi ch extent Leibniz has influenced Wolff. Peter R. Senn. 1997. \"What is the Place of C hristian Wolff in the History of the Social Sciences?\" European Journal of Law and Economics. 4, pp. 147-232, in particular pp. Wolff on Subsidi arity, the Division of Labor, and Social Welfare.\" European Journal of Law and Economics. Kluwer. 4, pp. 129-146, p. 132. 8 In this respect, Wolff differed from Hobbes who co nceived of this era of natural existence as one of war of all against all. Koppel S.

Munich: Oldenburg. 59 of his outline of natural law in the jus gentium .11 Wolff stated that the state has to shoulder those tasks, which other smaller entities cannot perform by themselves. He thus referred to the principle of subsidiarity not only as a limitation for the tasks of the state, but also as a duty of persons to take over r esponsibility for their own matters. 12 In the following, we will explore the implications of Wolff's concept of the principle of subsidiarity for health economics. Wolff's method is characterized by the distinction between philosophy on the one hand and application or practical advice on the other. Absolutely valid knowledge, or `truths of reason,' could be based only on fundamental, self-evident concepts. Empirical or hi storical knowledge should serve the purpose of ascertaining the truth by the deductive method. In accordance with this classification, every science was divided into two parts: one, the philosophical, was supposed to supply the conceptual and explanatory exposition; the other, empirical, part was required to provide the facts for verifying and amplifying the knowledge gained by de ductive reasoning. As a priori sciences, ethics, politics, and economics we re qualified as branches of philosophy and natural law. Technology and administ rative practice were regarded as the corresponding empirical disciplines . (Pribram, op. cit. , p. 94). The reason why Wolff went from philosophical proble ms to practical questions was his belief that the key to practical solutions of any p roblem lies in the understanding of the underlying philosophical issue. In this way, he mad e basic contributions to many disciplines. Wolff combined the deductive method with a priori reasoning. The following example appeared in the context of an attack on Wolff's met hod of a priori reasoning by the French philosopher Etienne Bonnot de Mabley de Cont illac and was an important factor in leading to the decline of Wolffianism in France. Wolff's attempt to calculate the size of the inhabitants of Jupiter might serve to i llustrate his method of a priori reasoning: Wolff first assumed that the size of the pupil of t he eye was determined by the strength of the light which fell upon it. The size of the re st of the body was then supposed to be in proportion to that of the pupil. Working f rom assumptions about the comparative strength of the sunlight on Jupiter and on the earth, Wolff deduced 11 Jus gentium is \"the law that was common to all nations,\" as op posed to jus civile , \"the specific law proclaimed for a community by i ts duly established authorities and adjusted to particular social and p olitical conditions.\" Karl Pribram, op. cit. , p. Backhaus. 1997. \"Christian Wolff on Subsidi arity, the Division of Labor, and Social Welfare.\" European Journal of Law and Economics. Kluwer. 4, pp. Compare 6, and \"Early formulations,\" pp. 136-139. 60 the size of the pupil und thus, the size of the inh abitants. (Senn, op. cit ., p. 161). Wolff used the mathematical-deductive method and a priori reasoning in order to identify problems that could be brought to a politi cal and administrative solution. (Senn, op. cit. , p. 161). The mathematical-deductive method became the method of mainstream economics, but in contrast to the method ological individualism Wolff assumed the household to be the relevant unit of de cision making. In what follows, we will first take a look at his m ethodological contributions to medicine and then turn to his social-economic thought which is basic to health economics. 3.2 Wolff's Basic Thought on Health Wolff repeatedly referred to topics of medicine and health. In his overview on the state of medicine, he provided clear definitions of healt h (14) and illness (15), of what is natural, what is contrary to nature, and what is un natural in the art of medicine (16), and he showed causes of illness (17). 13 He recommended the use of scientific research methods in medicine, so that the knowledge base in medicine could be improved. On that basis, better medical care could be provided. Wolff defined health according to the state of the art of medicine at hi s time: \"A body will be healthy, if all of its parts are able to perform their functions well. \" 14 In addressing a shortcoming of Aristotelian medicine, he distinguished between sym ptoms and the disease itself. He defined symptoms as an indication of bad health. 15 In his view, illness also encompassed mental illness. In order to prevent ill nesses from occurring, Wolff recommended taking a look at eating and drinking. T he quality of food and cooking matters. He also recommended avoiding vices; for in stance, he discouraged people from drinking too much wine. 16 13 Christian Wolff. 1736 Halle. 1981 Reprint. \"14. Vo n (Collected Works).

He distinguished between sciences and the ir methods on the one hand and applied arts on the other. Medicine is both, a scie nce and an art. Applied arts excel by the very process of applying art. He postulated tha t medicine is characterized by uncertainty. No one could with absolute security pr edict the outcome of a treatment. Wolff suggested that only the systematic repetition of experiments and treatments could lead to an improvement of the art of medicine . Therefore, he gave physicians the recommendation to experiment. Physicians should lea rn from the methods as applied in astronomy. (Christian Wolff. 1937 Halle. 1981 Re print. Vol. 21.3, op. cit. , p. 326). Astronomers arrived at scientific principles which they tested by experimentation for more than one generation. Similarly, one should try to arrive at such principles in medicine and subsequently improve upon them by expe rimentation. Those purported principles which turn out to be wrong should be dis carded. Wolff's methodological approach still stands to rea son. He provided clear definitions and showed the way how to delineate scientific prin ciples. 17 Wolff also broke the ground with respect to normative economics. In what follows, we will take a closer look at three of his normative concepts, namely the duti es of men, the house as the basic unit of decision making, and the principle of subsi diarity. 3.3 Duties of Men Men have to fulfill specific duties in order to fur ther their own happiness and that of others, or welfare of society. 18 Wolff saw duties of the individuals for themselves , with respect to others and before God. 19 He argued that reproduction is an obligation of 406. Das Laster macht einen Menschen ungl\u00fcckseelig, oder ein make a man unhappy, or someo ne with an immoral habit is unhappy). Vol. 21.5, op. cit. , pp. 529-530. 17 The following argument by Milton Friedman underlin es the importance of Wolff's methodological approach. Friedman has maintained th at confusion between positive and normative economics can hardly be avoi ded if there are lay experts in a field. Economics shares this fate with medicin e, where personal beliefs and \"home\" remedies become important wherever convincin g evidence for \"expert\" opinion is lacking. Milton Friedman. 1953. \"The Met hodology of Positive Economics.\" Essays in Positive Economics . Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 3-43, pp. 3, 4. 18 Depending on the context, Wolff's notion of \"Gl\u00fcck seligkeit\" is translated as happiness, or, in relation to society and the state as welfare. In contrast, welfare in the modern sense tends to focus on distribution. 19 Wolff, Vol. 19, Principles of Natural Law , op. cit. , Par. Menschen gegen andere, und den Re chten, die mit 62 mankind. If children are born, parents have the dut y to bring them up carefully, and this gives them certain rights to influence behavior and activities of their children. (Wolff. Preface to Vol. 19, Principles of Natural Law , op. cit. , pp. 4, 5). Similarly, a partner in a marriage has certain rights to influence the behavi or of the other in order to raise children together. This is also true for servants w orking in the household of the master. In exchange for services, the master provides a liv ing to the servants. This, so Wolff, gives the master certain rights over the servants. Each individual has the duty to strive for happines s and lead a healthy life to achieve this goal. In particular, ... there are duties with respect to the soul, the body, and the outer state of men (Par. 57), and these duties have to be combined in such a way that not only one of the duties is being pursued, while the others ar e being neglected. And further, the man who owns more wealth, and who can spend mor e of his wealth and rely on more help from others, is obliged to render a hi gher performance. 20 In general, the duties men have to perform are perf ormance oriented. Men have the duty to gain knowledge; 21 they have the duty to invent in order to make econ omic growth possible; as skills and individual abilities differ, men have the duty to share knowledge with those who are for instance not able to learn as well as they are themselves; men also have the duty to care for thos e who are disadvantaged; they have to care for those in bad health; they have to educate children; they have to teach children how to work, preferably by setting the goo d example. 22 Wolff's duties are deducted from his moral philosop hy. In his speech on The original German quote reads as \"Man h at also Pflichten gegen die und in Wolff, Vol. 19, Principles of Natural Law , op. cit. , Par. 103. 21 Wolff took the duty to learn seriously. In particu lar for women, Wolff has written an introduction into philosophy in the German langu age. At that time, it was not possible for women to attend a university. The succ essful completion of the school of Latin was the requirement for studies at the university, but women were not admitted to the school of Latin and did th erefore not fulfill this requirement. 22 Erik Reinert and Arno Daastoel. 1997. \"Exploring t he Genesis of Economic Innovations: The Religious Gestalt-Switch and the D uty to Invent as Preconditions for Economic Growth.\" European Journal of Law and Economics . 4, pp. 233-283. 63 ... he stressed the power of reason and showed his b elief that it is possible to live a reasonable life. Reason, for him, should be the teacher and the principle governing all details of human life and might be ca lled the law of nature. People should have a right conception of good and bad. On the basis of natural law, by which all human beings are governed, people should endeavor to make their inner life as well as outer life more complete. Goo d deeds are the activities of people trying to reform their characters and other situations toward completeness, while bad deeds are activities that l ead people to a lesser, incomplete state. Happiness therefore is a result a nd not an object of human morals, which are considered to be given by nature.23 For three reasons, Wolff admired the morals of the Chinese, in particular those taught by Confucius. First, he found Chinese morals useful in daily life, because they did not only improve individual life, but could be applied to national politics as well. Secondly, he praised the educational system of China. It feat ured lower and upper schools. This school system led to mass education of the Chinese, and also provided possibilities of learning for future leadership positions. Thirdly, \"Wolff noted that pregnant women were educated by music and instructive stories that were considered highly useful for the mental development of the fetus.\" 24 In the example, the mother's thinking can affect t he fetus' mental development. This shows Wolff's conce rn of individual health as an influencing factor in determining the future develo pment of people. Wolff distinguished between duties of the person wi th respect to him- or herself and with respect to others. With respect to themselves, persons have to maintain their health. For this reason, suicide is not an option m en have (Par. 112). In Par. 113, Wolff clearly stated the person's responsibility for his or her own health. All parts of the body have to be maintained in a s tate that they can be used in their function. Men have the duty to maintain good health. They have to be careful not to get sick. Illness should not be caus ed by men's own faults. If someone becomes ill, he has to take efforts to beco me healthy again. 25 23 Kanamori, Shigenari. 1997. \"Christian Wolff's Spee ch on Confucianism- Confucius as Compared with Wolff. European Journal of Law and Economics . 4, pp. 299-304, p. 302. 24 Kanamori, 1997, op. cit ., 303. Chinese medicine is based on the observatio n of nature. For instance, the influence of weather can cause an illness from the outside, if a person has not sufficient energy to r esist the illness. Emotions can cause illnesses from the inside, whereby every stro ng emotional intensity has a negative meaning. In Chinese medicine, we miss bact eria and viruses causing illnesses. A critical review of the effects of Chin ese methods of popular healing on society and its relationship to modern medicine has been written by Angela Ki Che Leung. 1995. \"Diseases of the Premodern Peri od in China.\" Kenneth F. Kiple (Editor). The Cambridge World History of Human Disease. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 354-360. 25 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Da al le 64 From the duty to maintain health follow individual rights to all those things, which allow the maintenance of life and health or which serve t he purpose to regain health, such as the right to food, drinking-water, and medicine (Pa r. 114), as well as the right to clothing (Par. 115) and shelte r (Par. 116). While men have the duty to work, a division of labor should take place that takes individual skills and differences in the ability-to-work into account. People should not damage their health by working too hard or by performing the wrong kind of work (P ar. 124). They should behave cautiously in order not to risk an accident or even risk their life (Par. 133). Wolff stated that the duties with respect to others are the same as the ones one has to follow with respect to oneself (Par. 133). Therefor e, for instance, if suicide is not an option, euthanasia is not an option, either. No one should hurt a person or take the life of a person, even if that person wants it (Par. 141 .) 3.4 The Principle of Subsidiarity Wolff described the duties of men as means to reach the goal of life, which is happiness of people. He described the primary form, in which this takes place, as the house. Wolff saw the household, or house, as a func tional unit. It was an organization which provided a living for its members. The member s would have different skills and abilities. A house could encompass the members of s everal generations of a family, as well as entire families of the workers. The house a lso includes the sphere of production, not only that of consumption. A busines s could be connected to the house in order to provide an income, but there was a divi sion of labor in the house and not only production for the market. Since at the time o f Wolff the roles between husband and wife, master and apprentice, etc. were given an d technology was largely unchanged despite Wolff's emphasis on technological progress, the division of labor is assumed to be given in the house. 26 (Par. 112); so ist der Mensch verbunden er wieder gesund werden.\" Wolff, Vol. 19, Principles of Natural Law , op. cit. , Par. 113. 26 The \"house\" then is, as in modern economics, i.e. the new home economics, a locus of both, production and exchange. In the Chic ago approach the household is not restricted to consumption, but includes the production of tailored services such as education, health care, the training of goo d habits, etc. These are also seen as capital, as they raise earnings later on. I f we assume that the income and the time budget of the household are given and that there are only two activities of the household, buying articles of mas s production and producing human capital in the household, then a substitution and income effect will arise in case of a price change. If the prices of mass pr oduction articles fall this is tantamount to increasing the household budget given the same basket of commodities demanded. The income effect gives rise to a substitution effect. 65 Men are always considered members of a house, unles s stated otherwise. In the house, each member has to be careful of not hinderi ng other members from fulfilling their duties. The house is the vehicle where men re alize their strive for happiness in very basic terms (food and shelter), but also in sp iritual terms which is part of the duties of men. We have seen above that it is the duty of a person to stay healthy; persons' individual health is part of and a condition for ha ppiness of the entire household and one has also to contribute to the health of others. A household can maintain the individual health of its members in various ways. M easures of personal hygiene can be taken in the house. Cleaning the house and separati ng animals from the family quarters are important factors in preventing diseas e. By using a sensible diet the household can contribute to producing individual he alth. The household provides care of its members, in particular of children and of th e elderly. Hence, basic functions of health care are to be provided in the house. The sa me is true for other basic functions resulting from the duties of men. For people who do not belong to a house, Wolff reco mmended the following social- economic provisions. 27 In order for all subjects to lead a decent life, i t is also necessary that the needy and the beggars receive what they require for their basic needs and, in order not to burden the subjects too much with requests for g ifts and donations, one has to pay heed to what the natural law indicates on th e subject of gifts and donations (section 488 ff.). Hence it is necessary to build houses of re-education where those who can work, but rather prefer the lif e of a beggar, learn how to work. Similarly, houses for the poor and destitute are necessary to provide for those who cannot earn their living with their own w ork and who have no relatives or friends who could support them. Further, it is n ecessary to have hospitals where the sick can be nourished and healed. At last , schools for the destitute need to be available in order to teach the children of poor parents, without asking for a fee, all those subjects, which for the m to know is either necessary or useful. 28 The share of human capital produced in the househol d will rise, the cheaper the price of articles of mass production will get. 27 J\u00fcrgen Backhaus. 1989.

Wolff defined society as \"a contr act which serves the purpose to reach a certain goal in a common effort. The number of people who form a society in order to reach a certain goal is also referred to a s a society (societas).\" 29 A house is also considered a society itself. It has the purpos e to provide a living for its members. Wolff defined societies according to the goals they serve. While he considered the houses as the basic units o f decision making, he recognized that they are not self sufficient and that forms of cooperation between houses are needed to perform tasks that are beyond the capacit y of the single household. In this context, Wolff introduced the concept of the state. It is readily apparent that individual households cannot provide for themselves everything that is necessary in order to satisfy th eir basic needs, comfort and enjoyments, i.e. wealth. They cannot by themselves be sure to be ab le to enjoy the fruits of their property and to enforce their p roperty rights. Nor can they defend themselves against aggression from outside. Therefore, one has to undertake a common social effort to achieve what in dividual households cannot realize on their own. And, to this end, societies h ave to be established. A society, which has been established to this end, is called a state (civitas). der . the Welfare State). Inaugural Lecture, Maastricht, p. 6 , 7. Translation, J. Backhaus, 1997, op. cit. , p. 136. 29 In the original, the quote reads as follows: \"Die Natural Law , op. cit. , Par. 836. 30 The original German (civitas).\" Wolff, Vol. 19, Principles of Natural Law , op. cit. , Par. 972. 67 Wolff sees providing law and order, as well as defe nse, as common tasks to be provided by the state. On the other hand, taking ca re of people is in the first place the task of the household, to which the person belongs, the \"house\" being a \"society\" in itself. In several places of his work, Wolff referr ed to the principle of subsidiarity, which can be summarized as follows: where a household is no longer able to function economically, common social efforts should be under taken to perform the task. 31 For persons in need who have no \"house,\" relatives or friends they belongs to, the measures described by Wolff are to be taken by othe r societies but the house. Those persons in need, who belong to a household, are bou nd to share in the duties of the household, and the household is responsible for the provision of nourishment, care and education. The limit of the intervention of another house, a private charity, the state, or any other social-economic entity, consists in the a bility of the private households to care for their members. 32 Hence, with \"societies\" Wolff meant other entities in society, not necessarily the state. This corresponded to wha t he observed in the reality of his time. These entities and only residually the state perform what the households cannot do by themselves. Wolff was well aware of the limit s of the state. The state should only support those activities of the citizens which were conducive to the common welfare. The history of the subsidiarity principle shows tha t Wolff's thought had an impact, indeed. After the Protestant churches insisted on f orms of self-governance against encroachments from the state, 33 half a century later, the Roman Catholic Church proposed the subsidiarity principle as a guideline for social policy with a view to fascist forms of government. 34 The interpretation of the Roman Catholic Church is more narrow in that it implies a hierarchical organizati on of society. The notion of lateral subsidiarity, where different, conceivably unequal bodies join in a common effort, is 31 See also J\u00fcrgen Backhaus. 1989. Die Finanzierung Hand der Theoriegeschichte .

His thinking can partly be put in line w ith that of Melanchthon, Althusius, and later Abraham Kuyper, who coined the term \"soevereiniteit in eigen kring\" when he delivered the Inaugural Addres s upon the occasion of the inauguration of the Free University of Amsterdam (O ctober 20, 1880).

See p. 462. 34 In 1931, Pope Pius XI introduced the subsidiarity principle in the Encyklika Quadragesimo anno as a basic pillar to the order of society.

The follow ing illustrations show that Wolff's thought can fruitfully be applied to contemporary h ealth issues. 3.5 An Illustrative Application of Wolff's Thoug ht Wolff showed that other politico-economic units hav e to intervene, if issues are involved that go beyond the control of families and individu als. Beyond the control of families and individuals figure issues such as consumer safe ty, occupational safety, sanitation requirements, measures of hospital and school hygie ne, prevention of infectious diseases, etc. If issues cannot be controlled by fa milies or individuals, health policy (by boards of health) and legislation (occupational hea lth, environmental health) are required for regulation and supervision. When looki ng at the history of single diseases such as tuberculosis, then Wolff's teachings have b een followed late. For instance, only in 1905, the World Tuberculosis Congress was held i n Berlin in order to eradicate the disease worldwide (compare chapter 10). An example where consumer safety and occupational h ealth are involved is the Australian asbestos tragedy. Medical research estab lished asbestos as a carcinogen in the 1930s, but consumers in industrialized countrie s and mine workers in Australia have been most commonly exposed to this carcinogen well until the 1970s. 35 The Australian asbestos mining industry developed large ly after these medical findings had been published. Politicians' and institutions' dela y in reacting to available knowledge led to the suffering and death of several hundred A ustralians. For decades, industry and state agencies ignored existing medical knowled ge. Neither did they provide laborers and consumers with information about healt h hazards of asbestos, nor did they enforce efforts to prevent the tragedy. The Australian asbestos tragedy could have been pre vented, if employers had been required to assume the health insurance costs of th eir employees. In addition, a variety of other measures could have been taken such as the provision of information to consumers and producers about the health hazards of asbestos, or the enforcement of effective safety measures. If one disconnects the d ecision making on asbestos use and those decisions at the micro level, which result in the adverse health effects, crises like the asbestos tragedy can occur. Following Wolff's a pproach, decision units would integrate costs and benefits and translate influenc e from, for instance the family, where the adverse effects of asbestos are clearly felt, t o the firms, where those decisions are taken. The integration occurs through the viability of the family and the state proper. Basic functions of health care are provided in the \"house\" as defined by Wolff. Today, 35 Ursula Backhaus. 1991. Book review: \"Jock McCulloc h. Asbestos: Its Human Cost. 1987.\" Business Library Review , Vol. 17 (2), pp. 128-130. 69 the role of the family has changed with more women being in paid employment, and increased mobility. In particular the number of eld erly is on the rise which poses a threat to society under the current pay-as-you-go s ocial security systems. (Reiner Leidl, 1998, op. cit. , p. 40.) By focusing on social security aspects, e conomists easily overlook the potential of the elderly for productiv ity. 36 They might be able to longer maintain an household and work than expected. A clo ser look at the problematic of aging by Posner revealed where the limits of the el derly are to work and to take care of themselves. 37 By taking their benefits into account, he arrived at the conclusion that the elderly do not pose as much of a threat to society as is usually held. They are productive longer, better health care and a better lifestyle add to healthy years in the middle of life, and they have more means on their o wn. Therefore, they can enjoy living in a household separate of their children, which gi ves them more privacy. Posner concluded that retirement age should be increased u nd subsidies to health care payments of the elderly should be abolished or at l east reduced, as these subsidies make health care cheaper for the elderly, who conse quently consume more than they otherwise would. Posner suggested a case for the su bsidiarity principle. He noted that the young are not likely to fully internalize the n eeds of their own old age and will therefore not make enough provisions for old age. H is reasoning is the following: People experience somatic and nonsomatic changes wh en aging, as well as a change in perspective: young people look in the future and are filled with hope; the elderly, closer to death, look back to the past and build on their experience. This idea by Aristotle inspired Posner to develop the concept of \"multiple selves\" within the framework of a human capital model. As people age t he change is so profound that one and the same person can be thought of as a youn g self and an old self, which intuitively explains why young people tend to consi der a life with severe ailments in old age as undesirable, and sometimes would rather be d ead than enduring such a life, but old people typically look at life from another pers pective and endure many restraints, before they want to die. Multiple-selves analysis s uggests that the young self might not fully internalize the welfare of his old self, an e xplanation why young people tend not to provide enough for old age. The consistent applicat ion of the subsidiarity principle means to encourage persons' ability for self care i n old age. The state or a private agency would have to make sure that savings at a yo unger age will meet the requirements of the future elderly person. When the European Union adopted the subsidiarity pr inciple as a policy principle, it became a surprisingly modern tool for organizing co mplex systems for delivery of services, involving different levels and types of o rganizations. The principle of subsidiarity encompasses two types: horizontal and lateral subsidiarity. Horizontal subsidiarity has its roots in the cooperation among houses, as urged by Wolff, and 36 Book review by Ursula Backhaus on The Coming Health Crisis: Who Will Pay for Care for the Aged in the 21st Century? 1993. John R. Wolfe. Business Library Review , Vol. 22 (2), 1997, pp. 115-120. 37 Book review by Ursula Backhaus. 2001. Business Library Review International . \"Posner, Richard A. 1995.

When different levels of governm ent, both nationally and super nationally, have to cooperate this is referred to a s lateral subsidiarity. Both types, the lateral and horizontal application of the subsidiar ity principle, are important to the European Union. 38 The principle of subsidiarity was introduced to Eur opean health policy by the Maastricht Treaty of 1991. Article 129 deals with subsidiarity with respect to health care and is interpreted as \"defining public-health issues as a matter of concern at the Community level to the extent they cannot be dealt with appro priately at the national level.\" 39 The recent experience with the subsidiarity principle i n the European Union, in particular the examples of cross-border care between European Unio n member states, shows that cooperation among the different countries has to be improved. Application of the subsidiarity principle suffers from inefficiencies resulting from bureaucratic hassles and high transaction costs due to country borders that make cross-border health care difficult. 40 New methods of coordination and cooperation such as the proposal by Frey and Eichenberger can reduce these inefficiencies. 41 Political entities in federations are typically territorial jurisdictions just as country borders, counties, cantons, districts and the like. These boundaries stand in the way to fulf ill a political goal. For those tasks which transcend territorial boundaries or may not e ven be related to them it has been proposed to introduce political units, which are de lineated according to the task to be fulfilled. These are functional, overlapping and co mpeting jurisdictions (Foqui) that can lower costs by making different systems compatible to each other. This leads to a higher efficiency of the Foqui as compared to the s ingle and incompatible political entity one had before. An example where a Foqui could be set up is the so- called \"Euregio\" formed by the 38 Harmonization efforts in the European Union are no t extended to the social security systems of different member countries, but there are some exceptions with respect to health, for instance in the field o f occupational health, environmental issues, and the harmonization of mark ets for goods and services, which may affect pharmaceutical products. Due to th e complexity involved, we will exclude harmonization efforts from considerati on. Compare 1-10, p. 1. Reiner Leidl. Editor. Health Care and its Financing in the Single European Market .

Cost-Containment measures in t he Dutch health care system have led to waiting lines for treatment of particul ar illnesses, such as heart disease, some orthopedic procedures, or eye surgery. Dutch p atients already can go over the border and face a much shorter or no waiting list f or the same procedure. In the Dutch province of Limburg this happens quite frequently. Agreements have been reached with health insurers to reimburse Dutch patients fr om Limburg, if they receive treatment in the \"Euregio.\" Additional agreements with health care providers in the neighboring countries have been made as well. There are certain projects, where the three countries work together. Yet, cooperation and coord ination could still be improved. By establishing a Foqui in health care in the \"Euregio \" gains are to be expected for all sides participating. 42 The introduction of the subsidiarity principle with respect to health policy of European member countries shows that better coordination and cooperation is required. This could be achieved by establishing FOQUIs,' leading towards more efficiency in providing health care. The discussion, however, goe s far beyond practical issues. The role of individual member states is changing as the y move towards a post national state. 43 In the light of globalization on the one hand, and an increasing fragmentation of compound states on the other such as the dissolutio n of the former Soviet Union, the peaceful divorce of the former Czechoslovakia, and the devolution in the United Kingdom and in Spain, is the future of the nation-s tate unclear. 44 It is even possible that citizens define themselves through functions instea d of birth or ethnicity. 45 In this sense, the principle of subsidiarity would apply ag ain in terms of differentiating the different functions the state has to perform from t he point of view of a citizen 42 Coordination within the Foqui and among the differ ent Foquis' can be achieved by voting. In the health care industry it is diffic ult to arrive at decisions due to the presence of bureaucratic committees, power structur es in hospitals, the influence of special interest groups, political reg ulations and verbal agreements between parties, short- and long-run contracts with health insurers, etc. Cutting through all this is a voting mechanism such as the demand-revealing process which takes the intensity of preferences into accou nt. This voting mechanism could be used to achieve simplicity of decision-mak ing within and among Foquis.' At the same time, it would cut through bur eaucratic hassles and allow for a more democratic decision making in the Europe an Union.

The goal of the economy is happiness of the people. In order to reach happiness, men are bound to fulfil their duties with respect to God, themsel ves, and others. This includes caring for one's own health and that of others, sharing knowle dge, providing education to children, or helping each other in case of need. In his outline of natural law, Wolff defined basic principles which are relevant to health economics. The \"house\" - conceived as an integrated production and consumption household - is in his conception the smallest unit of decision-making. The house provides among other things health care for its mem bers, when they are unable to care for themselves. Wolff was careful in describing und er which circumstances other socio- political units might take over tasks from smaller units. The \"house\" is the relevant unit of decision making, but Wolff saw a role of the sta te or any other \"society\" in the coordination and cooperation of the houses. In this context, he developed the subsidiarity principle. The limits of the intervent ion of a \"society\" consist in the ability of the private households to care for their members. C onsidering the time he wrote, Wolff saw a major role for charities and other socio-poli tical units in health care, and only residually one for the state. Wolff stood for a ben ign state. The task of the state was to provide services which could not be organized at a lower level such as law and order and defense. With respect to methodology, a bridge can be built from Paracelsus to Wolff, who more than a century earlier tried to put medicine on an empirical footing. In maintaining that medicine was not only an art, but also a science, W olff demanded that scholarly methods should be applied to the field in order to increase medical knowledge. He held that only on a better scientific basis, one could a rrive at better medical care. The emphasis in this chapter is on the original con tents of Wolff's work, but in order to show its relevance, three applications have been ch osen. First, with respect to consumer and occupational safety, there is a role f or the state or another agency, if consumers or workers cannot adequately protect them selves. Second, combining the notion of subsidiarity and Posner's work on aging l eads to the conclusion that the present policy, which treats the elderly as being d ependent from the state, should be reformed to a policy, which encourages and supports self care over people's entire life cycle. Third, in the Maastricht Treaty of 1991, the subsidiarity principle was introduced with respect to health care. Examples of cross-bord er care show that a better coordination and cooperation is required among Euro pean countries in order to make application of the subsidiarity principle more effi cient. However, if the vision of a decline of the nation-states holds true, where the future c itizens will define themselves rather 73 through functions instead of birth or ethnicity, th en problems of coordination and cooperation would be different. In this sense, the principle of subsidiarity would apply again in terms of differentiating the distinct func tions the state has to perform from the point of view of a citizen simultaneously belonging to different functional states, or, as Bruno Frey calls them, Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdictions . Invoking the principle of subsidiarity, the early w riters assigned the state an important role with respect to regulation and supervision. Th e theoretical basis for these measures starts with Wolff and Paracelsus. The coll ective area requires health policy. The main example is the development and implementat ion of health insurance as shown by Schmoller (compare chapter eight). A diffe rent aspect was pronounced by the Cameralists (compare chapter four): the welfare of an economy can be increased by a better health state of the people. This means that the tax base can be broadened and consequently that the state income can be incre ased through public health policy. References Hand der Theoriegeschichte .

New York: Spring er. 78 4.1 Introduction In this chapter, the contributions of the Cameralis ts are investigated, in particular those of Justi (1717 - 1771), to the understanding of wha t later was to become health economics. After the disastrous events of the Thirt y Years' War (1618 - 1648) human capital mattered. Hence, Cameralism emerged as a sc ience of economic policy which was directed towards economic development. It was n ot incompatible with intellectual developments elsewhere, notably in France, but yet totally different in its emphasis on economic development and the human factor in produc tion. The most prolific writer of the Cameralists, who fully developed the science, w as Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi. 1 To him not only the quantity, but also the quality of the population mattered. Since health has an influence on both, he elaborate d policy measures that would improve the health of the population in order to ma ke economic development possible and to sustain further growth. Justi proposed incen tives that would stimulate agriculture and thus encourage an improvement of the nourishmen t of the population in order to enhance health; he came forward with ideas how to r aise the quality of health care and proposed the introduction of a supervisory board fo r health care provision; and he was concerned with the health of soldiers. As was commo n in Cameralism, Justi considered people the wealth of the nation. Health is therefor e a matter of investment, not consumption; the healthier the population, the high er the wealth of the population. Cameralism emerged in the middle of the sixteenth c entury, developed mainly during the time of the Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648), and ended in the late eighteenth century. Cameralism was a scientific development of its own kind; \"nowhere the doctrine of the state, as well as administrative sc ience was connected to the social economy in the same way as in the German territoria l states.\" 2 The Cameralists wanted to increase and improve the population as a basis for economic development. They recognized a higher level of education and bet ter health as factors that advance development of a nation.

The Impact of the Thirty Years' War The Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648) and its aftermath gave Cameralism it s particular character. The environment under which the Camerali sts, as advisors to the feudal princes, had to function was characterized by compe tition between the many German states, a weak central power, and a war-torn countr y with a destroyed economic basis and an overall population that had fallen by roughl y one-third, from about 21 million to around 13 million. 4 In this situation, the Cameralists turned their at tention to the development of human capital, as they believed that this would foster economic development. More than three hundred small and independent sover eign states were created in the peace negotiations of the Thirty Years' War that st arted in Hamburg in 1641 and ended in the Westphalian cities of M\u00fcnster and Osnabr\u00fcck in 1648. Each state had only limited power, and the states had little unity amon g themselves. The rulers of the individual states could act independently. The cent ral power, consisting of the Emperor and the Imperial Diet (Reichstag), was weakened. Ce ntral taxation was almost impossible due to war-related damages and the destr oyed economy. 5 The Emperor could not act by himself in foreign policy. Each in dividual ruler had the free right to form an alliance with a foreign country, as long as it w as not directed against the Emperor or the Empire. The subjects of a territory had to foll ow the religion of the ruler of a territory, but they had the right to emigrate if they wished t o. The many independent and small states competed with each other for skilled labor a nd capital. 3 This is the definition by Albion W. Small, the fou nder of American sociology, who investigated social theory in the works of the Came ralists. He traced the Cameralists' social theory back to their concern to furnish the state with ready means. Albion W. Small. 1909. The Cameralists: The Pioneers of German Social Polity. Burt Franklin: Chicago, p. viii. 4 The reduction in population was not evenly distrib uted. \"The population of W\u00fcrttemberg fell from 400,000 to 50,000. The Palati nate lost more than 90 percent of its population. Three million people in Bohemia were reduced to 800,000.\" J\u00fcrgen Backhaus and Richard E. Wagner, 19 87, \"The Cameralists: A Public Choice Perspective.\" Public Choice . 53, p. 4. The contributions to the Heilbronn Symposion on the Thirty-Years War have sh own that at the time of the Thirty Years' War, the statistical basis was no t set up in well-defined units. For instance, one could not distinguish between the causes of death such as natural death or death caused by war and epidemics. 5 Compare Brockhaus Encyclopedia, 1892. Brockhaus: Leipzig, Berlin, Vienna, pp. 665-666. 80 Distinctive Feature of Cameralism: the Concern wit h the Police Function The Cameralists, in serving as economic advisors to the princes and feudal rulers of the territories, grounded their advice on economic arguments. 6 It was in the interest of the individual rulers to create conditions that att racted people to live in their territory. By developing an infrastructure that formed the basis for economic development, Cameralists tried to create a tax base for the stat e. The Cameralists were not only concerned with the treasury function, but also with the police functions of the state. Police functions in Cameralism are broader than in the English understanding of the word. 7 They encompass such measures as public education, public health policy, environmental policy, and even the regulation of th e manufactures through the guild system ( Polizeigewerbe ). (Pribram, op. cit. , p. 96). Cameralists systematically proposed the use of the police function as the most appropri ate way to establish a basis for national wealth, which would lead to further econom ic growth. Justi had a clear view of the importance of human capital as he wrote \"...all skills of the people living in the state, and even the people themselves are part of the weal th of the state.\" 8 Thus, human capital and its development form the major basis of economic development. Cameralists designed and applied the police functio ns to foster economic development on the basis of human capital. The concern with the police functions distinguishes Cameralists from Mercantilists and Physiocrats. Prominent figures in the history of ec onomic thought literature did not always see this clearly; for instance, the views of Adam Smith and Heinrich Rau contributed to misconceptions around Cameralism. Ad am Smith did not distinguish between Mercantilists and Cameralists. 9 Therefore, his criticism of the Mercantilists as pure collectors of money has been applied to the Ca meralists as well. Adam Smith disliked the Cameralists' policies, and in particul ar their projects of entrepreneurial activities leading to non tax-revenues of the state s (werbende Staatseinnahmen).\" 6 J\u00fcrgen Backhaus and Richard E. Wagner. 1987. \"The cameralists: A public choice perspective.\" Public Choice. 53, pp. 3-20, p. 6. 7 Therefore, a better translation might be policing function or simply policy or policy making, but policy and policy making are too arbitrary. Policing would presume a set framework of objectives which had to be developed first. 8 Louise Sommer. 1920-25 (1), 1967 (2), op. cit. , p. 233. The statement by Justi (1758) reads in the original d Cameralwissenschaften. (The State Economy or Systematic Treatment of all Economic and Cameralist Sciences). Leipzig: Breitko pf. Vol. I, p. 160. 1994. \"The German Manuela Fondazione Luigi Einaudi, pp. 329-356, p. 344. 81 The critics were also responsible for a misconcepti on between the Cameralists and the Physiocrats. 10 Rau stated that the Cameralists had the same goal as physiocrats, namely the maximization of the budget of the feudal rulers. He described the Cameralists as advisors mainly concerned with the t reasury (\"Schatzkammer\") and gave thereby the term \"Cameralism\" too narrow a mea ning. Rau neglected that \"Cameralism\" not only meant that the Cameralists we re acting in the interest of the treasury, but that they also had access to a govern ment (\"Ratskammer\") as advisors of the princes or feudal rulers. 11 Rau concluded that the Cameralists were mainly interested in the treasury function and that they o nly added to the treasury the functions of police later in order to provide security, educa tion and certain minimum hygienic standards for food. He stated that the police funct ions of health, formal schooling and basic hygiene were not connected to the study of th e treasury. (Rau, op. cit. , p. 12). According to Rau, only the Cameralists' political a dvice on the treasury was inspired by the question how to increase the national wealth, b ut not so their concern with the police functions. Rau's interpretation of Cameralism is too narrow. I n Cameralism, the police functions surely were part and parcel of a policy to increase national wealth and ensure further economic growth. Justi wanted to raise only so much money as is necessary for the state to fulfil its functions. Such a tax policy in cluding entrepreneurial projects by the state would fit in a broader policy orientation wit h the aim to maximize the welfare of the citizens in order to create a basis for economic de velopment and a tax base for the state. The Cameralists' insights go beyond a narrow concer n with the treasury. They had access to policy makers and while they studied ways to increase the revenues of the treasury, this was not unconnected to the study of the police functions. Cameralists went beyond the narrow concern of administration of the budget and studied the conditions that make for greater economic success i n order to broaden the tax base. The emphasis of their work lies on proposals for me asures for how to increase the state income. They developed theoretical principles of economics and can be considered the forefathers of public economics. Cam eralism included the study of many fields, for instance agriculture, forestry, mi ning and factory problems. Cameralists realized that the economic well-being of a country depends on the health of the citizen, 10 D. Karl Heinrich Rau. 1823. of its Elements). Heidelberg: Universit\u00e4ts=Buchhandlung vo n E. F. Justi's explanation of t he name \"Cameralism\" is quoted and put in context to the Cameralists' appro ach of a science of public finance by J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, 1989, in Die Finanzierung an Hand der Theoriegesch ichte. (Financing the Welfare State. An Orientation by a History of Econo mic Thought Approach). Inaugural Lecture, p. 8. 82 and they developed and realized measures of public health. They were also concerned with citizens' schooling. The Cameralists' concern with the police functions led to an increase in the human capital formation. In their v iew this would lead to a rise in national wealth and consequently to a broader tax b ase. Wicksell recognized the particular strength of the Cameralistic approach. In comparing physiocracy to Cameralism he noted the following: In a word, free exchange in economics may be compa red to the method of `trusting to nature' in medicine - when the doctor really does nothing, but leaves nature to effect its own cure. The term `physiocrac y' means precisely this. In a state of perfect health, which corresponds to a sys tem of economic equality, this is certainly the only correct treatment. Even in il l health, it certainly has a great advantage over bad treatment and dubious medicines. On the other hand, it cannot compare with a truly scientific treatment, w hich assists nature in a reasonable manner. Moreover, in the last resort, th e effects of even the most brilliant cure cannot be compared with those of rat ional hygiene, which aims at preventing disease and preserving health. 12 The latter cure described by Wicksell refers to Cam eralism. 13 Indicators of economic growth and population growth suggest that the state s applying the Cameralists' prescriptions performed well, indeed. When compared to France and other mercantilist states under the influence of the Physiocrats, econ omic growth and prosperity was much higher in the states advised by Cameralists th an in those states, which followed Physiocratic thought. 14 Policies directed towards investment take a long t ime before they show results. Roscher (1817-1894) took the emp hasis of health issues from the Cameralists and gave social policy advice in line w ith Cameralist thought (compare chapter four). Therefore, it is legitimate to inter pret the later demographic development as a success of the Cameralists. For instance, the average annual increase in population in the time period between 1860 and 1895 in Germany was 0,93%, and in France 0,29%, roughly a third of the former growth rate. 12 Aalen: Scientia, p. 82. Justi preceded the Physiocrats. He also pursued the idea of the single tax, which later became the main feature of the Physiocrats. 13 Wicksell recognized the implications of the Camera list period. He tried to implement a similar institutional-constitutional or der in Sweden, which would take the profit-seeking motive of legislators and b ureaucrats into account and reward public officials according to their success in achieving the aggregate well-being of the members of the state.

Editor. Pioneers of Modern Economics. Maastricht Lectures in the Political Economy . Cheltenham: Edward Elgar. 83 Health Related Thought in Cameralism Predecessors and precursors to Cameralism discussed health in connection to poverty and thought of ways of how to relieve poverty. 15 Two early representatives are Melchior von Osse (1506/7 1612). Von Osse was opposed to all kinds of tributes to the state and especiall y to taxes, when they were not collected with the purpose of being spent on measures of reli ef in extraordinary cases. He argued that through regularly and permanently levie d taxes those families would fall destitute, which needed all the means available for self-support. Due to his Christian duty, the Duke should provide help to the destitute . Van Osse proposed that the state should acquire income by founding and running produ ctive enterprises, and not by demanding tributes and levying taxes. According to Obrecht, it was in the interest of the state that people earn as much income as possible. Obrecht proposed individual insurance contracts and savings accounts to relieve poverty and the devastating effects of illness. Parents, who had been poor at t he time, when their children were born, but who were later able to support themselves due to a higher income or because of inheritances made, should create savings in orde r to be able to provide for their children. Those people, who not only have enough me ans to provide for food and housing, but who have some money left, should inves t in insurance funds in order to be able to support themselves in sickness or old age. 16 Early Cameralists such as Johann Joachim Becher (16 35 - 1682), Philipp Wilhelm von H\u00f6rnigk (1640 - 1714), and Wilhelm von Schr\u00f6der (16 40 - 1699) made calculations on the value of the people and concluded that a numero us and healthy population was a source of wealth to the country. The focus of Johan n Georg Leib's (1670-1727) work was on qualitative development, on \"how a ruler can improve land and people, foster industry and raise the nutritional standard.\" 17 Veit Ludwig von Seckendorf (1626 - 1692), another Cameralist of that period, was in fa vor of population growth. 18 The measures he proposed were development of agricultur e and small industry, prohibition of exports, and abolition of usury and monopolies. While he was opposed to taxes in 15 Louise Sommer. (1920-25) (1), 1967 (2). Die \u00f6sterreichischen Kameralisten in dogmengeschichtlicher Darstellung.

Vol. 6. Jena: Gustav Fischer, pp. 665. 84 general, von Seckendorff preferred the excise tax, but only if needed. 19 Under the excise tax, the poor would have to pay relatively m ore than the rich did. This had to be accepted, since it would enable the rich to keep th eir means and use their accumulated funds to provide employment. In this way, by provid ing employment opportunities through trade and agriculture the rich would suppor t the poor more than under any other tax scheme. He supported a tax system which d iscourages consumption and encourages investment. If a household was unable to achieve the subsistence level, he distinguished between poor, but able people, and th ose who are both, poor and unable at the same time. Only the latter category includes the sick and unable elderly and therefore deserves to be supported. (Peter, op. cit. , p. 34 - 36). Von Seckendorf developed a new view on the state, w hich he understood as a moral undertaking. 20 At the time, it was popular to believe that for th e politician only the interest of the state was important without conside ration of moral and legal restraints. This view he rejected as a misunderstanding of Mach iavelli. His main works, German State of Feudal Rulers ( Teutscher F\u00fcrstenstat , Frankfurt a. ( Teutscher Christen-Staat , Jena 1685) received several revised editions. After having served as custodian of the d ucal library of Gotha, he became Councillor at the Court (Hof- und Justitienrat) aro und 1652, 1656 he became Privy Councillor (Geheimer Hof- und Kammerrat), and in 16 64 Chancellor of the newly founded University of Halle (Prussia). Cameralism b ecame a field to be taught at universities in the beginning of the 18th century. The first university with a chair in Cameralism was founded in Halle in 1723. Frankfurt a. O. followed in 1727. Before that time, Cameralism was embedded in the teachings of l aw. Later, notably after 1727, Cameralism developed into political economics. In the eighteenth century, refined cameralism achie ved its perfection in the writings of Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi and Joseph von So nnenfels (1732-1817). The focus in this chapter will be on the writings by von Just i who stated the principles of \"Polizeiwissenschaft\" (police science, public admin istration) in 1756 and wrote many textbooks thereafter. 21 As will be shown later, von Justi applied his gene ral system rather specifically to health economic issues. Von Justi was born (around) 1717 in Br\u00fccken (Prussi a). He went to law school and 19 Joachim Heinrich Peter. 1934. Die Probleme der Armut in den Lehren der Kameralisten .

In 1755, he went to G\u00f6ttingen as a Mining Council (\"Bergrat\") to tea ch economics and natural science. In 1762, Friedrich II of Prussia asked him to come to Berlin as the chief supervisor (Oberaufseher) of the fiscal mines of Prussia. When he was accused of sloppy bookkeeping and possibly embezzlement of money - a charge that has never been proved; the problems could have resulted from his b ad eyesight - he was imprisoned in the fortress of K\u00fcstrin, where he died in 1771. Von Sonnenfels, who also served the imperial Austri an court as advisor on questions of public administration and economic policy, occupied the chair of police and cameral sciences founded in 1763 at the Theresianum in Vienna. 23 In his textbook, \"Principles of Public Administration, Policy and Finance,\" ( Handlung und Finanz 1765, he dealt with matters of publ ic health such as care of the sick, poor relief, prevention of epidemics, regulat ion of medical practice, or methods of procuring abortions. The physician and Cameralist J ohann Peter Frank (1745-1821) was deeply influenced by his work. 24 Frank, a German physician, was appointed the director of the General Hospital at Vienna (1795-18 04), before he became the physician to Czar Alexander I. In 1808, he returned to Vienna. His \"System of a Complete Public Health Administration\" strongly inf luenced the development of medical practice in Austria and Russia. 25 Other Cameralists could be mentioned, but this intr oduction serves the purpose at hand, to show that economic ideas about health and public health policy have evolved in Cameralism. In what follows, we shall first take a look at their common idea, the view of people as the wealth of the state. 22 Lippert. 1900 (2). \"Justi, Johann 1419-1420. 23 Karl Pribram. 1923.

Frank's work needs to be relegated to a separate, more specialized study. 86 4.2 People, the Wealth of the State Major Population-based Measures Cameralists developed an entire range of economic-p olitical measures by designing institutions that could be influenced by the state, by law, or by the will of the princes who governed the German states. The initiative for designing such institutions could hence come from either the estates, or the various forms of state administrative bodies, or the chambers of the prince himself. The Camerali sts, i.e. the advisors in the chambers of the prince, derived their legitimacy from their university-based erudition coupled with their track record in administrative p ractice. To give an example: von Justi had a dual appointment as professor and councillor of mining affairs in Vienna. The measures Cameralists proposed with respect to p reserving and enhancing the health of the population were only a small set of a ll economic-political measures they advocated and directed towards improving and increa sing the population. The following are the major, population-based measures: 26 - Improvement of the health of the population; - Improvement of the knowledge of the population, f or instance of methods of production; - Strengthening of social norms; - Educating children; - In particular, children should be taught how to w ork in order to prepare them for the production process later on; - Weak persons should participate in the production process; - An increase in the number of children born; - Attracting new inhabitants to the country; - Incentives for the inhabitants of the country to stay there; - Humane penalties for criminal acts; 27 - Prevention of war; - In case of war, the negative effects of war had t o be minimized. Other economic policies, for instance agricultural policies to make food readily available or measures involving infrastructure, were also con nected to the population policies and had repercussive effects; they were expected to support population growth. Schmoller criticized the Cameralists' approach, mai nly for its neglect of individual 26 Louise Sommer discussed these measures under the h eading of \"Populationistik.\" Compare 1967 (2).

He does not refer to individual happiness as is common today. Instead, his notion of happiness of the state resembles a concept of socia l welfare. The happiness of the state or social welfare increases with the number o f healthy people living in the state. In turn, the number of people being ill, very old, or those living in extreme poverty reduces the social welfare. Not only good health contribute s to the happiness of the state; other essential elements are that people's basic needs ar e covered and that they can lead comfortable lives. 29 Justi devised social policies directed towards inc reasing the happiness of the state. It is here that we find the roots of modern state health policy. Justi developed basic principles of economic organi zation and applied them to the design of appropriate institutions. For instance, ( 1) he proposed measures of control in order to improve the quality of health care. Effect ive medical technology is a precondition for a modern health care system. 30 (2) In order to reduce the risk of starvation, he took measures to build up the wealth of the population in particular within the household. 31 (3) He tried to reduce the risk of death, for inst ance by discouraging Cameralistic princes from engaging in wars, in part icular during the winter period, and he proposed hygienic measures to prevent epidemics carrying a high mortality toll. A sufficiently low risk of death is necessary to make the efforts of improving health worthwhile. (4) He designed institutions so that pe ople could accumulate savings for personal hardships. At an early stage of the health care system, ample wealth was 28 Gustav Schmoller. 1923. Grundri\u00df der Allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre. First Part. (Blueprint, I).

Getzen, 1997, op. cit ., p. 322. 88 required to pay for medical treatment in advance. In Cameralism health is part of a state's human cap ital endowment. While Justi tried to indicate ways and means to prevent the starvation o f people, he went beyond. He wanted to see an increase and improvement of the po pulation. Several measures served this goal, among them cultivation of the lan d, industrialization, trade policy and population policies such as an active immigration p olicy, discouraging emigration, and light sentences for criminal behavior. Justi's idea s for improving the health of the population are still worth considering. They are in particular useful in developing countries where a modern health care system cannot be realized, because the preconditions for its development are not met or on ly partially fulfilled. How to Prevent Starvation Starvation caused by a lack of food supply endanger ed the health of the population. As a remedy, Justi encouraged cultivation of the land by farming. He noted that farmers need to own their land, because otherwise they woul d not be motivated strongly enough to undertake the hard work of cultivation an d improvement of fertility of the land. It will certainly lead to a better cultivation of the ground and to the beginning of agriculture, if the farmers are owners of the farms and do not live there as villains or as bailiffs or tenants of the farm. If the farmers are not owners themselves then they lack the most effective incent ive, which people require being busy, hard working, and which makes them unde rtake difficult and valuable improvements. The fact is that they have t o be convinced that their work is to their own benefit and to that of their c hildren. 32 An incentive for cultivation would result from the proper tax policy and the threat that 32 Es gereichet unstreitig zu besserer und Finanzwes ens . (A Collection of Political and Financial Writings on Important Subje cts of the Art of Policy, of the Science of War, and on the Cameral and Financial Sy stem). Koppenhagen und Dir ect Those Responsible for Nourishment, i. e . Agriculture, by Duties and Burdens). 89 the state could take ownership away, if the land re mains uncultivated. It is common in various countries to allow a relie f of duties or even release the burdens entirely if pieces of land are used less th an before or even if they lay bare. I consider this a rule, which is not at all i n agreement with the welfare of the state. Every single piece of land which is used less due to the negligence of its owner, and which might even remain uncultivated , should immediately be burdened with higher duties in order to force its o wner to either better cultivate that piece of land or to give up ownership. The tru e wealth of the state rests only on those goods, which are produced and gained withi n the country. Thus, he who leaves his land fallow reduces the wealth of th e state. Therefore, if the increased burden does not have an effect, the gover nment does indeed have the right to force the person legally to cultivate the land he owns, or to take away ownership of that particular piece of land. 33 Justi proposed the introduction of a burden or duty as an incentive to induce a change in behavior: In the same way as one can discourage people from using their fields in a way, which is to the disadvantage of the common best one can stimulate them to produce those fruits on their land which are useful in developing commerce and a manufacturing industry. If one wants to stimulate the farmers to plant mulberry trees, saffron, dyer's-madder, dyer's woad, and suc h, then one should allow a field yielding that produce to remain entirely or p artly free of duties. Then, there will be people who want to take advantage of this b enefit. In a similar way, these duties are also very effec tive incentives, if one wants to stimulate the production of a certain kind of lives tock; or, vice versa, if one want to discourage this production with regard to the le vel of food supply and the common best. In the first case, one has to release all burdens, in the other case 33 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Es is 618: XII. 90 one has to impose heavy duties on raising this part icular kind of livestock. In both cases, the final goal will not be missed. 34 Justi showed that the state could motivate people t o act in the interest of the common best by using duties and burdens as incentives. He wanted farmers to produce enough food to prevent starvation, but also thought of the possibility of overproduction of specific agricultural products, which had to be pre vented. How to Abolish Begging Justi distinguished between different kinds of begg ars. He held that that there is no reason to beg for a healthy person who can work, an d who is therefore able to achieve the subsistence level. For those beggars who are he althy Justi proposed to establish workhouses. The state should only care for those pe ople too sick to work or too old. As \"a sure means to entirely abolish begging in the co untry,\" Justi suggested to take the following measures: My proposal is therefore to establish enough workh ouses in a country. The principal of the state has to make it public and we ll known to everyone. After that, all those who continue begging, will immediat ely be forced to work in the workhouse. They will be put under strong supervisio n. All those who continue begging will be imprisoned without further investig ation. Every day, they will have to do a certain amount of work. If necessary, they will be forced to work. In return for their work, they will be fed and given s helter. 34 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Wenn man des Nahrungsstandes und Besten Abgaben.\" 91 Every healthy person can perform various kinds of work. Everyone can work so much as to earn his subsistence level. Therefore, t he principal of the state will have no other costs but those of establishing the i nstitution in the first place; and he could even get considerable revenues from it. In order to offer the required employment possibilities, a sufficient number of fa ctories and manufactures would have to be established in the state. Accordin g to age and sex, every person [in the workhouse] would have to perform lab or for those factories and manufactures. It is indeed not necessary to keep th e people on bread and water and to mistreat them with daily beatings, with the exception of those who do not want to follow their daily work routine. One could give everyone several pounds of bread per day, as well as a vegetable at noon an d a soup in the evening and in addition to it a thin beer. It would still be to the advantage of the principal of the state. Even the older and indigent people could weave twenty threescore of linen per day or spin woollen threat. Without undul y diligence, this will cover their cost of living and is apart from the gain that resu lts to the principal of the state from operating these manufactures. The very old and indigent people, as well as those who are too fragile to work, have to be admitted to special poorhouses and have to be cared for as described above; and one can be sure, these will on ly be very few people as compared to all other beggars. The children of the people in the workhouses should be admitted to children's homes and be cared for in the same way. The children would have to stay in children's homes unt il the boys reach the age required to learn a certain trade or to perform a m anual task, and the girls become maids. This has the advantage that these chi ldren develop a proper work attitude and get used to honestly earning a li ving, instead of becoming beggars themselves. The poor- and children's homes could be supported from the surplus that is gained from the workhouses. To the principal of the state, a sizeable income would remain. 35 35 The original German quote reads as nd Brod arbeiten, und mit 92 The Human Toll of Winter Campaigns Justi held that soldiers should not be forced to fi ght during wintertime. War is harder on people during wintertime and more people will die, some of them later if they return home weakened. It is also likely that war, which st arted in wintertime, will continue during the summer. This will worsen the misery caus ed by war. Justi gave the following advice: Soldiers should not be sent to any mission if the time of year is adverse, or in disregard of nature. It is still very doubtful whether the winter campa igns that started to become common in the middle of Europe around 1740 are to b e received with approval or disapproval. Yet one can dig up some reasons as arguments in support of those campaigns. Sometimes, when met by surprise, the enemy can be overwhelmed in a winter campaign at once. This saves a lot of misery, unhap piness and bloodshed that tends to accompany a protracted war campaign. While the heat of the summer t\u00e4glichen Schl\u00e4gen gemi\u00dfhandelt das Betteln im Lande g\u00e4nzlich abzuschaffen.\" 93 also causes an uncomfortable situation to the soldi ers in many ways, often causing illness and death of soldiers, this source of distress is relieved by a winter campaign. For this reason, winter campaigns are frequently held in Portugal and Spain, and sometimes in Italy, and dur ing the heat of the summer, soldiers are moved to their refreshment quarters. These reasons can be refuted by the argument that a winter campaign can only lead to an advantage over the enemy when it is enti rely unexpected. However, if winter campaigns become customary, then the enemy w ill be ready for defense. Then, a lengthy battle cannot be prevented by a sur prise attack. It is further a fact that winter campaigns go along with much more trouble than regular attacks in the summer. We do not know for sure whether wint er campaigns cause more illnesses than campaigns in the summer. There is ev idence from Saxony, France, and Bavaria that shows that soldiers who pa rticipated in the first winter campaigns against Bohemia often died upon their ret urn. For many other reasons winter campaigns have to be rejected. In fact, as war during the winter is continued during the summer, t he misery of war so damaging to mankind is even doubled. Nature itself advises against war during the winter. 36 36 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Da\u00df m an die Soldaten zu h\u00e4ufig dahin gestorben. 94 Justi opposed war, but war in the winter even more so as it caused more misery for mankind. He not only took those soldiers into consi deration who died during the war, but also those soldiers who died from exhaustion af ter they returned home. Health Measures Against the Depopulation of a Coun try In his Grundfeste (Basic Pillars), Justi proposed the furthering of happiness of the population as the major aim of state policy, and by implication state power. 37 Such a policy implies increasing the number and the durati on of the useful lives of the population. Justi complained about the fact that in fectious diseases often hit states with the highest population and not seldom cut the popul ation in half. Evidence that he wanted to maximize the health of the population can be found in the measures he suggested against the depopulation of a country. Justi advised the creation of a healthy environment . He wrote that in North America \"the main reason of depopulation is without doubt a natural unhealthy condition of the country .... too much moisture in the air and rotte n evaporations ... the main reason are the many woods, lakes and morasses. Despite the fac t that this is a natural cause, it can nevertheless be removed.\" 38 Justi identified an unhealthy environment as a sou so ens .

In the original : Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Heinrich quote reads as follows: \"Die h aupts\u00e4chliche Ursache der 95 of illness and he realized that illness could also be caused by a lack of social hygiene and carelessness during food preparation. Consequen tly, he did give guidelines for developing institutions of social hygiene and he di scussed safety standards for the handling and preparation of food. 39 Deficiencies in availability and quality of health care provision were important causes of high mortality due to diseases, which could even le ad to depopulation. Justi wrote \"... that there are either not enough health institution s to fight pest and other epidemic illnesses or that physicians and other persons who are needed to maintain life and health of people lack the knowledge required for th eir task.\" 40 Justi proposed to control plague and other contagio us diseases by measures of blockade and quarantine on the borders of the count ry. He also recommended the institution of a Health Policy Council in order to gather data on mortality, morbidity, a nd epidemics and to devise an appropriate health polic y on that basis. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was not uncommon that plague would cut the population of a state in half. Justi suggested state intervention in the control and prevention of such contagious diseases (see paragraph 293). He advised to discontinue all contact and trade with people from countries, where the disease has occurred. The borders of the state should be protected in order to enforce this measure. If it was doubtful whether someone had been in contact with a disease, then th is person should be put in quarantine at an isolated location for forty days. The protection should include goods and mail, which should either not be delivered at a ll, or, if possible, be treated with smoke, etc. If the people of a city or larger regio n were infected, then soldiers should be ordered to isolate the entire area.

On Medical Institutions), pp. 249-256. 40 The original German quote reads as follows: Ursachen die und . Paragraph 292. 96 Justi also proposed to set up a Health Policy Council that would gather death statistics and data on illness and, based on this information would have the task to devise an appropriate health policy. In order to take effective measures against the pl ague and other contagious diseases in each state a Health Policy Council has to be formed. It will consist of experienced civil servants on the one hand and well -known medical doctors on the other, each forming half of the body. 41 The board would have to be notified of diseases and the causes of death, there being a requirement of notification and of providing death rolls. The board's tasks include the observation of neighboring countries and immediatel y taking action to prevent pest or other contagious diseases from spreading across the border. The board should also observe whether there are epidemic or other widespr ead illnesses in a region and provide medical information to local physicians or send a physician to that area. The Health Policy Council has to evaluate the death rolls, to determine the causes of epidemic diseases, and it has to bring out advice o n the best health policy and medicine used in order to prevent an epidemic. In g eneral, the Health Policy Council has to undertake broad measures to advance the stat e of health of the population and to prevent unhealthy conditions and illness. In addition to the Health Policy Council , Justi proposed to establish a Medical Board to assure that there is an adequate supply of physicia ns in a country. A second task would be to enforce quality standards of health car e provision. To ensure that there will be a sufficient number o f skilled physicians in a country should best be the task of a Medical Board (Collegi um Medicum). One-half of it could consist of high civil servants from the depar tments of the Interior and Justice and the other half of the most learned and well-known physicians. The Medical Board can be united with the Health Policy Council in such a way that they form two different departments of the latter. The Medical Board does not only have to test skill and scholarship of the new physicians, independent of the degrees and honors they have received at Universiti es ... The Medical Board also has to decide about complaints of malpractice of physicians and surgeons, midwifes and other health care providers. 42 41 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Um nu n wieder cit . Paragraph 294. 42 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Diese Vorsorge [da\u00df dem Collegium 97 Justi argued that quality control in medicine is re quired, because professionals in medicine would better be able to hide malpractice t han scholars of theology or scholars of jurisprudence. The argument that there is no med icine to prevent death could be misused to cover up serious professional mistakes. From medical malpractice, both the state and the population would suffer. It is diffic ult to control physicians, therefore a self- selection takes place in which the lesser able stud ents turn to the field of medicine. In order to prevent a negative self-selection, Justi s uggested to require a quality control of physicians seeking admission. The Medical Board should turn down all those who show insufficient or even average knowledge. An important part of the tasks of the Medical Board would be the control of quacks. It has to prevent treatment and medicine prescribed by unqualified persons being detrimental to the population. In order to prevent that the poor who cannot afford to visit a regular physician, would be forced to go to an un qualified health care provider, special physicians should be appointed who treat th e poor for free. Every sizeable city and region should appoint a physician for the poor, who would also provide medicine for free. An additional point of observation is hos pitals. They should be kept under close supervision and must be clean; otherwise, peo ple might die instead of recover. Justi considered carelessness of hospital employees as a crime because it could lead to the death of a patient. He also suggested that y oung physicians should gain at least one year of experience in a hospital or other insti tution before they get admitted as physicians. 43 Justi suggested that the highest body of a country' s police should stimulate the study of medicine. It should not only see to it that all hea lth-related sciences at the university prosper, but also that new discoveries would be mad e. By introducing a \"Collegio medico,\" data of the effects of medicine and of ill ness could be discussed by a group of physicians and thus new insights could be gained, i f only, one could prevent physicians from quarrelling among each other. 44 Justi proposed training and approbation of surgeons and midwifes. For ist ...\" Justi v., 1760, op. cit ., Paragraph 295. 43 \"Aufmerksamkeit auf die Pfuscher und Bestellung de r Armen-\u00c4rzte.\" as midwifes, professional boards, Collegio chirurgico , should be introduced. No one should be admitted to practice as a surgeon or midwife who has not been tested before the board and proven that he or she has the skills needed. 45 In a similar way, apothecaries and druggists, who p rovide ingredients for the preparation of medicine, should be controlled by te sting, visitations, and training. 46 For other causes that could endanger health, Justi sugg ested to take a look at the architecture of the cities, canalization, and hygie ne of cities. In particular, he suggested the control of foodstuffs. 47 Persons should be discouraged from committing suici de. Therefore, the attitude in a society should change, in particular, if suicide is regarded highly as a measure that proves courage. According to Justi, society should attribute a negative value to the commitment of suicide in order to discourage people from committing suicide. 48 Public Health Tradition in Cameralism Justi distinguished between the art of politics ( Staatskunst ) and the science of policy and public administration ( Policeywissenschaft .) The task of the former is to maintain the inner and outer security of the state. The latt er is the science of how to maintain and increase the wealth of the state, which consist s of different components including health of the population. Growth and improvement of the population increase the wealth of the state. In contrast to the art of politics, it is the task of policy and public administration to maintain and increase the entire wealth of the stat e by a good inner constitution. To realize this goal, civil servants should confer as much inner power and strength to the republic as is possible. For that p urpose, their efforts are directed towards cultivating the soil, towards improving the basis of living, and towards maintaining discipline and order in the commonwealt h; 49 45 \"Unterricht und Pr\u00fcfung der .\" Justi Umst\u00e4nde.\" J v., \"Von dem Selbstmord.\" (On suicide). Justi v., 1760 , op. cit ., Paragraph 301. 49 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Dahin gegen Grunds\u00e4tze der 99 Justi compared the science of policy and public adm inistration to the science of Cameralism: Policy and public administration are at the basis of true Cameralism; and the civil servant has to prepare the ground in order to enable the Cameralist to harvest without damaging the commonwealth. Yet, bot h sciences have their clear and undisputed limits. Policy and public admi nistration tries to maintain and increase the entire wealth of the state accordi ng to its inner constitution; and the Cameralist tries to withdraw from this total we alth of the state the capital that is required to cover the large expenditures necessa ry for governing the states, without causing harm to the former. 50 In delineating the tasks of policy and public admin istration, Justi built on Christian Freiherr von Wolff. 51 Justi has to be credited for the development of th e concept of policy and public administration, which included sy stematic state measures to improve the health of the population. He proposed measures of sanitation and hygiene and a board to control the quality of health care. His pr oposals influenced practical health policy. In 1725, King Frederic Wilhelm I. enacted a public health law and appointed academic and practical physicians to a public healt h board in order to enforce the law. As a Cameralist, Justi was important in founding th e public health tradition on the Continent. We also find contributions by other Came ralists who focussed on public health. 52 Notably with the physician and Cameralist Johann P eter Frank (1745-1821) this tradition reached its top. While there are ind ividual differences among Cameralists they have in common that they see health as an impo rtant factor for the development of the economy. They devised public health policies in order to enhance the health of Policeywissenschaft. (Principles of Police Science). Frankfurt a. M.: S auer & Auvermann KG.

We value being healthy both for its own sake and for its contribution to the production of other goods. 54 Empirical evidence shows that improved health conditions can influence the work c apacity of people, for instance of older citizens, thus allowing increasing the legal retirement age of 65. 55 Cost-effectiveness evaluations typically link medic al measures to health effects, which are defined as \"the sum of the years of life added by the intervention; and the improvements in health during years that would have been lived anyway, minus any deterioration in health because of side effects of the intervention.\" 56 Additional data are needed to link health effects to work capability. While better health is an important route to improv ed work capability, not all benefits of better health can be so translated. Woodbury and Ma nton researched the link between health effects and work capability of older people.57 They applied factor analysis to the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey and identified five major patterns of disability. The survey included 6,400 chronically disabled peop le who were older than sixty-five and did not live in institutions. It provided infor mation on how well they could perform \"activities of daily living (ADL's).\" 58 \"The first three groups, and certainly the first, should be capable of performing some kind of work. For the second and third groups, the work would need to be tailored to their physical limitat ions. The fourth and fifth groups would not be capable of working.\" (Russell, op. cit ., pp. 23). Using regression analysis, Woodbury and Manton linked the five patterns of dis ability to the twelve major diseases he had identified. They showed that the healthy gro up of sixty-seven-year-olds could 53 Mushkin, S. J. 1962. \"Health as an Investment.\" Journal of Political Economy . Vol. 70. Supplement, pp. 129. 54 Victor R.

Russell, op. cit ., p. 22. 101 be increased from 31 percent to 48 percent of the t otal, if all twelve diseases could be eliminated. The greatest impact would come from eli minating hip fractures, strokes, and senility. Evidence from international epidemiological studies shows that working capability is influenced by smoking. Smokers are more prone to il lness and face a higher death risk than non-smokers. With the exception of older women , smokers take more sick days than non-smokers. Interventions directed at prevent ing people from starting to smoke, such as school programs, might have the greatest lo ng-run effect on working capability. (Russell, op. cit ., p. 37). Interventions that are directed at helpi ng people to quit smoking increase working capability in the short ru n. Despite the wealth of data in this area, many doubts remain. For instance, the relatio nship between smoking and morbidity is not as well documented as the relation ship between smoking and mortality. A forecast of future smoking behavior and the natur e of future cigarettes would even increase the uncertainty concerning the data. Sports increases working capability, for example by reducing fatigue, anxiety, and depression. (Russell, op. cit ., p. 43). Several studies of aerobic exercise dire cted at strengthening lungs and heart have suggested positi ve effects for most people from active participation in sports. Exercise can keep t he elderly healthier. Incorporating easy activities into people's lives is a practical intervention; and more attention should be given to integrate exercise into daily lives. A study showed that schoolchildren, who followed a program that worked exercise into their daily lives, continued the exercise after a year, whereas other children who had follow ed a regular exercise program had given it up. (Russell, op. cit ., p. 45). Exercise differs from other forms of pre ventive medicine in two respects; it takes time, which is a cost to most people, and it is a pleasure, leading to a benefit. Several specific co st-effectiveness analyses are required to evaluate the health effects of different forms o f exercise. The working ability of people is likely to be reduc ed by osteoporosis, a widespread condition that leads to fractures, primarily of the wrist, hip, and spinal vertebrae. (Russell, op. cit ., p. 54). Its consequences are severe; people who survive the fractures are likely to lose their independence. Women are at higher risk than men are. The number of fractures could be cut by interventions s uch as calcium supplementation, oestrogen-therapy, weight-bearing exercises, etc., but the effect of fractures on people's ability to function is not well documented . Cost-effectiveness studies of alcoholism are consid ered controversial because of insufficient evidence. The database is insufficient for drawing conclusions about the impact of drinking on capability to work. It is sti ll considered beneficial to cure alcoholism, because the use of medical services dec lined after alcoholics quit drinking. (Russell, op. cit ., p. 58). Alcohol use takes different forms; there fore, the types of interventions vary. Excessive alcoholism has advers e health effects, such as delirium tremens and cirrhosis of the liver. Alcoholism is a major cause of accidents and has negative social effects. Excessive drinking impairs the capacity to work. Drinkers have shorter lives and require more hospitalization than non-drinkers require. It is difficult to connect health problems causally to the misuse of a lcohol, because alcoholics behave 102 differently from non-alcoholics. Today, common inte rventions include high prices for alcohol or consumption restrictions. Most treatment s are for excessive alcohol use once it has occurred. Chances of treatment are best for people who want to be cured, who have stable jobs and marriages, and who come fr om an upper socioeconomic background. Most people cure themselves without hel p. Those who quit are healthier and use fewer medical services, so there are reason s to continue fighting alcoholism. A possible intervention is education and social press ure to discourage people from drinking in inappropriate situations such as drivin g and on the job. Obesity is a condition where the distribution of ex cess body fat matters. It is usually associated with diabetes, hypertension, gallbladder disease, and a higher risk of death. Cost-effectiveness studies can be performed for sur gery, appetite depressants, and high carbohydrate, low fat diets, which are some of the remedies for obesity. The extremely obese often show great improvements after surgery, but the effects on work capability have not been studied in much detail. (R ussell, op. cit ., p. 63). This brief illustration of a few examples of cost-e ffectiveness studies and the effect of an intervention on working capability serves the pu rpose at hand to show that health care expenditures can increase the working capabili ty in specific areas and in the long run, and make it even likely to increase the retire ment age. Therefore, in a public household, those health care expenditures, which en hance the ability to produce and consume, should be entered as a figure of investmen t that have possible future benefits. 4.5 Summary and Conclusions In Cameralism, people are viewed as a major part of the wealth of a country and their advice to the princes of the under populated German states was to carry out population policies to improve and increase the population. Ca meralists recommended measures to improve the health of the population and the lev el of education, they suggested incentives to attract immigrants and resources from other countries, and they discouraged feudal princes from making war. In this paper it has been shown that the Cameralists were not only concerned with the treasu ry, but also with the police functions. The task of the science of policy and pu blic administration is to study the ways and means to increase the wealth of the state. Measures to improve health are primarily seen as an investment component that lead s to higher economic growth. Public health policy goes beyond a narrow concern w ith health. For instance, the soil has to be improved by agriculture in order to creat e a broad basis of nutrition. It was mainly Justi, who was concerned with the quality of health care provided. He suggested controls to prevent infectious diseases f rom entering a country, measures of hygiene in the cities, controls of foodstuff, and h e proposed the introduction of a Health Policy Council and various medical boards to supervise quality of health care. The view that health care expenditures and preventi ve health care are an investment that contributes to economic growth is still releva nt today. It is a warning against taking 103 measures that focus on a reduction of costs and neg lect the quality of health care provided. Better health improves the capacity to fu nction and the benefits from this should not be overlooked in public households.

A nation is characterized by its law, the state, and the economy, but also by religi on, language, art, and science. Roscher concentrated on the first three factors of influence in order to explain the political economy of a nation. 2 In line with Aristotle, he saw the family unit as the beginning of any nation's economy, and not the indi vidual. In his work, we find important tenets for health economics. Roscher prop osed the institution of social welfare services as well as public regulation to pr otect vulnerable groups in society, such as wage laborers, women, and children. He was a fervent advocate of the introduction of factory inspectors. In the Kingdom of Saxony, he was politically active in the implementation of his policy proposals. From to day's point of view, his contribution lies in building institutions for health care servi ces and in his reflections on what could be called, parallel to constitutional public financ e, constitutional health economics. Although he is not generally remembered as a health economist, Wilhelm Roscher emphasized health issues in both, theory and policy . This emphasis he took from the Cameralists. Roscher believed that theory could not be treated separately from practice. 3 In his economics lectures to law students at the U niversity of Leipzig he propagated the introduction of social welfare servi ces and public regulation in factories in order to protect workers and children. He was al so politically active in the Kingdom of Saxony to achieve this goal. In 46 years he taught generations of students, and became considered the forerunner of American instit utionalism. 4 1 Roscher is the founder of the older German Histori cal School, but the distinction between older and newer Historical School has been criticized as superficial. It served essentially strategic purposes. Menger intro duced the term \"Older Historical School\" in order to be able to associate Roscher's work with it. Both, Roscher and Schmoller, worked empirically, but Meng er wanted to base his own work on that of the \"Older Historical School,\" and he opposed the work of Schmoller who according to Menger belonged to the \" Younger Historical School.\" J\u00fcrgen Backhaus and Reginald Hansen. 2000. \"Methodenstreit in der National\u00f6konomie.\" (Methodenstreit in Economics).

Senn. 1995. \"Why had Roscher so much influence in the USA compared with the UK?\" 109 From 1835 to 1839, Roscher studied in G\u00f6ttingen and Berlin. 5 He wrote a doctoral thesis in 1838 in the philosophical faculty of the University of G\u00f6ttingen, and, in 1840, he wrote at the same University his habilitation th esis in history and state sciences. In 1843, he became extraordinary, and in 1844 ordinary professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1848, he was called to a chair at Lei pzig. Roscher was a member in professional associations and received several hono rary doctorates and memberships in honorary academic societies. His magnum opus was the System der Volkswirtschaft (The System of Political Economy) in five volumes (1854-94). The volumes dea l with the historical treatment of the science of political economy (volume 1), agricu lture and forestry (2), trade and commerce (3), public finance (4), and charities (5) . In 1874, Roscher's Geschichte der National\u00f6konomik in Deutschland (History of Political Economy in Germany) was published, and in 1851-52 Zur Geschichte der englischen Volkswirtschaftslehre (Towards a History of English Economics). He also w rote the standard work on comparative political constitutionalism, Vergleichende Rechtslehre . These main works are supplemented by many other writings. 6 In this chapter, we shall focus on his writings on health related issues. Roscher, the influential economist who was well kno wn inside and outside of Germany, is generally remembered as the founder of the histo ric method in political economics. His approach was descriptive and eclectic in the se nse that he used every conceivable bit of empirical information that he could get. He used the existing theories, but did not add an own specific contribution to theory. His con tribution lies in the historic method, which he introduced to economics. Krabbe has evalua ted Roscher's approach as follows: On the one hand, in presenting subjects like value , production and income, from classical theory, Roscher used the classical deduct ive approach which had originated with the Enlightenment. On the other han d, in dealing with the history of society and the development of institutions, Ros cher adopted Herder's organistic and, to a lesser degree, idealistic idea s which had originated with Hegel. It should be remembered ... that half-way th rough the nineteenth century, eclecticism had become a significant cultural pheno menon. Thus, on this point Roscher's thought bears the hallmark of his time. 7 Wilhelm Roscher and the \"Historical Method.\" Journa l of Economic Studies . Vol. 22, pp. 53-105, p. 64. 5 The biographical information is mainly based on th e following entry: \"Roscher, Wilhelm Georg Fischer, pp. 463-465. 6 For his other writings also compare the entry on R oscher in the Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Staatswissenschaften, op. cit. , Economic Studie s. Vol. 22, pp. 159-170, p. 162. 110 Kenessey saw eclecticism in Roscher's work, but rel ated it to the theory of economic stages. He distinguished the following three attrib utes in Roscher's writings: At any rate, when honoring Roscher's work the very first attribute (at least from the viewpoint of a statistician) is his wide relian ce on data, facts, and information. His utilization of classical thought p atterns to analyze such materials is another one. His emphasis on freedom and individ ualism appears to be a significant third attribute, and this connected him well to scholars outside Germany (especially in England and America). 8 The Christian faith was important to Roscher. His s cientific work is based on a Christian-moral concept. He \"takes the human being as a starting point and goal of economic science.\" 9 The human being, be it a teacher or a scholar, is responsible for all his scholarly life and otherwise before his god . Hence, the different spheres cannot be neatly separated. Roscher, who was not only a su ccessful teacher (primarily of future civil servants in the modern Kingdom of Saxo ny), but also active in municipal politics, aspects of policy making in the kingdom, aspects of social welfare legislation, and involved in numerous appointment decisions, was intimately aware of the impossibility of drawing sharp lines between belief and science. 10 He made the difference clear between his scientific work and hi s religious values in his last, posthumously published book, Geistliche Gedanken eines National-Oekonomen (Religious Thoughts of an Economist). 11 This book, which is mainly based on his former publications, focuses on the religious aspec ts of his work. He wanted to keep his political and religious thoughts to himself, wh ile at the same time trying to get them straight. One should think of this text as a diary, as a confidant. Although Roscher was well acquainted with the theor y of the English classical school, 12 8 Zoltan Kenessey. 1994. \"Economic Stages: Roscher, the Historical School, and Others.\" A Note.

Vol. 22, pp. 106-126, p. 110. 10 Schmoller was particularly concerned with this iss ue and devoted regular seminars and his inaugural lecture as the Rector Ma gnificus of the University of Berlin to this subject. Compare his inaugural lectu re, printed by Julius Becker, 1897. Wechselnde de utsche Volkswirtschaftslehre. (Changing Theories). 11 1896, Dresden: v. Zahn & Jaensch. 12 According to Schumpeter, Roscher was \"a very merit orious follower of the English `classics.'\" Joseph A. Schumpeter. 1954. History of Economic Analysis. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 508. 111 he had some reservations with respect to the doctri ne of laissez-faire, which had gained considerable support among the German indust rial community, some politicians, and even in universities. Kenessey has explained Roscher's reservations towards the English classical school in the context of stages of economic growth. There are certain intriguing and broad questions a bout the interest of Friedrich List, Wilhelm Roscher, and other 19th century Germa n economists (including Marx) in the stages of economic growth, as we call it today. The economic development level of Germany, as compared with Engl and, was an important impetus to German thinking about these matters at t he time. The stance to take in respect of free trade (and the protection of dom estic industries from foreign - principally British - competition) was a related on e. However, one should assume, theoretical problems played a role as well and thinking about growth in the economy was motivated, therefore, by inner deve lopments in economics as well. It is believed that List certainly, but possi bly Roscher as well recognized this conceptual need, as categories of classical ec onomic thought, which were first developed for the Britisch economy needed to be applied in countries which were at a less developed stage at the time. (Keness ey, op. cit. , p.5). Roscher was influenced by Friedrich List who held t hat an industry \"... must be protected before it can be established. Adam Smith' s principles of political economy, therefore, were not of universal applicability, but were relative to time and place.\" 13 Balabkins continued that some \"German historical ec onomists or economic historians, such as Wilhelm Roscher, Bruno Hildebrand and Karl Knies, not only rejected the claim of universal validity and applicability of classica l economics, but insisted that it was grossly inadequate to deal with industrialization a nd its social consequences, not to speak of its irrelevance, for Germany.\" (Balabkins, op. cit. , p. 25). Balabkins' judgment is different from that of Schumpeter, but the contr ary positions can be reconciliated, if we keep in mind that Schumpeter wanted to contribut e to economic analysis, while Balabkins wrote his book Not by Theory alone ... with respect to social policy. Therefore, it is understandable that both authors a rrive at different judgments of Roscher's work. There is hardly an aspect not treated by Roscher. H is arguments lie at different levels, though. Some of Roscher's remarks on health and hea lth economics clearly refer to constitutional health policy. Economic theory disti nguishes between process and structural theory. Buchanan asked in The Limits of Liberty under which structures process and structural theory would be applied. 14 One distinguishes between three political levels, the executive, legislative, and c onstitutional level. Accordingly, there are three types of health policy, executive, legislativ e, and constitutional health policy. In what follows, we will first look at health issue s that Roscher emphasized in theory, 13 Nicolas Balabkins. 1988. Not by Theory alone... The Economics of Gustav von Schmoller and Its Legacy to America. Berlin: Duncker & Humblot, p. 25. 14 James Buchanan. 1993. 5 The Limits of Liberty: between Anarchy and Leviathan. MacGill: The University of Chicago Press. 112 and then point towards practical policy measures, w hich he derived in the Cameralist tradition. 5.2 Health Related Aspects in Roscher's Thought The Historic Method There has indeed been doubt as to what Roscher's me thod and approach consist in. His work is very large, he systematized existing th eories, but it is difficult to find his own theory. His own contribution has been looked for in the method, which he developed early on in his dissertation on the older Sophists.15 While Roscher disagreed with the Sophists in discus sing their approach, he developed his own visions for the historical understanding of society. This discussion formed the basis for what became Roscher's main interest later , an analysis of different forms of state, as well as different functions of state (ind ustrial policy, safety regulations, and other policies). Roscher was interested in the orig in and development of the modern state. He wrote the standard work on comparative po litical constitutionalism, Vergleichende Rechtslehre describing major constitutional types. Roscher pos tulated an Aristotelian state that had to struggle against special interests of families, estates, corporations, communities, provinces, etc. In line with Aristotle, he held that any nation's economy begins with the family, not the in dividual, as the basic unit. In order to be functional, the Aristotelian state had to be reconstructed. Roscher believed that eventually democracy would degenerate and a proleta rian class would form. 16 An example of a degenerating state is the Platonian state, where those being in power did not follow the law, and where state censorship was strong in all areas of life. Roscher described some of Platon's examples who, am ong other examples, used the following medical analogy in order to illustrate hi s state. According to Platon, one should not strive for the happiness of the single p erson, but for the happiness of the entire state. This would be similar to the human bo dy, where health of the entire body is asked for, not just of a single limb. Platon often said that the head of state stands above the law and above the will and wishes of a po pulation. He compared this to the 15 Leonhard Bauer, Hermann Rauchenschwandtner, Cornel ius Zehetner. 2002. Edited, translated, and commented version. Wilhelm Roscher. \u00dcber die Spuren der (1 838). (Wilhelm Roscher. On the Traces of the Historic Method in the Works of t he Older Sophists (1838)). Marburg: Metropolis, pp. 43, 44. Moving from what h e perceived as the less important to the more important, Roscher first disc ussed Kallikles' lesson of the right of the stronger, second, the lectures by Thas ymachos and others, who elaborated on Potagoras' dictum that man is the mea sure of all things, and finally, he discussed the \"uninterrupted flow of th ings.\" (1838, p. 50). 16 For an overview of Roscher's constitutional types of state from antiquity to modernity see Giouras, 1995, op. cit. , pp. 115. 113 helmsman of a ship who cannot ask for the seamen's opinions when deciding on the course of the ship; or to a physician who has to ig nore the wishes of a patient when deciding on the treatment in order to restore healt h. 17 These examples illustrate that individual freedom was not valued highly in a Plato nian state. In general, Roscher considered a rise in freedom as an indication for t he cultural rise of a population. The Organic Construction of Society Roscher accepted Adam Smith as a forerunner of the historic method and tried to continue his tradition of moral philosophy, but unl ike Smith, who based his views on The Theory of Moral Sentiments ,18 Roscher relied on Christian faith. In line with Sm ith, he asserted that immoral actions have negative econ omic results. From this assertion follows the definition of \"true\" needs. ... the acting person has to transform his needs i nto \"true\" needs, which means to make them compatible with the needs of other ind ividuals. Roscher underlines the argument of Adam Smith, that the con sideration of the needs of others belongs to the reflective process of our own needs, when he says that the surest way to satisfy our needs through circula tion is to help others satisfy their own (1897, para. 11)[...]. It is worth noting , that a similar argument, relating to the negative economic results of the immoral act ion, was also to be used in the years to come by Schmoller. (Giouras, 1995, op. cit. , p. 111). On the basis of this metaphysical foundation, Rosch er developed his concept of an organic society. 19 He constructed ... the main propensities of economic action in a deductive way, through a supposed dualism of human nature, and not, as one w ould expect from an historical method, through a derivation from histor ical concepts. According to this dualistic conception every economy is based on the mental propensities of self-interest, which can degenerate into egoism, an d of moral conscience (Gewissen ), whereas this last propensity is the \"demand of t he divine voice within us\" (1897, para. 11). Through a combination of these two propensities the public spirit ( Gemeinsinn ) is born, which is looked on as the connection bet ween the members of society and which unites \"the great apparent contradictions\" (1897, para. 11) like a bridge. Apart from these qu alities the public spirit leads to a \"higher, beautifully limbed (1897, para . 12). Wilhelm Roscher. 2002. \u00dcber die ren (1838).

Indianapolis: Libery Pre ss. 19 Roscher's concept of the \"organic society\" served as a basis for Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian School. Compare J. Krab be, op. cit. , p. 159. 114 In line with earlier philosophical conceptions such as that of Herder, Roscher perceived of the national society as an organism in which har mony would prevail. Hereby he maintained that each nation has a unique constructi on characterized by its law, the state, the economy, religion, language, art, and sc ience. Roscher concentrated on the first three factors of influence in order to explai n the political economy of a nation. It was the task of the economist to describe the parti cular institutions of each nation and empirical regularities that are based on statistics in order to explain the causes of economic development and to show how to further soc ial welfare of a nation. In explaining economic development, Roscher has identi fied the simultaneity and the mutuality of events as an important aspect. This, h owever, poses the problem of determining cause and effect, which Roscher tried t o solve by positing an \"organic life\" as the first cause that would include the underlyin g religious belief. 20 Organic harmony requires that there is a harmonic r elation between the three income classes, land rent, labor wage, and capital interes t. A factor that could disturb harmony was labor, because the person who is selling labor becomes dependent of others. Roscher has demanded a just income distribution and higher wages for the workers in order to prevent a social uprising. In a Christian way, he wanted \"love\" to be the principle that governs social policy and that has t o be extended towards the weaker members of society. Here, we find a major differenc e to Schmoller, who based social policy on the analysis of social institutions, inst ead of religion. (Giouras, 1995, op. cit. , p. 112). Limits of the Division of Labor Roscher followed Adam Smith in the proposal of divi sion of labor. He predicted that productivity of a nation would rise due to the divi sion of labor. With an increase of cultural development, a nation would need politicia ns and people would specialize to become businessmen, politicians, highly qualified p rofessionals etc., but specialization of labor can be driven too far. If one-sidedness ov erwhelms in employment, the personality of a person will suffer, and, in the en d, this will be to the disadvantage of the entire nation. If a person has to perform a purely mechanistic act ivity, then this makes him a living tool, a slave, even if he or she is paid well, a ro le that does not befit an advanced culture. 21 Roscher considered one-sidedness in employment a d anger to mental and moral health of workers. He suggested that machines should be developed to take over highly mechanistic tasks. There should be a basic e ducation of people so that they 20 Perlman, Mark and McCann, Charles. 1998. The Pillars of Economic Understanding. Ideas and Traditions . Ann Arbor. The University of Michigan Press, p. 417. 21 Wilhelm Roscher. 1896. Geistliche Gedanken eines National-Oekonomen . Dresden: v. Zahn & Jaensch, p. 135. 115 would better be able to withstand the dangers of di vision of labor. He has observed an increase of the number of persons being mentally il l at any high cultural stage of a society. As a consequence of their illness, these p eople are unable to work and are likely to fall into poverty. 22 Roscher explained this phenomenon with the restles sness of life and interpreted it as a negative side effect o f a division of labor driven too far. Roscher considered it as rational for a culturally high-standing nation to take steps back in the division of labor in order to avoid mental a nd physical dangers. (Roscher, 1896, op. cit. , p. 135). As an alternative remedy of the one-side dness of the division of labor, he suggested extended leisure time, which highly de veloped cultures allow for. (Roscher, 1896, op. cit. , p. 136). This way, high standing professionals co uld voluntarily take over public tasks in society and, for instance , perform work in charities. 23 Tolerance towards the mentally ill in society is an expression of individual freedom, which Roscher propagated. He reported the following incidence: When the Saxonian state wanted to found an institution for epileptics , von Bodelschwingh who was opposed to it, said \"Let us keep the small amount o f misery, we need it.\" 24 At that time, there was no cure available for epileptics. Von Bod elschwingh did not want the epileptics to be locked away, rather, he wanted soc iety to develop so much tolerance that it will be possible to live with them. 25 How progressive his point of view was can be seen from the following quote: \"Unfortunately, epil eptics are all too frequently stigmatized and excluded from many activities of da ily life. Outdated beliefs and misconceptions about epilepsy have only recently sh own signs of lessening in the United States and other industrialized countries.\" 26 Roscher shared the sense of individual freedom that is expressed by von Bodelsc hwingh's remark. 22 For the causes of poverty compare paragraph 2 in W ilhelm Roscher. 1906 3. System der Armenpflege und Armenpolitik. (System of Poverty Care and Poverty Policy). Stuttgart and Berlin: J. G. Cotta' sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, p. 4. 23 While Roscher was in support of charities in gener al, and also wanted the state to support private charities, he also made some cri tical remarks. In the case of the \"Frauenverein of Elberfeld,\" where high-standin g women in society performed charitable work, he criticized that their level of proficiency was not sufficient to perform the type of work they did, fo r instance in mental hospitals. Wilhelm Roscher, 1906 3. System der Armenpflege und Armenpolitik. (System of Poverty Care and Poverty Policy). Stuttgart and Ber lin: J. G. Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, pp. 54-55. The conditions for charities to perform well have been worked out by his follower Karl B\u00fcch er (compare chapter 9). 24 In the original German quote this reads as follows : \"La\u00dft uns doch das bi\u00dfchen Elend, wir Armenpflege und -politik. Stuttgart: Cotta, p. 145, footnote 5. 25 An example is the case of the German Democratic Re public, where, handicapped people were not allowed to become teach ers. 26 Jerrold E. Levy. 1995 3. \"Epilepsy.\" Kenneth F. Kiple, Editor. The Cambridge World History of Human Disease , pp. 713 - 718, p. 713 116 The Social Question : Poverty and Illness. In his work, Roscher did not draw sharp lines betwe en poverty and illness. Aspects of the larger Social Question are discussed in the History of Political Economy , 1874, ( op. cit. ), and Structure of the Economy , 1913, ( op. cit. ). In System of Poverty Care and Poverty Policy , 1906 3, ( op. cit. ) he more narrowly focused on issues of poverty and illness. What was the cause of the workers' question? Rosche r saw the question of the workers as a problem of population (1897, para. 178 ). A lack of self-control on the part of workers would lead to a multiplication of their numbers. In order to prevent that workers fall into poverty, he suggested that they u se their savings and buy property, because this would invoke a certain sense of respon sibility. However, in order to prevent mass poverty, Roscher suggested \"only a tho rough education and self-control of the lower classes can prevent mass poverty; so t hat they never get married light- mindedly, that they always provide for old age and illness.\" 27 The role of women Roscher saw predominantly in the house. While single women should be able to work, he suggested that mothers s hould stay at home. (1897, para. 250, and para. 207). He noted that a woman who work s in a factory at too early an age later would not want to stay at home in order to ke ep a household. She would not like to learn the skills necessary to keep a house and r aise children. (Giouras, p. 112) The family would most likely suffer from the mother's e mployment, and this could lead to the decay of the family, which he identified as a major contributor to poverty. The consequences of a lack of care giving skills were f ar-reaching. For instance, Roscher described mortality of babies not only as a consequ ence of bad living conditions, but it was also due to the inability to take proper care o f babies, to insufficient and wrong nutrition (1906 3, op. cit. , p. 195). He also argued that young children neede d supervision for their mental development. For healt h reasons, Roscher was opposed to the work of young children in factories, with one e xception. If both parents worked at the factory, then the children should also do some light work at the factory after school instead of being left unattended at home. This exam ple shows that in line with the Cameralist tradition, Roscher considered the mental component of health as important. In his book on poverty and illness, Roscher noted t hat with an increase in culture, more and better care would publicly be provided and this had the consequence that more persons would apply for public care (1906 3, op. cit. , p. 6, footnote 7). To some degree, he saw the number of poor and ill persons as a stat istical problem. He noted that before introducing houses for the deaf and dumb, on e did not even know how many persons with that condition there were. He observed that recognition of poverty and 27 The quote reads in the original as follows: \"Nur e ine cit. , p. 21. 117 illness would depend on the cultural stage of a soc iety. A special education for a child being deaf and dumb is now considered a need for th at child, but it was not recognized as a need at a primitive stage of culture. Illness was a major cause of poverty. Roscher noted that among beggars, there were often mentally ill people who would also be addicte d to substance abuse. They were predominantly a problem of the large cities, where they could make a lucrative income as compared to a factory worker. Roscher thought th at poverty care would not be a remedy to begging; as beggars would always want to have more than what poverty care could offer them. He thought that begging has to be seen in connection to illness and addiction of people who lack the will and self- control to change. Thus, he concluded that only progress in psychological and p sychiatric research could eventually bring the problem under control. Roscher wanted to extend psychiatric research to the vagrant population, jails, workers' colonies, etc. (1906 3, op. cit. , p. 16). For those of the poor, who could not afford a physi cian, he suggested creating the public institution of a physician, who would provid e free medical care (1906 3, op. cit. , p. 57). In the Cameralist tradition, he suggested to s upport and teach the poor and ill, and preferably in their home environment so that they c ould learn to help themselves. He preferred voluntary help, in particular if provided by members of the higher classes, but considered professional help as inevitable in the m ost severe cases (1906 3, op. cit. , p. 75). 5.3 Public Regulations Roscher worked out specific suggestions taken from the Cameralist literature, notably Justi. Since he was also active in local, public, t ax, and social policy, some of these suggestions have indeed been translated into specif ic policies adopted in the Kingdom of Saxony. 28 In this context, his History of Economics in Germany should not be overlooked as the most important source of inspirat ion for his policy proposals. 29 Quality Controls of Commodities The basic concern was that producers take advantage of uninformed buyers and endanger their health. In the case of a faulty mach ine or other investment good, accidents were likely to result. Roscher showed tha t quality controls most likely were in 28 Reginald Hansen. 1997. \"The Pure Historical Theory of Taxation.\" J\u00fcrgen Backhaus. Editor. Essays on Social Security and Taxation. Gustav von Schmoller and Adolph Wagner Reconsidered. Marburg: Metropolis, pp. 289- 318. 29 Wilhelm Roscher. 1874. Geschichte der National-Oekonomik in Deutschland. (History of Economics in Germany). M\u00fcnchen: R. Olde nbourg. 118 the interest of the producers, if accidents could b e prevented. He argued that public quality controls allowed producers to sell their co mmodities at higher prices than they could ask otherwise. This was so in particular, if the goods had to be exported. 30 Public controls by police will always be necessary if the health of the user is jeopardized by a sloppy quality of the commodity, a nd if the user cannot take own precautions by performing controls on his own. Then, it is most likely that the producers will gain from measures of public qua lity control, for instance in the case of ships, steam engines, and fire engines.31 For foodstuffs, Roscher advocated regulation requir ing mandatory quality controls. In particular detrimental to consumers are alterat ions of foodstuff. In the middle ages - a time that is not well known for its concer ns for public health care - one has already recognized the need to publicly control foodstuffs. At many locations, legal regulations with respect to prepar ation, handling and alteration of foodstuff can be found. These regulations have more and more been forgotten. Despite the fact that there was no lack of regulati ons with respect to public medicine and hygiene, of which medical and sanitary police was in charge, an effective control of foodstuffs did not take place. Only since the middle of the 19th century such a regulation emerged in the cultu rally developed states which turned out to be very prolific. 32 30 Despite the fact that industry gained by quality c ontrols, it did not have the organization to perform the quality control by itse lf. Roscher recommended quality control by an existing organization, the st ate. Wilhelm Roscher. 1913. System der Volkswirtschaft. National\u00f6konomik des Ge werbflei\u00dfes und Handels .

C ompare chapter eight on public regulation of industrial production, crafts, and trade, pp. 318-409. 31 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Wo di e op. cit. , p. 320. German quote reads as \"Beson in the tradition of the Cameralists w ho by measures of hygiene and public medicine wanted to increase the health of th e population. He advocated public regulations also with concern to measures of accide nt prevention in factories, unsafe working conditions, and excessive work hours for wo men and children, or unsatisfactory living conditions of workers. Safety Regulations in Factories Roscher advocated that the justified interests of t hose, who cannot protect themselves, have to be protected by law. For instance, if worke rs were malnourished or exhausted due to bad working conditions, he recommended that the state should intervene. He argued that this would also be in the interest of t he factory owners. Under the equalizing influence of free competition , it should be in the interest of all culturally high-standing factory owners to prev ent existing or attempted over excessively strenuous working conditions and malnut rition of workers by public measures. 33 Healthy conditions of working in factories lead Ros cher even to consider protective tariffs. The line of argument is relevant in today' s times of globalization. It reads as follows. Efforts at maintaining healthy working con ditions in one factory can be undercut by less scrupulous factory owners operatin g in the same products market. In the extreme, this would lead to the departure of th e factory with the healthy conditions and leave the market only with firms operating with working conditions involving health risks. This calls for state regulation, since self- regulation under these circumstances is unlikely. Looking at international markets, if regulation in the form of international treaties cannot be accomplished, protective tariffs against product s competing with home products for which the previous scenario would likewise apply ca n be invoked as a measure of last resort. The option is treacherous, since it may inv ite retaliatory tariffs affecting totally unrelated home industries. Note that the argument d oes not involve working and factory conditions abroad. He is not talking about Chinese slave labor, textile sweatshops in New York, or shrimp processing in the harbor of Rotterdam. 34 He is concerned with local working conditions with respec t of the health conditions of workers facing international competition. bew\u00e4hrt.(12)\" Roscher, 1913, op. cit. , p. 328. 33 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Bei 913, op. cit. , p. 333. 34 Today, the arguments often run the other way, as p oliticians are concerned with working conditions abroad. 120 The larger a factory, and the fewer the number of c lose competitors, the more so become workers dependent and the less likely they w ill be able to agree on a free labor contract. Sometimes, children are employed, who fac e the exploitation of both, parents and factory owners. Roscher advocated for encompass ing public regulations that would prevent exploitation of both, youth and adult employees. He thought that the institution of worker councils was not able to prev ent exploitation. He observed that entrepreneurs were reluctant to accept them and tha t workers showed indifference and distrust towards worker councils. Under these circu mstances, he concluded that workers councils are most useful if they form at th e same time the board of a company- based health insurance (p. 336). In order to enforce a safe environment in factories , Roscher propagated the position of a factory inspector who visits factories and inform s the state about the needs of factory workers. He must be allowed to gain entry to the fa ctory at all times, while strongly keeping business secrets. A factory inspector must be impartial, his task is to make unsafe conditions public, but leave prosecution to police. Roscher also noted that the institution of factory inspector requires the regis tration of all factories and of their workers. The ideal would be a worldwide system of f actory inspections based on international agreements, an ideal that according t o Roscher was still far away (p. 339). Several countries, however, already had factory ins pectors. Roscher counted 543 public officials in Germany, 268 in Russia, and 200 in England. Their tasks varied slightly in the different countries (p. 341). Roscher warned of the effects of strong worker secu rity measures in one country, if other countries did not have such protections. A co untry without or with limited measures of security could in times of expansion du ring a business cycle fully take advantage of its capacities, while the other countr y would have a restriction and thus face a disadvantage. To a limited degree and in spe cific areas, Roscher saw a potential of international agreements to solve thos e conflicts. As an example, he cited the international Worker Security Conference in Ber n of 1905, where several countries signed an agreement prohibiting night labor for wom en in industry, as well as prohibiting the use of a toxic, white phosphor, in the production of matches (p. 342). Roscher attached an important role to statistics. N ational labor offices should gather the data necessary to make an evaluation of the sit uation in a country (para. 60 b). From specific labor secretaries, people should be a ble to obtain information with respect to their rights in factories and insurance claims (para. 60 c). The regulation for children employed in factories n ot only should prevent hardship at work, but also secure their education at school, an d night labor should entirely be prohibited. Roscher saw a case for moderate child l abor, but distinguished between children below and above the age of sixteen. For th e latter, he recommended that they should perform some kind of work, as this would be better for their physical and mental health and for society in general (para. 61). Appre nticeships of the youth need particular attention according to Roscher, as many of the apprentices would leave their contracts for a position requiring little qualifica tion, but offering a higher piecemeal wage (para. 62). He recommended that apprentices wo rking in particular health- 121 damaging industry such as the glass- or paint indus try should receive instruction in a building separate from the factory. With respect to female work, Roscher noted that it is particularly important that a female worker's health is not endangered and that t he family life is not destroyed by a mother's employment as this would have negative eff ects on children (para. 61 a). German legislation at the time provided for materni ty leave, a maximum workday of eleven hours, longer breaks for factory workers who have to take care of an own household, and allowed females to work only in thos e factories that do not expose them to extraordinary dangers. For instance, work i n quarries was restricted to females. Roscher observed a tendency towards a shorter workd ay for both, male and female workers. From an unrestricted workday, to a 12 or 1 3-hour day, he saw the 8-hour workday as a goal not so far in the future (para. 6 1 b). He thought that an improved technology in the future could help to introduce a shorter workday and bring about the benefits associated with it. According to English e xperiences with a shorter workday, the benefits consisted in higher productivity of la bor, more regularity, increased diligence, and better health states of the workers (p. 364). Roscher also wanted employees to observe Sundays and holidays, but note d that extreme poverty among workers and some technology in industry would requi re work on Sundays. From physicians' side, he quoted demands that in particu lar female office workers should get a long rest on Sundays, as tuberculosis and nervous disorders were on the rise (p. 367). Every entrepreneur owning a factory of craft shop h as to take safety precautions such as proper ventilation, security measures for machin ery, or protective clothing and carry the costs for these measures. Roscher considered it as even more important to also have rules that ensure moral standards in a factory . In case of an accident happening because of unsafe circumstances, the employer would have to reimburse the worker and his dependants. If the accident was caused by i ncautious behavior of the worker, then public poverty care would have to take over th e case. In order to prevent that workers would fall onto public poverty care, Rosche r mentioned the possibility that workers could buy accident insurance themselves, ye t he considered it an unlikely outcome. He therefore recommended that the factory owner would buy accident insurance. Then, the average costs of the accident insurance and of the other safety precautions would be part of the production costs a nd could be shifted onto the consumer (para. 63, p. 380). Roscher himself did no t discuss the effects of such a shift of insurance costs onto consumers; however, he refe rred the reader to the further discussion in Schmoller's Jahrbuch .35 35 Compare Schmoller's Jahrbuch , 1881, on financing health insurance, accident insurance, and insurance for widows and invalids. I n chapter 6, we will turn to this discussion in more detail. Wilhelm Roscher. 19 06 3. System der Armenpflege und Armenpolitik. (System of Poverty Care and Poverty Policy). Stuttgart and Berlin: J. G. Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, p. 349, footnote 8. 122 If an accident happened, then this did most often n ot lead to a claim. Roscher gave the example of the factory director at Hanover, who rep orted in 1870 a total of about 1700 accidents, but only in 116 cases accident insurance was claimed (1906 3, op. cit. , p. 345). Occupational Diseases Roscher paid attention to occupational diseases suc h as in mining. (Roscher, 1913, op. cit. , Paragr. 95, p. 607). There was a higher danger of accidents in mining than in other occupations. The hardship of working in a mine, suc h as working in a lying position, strong temperature changes, or dust development, fo rced miners to quit working before they reached the age of sixty. Roscher concluded th at only the healthy body of a male adult could withstand the hardships of mining. He a dvocated the prohibition of women and child labor in mining. The particular bad circu mstances of women and youth workers as described by Engels' Situation of the Working Classes in England he thought were due to entrepreneurs' greediness for p rofit. Roscher demanded that the personality of a miner ha d to be different from that of other workers. (p. 608) He had to be more steady and thou ghtful in order to withstand the particular dangers of mining. Here, Roscher pointed towards an important point in health economics. Selection of employees with a low er risk to contract an occupational disease can reduce the occurrence of occupational d iseases. If it is well-known that smokers are more likely to contract lung cancer in a dusty work environment, then preferably non-smokers should be selected to work i n that kind of environment. The entrepreneur has to take precautions in order t o protect the workers. Roscher thought that beyond the regulations in the Prussian Mining Law, inspectors should be sent into the mines in order to determine the state of safety conditions and they should make their results public (p. 610). Societies of miners, which can be traced back until 1300 (p. 611), had in Roscher's time mostly the role of insurance carrier for the s ick and the elderly, and for those who had an accident. They offered free treatment and me dicine, paid for a recovery period of up to eight weeks, offered an invalidity pension , a widows' pension, provided money to children and orphans, and paid for the funeral. Membership was compulsory for miners as well as mine owners. Membership fees of b oth, miners and mine owners, finance the insurance. 5.4 Summary and Conclusions Roscher has emphasized that economic phenomena are perceived differently at various cultural stages. An example is illness wher e we now perceive needs, for instance the need of special education for handicap ped children, which have not been 123 recognized at lower cultural stages. The historic m ethod leads to insights of the development of illness and its needs depending on t he cultural stage. Here, Roscher formulated an argument that shows the more modern d ebate of cost-containment in health care in a different light. Costs in the heal th care sector are rising, and the political debate often centers about the question h ow costs can be contained in the health care sector. While this is an important poin t, for instance if we think of how to remedy inefficiencies that are due to monopolist st ructures, it is often overlooked that development also brings about improvement in the pe rformance of health care. Not only costs are rising, performance is rising as wel l. New needs occur that have not been recognized before. Roscher was in favor of state regulations in order to ensure safe products and a safe working environment. He recommended public safety i nspections to enforce these regulations. 36 Roscher considered Engels' early criticism of the misery in factories an exaggeration. He recognized the problems associated with factory work and thought that the worst social consequences were due to the factory system not yet fully developed. With a system of inspection, he wanted t o control factory legislation and its effects. 37 In a comparison with other German states, the numb er of factory factory inspectors was relatively strongest in Saxony. 38 He also recommended accident insurance to be provid ed by the factory owners, and the costs to be shifted onto the consumers. In this context, he did not make clear the effects of safety legislation on the market. He des cribed that factory inspectors reported more accidents than were actually claimed. Some fac tory owners might need public assistance in order to survive. In the context of h is analysis of crises [Absatzkrisen], 36 Bismarck was opposed to the draft of the law on th e education of factory inspectors in 1877. By increasing the number of civ il servants, he feared that requiring companies to perform more administrative work could slow them down and hinder the growth of the economy.

This show s how strong Roscher's practical influence was in Saxony and beyond. Accor ding to Alfred Weber, at that time it was the most important task for worker security to increase the number of inspectors. Compare Alfred Weber. 1897. \" Die Entwickelung der deutschen Arbeiterschutzgesetzgebung seit 1890.\" clearly stated the limits of state interven tion. State intervention should not go so far as to replace the market. A far-reaching guardianship of the state over private actors (emphasis in the original) is not a good measure to prevent crises. In reality, the state would never be able to really supervise production and co nsumption. It would intervene only by accident here or there; and publi c help for one private actor would constitute a disadvantage for another private actor (who has to pay taxes as well) leading to artificial overproduction of so me goods and artificial underproduction of others; this would in many ways distort the way how supply and counteroffer naturally meet each other. 39 The following evaluation by Senn shows Roscher's pl ace in relationship to Wolff. My guess is that there is a distinct possibility t hat many of Roscher's ideas about the role of history in economics could be read as i n opposition to Wolff. Roscher made the object of political economy not the establ ishment of the best possible state of things, but rather the description of the actual state at which the economy has arrived through continual development. Is it possible that he consciously tried to move German economics away fro m the path of Wolff? Of the two crucial questions, `What is?' (positive eco nomics) and `What ought to be?' (normative economics), Roscher wanted to answe r only the former. In fact Roscher did radically alter the approach to economi cs in Germany with the development of the historical school of economics. 40 In listing single and unrelated problems, Roscher p rovided the arguments, but not yet the analysis. In emphasizing some aspects, he negle cted others, for instance \"the well- known book of Wilhelm Roscher System der Armenpflege und Armenpolitik (published for the first time in 1894) refers in only one sent ence to the obligatory insurance for surviving dependents.\" 41 He did not connect the different elements of socia l security 39 The original German quote reads as 1913, cit., 88, p. 578. 40 Peter R.

Evolutionary Economic Thought Adolph Wagner (1835-1917), the public finance theor ist and advocate, was interested in the limits of the state as a part of the economy. His prediction of the likely long-term development of the tasks of the st ate is known as Wagner's Law . He showed that with an advance in the culture of a soc iety the tasks of the state will grow in the long run. Wagner has formulated the con ditions under which the state can and should intervene in the economic process an d thus created a basis for legislation. He foresaw a role of the state with re spect to health care, which will be the focus of this chapter. In the introduction, Wag ner's work will be put in context by providing a short biography. Section 6.2 focuses on Wagner's Law , and an application to health care follows in the next sect ion (6.3). When Wagner formulated his law, capital markets had not yet emerged and in stitutions were not fully developed. In order to show the relevance of Wagner's Law today, aspects of both, the presence of capital markets and modern institut ions, will be discussed in section 6.3 and 6.4. The chapter ends with a summary and co nclusions (6.5). Wagner developed his law, when he was a professor a t the Commercial Academy at Vienna (1858-1863), where he devoted himself to the theory of public finance. Before he went to Vienna, he had studied jurisprude nce and political science at the Universities of G\u00f6ttingen and Heidelberg. From Aust ria, Wagner proceeded to the City College of Commerce in Hamburg. Later, he held chairs at the universities of Dorpat, Freiburg and, from 1870 until his death in 1917, Wagner was Professor in Berlin. His major works are Grundlegung 1 and Finanzwissenschaft .2 Wagner was one of the co-founders of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik , but became frustrated and discontinued his activities in the Verein . On social policy, Wagner and Schmoller often had controversies. While Wagner was more moti vated by religious- philosophical considerations, Schmoller based his o pinions strongly on empirical facts. Adolph Wagner did not want to be associated with the Historical School. Instead, he felt to be close to Carl Menger. 3 Wagner was a member of the Royal Statistical Bureau of Prussia. From 1882 to 1885 he was a member of the Prussian Lower House for the German Conservative Party. 1 The Grundlegung (Foundations) is Wagner's own work and part of his Lehr- und Handbuch der politischen Oekonomie (Text- and Handbook of Political Economy) (1892-94) which grew out of a revision of Rau's textbook on political economy.

Gustav von Schmoller and Adolph Marburg: Metropolis, pp. 289-318, p. 292. 131 Although Wagner did not actively participate in the research and debates with respect to social security and health, which took p lace in the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik , he was not without political influence in this area . For instance, he was one of the first to be consulted about introducing a system of social security. In November 1871, shortly after the establishment of the German Empire, Wagner was invited as a social policy advocate and scholar to a meeting i n the Prussian Ministry of Commerce, in which representatives from commerce, i ndustry, and the landed interests participated. He pointed towards the nece ssity of a social enqu\u00eate, tax reform, and the establishment of supervision of fac tory inspections. 4 At the meeting in the Prussian Ministry of Commerce, Wagner was co nsidered one of the few representatives of the conservative viewpoint. Amon g the other participants were captains of industry or members of parliament, who were considered to agree with the doctrines of the Manchester School. According to the Manchester School the state should only take a position as a night watchman. This expression was coined by Ferdinand Lassalle wh o was, like Wagner himself, an opponent of the pure free market econom y as proposed by the Manchester School. 5 Wagner disagreed with the view of the Manchester S chool. Wagner introduced the state as an actor providing t he infrastructure for the economy, for instance by enforcing laws. He held th at the state becomes the basis for the economy. The state takes part in the econom y itself by producing goods and services in addition to those produced by the free market economy. 6 Thereby, the state forces the competition to follow its lead. Fo r example, a state mine introduces safety measures and produces the information necess ary for the mining authority to regulate the private mines. A state railroad develo ps guidelines with respect to safety and through the experience gained in the operation of the railroad generates the information necessary to regulate all railroads, pu blic and private. In a pure market economy, regulation is stifled, since the state lac ks the information necessary for regulation. The state creates a legal infrastructur e in order to enhance cultural and economic development. (This might lead to a more eq uitable distribution). As a Socialist of the Chair Wagner wanted to promote social freedom, thereby overcome class formation, and hence prevent class s truggle.

Adolph Wagner, 1901, op. cit. , p. 944. 132 the strive of the Socialists of the Chair for social freedom were the freedom of organization, the right of unionization, and the fr eedom of uninsurable risks such as the loss of the ability to work due to a labor-rela ted accident, the loss of the major breadwinner, and the loss of the ability to work du e to old age. 7 In his efforts to create the possibility for social progress and elev ation, Wagner was concerned with the proper limits of the state. He proposed that pe ople who receive goods and services from the state also pay for them through s mall fees and moderate taxes. He was aware of the difficulty of determining the valu e, costs, and quantity of goods and services provided by the state. As a solution, he p roposed participation of the citizen in the public decision making process. (1901, op. cit. , p. 944). After having set the stage in the introduction with a short biography and context of Wagner's work, we will now turn to those aspects of his work, which are relevant to health economics. Wagner's Law , a forecast for the long-term behavior of the stat e, is embedded in the analysis of the Austrian state b udget and will be discussed in section 6.2. In section 6.3, Wagner's Law will be applied to explain the growing influence of the state in health care. In the next section, the focus will be on one aspect of Wagner's analysis, namely that capital (o f all kinds) will become more important in the future. This is also the starting point for the Baumol-Bowen hypothesis which focuses on production costs in ord er to explain the rise of real health care costs (section 6.4). The chapter ends w ith a summary and conclusions (section 6.5). 5.2 Wagner's Law In the context of public finance, Wagner used the n otion of the state in the sense of subsidiarity. 8 In Wagner's view, the state is a much more complex concept than the perception of today. In a modern conception, the st ate consists of different levels of government ranging from national to local, each wit h its own tasks and 7 Modern European laws of social insurance include t hese three forms of uninsurable risks.

Tasks may be handled in any one or several subsets of society , and it is the government's responsibility to ensure that specific tasks such a s health policy are performed. It is not the government's responsibility to do this all by itself. In 1863, Wagner formulated his law of the expansion of state functions over time. He predicted that with an increase in the cultural and technical development and general sophistication and interconnectedness of a complex society the state would become more influential. On the whole, the realm of the state's activities has become ever more extensive, as the concept of the state developed, a s people achieved higher and higher levels of civilization and culture, and the more demands were consequently addressed to the state. This has also led to a continuous increase in the required state revenues, an increas e which was generally even higher relative to the increase of the extent of state activity. The cause for this relative difference lies in the means empl oyed by the state: these have become ever more complex, comprehensive and costly as one and the same need required an ever more perfect, higher and refi ned way of being satisfied. Consider by way of example the educational system! The phenomenon has the character and importance of a \"law\" in politica l economy, the requirements of the state are constantly rising as people progre ss. 10 In 1892, Wagner represented a more refined formulat ion of his law. He distinguished 9 Compare for instance the textbook by David N. Hyma n. 1999 (6). Public Finance. A Contemporary Application of Theory to Po licy . Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers. 10 The original quote reads as follows: \"Im ganzen is t der des \u00f6sterreichischen Staatshaushaltes . (The Budget).

In no te 3, p. 296, Wagner referred to a textbook by Umpfenbach as the original source of the law. 134 between two bundles of public functions, the sphere of law and power, and the sphere of culture and welfare. 11 In the sphere of law and power the tasks of the st ate might rise, if government takes over activities fro m the private sector in order to introduce a higher degree of professionalization. D ue to the development of the economy, the legal circumstances might become too c omplicated and require further regulation. In the sphere of culture and welfare, t he functions of the state might increase, because certain production activities are taken over by the state such as measures of infrastructure, the implementation of i nsurance systems, or monopolies. New needs might arise that have to be fulfilled by a better or more refined supplier, or services have to be fulfilled where the central perspective is not profit maximization, for instance in education, traffic, h ealth care, or communal services. Rising collective and cultural needs will increase state functions, if the quality of the services provided by the state improves. Wagner was concerned about the impact of the develo pment, which we today call Wagner's Law on the status of civil liberty. In his article on \"The State\" of 1901 ( op. cit. , p. 946), he distinguished between primarily indir ect and primarily direct state services in the sphere of culture and welfare. He e xpected that each type of service would have a different effect on the economy. 12 Primarily indirect state services, for instance measures to facilitate legal complications or to improve infrastructure, would allow private and small political entities to remai n independent and thus facilitate the free market exchange, while primarily direct state services, which are often required for technical reasons, would lead to centralization . Wagner argued that provision through primarily direct state services will occur when in relation to marginal costs average costs will be very high. This case of incre asing returns to scale, however, is important from the point of view of civil liberties , too. Because of high average costs, a central provider of a service or product can real ize economies of scale and economies of scope. 13 Therefore, the central provider faces lower produc tion costs 11 Compare his more refined formulation of 1892. Adol ph Wagner. Grundlegung . (Foundations), Handbuch der politischen Oekonomie (Text- and delberg. C.F. Winter'sche Verlagshandlung. Paragraph 358. 12 Wagner was not the only one thinking along these l ines. Two other examples are the following: in the long run, federal program s tend to lead to agglomeration. This is one reason why people move f rom the countryside to the city. Federal programs tend to benefit the cities, so that it becomes cheaper to live there. This effect is known as Brecht's Law . Another law, Popitz' Law , states that in the case of federal states, one can find a long-run tendency towards centralization in the development of the shares of the central state. The expenditures of the single states and the cities be come less important as part of all public expenditures. Compare Walter Wittmann. 1 970. Einf\u00fchrung in die Finanzwissenschaft .

When a broader rang e of goods or services leads to cost reductions, then we speak of economie s of scope. As the central 135 than smaller entities, but may have difficulties in absorbing the relevant information from the base. Wagner, an advocate of minimum state influence, preferred indirect to direct state influence, as the former better would leave civil liberties intact. Due to a process of steady refinement, Wagner concl uded that capital, both material and human capital, will play a more important role in a developed economy, thus, over time, the principle of prevention would become more important than the principle of repression. (1892. op. cit. Paragraph 71 ff.). The principle of prevention with extensive institu tions to prevent legal disturbances and other evils (for instance in the a rea of the health care system)... will more and more be applied, so that t he system of cure will become less important... 14 Wagner has applied this principle to health care. H ealth care, in Wagner's view, encompassed the progress in natural sciences leadin g towards better health, healthy animals and plants, and the environment in general, which is crucial to human health. Wagner expected the state to implement the insights and new knowledge developed through natural sciences. The conditions leading to health or sickness of pe ople, animals, and plants involve light, air, water, food, housing etc., as w ell as infective agents and means of precaution. The progress of the natural sc iences with respect to these conditions of health and sickness, among othe r factors, has in many respects an influence that the public, the state ta sks will continue to expand in the interest of everyone in order to ensure welfare conditions of this kind. 15 provider, the best service provider for the task de fined as a state task is meant. For instance for canals, postal services, or electr icity, the national level would most likely be appropriate, for more local tasks su ch as garbage disposal a regional or city level would be chosen. 14 The original quote reads as follows: Adolph Wagner, 1901, op. cit. , p. 749. 15 In the original, the quote reads as follows: \"U. a . sind die der \"II. Staat in national\u00f6konomischer Hi nsicht.\" . 736. 136 Better prevention will be produced by more complex organizations in the economy. Wagner thought that in the modern state public serv ices would be delivered in a different way with capital and human knowledge beco ming more important. Large institutions and organizations would emerge requiri ng highly qualified labor. Well- educated civil servants would be employed in compli cated organizational structures in such areas as law, defense, and health care. (19 11, op. cit. , p. 737). A high level of financial flow is necessary in order to finance these measures. As consequences of more preventive measures of the state, Wagner pr edicted an increase in costs, as well as a more even distribution of benefits and co sts in the form of taxes in the long run. He considered a more equal distribution as a f avorable outcome of the preventive system. Could civil servants fulfill the requirements posed by a modern society? Wagner compared the performance of public and private empl oyees and found that civil servants were hampered in their work by unavoidable state controls and lacked the incentive to make profits, as they did not have a s hare in the outcome. Wagner considered continuous profitability a measure of ef ficiency for private businesses. However, the state could offer other than monetary rewards to civil servants such as honors (ranks, titles and decorations) and give the m a better standing through greater security of office and better prospects of promotion. Therefore, Wagner concluded that \"the state often has at its disposal a quite exceptionally competent body of employees and, at equal salaries, a more ef ficient one than can be found anywhere else.\" 16 Due to the extra incentives the state can offer, c ivil servants would be as competent as or even better than employees in the private economy. Wagner's Law is open as to the forms state involvement may take . For instance, invoking the subsidiarity principle, the state may take on additional tasks while at the same time delegating responsibilities elsewhere; ei ther downwards in a decentralizing way or laterally like charging or cr eating additional institutions. By consequence, even a decrease in the state share of the social product would be compatible with Wagner's Law , since this law does not deal with expenses, but w ith tasks and their fulfillment and each task can be ac complished by either spending or regulation. The general rule for the state to take over a task is formulated as follows: The state has to take over those activities to sat isfy the needs of its members, which can neither be carried out by private units, nor by other, free or compulsory organizations (self governing bodies), o r which can only be fulfilled by these units and organizations less wel l or at higher costs. 17 16 See Adolf Wagner. 1883. \"Three Extracts on Public Finance.\" Extracts from (3), Leipzig, pp. 4-16, 69-76. In: Musgra ve, Richard A. and Peacock, Alan T., Editors. 1958. Classics in the Theory of Public Finance . London: The Macmillan Company, p. 4. 17 In the original, the quote reads as follows: \"... der to the principle of subsidia rity. These three exceptions justify state action, but also delineate the scope for stat e action. The first two exceptions refer to characteristics in the production process, the third case relates to characteristics in the use of the good or service p ublicly produced. First, exceptions are those cases, where the privat e provision of a good or service is based on the interest of an individual and thus ign ores a long-term general interest. Wagner wanted the state to undertake large capital investments and guarantee production for a long period of time. He assumed th at the bond rate must be lower than the private interest rate for borrowing, becau se the state is the better risk. This is only the case if budgetary discipline exists. On ly under the condition of a balanced budget, the state can refinance itself. Second, exceptions are cases, where a uniform regul ation is desired. Here, production should lie in one hand and should extend over a wide area. Wagner assumed that local businesses can only reach a rela tively small area. It gives rise to differences in prices and quality, local monopolies , and unavailability of goods and services in certain regions. A state can intervene by creating a larger business area, which Wagner typically wanted to achieve with an ex tension and improvement of the railroad. He had allocative questions in mind when he demanded that production should take place by the state. He wanted to preven t that a private company would create a monopoly and receive a large monopoly rent . Third, exceptions are those cases, where many consu mers benefit and marginal utility cannot be measured. These are public goods. Here, exclusion from the use of the good or service by additional customers would n ot be efficient. Wagner also included those cases where external effects are pre sent, in particular, if other people have an advantage from the production of a good or service. (1892, op. cit. , paragraph 380). In all of these cases, Wagner considered it as like ly that a good or service will be provided by the state. Therefore, these cases form the basis of a political consent. 18 Not interest groups should become important in the decision of what is provided by the state, but on the basis of the conditions formu lated, participants of the political process should be able to come close to unanimous v ote on whether to support and consequently undertake state provision of the servi ce or good, or not. Wagner was concerned about the possibility that the state woul d take over inappropriate functions and activities and that a good or service would be provided at too high a cost. He warned that the state might overestimate the value of its activities, expand them too far, or that the state might keep to old patterns o f production and continue to produce superfluous services. (1892, op. cit. , paragr. op. cit. , 1892, Paragraph 377. 18 The intellectual link to Wicksell (and therefore B uchanan) is obvious at this point. Adolph Wagner. 1911, op. cit. , p. 738. 138 Wagner's three exceptional cases to the general rul e of subsidiarity apply to the health care system. Examples are the following: req uiring that production should be guaranteed for a long time period (case one) makes sense in basic medical research, where long lines of research and large ca pital investments are required. Often, it is politically desirable that people in r ural areas have the same access to health care as people in metropolitan areas. Then, the second case of uniform regulation is important. Differences with respect t o access, prices and quality of health care provision and the finance of health car e among different regions and countries could be eliminated. 19 If questions of equity and redistribution through t he health care system are politically important, then production should lie in one hand. 20 An example is the foundation of the British National Health Service, which has pres umably been founded for reasons of altruistic externalities. Those people, who form erly eschewed care, should consume more of it, if it is for free. 21 This is also important in developed countries without a National Health Care System, if the state wants to guarantee equal access to health care for all persons, or provide a minimu m level of health care provision for the poor and needy people. 19 For a discussion of differences in health care sys tems see Hans Maarse and Aggie Paulus. 1998. \"Health Insurance Reforms in th e Netherlands, Belgium and Germany: A Comparative Analysis\". Reiner Leidl. Editor. Health Care and its Financing in the Single European Market . Amsterdam: IOS Press (Biomedical and Health Research, Vol. 18). pp. 230 - 253. 20 For a discussion of the justification of equity an d redistribution in health care see Alan Williams, 1997. Being Reasonable about the Economics of Health. Selected Essays by Alan Williams . A.J. Culyer, A.J. and Maynard, Alan. Editors. Cheltenham United Kingdom: Edward Elgar. An example is the broad support for health policy proposals, also by some modern he alth economists, who want the state to take an active role in health care in order to ensure access of all classes to health care. See, for instance, Hillary Clinton. 1996. It Takes a Village. Simon and Schuster. 21 Buchanan tried to understand and solve the followi ng dilemma of the British National Health Service: on the one hand people pre sumably should have an incentive to consume more care, because additional care is considered to be beneficial, on the other hand, taxpayers are not wi lling to finance all care that is being demanded at a zero price. In the British Nati onal Health Service, the price mechanism cannot be used to equalize demand and sup ply, therefore, as a consequence of the dilemma described, other measure s of rationing prevail such as long waiting lines, lists of priority, excl usion of some forms of therapy, etc. For a discussion of collective and market solu tions of this dilemma see Mark Pauly: \"James Buchanan as a Health Economist.\" Buchanan/ files/ pauly.htm. August 1999.) 139 What is important for the third case that many cons umers benefit and where marginal utility cannot be measured? In health care , differentiation of insurance contracts is typically politically restricted. Peop le with serious illnesses tend to be treated financially in the same way as people who a re less seriously ill. As a consequence of the political restriction moral haza rd can occur, a change in a person's behavior leading towards an over utilizati on of medical services due to health insurance or any other reduction of the risk of illness. 22 Wagner proposed that the citizens should pay small fees for state servic es. Imposing patient cost sharing could restrict moral hazard in health insurance. Al l three of exceptions to the general rule of subsidiarity are met in the case of health care services and therefore, it can be concluded that according to Wagner there is a ro le in the finance and provision of health care for the state. Wagner's prediction and projection of 1863 was that the tasks of the state in a complex and developed society would and should grow over time. Wagner, however, wanted to keep civil liberties intact. On this basi s, he formulated his law as an evolutionary law. A discussion with respect to heal th care follows in the next section. 6.3 An Interpretation of Wagner's Law as an Evolutionary Law A rise of the cultural development in a society lea ds to better health of the population; as people strive for a better education and higher incomes, bad health carries higher opportunity costs. The state interve ntion leads to a better health level of the population and to an additional cultural ris e, which again increases opportunity costs of illness. Therefore, the demand for health care is expected to increase and preventive measures will gain in importance. Wagner recognized that through the state intervention, the system transforms itself an d requires further state intervention. The state is part of this evolutionary process. Critical readers, who negate a role of the state in evolutionary economics, could pose the question, what is evolutionary about Wagner's Law , when government influence in the health care systems of developed W estern countries is typically so strong? Critics typically suggest that by exerting power the state destroys the results of existing evolutionary economic growth. 23 According to this view, there is no role for 22 Here we recognize a parallel between Wagner and Bu chanan. Wagner realized that a collective decision is required when margina l costs cannot be differentiated. Buchanan went a step further in vie wing the resulting additional cost due to moral hazard \"not as disembodied (or ev en specifically game- theoretic) individual or insurance-firm behavior, b ut rather placing it explicitly in the context of collective choice.\" Pauly disagreed with the collective approach and rather suggested giving people a choice of high ly differentiated insurance contracts. Mark Pauly, op. cit. , p. 2. 23 This was suggested at the Workshop of the Max-Plan ck-Institute for Research into Economic Systems on History of Evolutionary Thought in Economics . Jena, August 26-28, 1999. Another suggestion was to look at the work of Joseph 140 state intervention in evolutionary economics. These critics misunderstand Wagner's Law which starts out from the cultural advance in soci ety, and, through a change in the opportunity costs, implies an increase in the t asks of the state in a process of adaptation. In this sense, Wagner's Law has to be interpreted as an evolutionary law. The cultural advance of society, including health i mproving measures, is not imposed on society, but comes from within the population. T he following example illustrates Wagner's demand that civil liberties should be kept intact and transmittance of information not be destroyed by providing a good or service through the state. In the 1930s, Roman Catholic priests of the order of St. E dmund and nuns of the order of St. Joseph came to Alabama's Black Belt to help rel ieve poverty, a high infant mortality and other conditions that led to a low li ve expectancy especially among the black population. 24 When they came, they found a local health care sys tem in place. They used the cottages and other small buildings, w here black people had been treated before, until they were able to begin build ing new facilities. A federal grant through the Hill-Burton Program of $ 800,000 allowe d the construction of a hospital in 1963, which replaced the small local health care facilities of the black community. Only twenty years later, this hospital had to be cl osed due to mounting debts leading to debt payments of $ 1 million annually. Additiona l health policy measures by the state were required to ensure the provision of heal th care in the area. A well- meaning effort by the church and substantial state support thus led to the destruction of small local self-help groups. The quality of hea lth care these groups delivered was not considered acceptable, but instead of giving in centives to provide better service in the same small local environment, a new state-fu nded central hospital was built, which soon became financially unbearable. Not only the ability for self-help was destroyed, but also transmittance of information wi th respect to prevention, nutrition and other life-style factors important to health. T he cottages and small buildings used to treat blacks had been centers of communication, which served to transfer health- related information not only to patients, but to pe ople living in the area. This example shows that by interfering in an evolut ionary process, the system transforms itself and new state intervention will b e required. The federal program failed, and the state became involved in a new and additional task of setting up a health care system as the local system had been des troyed. Centralization occurred at the wrong place. The effect had probably been le ss distortionary, if one had tried to strengthen the existing informal organization. T he move towards cultural advance, leading to a higher education, better incomes, and better health, has to come from within the population, but cannot be imposed on a p opulation. Then, Wagner's Law also leads to government intervention, and a transf ormation of the system requires new government intervention, but in a less distorti onary way as described above. It Schumpeter, who saw a role for the state as a polit ical entrepreneur. There was a consensus at the Workshop that more research is n eeded on the role of the state in evolutionary economics. 24 Alvin Benn. \"Saints of Selma.\" Montgomery Advertiser . July 28, 1999, pp. 1A, 4A. 141 was a main concern by Wagner that civil liberties a nd the informational base would be kept intact. Wagner's concern with civil liberties can be relate d to the modern discussion of direct and indirect democracy. Empirical studies by Werner Pommerehne show that the budget size realized in different cantons in Switze rland is lower under direct democracy than under indirect democracy. 25 In some cantons in Switzerland, voting on the budget is done directly through a referendum , in others it is done by indirect vote. Pommerehne has found that the budget size is smaller, if the vote occurs through a referendum. Communities with direct democ racy try to avoid additional layers of authority. Even if fairly large, they try to organize themselves as neighborhoods. Tax returns tend to be public and mu tual trust is fostered. Public authority tends to be accomplished through honorary service and public service tends to be voluntary. However, as the issues becom e too complex, direct democracy is no longer feasible. Frey tried to dete rmine the optimal mix of elements of direct and indirect democracy in order to maximi ze public sector efficiency. 26 He asked what the ideal constitution should consist of in order to prevent deceitful behavior of both, politicians and taxpayers alike, and at the same time establish trust between politicians and citizens, thereby maintaini ng civic values. This led him to the suggestion of FOCI (functional, overlapping and com peting jurisdictions). 27 When Wagner formulated his law, he did not foresee the emergence of a capital market, which would give private investors access t o capital. The focus of the next section will be to show how the emergence of capita l markets changed the role of the state as perceived by Wagner. This will be illu strated with the example of health care. In contrast to Schmoller, Wagner also has not foreseen the negative effect of bureaucratization, which will be discussed at the e nd of the next section. 25 Werner Pommerehne. 1978. \"Institutional Approaches to Public Expenditure: Empirical Evidence from Swiss Municipalities.\" Journal of Public Economics . 9, Expenditures and Voti ng Behavior: An Empirical Investigation at the Example of Public Subsidizatio n of Theaters).

He predicted that in a culturally advancing society, innovations would lead to more complicated and capi tal-intensive methods of production in the future. 28 Historically, capital markets developed slowly. For instance, the Fugger and Welser families underwrote the campaigns of Charles V., wh o had no access to capital markets. In Napoleonic times, wars could be finance d through access to capital markets. 29 Private access to credit was scanned, typically re duced to suppliers' lines of credit. Stock exchanges for corporate credit dev eloped in the second half of the nineteenth century allowing private corporations to borrow large amounts of capital. Capital markets accessible to households are a phen omenon of the twentieth century. Baumol and Bowen assumed the presence of a fully de veloped capital market. 30 Like Wagner, they predicted that a move towards more cap ital-intensive methods of production will take place in the future, but, in c ontrast to Wagner, they showed that this could not be realized in all sectors of the ec onomy. Baumol and Bowen found that capital-intensive methods of production tend n ot be applied by the state, but by private corporations. Those are to be found in the thriving sectors of the economy. The state is typically to be found in the areas of the sectors of the economy, where productivity growth is low. Baumol and Bowen tried to explain this phenomenon and came up with the Baumol-Bowen Hypothesis . In what follows, we will take a closer look at this hypothesis, which focuses on productiv ity differentials, and its implications for health care. Baumol and Bowen noted that there is persistence in the pattern of differences of productivity growth among different economic sector s in a developed economy. The 28 Wagner did not investigate the process of economic development in detail. This task was left for Schumpeter, who focused on the ro le of those persons with leadership qualities, who would pick up or make inv entions and then turn them into innovations. He considered those innovators as the driving force of economic development. Compare the \"Seventh Chapter\" by Joseph Schumpeter. 1912. The Theory of Economic Development . Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot. 29 Compare David Ricardo. 1817. (1949). Principles of Political Economy and Taxation . London. 30 The framework for the analysis of productivity gro wth differences in economic sectors was developed when Baumol and Bowen analyze d the performing arts sector in 1966. The authors referred to the phenome non as \"cost-disease of the performing arts.\" William J. Baumol and W. G. Bowen . 1966. Performing Arts. The Economic Dilemma . New York: Twentieth Century Fund, p. 183. 143 analysis of long-term data of the performing arts, health care, education, police protection and legal services showed that the rise of real costs lies persistently over that of the inflation rate. 31 For instance, those sectors with low productivity growth, which Baumol and Bowen referred to as stagnant sect ors of the economy, do not suddenly switch to periods of rapid productivity gr owth, but remain rather steady in their pattern of low productivity growth (1996, op. cit ., p. 183). Baumol found that in the stagnant sectors of the economy more personal s ervices are required as inputs than in the thriving sectors. They identified the h andicraft aspect which is central to those sectors. For two reasons, personal services in stagnant sect ors cannot easily be replaced by automation processes. First, it is hard to standard ize the cases and second, the quality of service would decrease, when introducing automated services (1995, op. cit ., p. 14). In health care, physicians have to treat each case individually. When a physician cuts back the time he or she spends in tr eating a patient, then quality of diagnosis and treatment can be expected to be reduc ed. Due to these characteristics, it is difficult to implement techn ical progress into stagnant sectors, which would lead to productivity growth. In stagnant sectors, an increase in costs causes a price increase, when it cannot be offset by productivity growth. This is known as the Baumol-Bowen Hypothesis and can be illustrated by the following example. After a car accident has happened, the damaged car can usually not be left to a robot for repair, but a mechanic has to work on it. If the mechanic gets a pay raise and nothing else changes, then costs for car repair will go up by the amount of his pay raise. T his happens in a sector of the industry, where handicraft cannot be substituted by capital. In a sector, where technological innovation is high, an increase in co sts does not have to lead to a price increase. Baumol and Bowen illustrated this with th e example of the production of new cars. If a new idea leads to an automation proc ess increasing productivity, then costs of the new cars will decrease. If workers in the new car industry get a pay raise, then this means an increase in costs of the new cars, but it might be offset or partially offset by the productivity growth caused by the innovation, which decreased costs. This example shows that the effect of an inc rease in costs in stagnant sectors is different from other sectors of the economy, whi ch can fully take advantage of technical progress. Due to the characteristics of stagnant sectors, pro blems of standardization and an expected loss in quality would occur, if beyond a c ertain limit technical progress would be integrated into the production process. Th e introduction of High-Tech 31 William J. Baumol. 1995. \"Health Care as a Handicr aft Industry.\" The Office of Health Economics , Annual Lecture, p. 7. For example, Baumol tried t o explain why between 1948 and 1995 the price of physician's services rose by more than 5.5 % per year, as compared to the rise of the cons umer price index of roughly 4 %, or why in the same time period, the price of a h ospital room shows an annual average increase of 8.6 % which is well above the r ise of the consumer price index. 144 medicine into health care is a promising field lead ing to better methods of treatment and enabling shorter stays in hospital, but High-Te ch medicine is not applicable to all cases. The consequence of Baumol's hypothesis of st agnant sectors is to substitute as much capital as possible for labor in order to a void a long-run increase in costs of health care production. Such a development can be o bserved, especially in form of High-Tech medicine, which is being introduced in ho spitals. This is typically not seen as a cost-saving development, but as the opposite: a cost factor, especially if it takes the form of High-Tech. (Mittelstrass, op. cit. , p. 35). Of all areas in medicine, development and introduction of High-Tech medicine has been strongest in the field of surgery. While High-Tech medicine has a place in health care, leading to better methods of treatment and enabling shorter stays in hospital, health care remains a stagnant sector, which requires medical judgment on a case by case basis and provision of care on a personal basis. In stagnant sectors, increasing automatization is generally not a method to further reduce health care costs. Stagnant sectors can be both, public or private, bu t often they are to be found in the public sphere. Due to the productivity growth in so me sectors of the economy, which tends to be in the private sphere, people become we althier over time. As private affluence increases, Baumol argued that people will better be able to pay for the goods and services produced by a stagnant sector. H e proposed the introduction of own contributions and a broad-based managed care ap proach. He also recommended measures that tend to shift stagnant se ctors to the private sphere, such as more private hospitals, more private school s, etc. (1995, op. cit. , p. 31). 32 Baumol wanted everyone to reach a certain minimum s tandard of health care (1996, op. cit. , p. 184). Therefore, he proposed basic insurance t o cover catastrophic risks of a country's population. 33 Bureaucratization could lead to higher employment. Two effects need to be distinguished here. On the one hand, shielded secto rs, irrespective whether they are public or private, leave opportunities for producti vity increase unutilized and therefore retain relatively higher payrolls than competitive firms. In addition, monopolies tend 32 The health care policy measures proposed are also based on Baumol's and Blinder's work on efficiency and the theory of cont estability. According to the Contestability Hypothesis , a firm in a monopoly situation behaves as if ther e were competitors in the market, because it wants to prevent market entry by potential competitors. There is an incentive to the company to make market entry unattractive to other companies. The monopoly can do this by keeping profits relatively small and providing consumers wi th an attractive supply of goods. Compare William J. Baumol, and Alan S. Blind er. 1982. Economics: Principles and Policy . San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 33 For a discussion of public health policy and the a djustment processes caused, compare Ursula Backhaus, Ursula. 2000. \"My Family D octor is not a Robot: An Application of the Baumol-Bowen Hypothesis to Healt h Care.\" Gerrit Meijer, Wim J.

The Netherlands: Shaker Publishing. 145 to develop bureaucracies which can be described by Niskanan's model where budget and typically payroll maximization reasonabl y describe organizational behavior. 34 There is a state monopoly in many of the stagnant sectors; therefore, stagnant sectors enjoy more security in employment and funding than free-market sectors. As a consequence of bureaucratization, the re is a tendency towards a rise in employment instead of a decline as might have ha ppened in a purely private, competitive sector. 35 Buchanan and Tullock have variously pointed out tha t market failure cannot be construed as a cause for government to intervene. F irst, one has to show that governments can perform better than the market. Thi s was the problem of Adolph Wagner. He believed that government can work better than the market. In contrast, Schmoller has shown how a program desi gned on the principles of common agricultural policies will lead to an ever w idening web of governmental interference into markets and result in and perseve re malfunctioning of both, governmental agencies, the respective markets, and their interaction. While Wagner has a predisposition in favor of state policy initi atives, Schmoller is quite aware of state policy failure. For example, for the example of agricultural policy, the Kanitz Act Proposal, he gives an in-depth analysis. 36 Spot wise interferences into the health system by contemporary governments tend to develop the same pattern. Adolph Wagner did not see these unintended consequences of governmental interference into markets as he was convinced that governmental leaders (enlightened civil servants and hereditary rulers) were guided by ethi cal convictions. However, in favor of Wagner it has to be emphasized that he primarily thinks of state intervention through public entrepreneurship instead of regulati on. State policy through market participation typically does not lead to market fai lure. 6.6 Summary and Conclusions Wagner's Law starts out from the cultural advance in society, a nd, through a change in the opportunity costs, implies an increase in th e tasks of the state in a process of 34 William A. Niskanen, Jr. 1971. Bureaucracy and Representative Government. Chicago: Aldine Publishing Company. 35 Empirically, such an employment effect of bureaucr atization has been shown with respect to the arts. Today, more people are em ployed in large public theaters than there used to be. The same performanc es took place in much smaller, often private theaters. For instance, Goet he employed in his own private theatre very few people for the same perfor mances we can see today.

Wagner's Law is an evolutionary law, which states that the cult ural development is not imposed, but comes from within. Wagner also predicted that the principle of prevention would become more important over time, both in law and in health care. Wagner assumed that the state plays an important role in providing capital. Hence, the state finances medical (and oth er) research, which presumably leads to new innovations and further progress of so ciety. In the health economy today, the conditions under which Wagner formulated his law have changed. Health policy measures are sometimes imposed by government , capital markets exist, and distortionary effects of bureaucracy of both, marke ts and governments, might be present. Therefore, while the underlying principle is true, we can only cautiously interpret our reality with Wagner's Law . Wagner's analysis of the state budget and the prope r limits of the state with respect to health care lead to insights which are important for issues so far neglected in health economics. In diagnosing an increase in the functions of the state, Wagner was correct, and certainly for the case of a grayin g population. He did not see, however, the innate pressures of a state health org anization even beyond its purpose. He considered the state and bureaucrats as able to efficiently provide services. Unlike Schmoller, he did not perceive bur eaucratic inefficiencies as mentioned above. And he certainly did not see the c onsequences of his own Law. A large state health organization, which is not organ ized according to insurance principles, would lead to a deterioration of health services instead of an improvement, for which he had wished. The relevance of Wagner's approach consists in two parts. On the one hand, we want to understand to what extent Wagner's Law can explain current trends in state involvement and expenditure with respect to health care. Here, our findings are that the explanatory power is limited. As has been shown above, further developments such at the economic theory of bureaucratization or the Baumol-Bowen Hypothesis fill in gaps. On the other hand, one does not do ju stice to Adolph Wagner, the public finance theorist, if one neglects his normative con cerns. Here we strike a fertile mind. 37 The three exceptions Wagner formulated with respec t to the subsidiarity principle were directed at achieving a broad consen sus among citizens and politicians in order to support the measures public ly undertaken. They can be used as a yardstick against current developments and may help in the formulation of policy. 37 In comparison with his contemporary and leader of the Younger Historical School, Gustav Schmoller, Wagner's strength lay in his normative approach.

This chapter is a revised version of my publication : \"Austrian Aspects to Health Economics.\" Modern Applications of Menger - 1921) founded Austrian Economic s with his Grunds\u00e4tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre (Principles of Economics, 1868). 1 In this work, he saw the importance of health as a factor contributing to th e development of a nation, which is brought about by individual planning and provision for the future. 2 He thus builds on the old Cameralist tradition. 3 Hence, public policy was among other things direct ed to maintaining public health standards. Menger's stude nts and proponents of the Austrian School, Friedrich von Wieser (1851-1926) a nd Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk (1851-1914), further developed his thought and est ablished the reputation of the Austrian school of economics. The major cornerstone s of Austrian Economics are methodological individualism, methodological subjec tivism, and an emphasis on time. In the introduction, Menger's biography shows that as the teacher of Crown Prince Rudolph he was presumably not without political inf luence. In section 7.2, an overview of Carl Menger's perceptions of health in the econo my follows, in particular his discussion of the role of error with respect to the production and consumption process and the role of health in individual planning and p rovisions made for the future, an idea, his successor B\u00f6hm-Bawerk built upon. The concept of a subjective discount rate has found entry into modern health economics as will be illustrated in section 7.3. The chapter ends with a summary and conclusions. Carl Menger was born in 1840 in Neu-Sandec, Galicia , the Austrian Empire and he died in 1921 in Vienna. 4 He studied in Vienna and Prague and in 1867 he rec eived his doctoral degree in jurisprudence from the Jagiellon ian University in Krakow. Then, he worked as an investigative journalist of a governme nt sponsored newspaper reporting on economic issues. On this basis the government th ought to launch an academic career for him at the University of Vienna, an effo rt that failed in first instance, because 1 Carl Menger. 1871 (2). Grunds\u00e4tze der Editor. T\u00fcbingen: Mohr 1868, first edition. 2 In his Principles , Menger frequently has used the term \"Volk\" which has been translated as \"nation\" throughout. With reference t o the polyglot territories of Austria-Hungary and eastern Prussia, Mises later ha s clarified the term in relating it to a speech community. Leland B.

Munich: dtv. Volume 7, p. 67. 155 the faculty (von Stein) rejected the habilitation t hesis. This thesis later proved to be controversial in more than one sense. His most impo rtant work was written in 1868, Grunds\u00e4tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre , op. cit. , where he tried to show the relationships among utility, value, and price. Thereafter, Menger accepted a position in the Austrian civil service. In 1873 he became a professor of pol itical economy at the University of Vienna. In 1876 he was named the teacher of the Aus trian Crown Prince Rudolph who received fifteen lectures on political economy. 5 In 1903, Menger retired from his professorship in Vienna and devoted himself to the completion of his studies in economics, but tragically, most of his late work wa s lost because of his endless efforts to revise his work. Menger contributed to the formulation of a subjecti ve theory of value. He explained relative prices on the basis of subjective individu alism. Individualism refers to the unconscious situation of individual preferences det ermining social institutions. With social institutions, Menger meant prices and other economic phenomena. Menger was aware of the principle of marginal utility, but did not apply it systematically. He did not use the concept of marginal utility to explain rela tive prices; it was later introduced by Wieser. 6 Today, Menger's approach is accepted in the mainst ream. He changed the research program, because now we look at the indivi dual as the point of departure, not at the economic context. The Austrians such as Meng er distinguished between economic spheres and extraeconomic spheres. In such a distinction, health is not an economic phenomenon. Schumpeter in his Seventh Chapter tried to break the mold. 7 Menger wrote his early and major work, the Principles ( op. cit .), in a time when the cultural and industrial development has led to a ne w post-feudal upper class with new attitudes and diseases. In his analysis of the econ omy, he has emphasized the role of the individual as the decision-taking unit and the role of time in the production and consumption process. He explored issues of percepti on and education as determinants of better health. Health aspects in the Principles ( op. cit .) appear in relation to what Menger perceived as human error and processes of le arning and with respect to the cultural development of a nation. A presentation of related quotes and their context follows in section 7.2. B\u00f6hm-Bawerk built on Menger 's ideas, as will be shown later in this section. 5 Erich Streissler and Monika Streissler.

(Menger, 1971(2), op. cit. , p. 21). Menger considered planning ahead in the p roduction and consumption process as a prerequisite for cultural development. In this process, he foresaw the possibility of human error, in particular with resp ect to the nature of goods and needs, and individual provision for the future. A substantial part of Menger's library at the Hitot subashi University consists of medical books, which shows his interest in the human body. Albert Sch\u00e4ffle, who held a chair at Vienna University since 1868 was presumably not wit hout influence on Menger. He shared with Menger the view that \"cause and effect\" are not restricted to phenomena of the natural sciences, but can be applied to social activities of people as well. 8 Menger occasionally referred to examples where the functio ning of the human body was involved, but clearly departed from Sch\u00e4ffle who an alyzed the economy in analogy to the human body. 9 In leaving the tradition of body politics, Menger saw \"cause and effect\" from a need to its satisfaction either occu rring within the body or outside. When therefore our person should move from the sta te of desire into that of the satisfied need, then there have to be sufficient ca uses to bring this about. This means that either the forces acting in our organism have to remove our distracted state, or that things from outside of ou rselves have an influence on us, which by nature are able to bring about that st ate we refer to as satisfaction of our needs. 10 Goods are those things, which can be used to satisf y needs. Four requirements have to be met for a thing to become a good. ( Principles , 1971(2), op. cit. , p. 3). First, a 8 Both, Sch\u00e4ffle and Menger, stress the restrictions under which persons act.

T\u00fcb ingen: Verlag der Laupp'schen Buchhandlung. 10 The reads follo ws: \"Wenn demnach unsere Person Bed\u00fcrfnisse nennen.\" 1971, op. cit. p. 1. 157 human need must be present; second, the causal rela tionship must be given in the sense that the thing must possess qualities that en able it to satisfy the human need; third, a person has to be aware of the causal relat ionship between satisfaction of the need and the thing; and fourth, a person has to be able to dispose of it for satisfying the need. If at least one of these four requirements ha s not been met, then a thing cannot become a good. Menger considered it an error, if individuals belie ve that things have good character, which in reality they do not have; he referred to t hem as imaginary (eingebildete) goods. According to his view, it is also an error, if people assume a need to be as given which they do not really have. An illustration is t he following: A special relationship can be observed in those ca ses, when things are treated as goods, which do not stand in a causal relationsh ip with the satisfaction of human needs. This happens if things are falsely tho ught to have properties, which in reality they do not have, or if human need s are falsely assumed, which in reality do not exist. ... To the things of the f irst kind belong most cosmetic goods, amulets, the majority of medicine, which is given to the ill in a low standing culture, and in the case of raw peoples st ill in the present, divining rods, love drinks, etc., because all of these thing s are in reality unable to satisfy those human needs, which they are supposed to satis fy. To the things of the second kind belongs medicine in order to cure illne sses, which in reality do not exist... 11 First, in a society at a low cultural level, medici ne is often ineffective, which is an example that this good does in reality not have the qualities and effects expected. Second, if medicine is prescribed for imaginary ill nesses, then human needs are 11 The original German quote by Menger reads op. cit. , p. 4. 158 assumed as given, which in reality do not exist. It was Menger's prediction that as a nation becomes more developed, people acquire more knowledge, they make fewer errors about the character of goods, and there will be less imaginary goods in the economy (1971(2), op. cit. , p. 5). But what about imaginary needs? Menger did not make a prediction about the development of imaginar y needs in the future. As Mises has pointed out, Menger's distinction betw een real and imaginary goods and needs is not consistent with a strictly subjective base. According to Mises, an economist following a strictly subjective view cann ot assess people's needs and the character of the goods to satisfy those needs. 12 This shows that in Menger's analysis the subjective base is not yet fully developed. 13 According to Menger, a good, either a matter or a s ervice, can also consist in an activity not undertaken. Menger illustrated the val ue of an activity not undertaken as follows: \"... the circumstance, that a rich physici an living in a small country town with only one other physician stops practicing is even l ess a work effort of the former, but for the latter, who thereby becomes a monopolist, it is a very useful act of omission.\" 14 In cases such as these, Menger considered the market s tructure, but he neglected the welfare effects of a local monopoly in health care.15 The lectures he gave to Crown Prince Rudolph show that he was in favor of a minim um of state interference.

Frankfurt: Peter Lang. 14 The original German quote reads as cit. , p. 6. 15 The welfare effects of a monopoly in health care h ave already been a problem to Paracelsus and to the Cameralists, who feared th at the provision of health care to the population is insufficient and possibly of low quality. The Cameralists wanted to ensure minimum quality standards of healt h care through supervisory committees. Menger's successor and proponent of the Austrian School, B\u00f6hm- Bawerk, considered monopolists' fear of outsider co mpetition as the most effective means against unscrupulous exploitation o f their monopoly position. According to B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, markets should not be reg ulated against the behaviour of market participants, but in line with what they want to achieve. Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk. 1975. Macht che Buchgesellschaft, pp. 26, 27. 159 The production process takes time and is connected to consumption. By distinguishing between goods of higher and of lower order, Menger has integrated the production and consumption process. Goods of lower order are able to satisfy a need immediately, for instance tobacco, which is a good of first order. O ther goods, for instance tobacco leaves and tobacco seeds are necessary to make the tobacco and are called goods of second order. Tools, human labor, or the tobacco pl ot are even further away from immediately satisfying a need and are considered go ods of third and fourth order. In the example given, tobacco leaves and dry air are c omplementary goods. They are necessary in order to make tobacco. In a highly dev eloped economy, complementary goods will be provided through the market. 16 People's preferences can change, and sometimes they change very suddenly. In the example of a sudden stop in the use of tobacco this would lead to a wealth of adjustment p rocesses, making the stock of tobacco leaves and seeds obsolete and requiring a d ifferent use of the land, of the farmhands who had been working on the tobacco field s, and of the machines used. In case of a disturbance such as war or a sudden prefe rence change, shortages or surpluses of complementary goods can occur and temp orarily lead to unemployment. The longer the production process, the more time it takes to transform goods of higher order into goods of lower order, and the higher wil l be the degree of uncertainty with respect to quantity and quality of the good produce d. For the further development of a nation it is important that people employ goods of higher order. In a culturally high- standing nation, Menger has considered planning for a lifetime and beyond not as unusual. He has argued that we enjoy the fruits of the provisions for the future of the past when we have to use the services of a lawyer o r physician, as it would be too late to acquire these skills at the moment we need them. (1871, op. cit. , p. 33). Individuals will plan ahead for expected developments and to a certain degree make provisions for unforeseen needs in the future. In a similar way, c ommunities will act and anticipate the increased future need when planning public building s such as schools and hospitals, roads, parks, water facilities, etc. (Menger, 1871, op. cit. , p. 39). This is central to Wagner's Law , of which Menger seems to be aware of. While planning ahead in the production process is i mportant for cultural development, planning ahead in the consumption process is also a significant factor contributing to development. 17 As in the production process, Menger has started w ith a basic example related to the consumption of food. Goods have value, because they can satisfy our need s. (Menger, 1871, op. cit. , p. 75, p. 85). Satisfaction of individual needs has a subj ective component, as individuals equalize marginal utilities when consuming or produ cing different goods and services, and an objective component, as consumption depends on the means someone has to spend and on availability of certain goods or servi ces. Marginal utility from the 16 Menger used the term \"Verkehr\" when he referred to the market. 1871, op. cit. , p. 16. 17 Auke R. Leen. 1999. The Consumer in Austrian Economics and the Austrian Perspective on Consumer Policy . Dissertation, Wageningen. 160 consumption of a certain good such as food intake t ypically decreases, if the consumption of the good increases. Up to the point to where subsistence is secured, s atisfaction of the need for food fully means to every person to maintain his life. A s observation teaches us, consumption above the subsistence level to the same person only has the meaning of a more and more decreasing satisfaction, until consumption has reached a certain level, where the satisfaction of the need for food is already fully reached, so that every additional intake of f ood neither contributes to maintaining life itself, nor makes a positive contr ibution to health, nor leads to additional satisfaction to the consumer, but starts not to matter to him any longer. Eventually, further consumption will become painful, a jeopardy to health, and finally a threat to life itself. 18 According to Menger, people do not always act in an enlightened way. He wrote that experience has taught us \"a current satisfaction or satisfaction in the near future seems to be more important to people than a satisfaction of the same intensity in a more distant point in time.\" 19 Even if people are not dumb and try to make ration al decisions, they easily make errors in evaluating future needs. In particular, people easily get misled when they estimate the value of those satisfactions of needs, which improve their well-be ing in an intense, but fast passing way as higher than the value of those satis factions of needs, which are less intense, but which occur over longer periods o f time. Not infrequently, people evaluate passing intense pleasures as higher than their permanent welfare, sometimes even higher than their own life.20 18 The original German quote by Menger reads op. cit. , p. 91. 19 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Ein G enuss Zeitpuncte.\" (1871, op. cit. , p. 128). 20 German quote reads thought it to be bad judgment, if a person e valuates the present satisfaction of a need as higher than the future satisfaction of ne eds, in particular if the immediate satisfaction is accompanied by negative health effe cts. This high time preference, associated with negative health effects, Menger con sidered an obstacle to planning and provision for future needs, which are important for the cultural development of a nation. In order to encourage cultural development, he has recommended that people should use goods of higher order, build up long pro duction processes, accumulate knowledge and plan for further knowledge accumulati on, for instance by setting up institutions for the education of highly specialize d professionals. Building up capital is crucial in this process of cultural development. In this, he can hardly be distinguished from what Schmoller proposed. In building up culture, Menger distinguished betwee n two types of capital. (1871, op. cit. , fn., pp. 130, 131). The productivity resulting fr om land or buildings is different from the productivity resulting from that part of capita l which is often represented by sums of money. In Menger's terminology, human labor is a pa rt of capital of the former kind and a good of higher order. In other words, one can inv est by buying machines and setting them in operation, but one can also invest by train ing people and asking them to solve problems as is the case in the example of the pharm aceutical industries. The actual production of most advanced drugs involves miniscul e costs. The cost lies in researching, developing, getting approval, marketin g, and continuous observation of long term effects. Virtually all the capital involv ed is human capital; virtually all the capital affected by the use of these drugs is human capital. Menger's concept was further developed by B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, whose most import ant original contribution was his theory of capital and interest. 21 In his lectures, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk saw health as an inpu t in production. People should strive to reach the maximum of utilit y in their personal lives with as few sacrifices as possible; it is a sacrifice, if peopl e's health suffers from working. B\u00f6hm- Bawerk described health as an input in the producti on function. 22 Mental and physical health might suffer, if an employee faces one-sided requirements due to the division of labor. Wohlbefinden f\u00f6rdern, anzuschlagen, als p. 122. 21 Friedrich A. von Hayek. 1968. \"The Austrian School .\" International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences . 4, pp. Lectures on Economics. Copy on the Basis of two Transcripts.) Marburg. Metropolis. p. 43. 162 A far-reaching division of labor can also contribut e to unemployment. A worker, who has only developed limited skills due to the one-si dedness of requirements at work, will find it difficult to find new employment, if he or she gets laid off. In his Lectures , B\u00f6hm- Bawerk has shown that loss of employment is likely to occur under a far-reaching system of division of labor, which requires an orga nization for coordination. Coordination becomes difficult in times of war and political unrest, and can easily be disturbed, if it takes place at an international le vel. (Tomo, 1998, op. cit. , p. 137). As remedies for the disadvantages of a far-reaching di vision of labor, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk has proposed shorter work hours, so that time is left f or the regeneration of health through leisure and cultural activities. By offering the po ssibility for a continuing general education, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk proposed to raise the level of knowledge, so that people would be less affected by the one-sidedness in the production process. He proposed to offer support to those employees, who became unempl oyed. B\u00f6hm-Bawerk wanted to build a stronger organization which was better able to prevent unemployment, for instance by hiring qualified professionals, economi cally and technically skilled employees who could function as supervisors and who would be responsible for the coordination of work. In addition, he suggested sup porting labor by as much physical capital as possible in order to enable a developmen t, where the productivity of labor is high so that output can be produced at a low level of labor input. (B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, op. cit. , p. 138). Like Menger, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, considered a larger conce rn of the future, where the rate of time preference is consistent with a low subject ive discount rate, as conducive to the cultural development of a nation. People are willin g to forgo and postpone consumption to a later period in their life. This would lead to an increase of national savings and national capital. (B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, op. cit. , p. 308). In his work on capital and interest, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk wa s concerned with the valuation of goods and services. He was strictly opposed to the idea that the amount of labor as input for goods and services determines their value . He argued that the existence of the phenomenon of interest shows that there must be another determinant of value than labor. \"One does not receive interest on capit al because of some kind of work performed, but simply, because one is owner; intere st on capital is not a labor income, but an income due to possession.\" 23 In the second volume on Positive Theory of 23 The original German quote reads as follows: nstheorien . (Capital and 163 Capital B\u00f6hm-Bawerk has shown that all forms of interest a re based on a difference in value between future and present goods. Psychologic al factors and differences in production technology cause the original difference in value. (1921, op. cit. , p. 454). Concerning the psychological side, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk buil t on Menger. He gave the example of farmhands without own possessions. In co mparison to capitalists, the farmhands would always more strongly prefer present to future consumption; the capitalists would wait. (1921, op. cit. , p. 458, note 2). Concerning the technological side, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk deve loped as the basic notion that waiting is the essence of capital formation and wil l increase productivity. In many areas of production, time is an important element. This i s true in agriculture, in hunting and fishing, and in particular in forestry, where the p rocess of production can easily take more than a century. During this process of product ion the producer has to wait, but he does not sit idle. He has to take care of the field , the pond, or the forest. In industrial production, time can also be of essence, even in th is time of the delivery of turn-key factories, a global division of labor, and almost i nstantaneous communication. Production requires research planning and organizat ion and is never instant. In this sense, time is necessary, but this is time that is necessary for activities, and not for idle leisure. Often, the analogy is used of wine that ma tures and gets better with age. Only selected wines of a minimum quality can improve and they have to be selected carefully. Further, they have to be kept under adeq uate conditions in order to improve. Interest exists, because waiting is painful; a sacr ifice, made only if there is sufficient compensation. That compensation can be offered to t he suppliers of waiting, because waiting can be used to create additional value. A totally different situation arises, when for inst ance in health care, for ethical, religious, or political reasons, the market mechanism cannot b e used for allocation. Babies, kidneys, or hearts cannot be bought and sold in mos t circumstances. Often, as Calabresi pointed out, a substitute and less effici ent mechanism for allocation has to be used.24 This is typically the queue (waiting in line). In modern societies, we find it in health care, but also in the legal system. The queu e is politically expedient. It helps reducing expenditures (while at the same time gener ating substantial costs). From the point of view of political illusion, the queue has the advantage that it never gets beyond a certain length. This is, because an additional pa tient or plaintiff joins the queue only, if the expected value of the treatment or contract set tlement is at least slightly higher than the cost of waiting. The cost of waiting consists m ostly in opportunity cost and is the higher, the more severe the health condition or the more important the legal case. In this sense, although in a very costly way, the queu e as an allocative mechanism does make a selection between economically more and less important cases. The longer the queue, however, the higher the social cost imposed on society by this allocative mechanism. It is important to note that these costs fall not only on the cases in the Interest. I.

Norton & Company. 164 queue, but are also borne by those not joining the queue. This phenomenon is not to be confused with the Austrian process of time-consu ming roundabout production. The idea that human decisions are not made with res pect to medically relevant single aspects of one's health figures prominently in Aust ro-Marxism, another strand of thought that grew out of Austrian economics. In Mar xist economic thought, matters such as health conditions are not a result of indiv idual self-conscious and responsible decisions, but a consequence of the class situation in which people live, work, linger, and die. 25 People grow into or else opt for a particular life style, a concept that in the Austrian tradition is called Lebenslage . It became extremely important when Otto von Neurath proposed a planned economy for Post World W ar I German countries. 26 Planning was to be done not in terms of setting pri ces, production or material goals, but in terms of physic lifestyles to be attained for an d by the democratically constituted people. The policymakers' choice was then to choose among alternative lifestyles (Lebenslagen ) as a policy goal. Conceivably, one of the most im portant contributions of the Austrian School, Ludwig van Mises' Socialism (1922), was written in order to disprove the feasibility of this Austro-Marxist con cept. 27 This again shows of how important it is to look at all the different Austri an contributions. In the Principles ( op. cit. ), Menger has shown that choices have an intertempo ral dimension where time preference is involved which d iffers between individuals, and in particular between groups of people. He considered a low subjective discount rate of persons as conducive to the cultural development of a nation. Menger's idea of individual choices is now part of mainstream econom ics; more precisely, it is the basis of the theory of opportunity costs. 28 Modern health economics is based on human capital theory in which the subjective rate of inte rest is the pivotal variable. 29 25 This is why the Marxist government of Vienna in th e early Twenties excelled in architecture trying to change the objective living conditions of the working public. For instance, a single building complex, the street sight of which extends over one entire kilometer. Compare Mark E. Blum. 1985. The Austro-Marxists 1890- 1918. A Psychobiographical Study .

Cost and Choice . Chicago: Markham. 29 The old health economics is essentially the instit utional business economics of the nationalized British Health Care System. The hu man capital model, which is the basis of modern health economics, was developed by Gary S. Becker in 1964. After all, Becker is not an Austrian economis t. The unit of analysis is the family and the goal pursued is joint maximization o f utility. 1975 (2). Human Capital . New York: Columbia University Press. On the basis of his work, Victor 165 B\u00f6hm-Bawerk's original concept of capital as `waiti ng', that is abstaining from immediate satisfaction of needs and postponing cons umption to achieve higher satisfaction at a later date, has turned out to be applicable in analyzing the lifestyle choices people make. Such choices can be interprete d as a type of waiting (giving up immediate satisfaction) with the goal to have a ret urn on that investment in the form of a better health later on in life and avoidance of p remature death. This issue will be discussed more closely in section 7.3. 7.3 The Role of the Subjective Discount Rate in M odern Health Economics Choices of lifestyle often involve a comparison bet ween the benefits of current consumption and possible negative health effects in the future. The adverse health consequences of a particular behavior do not afflic t individuals with absolute certainty. Smokers are affected by a certain statistical chanc e of suffering various smoking- related diseases. As a negative externality, smokin g might affect nonsmokers also with a certain statistical chance suffering from second- hand smoke. 30 People, who overeat or drink too much, face a similar dilemma. Skinny p eople have a lower lifetime risk of negative health effects and can expect to live long er than people who are overeating. Excess drinking is associated with a higher risk fo r accidents, personal deterioration, neglect of family responsibilities, and early death . Is giving up smoking, loosing extra weight and keeping it off, or stop drinking excessi vely worth the present effort and forgone pleasure of current consumption for an unce rtain future health gain? The picture is a more broad one and also concerns b asic values. 31 Pertinent to the area of lifestyle choices are industrial and legal issues, and policies related to public health. 32 People are faced with multiple, conflicting, and o ften irreconcilable choices, when they make their lifestyle choices. The choice concerning obesity, smoking and alcohol (ab)use does not exhaust the set of lifesty le alternatives. People pick from a larger set, including behavior associated with obst ructive stupidity, cruelty, extreme materialism, drug abuse (coke, heroine, crack), and other conditions such as driving tractors, lorries, certain sports that require cons tant painkillers, or workaholic behavior, to name but a few examples. Individual time and ris k preferences are important for a R. Fuchs has done empirical work. See, for instance , 1982. \"Time Preference and Health: An Exploratory Study.\" In: Fuchs, Victo r R. (ed.) Economic Aspects of Health . Chicago and London. The University of Chicago Pre ss, pp. 93-120. 30 Walter Adams, James Brock. 1999. The Tobacco Wars . Cincinnati, Ohio: South- Western College Publishing, p. 54. 31 For instance, the Cameralists considered the lack of chastity as a reason for the spread of diseases and tried to promote this value. Compare chapter three on Cameralism. 32 Examples are taxes on alcohol and tobacco. An illu stration of far-reaching consequences in the case of tobacco is given by Wal ter Adams and James Brock, 1999, op. cit. 166 person's choice. Some people value a current satisf action much higher than a future satisfaction, and accept the higher risk of sufferi ng from a future lifestyle-related disease. According to Menger, this kind of individu al behavior does not bring about cultural development of a nation. Mainstream economists assume that individuals act r ationally in their choice of lifestyle. Given individual restrictions, they will increase t he consumption of those goods and services that provide them the greatest marginal ut ility relative to the price they must pay. Negative adverse health consequences will rais e the subjective price of that particular activity, and a person will engage in it , if the benefits outweigh the price. The question remains, however, whether a person is free in choosing a certain lifestyle. In the case of addiction, we cannot speak of a rationa l and voluntary individual choice. Yet, even addiction can be shown to be a rational c hoice in the long run. 33 A particular lifestyle is not an individual choice, if it is req uired as necessary behavior in a group. An example is the requirement of a certain professiona l behavior, but we can consider a person's decision to belong to that particular grou p a free and rational choice. Differences in the choice of lifestyle of persons w hich lead to differences in their health status, can be explained in an extended human capit al model. In the basic model, economists explain with reference to differences in investment in human capital differences in earnings among individuals and over the lifetime of a single individual. 34 If the model is extended, a variety of other phenom ena such as lifestyle choices and health effects can be explained as well. A brief de scription of the basic human capital model follows, before we turn to the application at hand, an explanation of individual lifestyle choices in combination with health effect s. The term human capital is used in strict analogy wi th physical capital as an asset, which yields earnings over time rather than immedia tely, the net present value of the life time stream of income. Earnings can be pecunia ry or nonpecuniary. An example is when human capital investments improve the health o f employees, which leads to higher productivity of a company. This can occur di rectly by encouraging a healthy lifestyle or indirectly by providing on-the-job tra ining. As employees become more knowledgeable, they are likely to become more produ ctive and face less stress in their work. 35 The earnings here are partly pecuniary, consisting in lower costs for the company, and partly nonpecuniary, consisting in a h igher level of well-being for the employees. In the basic model, human capital can be created by activities such as formal education or on-the-job training, but also by forming network s with other people. A person investing in human capital cannot engage in other a ctivities at the same time and might 33 Gary S. Becker and Kevin M. Murphy. 1988. \"A Theor y of Rational Addiction,\" 96, Journal of Political Economy , pp. 675-700. 34 Gary S. Becker. 1964; 1975 (2). Human Capital . New York: Columbia University Press. 35 As we have seen above, this case B\u00f6hm-Bawerk had i n mind when presenting his lectures. 167 therefore forgo wage or other benefits. Such opport unity costs are part of the investment in human capital. Direct cost of acquiri ng human capital might consist in accepting a lower wage from an employer, who provid es on-the-job training. If the on- the-job training consists in experience, an employe e will not have to pay for it. 36 An employee will be reluctant to pay for human capital , if it is only applicable in the specific work environment provided by the employer as he can not transfer specific human capital and translate it into a wage advantage when leaving the position. Similarly, the employer will be reluctant to pay for the creation of general human capital, which the employee can take elsewhere, possibly in return for a higher wage. 37 It is an assumption in the basic human capital mode l that people act rationally. Employees incur the costs for the creation of human capital only, if there will be higher earnings in return, and employers are only willing to invest in human capital, if they can expect a higher productivity by employees in the fu ture. In analogy with the investment in physical capital, human capital investments requ ire that there will be a repayment for the investment with interest, and this will be comp ared with the earnings of alternative investments of a similar risk. The higher the inves tment in human capital, the larger must be the present value of the anticipated earnin gs due to that investment or productivity gain. The additional earnings should b e sufficient to cover the initial investment and to compensate for the \"waiting\" that was involved, the interest factor, in order to make the investment worthwhile as compared to alternative projects. Truncation of the time horizon shortens the payback period and causes lower investments in human capital. Truncation of the tim e horizon could consist in proximity to death or retirement, in leaving a family, a comp any, a country, etc. An example is a young or middle-aged person newly infected with HIV , who knows that he has maximally ten more years to live, before his health deteriorates. Posner gathered empirical evidence on HIV infected persons. He has reported that lower investments in human capital can be observed, as well as a high ra te of suicides; even before HIV infected persons develop AIDS. 38 Not all people do cut off investment in human capit al despite approaching an horizon, for instance the authors of an autobiography who tr y to finish their work before they die. It can be astonishing, how much very sick people st ill can accomplish. This fact is usually not discussed in the health economics liter ature, but it can be explained in a human capital context. Posner has explained the phe nomenon that people still invest in human capital despite approaching a horizon such as death, and despite diminished 36 This is different in the case of an apprenticeship , which will lead to a high qualification of the employee. 37 This is also a selection mechanism for employers t o find those people, who have a low discount rate and whom they expect to be more productive than others. 38 Risk preferences have been assumed to be the same. Time and risk preferences are not independent, for instance in th e case of combat troops with high risk components. They are highly educated, but chances to survive combat are very low. 168 health, with post-humous utility. ( Op. cit. , p. 58). If a person is altruistic towards family and friends, he or she might want them to benefit f rom his work; if he or she is more selfishly oriented he might want to install a good reputation for himself, which would also be a family asset. When people are very close to a horizon, human capi tal economists speak of the last- period problem. Then, rewards and punishment as inc entives for good behavior become irrelevant. An example is the drug-addicted HIV infected criminal, who threatens to infect people with AIDS. The period fo r punishment is too short to be a disincentive for his or her behavior. For a religio us person there might not be a last period, as he or she believes in an afterlife, wher e his current behavior will be judged. Human capital, like physical capital, depreciates, for instance by memory loss or through a change in the work environment which typi cally requires new knowledge and skills and reduces the value of the existing erudit ion and experience. (Posner, op. cit. , p. 53. Human capital can also depreciate due to bad health or aging of people. Aging often goes along with somatic and nonsomatic change s leading to a loss of memory, reduced dexterity, a lack of flexibility, and slowe r speed in learning and applying new skills. The question arises whether people will rep lace human capital lost by depreciation. If people would not change physically , they would consider the cost of the new human capital investment and compare the minimu m payback period of this investment with the real payback period. The real p ayback period is the time left to work until they reach a horizon such as retirement or the time when they plan to leave the company. They would not undertake a human capit al investment to replace human capital, if the minimum payback period would be lon ger than the real payback period. If the employer would pay for the human capital invest ment, he would also take the truncated horizon into account. If the assumption i s dropped that people do not change physically, as is the case of diminished health, pe ople might not be able to replace the knowledge lost, or not as easily as they used to, w hich increases the cost of acquiring human capital. They might find it more difficult to apply new knowledge, and perhaps by being confronted with a longer real payback peri od than the minimum payback period, they might decide not to replace losses of human capital due to depreciation, which might lead to net depreciation. If the minimum payback period for some investment i n human capital is twenty years, a person, who expects to be working for only ten more years will only invest those parts of human capital with a high return, or else use th ose parts of human capital, which will have a rate of return of ten years or less. He will thus behave different from someone who expects to be working for another thirty years. If the net depreciation of human capital causes a fall in real earnings, the employe e has fewer incentives to remain employed. This explains the retirement decision und er the assumption that the retirement age is flexible and for the employee to decide. With regard to the formation of human capital to be expected in the future, and focusing on the United States, two developments are identifi ed by Posner, which work in opposite directions. ( Op. cit. , p. 55). The trend of a rising longevity of Americ ans is well established and Americans can be expected to contin ue to live longer, which is partly 169 due to a better medical system and a general rise i n the standard of living. Posner expects that additional healthy years will be added to the prime years, which will enable people to be active longer, before their health wil l diminish. A rise in the amount of human capital investment due to the longer payback period (retirement age is more flexible in the United States than in Europe) can b e expected. At the same time, it can be expected that due to diminished health in old ag e these people eventually will need caretakers, but caretaking generally is a low-skill ed job and will therefore lead to a fall in the investment of human capital. Some caretaking , of course, requires high medical skills, and therefore partly offsets the first effe ct. Human capital is not only formed through formal sch ooling and on-the-job training, but also by personal relationships, which require the i nvestment of time to develop into mutually beneficial relationships. In health econom ics, personal relationships are very important as sick people get help from family, frie nds, or neighbors, etc. Posner investigates the relational human capital formation of elderly persons. He has noted that people who reach old age are not a random draw of the population. His findings are that they have fewer friends than an average yo unger old person; they are typically of better health than average, more intelligent, mo re affluent, and better educated. Empirical studies show that health, age, income and education, are correlated with each other. A possible explanation for these correl ation patterns lies in differences in subjective discount rates among people. Victor Fuchs has explored the interrelationship bet ween time preferences, individual behavior and health states of people. (1982, op. cit. ). He showed that people who have a low discount rate invest more in their long-term health than others. They incur higher costs in the presence for a better health in the fu ture by smoking fewer or no cigarettes, eating less fat food, sticking to a diet, drinking less alcohol, exercising more, etc. Fuchs found that persons with a low subjective discount r ate are typically of better health, belong to higher income classes and are better educ ated than people with a high preference for current consumption. His empirical s tudy is based on Becker's theory of human capital investment ( op. cit. ), and on Grossman's empirical application of this theory to the relationship of health and education.39 Grossman has shown that the effect of schooling on health is statistically sign ificant. It remains significant even after controlling for income and other variables. Additio nal schooling has a further positive effect on health. This seems to be in contrast to t he income variable. The correlation between income and health status is strong at low l evels, but tends to become weaker with a higher income. The association of schooling and health status is so strong that it appears in cross-sectional, as well as longitudinal studies, and in objective measurement of health status, as well as self-repor ted data. (Fuchs, op. cit. , p. 94). When controlling for income, the relation between h ealth and schooling remains strong. In Grossman's interpretation, a person is the more efficient in producing health, that is, in choosing a healthy lifestyle, the better educate d he or she is. Empirical evidence provided by epidemiological studies show the import ance of lifestyle variables as 39 Michael Grossman. 1972. The Demand for Health: a Theoretical and Empirical Investigation . New York: Columbia University Press for the Natio nal Bureau of Economic Research. 170 determinants of health status and mortality. Fuchs has explained different choices of lifestyle as the result of differences in the time preference of individuals who might have a differen t willingness or ability to undertake an investment in human capital. ( Op cit. , p. 95). His empirical study of 1979 is based on a response of 508 men and women aged between 25 and 64. Lifestyle variables used are cigarette smoking, dental visits, exercise, wei ght, and seat belt usage. Health status is reflected by three sets of indicators: fi rst, self-reported health, second, a checklist of symptoms and diagnoses, hospital stays , physicians' visitations and use of drugs, and third, whether the respondent was able t o walk or jog a mile. These measures are correlated among each other. Time pref erence is measured by asking the respondent questions on whether they prefer mon ey now or a higher amount of money in the future. As a result, Fuchs has shown t hat for a measure of \"excellent health\" as dependent variable, the effect for time preference is relatively stronger and the effect for schooling relatively weaker. Fuchs has tested two hypotheses. According to the f irst, time preferences are formed early in life and influence both, investments in ed ucation and investments in long-term health. People with a low subjective discount rate, which implies a relatively high willingness to defer immediate engagements, can be expected to invest in high levels of schooling and to choose more health-enhancing ac tivities than people with a high subjective discount rate, who prefer a minimum of e ducation and a not-so-healthy lifestyle. According to the second hypothesis which is not mutually exclusive with the first one, education affects time preferences. The higher educated a person, the lower becomes his or her subjective discount rate. Fuchs could not empirically distinguish between both hypotheses, but he was able to show th at people with a low subjective discount rate tend to choose a healthier lifestyle and therefore make higher investments in their long-term health than people w ith a high subjective discount rate. Fuchs ( op. cit .) has obtained values on time preference by asking people for interest rates, but a money-related measure might not reflec t people's choices with respect to health-related activities. In 1988, Moore and Viscu si studied time preference of workers, who took a high risk of injury at their jo b, and observed discount rates of 10 to 12%. 40 Fabian has reported the results of a model, where individual health choices are placed in a life-cycle decision-making framework. 41 The model is applied to life- threatening illnesses with long latency periods. Fa bian has suggested to directly measuring health behavior involving intertemporal c hoices. This could be done either by developing alternative life-cycle scenarios and letting people choose a certain scenario, but then the discount rate might remain i mplicit, or by contingent market experiments which would reveal the discount rate.42 The results obtained by Fabian 40 Moore, M. J. and Viscusi, W. K. 1988. \"The Quantit y-adjusted Value of Life.\" eorge, Kenkel, Donald, and Fabian, Robert (Eds.). 1994. Valuing Health for Policy. An Economic Approach . Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press , p. 131. 42 \"One way of doing this would be to derive qualy es timates for several health 171 show that people discount future health problems, a nd that in particular young people heavily discount health problems that are postulate d to occur late in life. An aspect generally not discussed in a human capita l framework is that over a person's life cycle, time preferences can be different. (Pos ner, op. cit. , p. 58). Posner has observed that the elderly are typically more pessim istic and routinized than young people. Due to diminished health they can often onl y choose from a very limited set of alternative activities. As they do not interrupt th e flow of time with as many activities as the young, time seems to pass by faster for them. B ased on this observation, Posner has suggested that the subjective discount rate dec lines over the life cycle. We can expect a higher subjective discount rate for the yo ung, who can choose from a larger set of alternatives to fill their time with, than f or the old. (Posner, op. cit. , pp.70-73). Why do we observe low subjective discount rates amo ng the very old? Under the assumption that the subjective discount rate does n ot change during the life cycle a selection bias argument can be made. Only those peo ple reach old age that have a low subjective discount rate, as they have made more in vestments into their long-term health than people with a high subjective discount rate. There might be an increase in subjective discount rates during the last-period, w hen there is little time left to live, but it depends on the strength of the bequest motive of th e very old, how strong the increase will be. 7.4 Summary and Conclusions Time plays an important role in Austrian economics. Planning ahead in the production process includes acquiring an education. Menger's e xample is that of a physician; it would be too late to acquire the education of a phy sician at the point of time, one is in need of one. In the consumption process, people mig ht make errors with respect to the character or a good of need. The lower the cultural development of a nation, the more likely are imaginary goods and needs such as ineffe ctive medicine or imaginary illnesses. In evaluating future needs, consumers of ten evaluate a short intense present pleasure as higher than their permanent well-being, sometimes even higher than their conditions that explicitly pertain to the present. The second step is to arrange these health states in various plausible life-path scenarios. The sum of the qualys is a quality-adjusted life for each scenario . The implicit discount rate is zero. The next step is to present these scenarios t o respondents with the time dimensions clearly stated. The disability time path s would differ considerably among scenarios. The respondent would compare them with each other and with a base-case scenario in which none of the disa bilities appeared. Respondents would first rank the scenarios accordin g to their preferences. They would then evaluate the scenarios in qualy terms .. . The implicit discount rate would be obtained by comparing the quality-adjusted lives with the life path constructed by adding together the timeless qualys into corresponding life paths.\" (Fabian, op. cit. , p. 132). 172 own life, a behavior Menger considered as wrong. In order to encourage cultural development of a nation, Menger has recommended bui lding up long production processes, in particular by focusing on knowledge a ccumulation. B\u00f6hm-Bawerk focused on the relationship between hum an labor and health, which he saw as a factor contributing to health. He has furt her developed Menger's concept of capital; Menger interpreted human labor as a kind o f capital that could be enhanced by better health. B\u00f6hm-Bawerk's concept of capital as `waiting' can be applied to interpret decisions involving health as investments in the fo rm of abstinence from immediate satisfaction, thus building up health capital to be enjoyed in a later stage of life. If we look further at the different Austrian strand s, we find the Austro-Marxists who built on Menger's theory of individual errors and his psy chological explanation of capital. They have focused on the differences of individual time preferences and developed the concept of Lebenslagen among which a central authority has to choose for its people. 43 Then, lifestyle choices are not a matter of providi ng information to individuals, who subsequently take their own choices, but of the con cept of Lebenslagen . This overruling of individual choices has been criticize d by Ludwig von Mises in his book of 1922, Die Gemeinwirtschaft , op. cit. , on which the Neo-Austrians based their views. Health economics is not fully developed in Austrian economics, but a typical health economic study leading to health policy conclusions could gain from employing the Austrian approach. Health policy conclusions could become more realistic, if health economists would be aware of the differences of ind ividual time preferences. In concluding, we can say on the one hand, that the ch oice theoretic foundation of the Austrian approach provides the concept of opportuni ty cost, which is at the heart of health related policy. On the other hand, applying the Austrian theory of capital and its related theory of production to the sector of healt h policy, for which it was clearly not designed, would lead to fruitful results. This howe ver, is an important result itself. References Adams, Walter, and Brock, James. 1999. The Tobacco Wars .

Gustav von Schmoller and Adolph Wagner Introduction Gustav (von, 1908) Schmoller: His Life and Work In the nineteenth century issues of health and heal th care have been discussed from an economic perspective, especially by the German H istorical School as exemplified by the contributions of Gustav Schmoller (1838 -1917). Schmoller treated health issues as part of the larger Social Question which had arisen when during Germany's industrial revolution farmers and workers had moved from the c ountry to the cities to find employment in the new established and expanding fac tories. A proletarian class formed and dissatisfaction was high. The Social Question was a main concern to Schmoller. He had the idea to insure the major risk s in workers lives. By establishing state institutions of social insurance he wanted to create the basis on which further markets for insurance could develop. Hereby, he con sidered health a central variable which had an influence in his proposals for economi c policy. Schmoller created the scientific basis for the German welfare legislation in the 1880s. To this effect, he organized a professional think tank of his colleagu es, the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik . In this chapter, the focus is on health aspects in Schmolle r's work. Gustav Schmoller was born 1838 in Heilbronn and die d 1917 in Bad Harzburg. 1 He was introduced to the cameral sciences early on by his father, a business administrator of the royal estates of W\u00fcrttemberg, who thus laid the foundations for his later development and interests. 2 Schmoller became familiar with large data sets and the application of statistical methods through his gran dfather, who cultured plants on a large scale in order to study Mendel's law. In his later work, Schmoller systematically applied the statistical-empirical method to the soc ial sciences. Based on empirical material, he arrived at theoretical conclusions. 3 Schmoller studied cameral sciences in T\u00fcbingen and wrote his doctoral dissertation in 1861. Charged by the chief statistician of the King dom of W\u00fcrttemberg and extraordinary professor at T\u00fcbingen, Gustav R\u00fcmelin (1815 - 88), Schmoller built from scratch the industry statistics for W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1864, he received a position at the University of Halle. On the basis of his statistica l industry studies the usual requirement 1 The biographical notes are based on the entry by H orst Betz. 2001 K. B. Saur. Vol. 9, pp. 39, 40. 2 Nicolas Balabkins. 1988.

Schmoller was a co-founder of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik in 1872 and took leadership for a long time. It was the expressed goal of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik to establish a research program that was not only theoretically or iented, but also applicable to social policy. Schmoller wanted to create an institution w here the scientific discussion of social-political issues could take place. 6 By devising policies for encompassing welfare legislation, the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik prepared the ground for Bismarck's welfare legislation in the 1880s. 7 The driving force behind this legislation was Schm oller who by creating a teaching and research program influenced others in adopting his method and subjects which is referred to as Schmoller's pr ogram. In 1872, Schmoller accepted the chair at the newly founded University of Stra\u00dfburg. As the editor of the Acta Borussica he was influential in writing the history of Pruss ia. When he became the editor of the newly founded jour nal Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Gesetzgebung, Verwaltungs- und Volkswirtschaft im Deutschen Reich (Annals of Legislation, Administration and Political Economy) which later b ecame to be known as Schmoller's Jahrbuch , his first article was on the idea of justice in t he economy. 8 In 1882, he 4 Zur Geschichte des pp. 32-64. 6 While it is no longer the expressed goal of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik to make contributions to social policy, it remains committe d to the scientific discussion of policy-relevant issues which was Schmoller's main i and Berlin: Duncker & p. 109. 7 Nicholas W.

Gustav von Schmoller and 180 received a call to Berlin and later was elected Rector Magnificus of the University. Schmoller was honored in many ways. In 1884, he bec ame a member of the Prussian Council of State and in 1887, a member of the Pruss ian Academy of Sciences. He represented the University at the Upper House. In 1 908, he was ennobled in recognition of the merits of his work. Schmoller wrote many smaller works, before he wrote his magnum opus, the Blueprint , which was published in two volumes in 1900 and 1904 and in a second edition in 1923. 9 The Blueprint is the condensation of roughly four decades of lec turing. It is based on his earlier work such as his monograph on the weaver guild of Strassburg, from which emerged the \"pattern of long-term evolut ion of economic and social institutions.\" 10 Schmoller's last larger work, a methodological con tribution on the economy, economics and the economic method, never g ot published. In 1911 Schmoller edited and rewrote this work, but the con tribution was deleted from the new edition of the Handbook of the State Sciences , which was published in the same year. This was due to principle methodological difference s which also explain why a reprint of Schmoller's Blueprint did not appear before 1978. Methodological differe nces between Schmoller and Menger became to be known as the firs t Methodenstreit ,11 and between Schmoller and Max Weber as the second Methodenstreit . Backhaus and Hansen have noted that these discussio ns threatened to question the scientific value of Schmoller's writings and even t hat of his lifework, the creation of the basis of the German social welfare legislation in t he nineteenth century. 12 A fundamental change in methodology occurred when Max Weber's approach was adopted and not Schmoller's. Schmoller applied the empirical-statistical method to social-political questions. In contrast, Max Weber held that prejudices cannot be solved Adolph Wagner Reconsidered .

Jahrhunde rt by Balabkins, 1988, op. cit. , p. 38. 11 Schmoller provided the basic concept for the legis lation of the German income taxation in 1874. The first Methodenstreit had practical consequences for the current income tax legislation in Germany. This is the topic of the dissertation by Reginald Hansen. 1996.

Vol. 31, pp. 307-336, see p. 313. 181 empirically. Hence, according to Weber, the empiric al-statistical method cannot be applied to social political questions. Schmoller's approach also stands in contrast to the current approach of health economics which is expli citly normative in institutional and policy assumptions and in the framing of research q uestions. Despite these methodological differences, Schmoller 's impact was far-reaching. The most succinct assessment of the impact of Schmoller 's approach is given by Laidler who wrote: 13 Bismarck became a close student of this school and seized upon the program of Wagner, Schmoller and others and attempting at one and the same time to strengthen the state, undermine the social democrat ic movement and improve working conditions. The social legislation of the 7 0s and 80s in Germany was the result. 14 Graf Otto von Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen (1815-98) introd uced social welfare legislation and compulsory insurance acts in Germany. 15 Compulsory sickness insurance, of which the worker contributed two thirds and the emp loyer one third of the funds, was passed in 1883; compulsory accident insurance in 18 84. Compulsory old-age insurance of which the employee, employer and gover nment shared the payment was adopted in 1889. The question is pertinent, whether Bismarck's socia l policy influenced Schmoller. An answer is given by Schmoller himself, who noted tha t Bismarck's willpower was his most essential trait and that practical experience meant everything to him, but not theories. 16 In looking back, Schmoller evaluated his work on s ocial insurance as 13 In tracing the impact of Schmoller and Wagner, Pet er R.

Publication forthcoming. 16 In order to answer the question whether Schmoller was influenced by Bismarck, John O'Brien translated four letters written by Sch moller on Bismarck, which were included in Schmoller's Charakterbilder published in 1913. He did not only look at social welfare legislation, but also at oth er issues such as the relationship between capitalists and landowners. The detailed di scussion leads beyond the 182 follows: In my three articles on the workers' question (186 4, Preu\u00dfische Jahrb .), I tried to show myself how the newer social institutions can h ave an effect in raising the standard of living of workers; I focused on the mor al and economic, on the general education of the working class and on the e ducation provided by the unions. In all of my later scientific work I tried to show that in our German states of civil servants a leading role in social policy f alls to monarchy and civil servants. Practical life followed these paths, in p articular through the initiative by Bismarck. 17 In the letters on Bismarck, Schmoller was less favo rable. He wrote that Bismarck \"criticized the workers too much,\" \"was not fair to the growing, legitimate self- confidence of the lower classes,\" and \"always criti cized the civil service.\" (O'Brien, 1987, op. cit. , p. 19). He distinguished Bismarck's views on soci al legislation according to three different time periods. However little practical happened at that time in Sozialpolitik , the fact is clear and confirmed in many ways that Bismarck's views un til 1876 moved nearly in the same direction as the founders of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik , who independently of the government and without any clo ser knowledge of Bismarck's views had written on their banner in 187 2 a vigorous, but moderate program of political social reform based completely on the existing social order... From 1876 onwards, a certain modification of Bisma rck's views on social policy occurred in connection with the economic crisis and the growth of the Social Democrats' agitation ... In 1880, he himself took o ver the Ministry of Commerce and it was obvious that he rebuffed some individual s with whom he had previously dealt, excluded others, and ran the mini stry most vigorously. 18 scope of this paper.

When Bismarck took over the Ministry of Commerce in 1880, a change took place. Finally, Bis marck \"did not become master of the labor movement which he promoted by the general right to vote,\" but \"in times of great reconstruction, such movements and great soci al struggles cannot at any time be definitely and completely lacking\" 19 Schmoller concluded towards the end of his letter that practice and science have to complement and co rrect each other as they cannot be both perfect. Schmoller's contributions to health economics are o ften made in relationship to the Social Question which he wanted to relieve. In the Blueprint , he paid particular attention to health issues in the chapters on work contract a nd work environment and on new social institutions and welfare legislation 20 Schmoller's influence reached beyond his own program. He was influential in policy, not only through the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik and his journal, but he was also supported by Altho ff, the Prussian administrator of science in the Ministry of Culture (compare chapter nine). By both, Schmoller and Althoff, questions of health are always seen in the larger context of the economy. 8.2 Schmoller's Analysis of Health Related Issues: Basing Solutions on Principles of Insurance Schmoller emphasized Christian Freiherr von Wolff's (1679-1754) importance for modern economics. Just like Wolff, he saw the indiv idual as a dependent person, and not as an isolated human being. 21 Schmoller's \"household\" is similar to von Wolff's \"house,\" because both are small economies by themse lves. Schmoller defined \"a household as a smaller or larger union of people wh o belong together and who share certain mental, cultural or legal values, who work for one another or partly with others outside the household.\" 22 The relevance to health economics results from the fact that the members of a household care for one another and that the household is important in the production of health. Individuals can belong to one or more households, but 19 O'Brien, 1987, op. cit. , p. 62. (Translation of a letter written by Schmol ler in St. Blasien, September 16, 1898). 20 See Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., chapter 7 on work contract and work environment (pp. 294 - 367), and chapter 8 on new s ocial institutions and welfare legislation (pp. 367-481). 21 J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, 1997. \"Christian Wolff on Subsidi arity, the Division of Labor, and Social Welfare.\" European Journal of Law and Economics . Kluwer. 4, pp. 129-146. p. 130. 22 The original op. cit ., p. 3. 184 usually, each individual belongs to at least one fa mily as a basic household. Schmoller distinguished between economic and noneco nomic activities that are performed in order to serve the satisfaction of nee ds. He defined those activities that are directed towards a higher goal than production as noneconomic activities. Examples include sports, walking, or care for healt h. There is an economic side to noneconomic activities, if people perform these act ivities in order to earn a living. (Schmoller, Blueprint , I, 1923, op. cit ., p. 3). All economic activities, whether they are paid or unpaid, contribute to economic production. With a rise in culture, Schmoller predicted that a higher part of the economic activi ty would take place in exchange for money. A political economy comes about when enterprises be come separate from family households. Hereby, a leading role is often played by technical development. Schmoller distinguished between static and dynamic aspects of technical development in order to explain social and economic change. 23 In a political economy people share similar customs, common legal rules, a central fina nce system, and a coherent and integrated system of infrastructure. (Schmoller, Blueprint , I, 1923, op. cit ., p. 5). According to Schmoller's view, a state is part of a highly developed political economy and forms the central household to all other househ olds. The relationship between the individual and society as a whole has been subject to discussion. 24 As a general principle, Schmoller propagated not j ust an increase in the wealth of a nation, but also an improvement in the nation's culture. He foresaw the possibility, as did Wagner, of not only economic de velopment, but also cultural improvement including ethical refinement. In this c ontext, improving health also implied improving longevity, but also cultural formation an d civic virtues. Already in his early articles of 1864, Schmoller pr oposed compulsory welfare legislation for workers so that families would not fall into po verty through illness. (1864, Preu\u00dfische Jahrb\u00fccher, op. cit. ). In the second and revised edition of the Grundri\u00df which appeared after Schmoller's death in 1923, he evaluated the experience of roughly twenty years of compulsory welfare legislat ion in Germany. On the basis of compulsory social welfare legislation, Schmoller in tended to stimulate market forces so that a family household could further limit the ris k it is facing through health (and other) 23 Schmoller's evolutionary approach is analyzed by K arl-Heinz Schmidt. 1993. \"\u00d6konomie und Technologie.\" (Economics and von 261-274. 24 This is the topic of the dissertation by Athanasio s Giouras. 1994. .

Frankfurter Abhandlungen Herchen, pp. 70,71. 185 problems by buying insurance and by living on credi t if needed. He looked at illness as a statistical phenomenon which is calculable so tha t health insurance markets could develop. 25 Schmoller stated that illness causes disruptions an d costs to the family household, the more so, the smaller the family income and the more it depends on monetary wage. Coming irregularly and unpredictably, a family is n ot prepared to cover the costs caused by an illness out of its regular budget. Ill ness was in Schmoller's view a main cause of poverty. ( Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 402). As the principle elements of a system of worker insurance he considered the provis ion of health insurance (he looked at the legislation in the time span between 1883 an d 1911), the provision of money income for a woman in childbed (this was already pa rt of the health insurance), insurance in the case of death (which was even olde r than health insurance), accident insurance (introduced in 1885), and invalidity insu rance (also a part of health insurance). Schmoller wrote that social insurance l egislation in Germany also would not be complete without unemployment insurance. ( Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 449). In historical sequence, unemployment insurance legisla tion was not passed until 1927. Subsistence Economy of the Household Schmoller has observed that it is more urgent to ha ve worker insurance in some regions and at certain points in time, and he has f ound at the same time that the need for worker insurance is generally less pressing if a subsistence economy is present. The subsistence economy of the family household for ms a major source of income and gives stability to the household, for instance if t he household is struck by a case of illness. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 401). Schmoller defined illness as an unforeseen interrup tion of the working ability, which could have devastating effects on the production an d income of a family household. The effects of illness on the subsistence economy o f the household would depend on which member of the household would get sick. (Schm oller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 402). In case of illness of the mother, the subs istence economy of the family would suffer by a shortfall in household production resul ting in neglect. This was the worse, if there were small children and no servants helping i n the household. In case of illness of the father, who at that time mostly was the main br eadwinner of the family, the economic basis of the family was threatened by the absence of a major source of 25 In looking at the difference in behavior of groups of people who are entitled by certain rights and other groups of people who are i nsured, Pennings saw the modern importance of Schmoller. Schmoller was in fa vor of the insurance solution.

Schmoller saw the wife's responsibility primarily w ith respect to the family household. He was in favor of female education, as long as it helped her to fulfill her role as a care provider. 26 Since Schmoller argued from the point of view that the household was actually to be seen like a small firm the complexit y of the task of its managers should not be underrated. Herkner built on this view, and, in his inaugural lecture, emphasized the importance for women to study economics. 27 Herkner saw essentially three reasons for women to study economics; first, unders tanding market operations certainly befits the manager of a firm or household ; second, economics had just been established as a teaching subject. Having a degree in the discipline meant having recourse to an outside income should the major brea dwinner prematurely die or fall terminately ill. Third, Herkner, as did Schmoller, saw economics as an inherently emancipatory scholarly discipline. Schmoller was concerned that households based on a small subsistence economy would offer resistance to the introduction of compu lsory social welfare services, or, if a compulsory health insurance was already in place, t hen he feared that those households might stop investing or saving and there fore become more vulnerable again. If a household with a small subsistence econ omy has to pay compulsory health insurance, then it faces in its budget decision the following alternatives: spend the money available, invest the money in the subsistenc e economy, or put it in a bank savings account. Schmoller thought that it might be likely for such a household to decide against investing in the subsistence economy and against putting the money in a bank savings account. The empirical evidence sugg ested that the German worker insurance system, an overwhelmingly compulsory syst em, coexisted next to a strong Savings and Loan Sector. On the ground of empirical facts he concluded that his concern was not justified. 28 Even if a compulsory health insurance was in place , households with a subsistence economy tended to con tinue to invest or save. The interdependency of Schmoller's approach can be illustrated in the example of the subsistence economy. His proposals for income tax l egislation and social welfare legislation are not unrelated to each other. The su bsistence economy provides a source of income to the household which Schmoller w anted to include in his concept of income. According to Schmoller, people should pay i ncome tax according to their real 26 Irmintraut Richarz. , House and Household. The Beginning and History of Household Economics).

Vol. XIII, 1899, pp. 227-254. 28 In Germany, Schmoller was looking at empirical evi dence of roughly twenty years. He also included the experience of other cou ntries such as England and France. Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 402. 187 standard of life. 29 This means that beyond monetary income it was impo rtant to include the components of nonmonetary income. In order to e stimate people's real income one had to look, for instance, at the value of living i n a large house and park area, or the value of a garden, as well as extraordinary returns . Schmoller proposed the income tax reform in Saxony that was introduced between 1874 u ntil 1878. (Hansen, 1996, op. cit. , p. 57). Hansen described the reform of the income t axation as the centerpiece of the new institutions of social welfare legislation as i t was directed towards providing stability to households. The Labor Contract Reviewing the development of the economy from a feu dal economy to a modern economy based on monetary exchange, Schmoller obser ved that a deep transformation of the way, work is organized took p lace. Obviously, the lord of manor did not conclude individual labor contracts that co uld specify health related auxiliary services and duties. The whole system of the divisi on of labor was rested in a paramount exchange of a duty's services and fees wh ich were not individualized, but based on immutable conditions such as houses, farms , etc. Industrialization went along with urbanization and the freedom to enter individu al labor contracts. Now, all the prior duties (Nebenpflichten) had to be negotiated separa tely and often could not. Urbanization brought about new health conditions an d notably risks which had neither been embedded in the old system, nor could they be immediately cast into new contractual forms. Here, the labor contract showed a gap between what had traditionally been taken care of in a different sys tem and what now had to be dealt with under different circumstances of habitual relations , customs, religion, the role of law, and technology. As we concentrate on the effects of health, we are mainly interested in Schmoller's treatment of other aspects of the labor contract, b ut the wage level. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 307). Here, Schmoller gave two examples where he illustrated possible health effects. First, he poin ted out the consequences for health of a law, which no longer allowed employees to be paid i n commodities or to receive credit for commodities, and secondly, he described the hea lth consequences of the pieces wage. Schmoller warned of the unintended consequences, wh en Besteuerung,\" (The Doct rine of Income in Relationship to Basic Principles of Taxation), Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die gesamte Staatswissenschaft , 19. a summary and compa rison to Wagner's concept see Reginald Hansen. 1997. \"The Pu re Historical Theory of Taxation.\" Editor: J\u00fcrgen Backhaus.

In the beginning of the nineteenth century it was still customary in Germany to pay wa ges or part of the wage in commodities. This was a remnant of the old direct e xchange and extended family economy which was on the decline. Credit could also be received in the form of commodities which was particularly important in the agricultural sphere. However, widespread defraud had become common; for instance the practice not to pay workers in money, but in chips redeemable only in factory s hops, or to offer expensive and useless goods or goods manufactured by the employer himself instead of paying wage. Complaints about abuse of this wage system le d to legislation prohibiting the wage-in-kind and restricted the possibility to rece ive credit in the form of commodities. The difficulty when putting this legislation into practice is the following. On the one hand, employers are neither allowed to pay wage s in commodities, but only in money, nor are they allowed to provide credit to their workers in the form of commodities. (This concerns either all employers or only those employers, who are in manufacturing.) On the other hand, for pract ical reasons one has to allow employers to provide the workers with housing, heat ing, use of land, regular meals, medicine and medical help, as well as tools and fabrics, at reasonable prices. 30 This shows how Schmoller critically looked at regul ations directed at industry, but also affecting the (barely) developing agriculturally ba sed industrial sector, the development of which he did not want to be suffocated by regula tions extraneous to this sector. The analytical result is achieved by looking at typifie d agents of all the relevant sectors and their concomitant relationships. Not shown in the q uote is the empirical base, on which the conclusion rests. Schmoller not only considered the payment relationship, but also availability of credit. The possibility to receive credit is truly important in an unforeseen emergency or illness, especially when there is no o ther safety net. The second example where Schmoller noted possible h ealth effects was the introduction of the pieces wage. In this example, S chmoller explicitly excluded the wage level from consideration. His empirical indust ry studies showed that the pieces wage tended to increase output tremendously, but th at at the same time a decline in quality would take place and health problems among workers would increase. He concluded that it would not be desirable to introdu ce the pieces wage to all industries and specified the conditions under which the disadv antages of the pieces wage could be overcome by retaining its main advantage, an inc rease in output produced. Schmoller noted that the pieces wage is the wage fo rm of capitalist production 30 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Das S chwierige der Ausf\u00fchrung liegt darin, da\u00df op. cit ., p. 323. 189 characterized by large factories and relative stabi lity of technical and economic development. His goal was to keep the incentives pr ovided by the pieces wage, but to overcome the negative effects with respect to healt h and lower quality of output produced. He suggested a combination of time and pi eces wage, similar to a railway engineer who receives a basic monthly salary and ex tra money per mile driven, or to a professor who is paid his salary and who in additio n receives lecture fees from students. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 326). Schmoller noted that the pieces wage came into exis tence \"where the workers were not part of the house of the master.\" 31 In modern economics such a relationship is typically explained in an Alchian-Demsetz model. 32 In a small group, such as a family or small firm, one group member knows more or less what the other one does. Through this implicit form of monitoring and control, the p roblem of quality control is not prevalent. In addition, the head of household knew that he or she had to care for the workers and was therefore not interested in pressin g them to achieve a maximum of output without consideration of health care costs. The traditional family which included several generations and even the workers and their families who were helping in the household and who provided care to those family mem bers who needed it, resembled a small group as described by Alchian and Demsetz. Schmoller has observed that in a factory setting, w here the pieces wage has been introduced, the employer shows less responsibility for his workers' fate, not only in times of distress, but in general. Too much work, a t too high a speed, sometimes in an unhealthy work environment, is demanded so that wor kers' health is being jeopardized. Vice versa, the workers show less commitment to the ir work and tend to produce goods of lower quality. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 324). He concluded as follows: The most important step has been done, when and wh ere the employers become so far-sighted that they recognize how dange rous and damaging a decreasing standard of living is for the workers; w hen and where the social responsibility of the workers has grown so much, th rough organization, a growing self-awareness, and a better education that they fight deliberately and energetically against the worsening of their living standard. 33 31 Der \"Akkord- cit ., 1923, p. 324. 32 Alchian, Armen A., and Harold Demsetz. 1972. \"Prod uction, Information Costs, and Economic Organization.\" American Economic Review , 62, no. 5: 777-95. 33 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Das W ichtigste is Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 353. 190 Here lie the historical roots of the German system of Worker Co-Determination. The idea behind is that workers, who have a possibility to express their interests, will be more loyal to the company in the long run. They wil l make personal investments with a longer time span, and also expect their employment relationship with the company to be stable. In general, they will have an interest i n maintaining a high quality of output in order to secure their own position. They will have an interest in a healthy work environment. Measures of Poor Relief Schmoller showed that injury and sickness were the two major reasons for poverty. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 380). Therefore, measures of poor relief had to concentrate on the control of injury and sicknes s among the poor which was either possible by institutionalized care or by care at ho me. Schmoller described the English experience of poor relief, where needy people from all kinds of groups, the sick, the elderly, beggars, et c., had been brought together in a single workhouse. This experience he evaluated as v ery costly as different incentives for the people of each group are required to bring them back into a regular working life. The data show that quite different types of poor h ave to be distinguished. Their needs differ and hence, the kind of help to be prov ided has to be suitable to the needs of each group. Here, the most important diffe rence [to hospitalization, my add., U. B.] is that certain types of poor are supp orted best by leaving them in their family household and subsistence economy, and supporting them by relieving their work at home through goods and serv ices needed, (for instance those people who are only temporarily in need; or t hose, who are only slightly sick; or widows with children, who still earn some money). Others (for instance, the seriously ill, the insane, the blind, and the e lderly, who have no family) should be hospitalized in special institutions adap ted for the purpose at hand. 34 Providing relief at home can be the cheaper alterna tive as compared to institutionalized 34 The original , II, 1923, op. cit .,p. 381. 191 care. Care at home kept the relations to family, em ployers, church, and other associations intact, and the obligation of those gr oups to provide for their members. Schmoller thought that the existence of a subsisten ce economy kept people from easily falling into poverty. Hence, his plea for help with the subsistence economy in case of sickness. Bringing people into institutions as opposed to sup porting them at home requires an administration and appropriate buildings. While it is more expensive than care at home, it breaks up family and other relationships of the institutionalized offering an environment that might be more appropriate for some persons belonging to specific groups. For instance, forced reeducation can only t ake place in an institutional environment. Schmoller rejected the idea of forced reeducation of the poor, because it hurts individual freedom. He thought that radical s ocialists, who propagated the idea of forced reeducation, were too optimistic about the s uccess of forced reeducation as a measure of poor relief. 35 In his view \"the discussion between open and close d care, family and institutional care is ... at the same ti me a discussion about the large principles of organization of the economy.\" 36 His goal was to provide help which at the same time educated and raised the individual to a h igher cultural level while keeping individual freedom intact. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit .,p. 374). After listing several arguments against hospitaliza tion, including a bad reputation of institutionalized care due to high costs and abuse, an observation, Schmoller based on the time span between 1500 and 1700, he argued that \"only in large institutions it is possible to introduce all kinds of technical advanc es in treatment of illnesses, but also in heating, lighting, food preparation, as well as in teaching and hygiene...\" 37 Due to the implementation of such technical inventions properl y executed institutional care might be the better alternative, but it is more expensive than open care. Hence, only selected categories of the poor should be admitted to larger , well administered institutions. Schmoller was aware of the danger of infection and gave childbirth as an example, where hospitalization is not recommended. 38 \"Hospitalization of all pregnant poor 35 According to Schmoller, radical socialists had a p reference for institutionalized care, because it allowed forced reeducation. Schmol ler, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit .,p. 381. 36 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Das p , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 381. 37 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Einma , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 385. 38 In the Netherlands, childbirth at home is common. Dutch midwives are responsible for regular check-ups of healthy pregna nt women and assist with giving birth at home. For the first week or so, nur ses check on mother and baby 192 women is entirely wrong; it is much better to help them with home nurses in their family economy; only those women, who face special complic ations with childbirth, should be admitted to hospitals.\" 39 Schmoller propagated institutionalization as a meas ure of poor relief only in specific cases. He argued that support and care at home are both, less costly and more efficient; only if that was not possible, or if spe cific technical procedures were required hospitalization should take place. Social Welfare Legislation In the process of the transition to an industrial s ociety, the wage sometimes fell under the level of what was needed to live on. 40 This was one reason for the introduction of basic welfare institutions including compulsory sta te health insurance. The newer worker insurance system which first deve loped in the hands of free cooperatives, then under compulsory state cooperati ves, resulted from the imperfection of the entire older poor relief system , and from the low wage level; it presents itself as an improved effort to provide a substitute income for the sick, invalid, old, or unemployed workers who cannot earn a wage due to an accident or a natural handicap. 41 Schmoller was in favor of basic social welfare legi slation on a case-by-case basis, but he was not an advocate of an all encompassing welfa re state. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, pp. 349, 350). In reviewing the discussion of the right of existence, the right of labor, and the right to the full value product of l abor, Schmoller clarified his own at home and there is also help in the household. Pr enatal mortality in the Netherlands is lower than in Germany and the United States, where hospitalization is the rule. Thus, childbirth at ho me is to be preferred. 39 The original German quote reads as II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 386. 40 Only extreme liberals declared any public help to the poor as wrong. Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 344. 41 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Das n euere Arbeiterversicherungswesen, op. cit ., p. 344. 193 position. With respect to the right of existence he wrote: The essence of the matter is that this so-called r ight of existence as a general vague idea gets only meaning and justification in t he limited efforts to shape concrete help for certain cases, in which the moder n money wage system fails. 42 Schmoller saw social status as a potential objectiv e of social policy. He did not take the social stratification he found in the rapidly indus trializing empire as given. Since the process was in motion, it could also be influenced by such forms of social policy (legislation) which by creating new life chances wo uld have wealth effects for the lower income groups without redistribution. Thus he thought to defuse class st ruggle postulated and intended by Marx and Engels, with th e effective agitator in the person of Ferdinand Lassalle. As a more narrow right than the right of existence Schmoller described the right of labor. Schmoller rejected a right of labor, because it restricts market forces too much. He noted that Bismarck adopted the right of labor f rom the General Prussian Common Law. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit., p. 344). Between 1881 and 188 9 Bismarck introduced a social welfare system and compulsory i nsurance acts in Germany. Unemployment insurance legislation, however, was no t passed until 1927. With social welfare legislation, Bismarck intended \"... to reco ncile the majority of the workers with the existing order of the state. This will lead to harmony between the interests of the workers and those of the employers.\" 43 Bismarck considered it as a duty of the state to provide employment possibilities, if able workers c ould not find work; he wanted to protect people in case of illness and accidents, an d to provide for old age. Give the workingman work as long as he is healthy, \" he said, \"assure him care when he is sick, insure him maintenance when he is old .... Is it not established in our social relationships that the man who comes before his fellow-citizens and says, `I am healthy, I desire to work, but can find no work,' is entitled to say also, `Give me work,' and that the state is bound to give him work?\" Germany, and particularly Prussia, now embarked extensively upon a policy of governmental 42 The complete quote reads as follows: \"Das Wesentli che Schmoller referred to the right of labor as a more narrow rig ht than the right of existence.

(Van Meerhaeghe. Draft 3-6-02, op. cit ., p. 2). With the introduction of social welfare legislation he wanted to gain support for t he Conservatives, and weaken the position of the Socialists. It is sometimes suggest ed that Bismarck bought off the working class by offering the social state. If the bribe was convincing, and the support forthcoming, one should not take issue with distrac ters who describe the policies as a bribe. 45 The facts speak for themselves with high immigrati on of workers, high fertility in working class families and dramatically rising inco me and health levels. 46 More interesting is the question of who influenced Bismarck to introduce these complex policies. Social historians have not succeeded in s howing a direct link between Schmoller's activities, the research work of the Ge rman Economic Association (Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik), the legislative proposals and t he legislation ultimately adopted. 47 But as in the case of the German Civil Code, 48 once a piece of legislation is in place, the implementation is controlled by the commentary lite rature as von Gierke to this very 44 Compare the entry on \"Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen, Karl O tto Eduard Leopold, Prince (1815-98)\" in The New International Encyclopedia , New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 2nd. ed., Vol. III, 1923, p. 336.

Another exa mple is the contribution by Eckart Reidegeld, who reported that Schmoller himse lf stated that reforms towards compulsory social insurance were well under way, before Bismarck put them in practice. \"Sch\u00f6pfermythen des Wilhelminismu s: Kaiser und Kanzler an der \"Wiege des deutschen Sozialstaates.\" (Myths of Creation of the New York: Cam pus, pp. 261-279, in particular p. 270. 48 J\u00fcrgen Backhaus.

Volume 7, Nr. 1. 195 day determines the way the German Civil Code is bei ng applied. 49 It was Schmoller who set out a theoretically coherent framework whic h could be taught and allowed to understand the complex interdependencies between th e different new social institutions. 50 Schmoller himself thought that the Verein f\u00fcr Sozialpolitik had found the right bridge between socialism and liberalism and through its pu blications contributed to the solution of the social question . Their historical research showed that the cultura l and economic rise of the lower classes was higher under strong monarchies than under weak and oppressing governments. A monarchy with an enlightened civil service should be given the leading role in order to lay th e political ground works for building up the necessary social institutions. Schmoller noted that the scientific work of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik on social and economic matters influenced German p olicy, in particular Bismarck's proposals, and that it shaped the charac ter of the German state sciences between 1860 and 1914. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit. , p. 349). Insurance and Credit In the eighth chapter of the Blueprint , Schmoller analyzed the major social institutions, in particular with respect to a reduction of povert y and improvement of the health status of the lower classes. He showed that in the lower c lasses, illness leading to unemployment is a main reason of poverty. A system of insurance and credit is desired that allows for social upward mobility of workers a nd that protects them from falling into poverty in the case of illness. A look at the historical development of welfare leg islation shows how Schmoller arrived at his theoretical position. He described that in s tages of primitive culture, children born unwanted and old people were killed and the dying s ick left behind on the trails. When family-like groups and patriarchal family structure s developed, he noted that \"help in sickness and need was provided only within the fami lies and small family-like groups and mostly the price was submission to the patriarc hal structures.\" 51 The communities became larger due to an increase in mobility and gr owth of population, and the smaller units dissolved. With the introduction of money wag e, the security provided in an 49 J\u00fcrgen G. Backhaus. 1999. \"Otto von Gierke (1841-1 New Social Institutions), pp. 367-481. 51 The original German quote reads as nicht 1923, op. cit ., p. 374. 196 exchange economy cease to exist. The larger politic al units developing, the states did not have the means to take care of their members, a nd the phenomenon of poverty of the masses arose. Schmoller saw the explanation for mass poverty in the technical and organizational development of institutions which wa s lagging behind the other movements. There have been exceptions of states and larger pol itical units trying to provide help at least to some groups of needy people. Schmoller des cribed several such efforts, among them the welfare scheme of the so-called full citizens of Athens who received benefits; or the early welfare system by the Jews, who engaged in charities. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 375). The Christians took over the Jewish system. Schmoller described the early examples as r esponsible approaches to poor relief taking place on a case by case basis, but af ter the Christian religion became the religion of the states, he criticized that \"... the way they gave care to the poor was already in the Roman Empire such, that it almost mo re promoted than alleviated poverty.\" 52 Bishops and clerics did not require individual pro ofs of need, but uncritically entered names to clerical lists of the poor. In the process, large foundations, hospitals, and other social institutions were founded to serve their needs. This came to an end during the thirteenth and fourteenth century, when the number of beggars and wandering unemployed increased drastically. When th e church refrained from poor relief, public welfare took its place. In the begin ning, their efforts were often not better than those of the church, but Schmoller noted that there were some exceptions; for instance the well documented poor relief measures t aken by the city of Augsburg between 1459 and 1512. In concluding the historical overview and on the basis of what he saw as an efficient solution, Schmoller formulat ed his own theoretical position. Not without mentioning that eventually the market w ill provide a better solution through development of the insurance system, Schmoller prop osed to put welfare legislation in the hands of the local communities, where well-able and prominent civil servants should take care of the poor according to clear pri nciples of administration. 53 Only those public or small public units (communities) sh ould be responsible for social legislation which have also the right to raise taxe s as they have the information required to make just decisions. \"Only their poor r elief distributes the burden evenly and fair among all citizens; especially among those wit h higher incomes; only this kind of 52 Die op. cit . p. 375. 53 Schmoller notion of bureaucratic behavior was diff erent from the one we have today. When Schmoller referred to the civil service , he did not think of a bureaucratic organization. An example of the Spanis h health care system, which suffers from failure of bureaucracy, is given in th e contribution by Benito Arru\u00f1ada. 1997. \"Designing Markets versus Bureaucra cy in the Reform of the Spanish National Health System.\" Essays on Social Security and Taxation. Gustav von Schmoller and Adolph Wagner Reconsidered . Backhaus, J\u00fcrgen. Editor. Marburg: Metropolis, pp. 429-444. 197 care reaches all the poor.\" 54 Poor relief should be entrusted to local community governments, because they can better control the poor than state governments. The y have the informational basis to judge if help is no longer required and accordingly can cease to provide public support. Schmoller warned that this kind of direct control w ould get lost if public poor relief would be administered at the national level. Public poor relief [at the national level, my add. , U. B.] would be much more of a communist rule than local community poor relief. Ev ery one of the poor would try to get as much as possible from the common pot with out giving something in return and the sense of responsibility that the loc al community organs possess, would get lost. 55 Not only national public administration leads to a lack of control and invites exploitation of the poor relief system, but also if there are ma ny different, uncoordinated sources of help. Schmoller referred to the experience of the N etherlands and showed how the system of many different charities kept people into poverty. 56 Instead of trying to earn a living by working, the poor exploit the different s ources of support. There are complaints from the Netherlands that in every town there are four to six different organizations, foundations, associati ons, etc. that provide help entirely independent from each other. The larger th e means of private persons, associations, foundations are, the worse will be th e effects of such splintering. 57 Schmoller concluded that only excellent personnel w ith clear instructions and 54 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Nur i hre Armen.\" Schmoller, Blueprint II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 382. For Schmoller's notion of social justice in relation to the income tax, see Hansen, 1997, op. cit. 55 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Und e s hat nicht an II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 385. 56 Some reminiscent are still present as documented b y J.G.A. van Mierlo.

On the one hand, not too much help should be provided, because this would be an incentive for begging and it could lead to the formation of a pro letarian class. On the other hand, not an insufficient amount should be given, so that peo ple will be able to overcome their problem of poverty. Ultimately, the poverty administration of the commu nities should be abolished as it is only a transitory solution. Schmoller favored and e xpected that (in line with his active political involvement) a market solution would evol ve. The last goal must be to advance the less fortunat e classes of society through savings banks, cooperatives, associations for mutua l support, and an insurance system that they no longer will need help from the poor relief administration. 58 A system of insurance and savings accounts can reli eve poverty, and in particular sudden poverty due to illness. \"Similar to the poor relief administration we deal with social institutions, but they are better tied to in dividual and social interests...\" than the former. 59 Between 1840 and 1900 \"the existing mutual support systems of the lower and middle classes providing support in case of ill ness and death ... developed into a great worker insurance.\" 60 In contrast, if the insurance was in the hands of large business companies, Schmoller noted that ... only to a modest degree the companies succeede d with the insurance of life annuities; they have been unsuccessful with orphans -, widows- and the sick insurance, although they made many efforts. To find mathematically secure bases and to organize a business which is commercia lly safe seems to be too difficult in these cases. 61 58 The original German quote reads as , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 389. 59 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Es ha ndelt sich und .\" Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 390. 60 The original German quote reads as follows: \"...di e op. cit ., p. 392. 61 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Die V ersicherung von Renten ist den cit ., p. 397. 199 Schmoller explained why small local cooperatives pr oviding mutual support perform much better than joint stock companies. Smaller, more local insurance associations have th e advantage that they can work with the most simple and inexpensive organizat ion; they can rely on physicians' knowledge of persons and cases; they ar e based on the sympathetic feelings of neighbors, friends, professional peers, just like the old guilds. Up to now, the health insurance system has not prospered in any other way; it was always a failure in the hands of joint stock compan ies organized according to business principles. 62 Schmoller observed that traditionally employers als o had to play their role in providing social security to their workers. Employers had to share in the health care costs of employees. This developed from a company-based work er insurance, where health insurance costs were part of the production costs. In this respect Schmoller saw Bismarck's legislation more an evolution than a rev olution. ... according to an old social principle the emplo yer, landowner, ship-owner, or mine-owner had to share in supporting their people when they were old and sick or in need. Today, in a time of large industries an d under current insurance laws, this obligation has turned into contributions of employers to employee insurance funds required by public law, or even in the obligation of employers to carry the costs of particular damages (accidents), which are part of the production costs. 63 Companies' payments for health insurance mean inves tment in human capital. Schmoller observed: \"...soon grew the insight [on t he side of the employers, my add.] that foundation and support of these funds is a mea ns of power, even a good capital 62 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Klein ere, 1923, op. cit ., p. 389. 63 The original German quote reads as follows: \"...; es war cit ., p. 401. 200 investment.\" 64 Not only are the employees more healthy, but emplo yers, who make contributions to employees unemployment insurance, can expect more loyalty from their employees. In paragraph 221 on how the German unemployment ins urance originated, Schmoller stated that \"millions are insured, who would not be covered without compulsion and if the compulsory funds would not exist.\" 65 Insurance laws and state control prevent wide-scale fraud and abuse. A widespread form of a different type of abuse is according to Schmoller \"... the tendency to get as much out of the funds as possible.\" 66 Larger funds can work more efficiently: they are te chnically better administrated, can afford to pay better qualified board members, are b etter experts in control of the ill, and their overhead costs are relatively lower: \"The sma ller the funds, the larger the expenses.\" 67 While Schmoller observed a trend towards larger he alth insurance funds, he noted their specific disadvantages, \"... the oth er side is here the more pronounced, that is the difficulty to let the members have not only an interest in the benefits of the insurance fund, but also in the fund itself, its ad ministration and prosperity.\" 68 8.3 The Translation of Schmoller's Approach into a Research Program Schmoller, who has so far been discussed as a socia l scientist, was also an organizer of research in his activity as founder and publishe r of what came to be known as his journal ( Schmoller's Jahrbuch ), various book series, and, most importantly, by organizing the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik .69 This was a most unusual experiment in itself, 64 The original German quote reads as follows: \"...ba ld wuchs auch II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 407. 65 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Milli onen sind S chmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 419. 66 In German, Schmoller referred to this type of abus e as II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 419. 67 In the original German, this reads: kleiner , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 419. 68 In the original German quote this reads: \"...die K cit ., p. 419. 69 \"On July 13, 1872, a number of leading German acad emic economists of the day - Adolph Wagner, Wilhelm Roscher, Johannes Conr ad, Ernst Engel, Georg Fr.

Organizing the diverse, stubborn, and often lonely professors of economics into coherent research efforts, in eac h case devoted to applied questions and moreover in each case to politically acute and practically relevant applied questions was a feat we cannot document in any othe r Western country at the time. More astonishingly, Schmoller pulled this off for a lmost fifty years and his successor, Heinrich Herkner, for another decade. One of the focuses of this research effort into soc ial policy was health economics.

The table given above lists these health related public ations of the German Economic Association ( Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik ) over the period from 1872 until 1935. Health related topics cease to be discussed approximately with Schmoller's death (1917). It would take more than fifty years before the topic w ould reemerge in economic publications as a major issue. 8.4 Summary and Conclusions In this chapter, we focused on Schmoller's thought relevant to health economics. Schmoller saw illness as the main factor leading to poverty. Coming irregularly and unpredictably, illness would disrupt the family hou sehold just like a war would disrupt the household of the state. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 402). Schmoller saw health issues in the context of the Social Question , which he wanted to relieve. In this chapter, a more narrow view was taken by looki ng at his economic analysis of issues affecting directly and indirectly the health states of people. From this perspective, Schmoller's discussion of the evolutio n of institutions mitigating economic insecurity and poor relief are among the relevant t hemes. This is the background for his own theoretical position. Schmoller wanted to insur e the major risks in workers lives. By establishing state institutions of compulsory socia l insurance he wanted to create the basis on which further markets for insurance could develop. The purpose of this and other insurance schemes proposed is to prevent unfo reseen interruptions of the household economy in order to enhance rational econ omic calculation. Schmoller was the editor of the leading economics j ournal in Germany at the time. As 204 the name of the Journal indicates, Annals of Legisl ation, Administration and Political Economy it was about social policy reforms in their broa der sense. Health issues have also been discussed in the research wor k of the German Economic Association ( Schriften des Vereins f\u00fcr Socialpolitik ), which has been set up and coordinated by Schmoller, and finally in the Acta Borussica . Schmoller's manifold activities and projects are sometimes referred to a s Schmoller's program. By specifically training students for publication of t heir work and by suggesting topics for research, he inspired others to perform research al ong the same line. The notion of social justice is what Schmoller shared with the pe ople participating in his program. \"At the core of Schmoller's program stood his sense of social justice. This was the motivation to contribute scientifically, with the h elp of the \"historic-ethical\" method, to the solution of the Social Question .\" 71 Hansen has shown the influence of this notion of social justice on the reform of the income tax legi slation as suggested by Schmoller. In understanding the interdependency of Schmoller's ap proach, Hansen interpreted the reform of the income tax legislation as an integral part of social welfare legislation. Both types of legislation are directed towards reaching a higher cultural formation and civic virtues. Risk limitation of the household is central to Schm oller, who focused on the household as the basic unit in the economy. 72 He observed that the household was threatened in its functioning by major risks. By establishing sta te institutions of social insurance he wanted to create the basis on which further markets for insurance could develop so that individual households could further decide on risk limitation, for instance by buying additional insurance coverage or by taking out cred it. Schmoller only wanted to provide the most basic social welfare institutions, as he w as in favor of market based solutions. His goal was that risk limitation would occur throu gh various forms of insurance and credit possibilities to be offered by the market. In the context of poor relief, he repeatedly discus sed health aspects. In finding the right measures for poor relief, he found it necessary to distinguish between different groups of the poor. Schmoller has observed that any kind o f subsistence economy makes it very unlikely that people would fall into poverty t hrough an unforeseen event such as illness. (Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 378). Hence, as a measure of relief he proposed a combination of an open and a closed syst em of state poverty care. Care at home leaves the individual relationships to family and employers, churches, associations, and guilds intact, as well as the obl igation to take care of their members. Only the most basic public poor relief was to be pr ovided. If care at a hospital was inevitable, for instance because better medical tre atment was required, then one 71 In the German quote this reads: \"Kernpunkt von , p. 39. 72 See Schmoller, Blueprint , II, 1923, op. cit ., in particular chapter 7 on work contract and work environment (pp. 294 - 367), and chapter 8 on new social institutions and welfare legislation (pp. 367-481). 205 should be aware of a patient's individual freedom. In an historical overview, Schmoller showed that pr ivate initiatives of the church, religious orders, and wealthy citizens, individuall y or participatory in charities, have been one of the ways through which poor relief has been provided. He showed that poor relief can only be provided efficiently if the re is a proof of need and if it is given on a case-by-case basis. If there are too many sources of help and private initiative remains uncoordinated, then this gives rise to abus e, even leading to an increase in the number of the poor. Therefore, there must be incent ives to leave the poor relief system again. In Schmoller's time, the help provided by pr ivate charities, churches, and other initiatives was not sufficient. Therefore, he was i n favor of basic social welfare legislation provided by the state. He followed the tradition of Wolff when he advised \"... for Germany ... the initiative to social reform sho uld better lie in the hands of a far- sighted monarchy with a healthy, first rate civil s ervice ...\" 73 Only first rate bureaucrats could perform a case-by-case proof and set incentiv es for recipients to leave the social welfare system, if help was no longer needed. Schmoller has noted that the possibility to receive credit is important in an unforeseen emergency or illness, especially when there is no o ther safety net. Some modern proposals for a market-oriented health care reform center on the possibility to receive inexpensive credits. 74 He discussed how such social and economic mechanism s for risk limitation had evolved in the past. Among the evolving institution s were associations for mutual support which offered their members support in exch ange for their contributions, but in a time of increasing industrialization, these assoc iations were no longer sufficient. Schmoller was in favor of national compulsory socia l insurance, but he advised against large joint-stock corporations as providers of heal th insurance. He rather wanted smaller entities, for instance at the work level, t o provide basic health insurance. 75 73 In the original German quote this reads: \"Daher wi II, 1923, op. cit ., p. 367. 74 Compare, e. g . the concepts developed by John C.

Washington, DC: Cato Institute. 75 Individuals are willing to take higher risks, if t hey are insured for the consequences. This phenomenon, which today is refer red to as moral hazard , can be restricted by control of the insured individ uals. One way of control is to choose a small-scale insurance in an organization, where the person is known. Schmoller obviously had this in mind when he recomm ended small-scale insurance organizations. Another way to restrict mo ral hazard is by setting the appropriate incentives. Insurances experiment with insurance schemes containing own contributions and rewards for leadin g a healthy life as incentives to contain moral hazard. Willard G.

This chapter has been written on the basis of my pu blication \"Non Market Exchange in Healthcare: Lessons from Karl B\u00fccher\" in the volume on Karl B\u00fccher: Theory - History - Anthropology - Non Market Economics . Editor: J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, 2000, Marburg: Metropolis, pp. 337-362. The Life and Work of Karl B\u00fcch er (1847 - 1930) Karl B\u00fccher, a historically working economic theore tician, has emphasized economic exchange before the advent of markets. In contrast to the classical economists, of whom he was critical for focusing on market exchang e processes, B\u00fccher has considered mainly that part of economic behavior wh ich constitutes exchange without a market. As he has noted, nonmarket economic behavio r accounted for a large part of the economy in its earlier stage of development. Hi s illustration of nonmarket behavior includes such phenomena as the gift relationship, b orrowing and lending of goods and services, and labor provided in exchange for future help. These kinds of nonmarket exchange are characterized by a give-and-take relat ionship and should therefore be distinguished from actions born out of altruism. In line with von Th\u00fcnen's and Gossen's work, B\u00fccher held that nonmarket economic behavior is grounded in the principle of marginal utility. His observations and interpretati on of nonmarket exchange are included in this book because of the relevance of n onmarket arrangements in health care. The issue of nonmarket exchange in health car e has become all the more important with the gradual collectivization of this sector. 1 B\u00fccher's name is neither an entry in The Encyclopedia Britannica of 1997, nor in The Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die of 1966, but he is included in the Brockhaus Konversations- Lexikon of 1892, which was published during his lifetime, as well as in the New Palgrave and in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences . B\u00fccher studied history, political science, and classical philology in Bonn and G\u00f6ttingen, worked several years for the Frankfurter Zeitung and held chairs in Dorpat, Basel and Leipzig. 2 He was familiar with the English, French and German litera ture in economics of his time. 3 Besides his major works Development of the Economy , Contributions to Economic History and Work and Rhythm he published various monographs on labor condition s, the position of women, tax regulations, bookbinders , organizations of the handicrafts such as guilds and other forms in German towns of t he Middle and High Middle Ages. 4 During his lifetime, he gave lectures at meetings o f local organizations of industry and 1 A particular outgrowth of this literature is the w ork of the Tidmus School at York University. 2 Karl Polanyi. 1968. \"B\u00fccher, Karl.\" International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , pp. 163-165. 3 See for instance the catalogue of his library at t he University of Kyoto: Katalog der Karl B\u00fccher B\u00fccher. 1922.

The first edition was published in 189 6 in Abhandlungen der K\u00f6niglich S\u00e4chsischen Akademie der Wissenschaften , vol. 17, no. 5. Leipzig: S. Hirzel. The work was continually revised, the sixth edition was published in 1924, Leipzig: Reinicke. 213 handicraft upon invitation, and was frequently aske d to write expert opinions. On the basis of his work, many doctoral theses have been w ritten. 5 In Development of the Economy ( op. cit. ) and Contributions to Economic History ( op. cit. ) he showed the transition from a primitive society with no market exchange to a higher developed society in an exchange economy. In antiquity with production mainly taking place in the household (\"oikos\") there was a lmost no market exchange. To some extent, market exchange took place in the town econ omy of the Middle ages, but production had still very much the purpose to creat e an object of value for own use. Out of the earlier stages, the market economy (\"Verkehr swirtschaft\") developed which in comparison to earlier forms has the highest degree of market exchange. While B\u00fccher has focused on nonmarket forms of exchange before t he advent of markets, he has also shown that in the market economy next to the m arket other forms of exchange exist which are based on nonmarket transactions. Work and Rhythm ( op. cit. ) was very popular at the time B\u00fccher wrote. As he has noted in the preface to the fourth edition, he hit upon t he subject of music, songs and poetry of laborers when working on older forms of labor co operation. (1909. Leipzig and Berlin: Teubner). He has observed that music would enhance the productivity of people, and even makes animals work harder. In the book, he questioned why there is a division between play, sports, and movement for h ealth-related reasons on the one hand and work, typically seen as a burden, on the o ther. A person from a primitive culture does not make the difference between play a nd work, but performs work according to need (\"Bedarfsarbeit\"). (B\u00fccher, op. cit. , p. 5). The work effort results not only in owning a certain good, but work itself brin gs along pleasure and satisfaction. Technical means are imperfect and the work processe s are long. Despite these circumstances, the products, usually intended for l ong-term use, often consist in works of art. B\u00fccher found that creating art is a means t o overcome the burden of work, but even more important is dance. (B\u00fccher, op. cit. , p. 16). In studying music of laborers, B\u00fccher has observed that the work rhythm determines the rhythm of the songs at work and that sometimes two, three, or even more, labore rs work together to make a rhythm possible, even if each one of them pursues his own goal. Singing has an even stronger productivity-enhancing effect than dancing, in part icular if a social duty requires people to work together on the same goal. 6 In particular in small villages it often was a soc ial duty of neighbors to help each other with work on t he fields, building homes, work in the home, in case of illness, or at harvest time, w hen the work could not be delayed. 5 Lectures and industry studies leading to expert op inions, as well as the work of his doctoral candidates are available at the Karl B \u00fccher estate of Kyoto University. 6 According to Alchian and Demsetz, team production requires costs of monitoring and control. Although B\u00fccher has not made this expl icit, he discovered a method of control in team production, as working to gether according to a rhythm is a method of minimizing costs of monitoring and c ontrol. See Armen A. Alchian and H. Demsetz. 1972. \"Production, Information Cost s, and Economic Organization.\" American Economic Review . 62, pp. 777-795. 214 B\u00fccher has observed that nonmarket exchange relatio nships in the sense of what might appear as unilateral voluntary behavior and t herefore outside the realm of economic analysis is, in fact, bilateral exchange. This exchange is based on mutual advantage made possible by social norms, where the legal order could not bring about feasible results. These institutions such as volunt ary labor exchange (\"Bittarbeit\") are therefore within the scope of economics. In various sections of his work, B\u00fccher has analyzed the exchange of goods, services, productiv e capital and labor, which takes place outside the market. 7 This will be the subject of the next section (9.2) , followed by a discussion of the relevance of his contributions for health economics today (section 9.3), and a summary and conclusions (section 9.4). 9.2 Gift Giving, Borrowing and Lending, and Labo r Exchange. B\u00fccher placed particular emphasis on the study of g ift giving, borrowing and lending, and labor exchange. He built on a well-established tradition in German economic theory. Already von Th\u00fcnen pioneered the idea of gi ft-giving through his will. In his will, von Th\u00fcnen gave almost his entire estate to his far mhands as a gift. It provided them with a basis for living and the possibility to buil d up future capital. In return, he expected the children of the beneficiaries to be better educ ated, to the benefit of their proficiency in agriculture or other pursuits and as mature citi zens. B\u00fccher was aware of the formulation of the principl e of marginal utility by Gossen and von Th\u00fcnen and applied it in order to explain the p henomena of nonmarket exchange. (1919, op. cit. , p. 23, note 1). By marking the following quotes, B\u00fccher has emphasized the principle of marginal utility in his personal c opy of von Th\u00fcnen's Isolated State . At the border of the cultivated land of the Isolat ed State, where the ground does not yield rent, and the revenue of the estate is li mited to the interest borne by buildings and standing capital, the effect of an in crease of the labor wage will be that the land rent will become negative, i.e. fall below zero (p. 68). Herein is the reason revealed for such an importan t phenomenon of our future investigation: that each unit of newly invested, ad ditional capital will bear smaller rents than the one invested earlier (p. 99). 8 7 Chapter 1, \"Schenkung, Leihe und Bittarbeit.\" 8 In the original German quote this reads as follows : \"An der Grenze der kultivierten Ebene gibt, und der Gutsertrag auf die successor of Roscher in Leipzig, B\u00fccher c ontinued in the same tradition. 9 Roscher had pointed towards the production and exch ange of goods and services without the use of money. In what was meant as a re mark on the side, he described networking in the lower classes as an economic phen omenon. The network of help of family members and in parti cular the help of friends and neighbors is admirably strong in the lower classes. It is more than likely that the kind of help provided by these circles is by far hi gher in value than the charitable care provided by the higher classes. This is not on ly true with respect to the ability to help, but also in absolute terms. It is most likely that the value of this mutual support is by far higher than that of the so much appraised charities and gifts of the wealthy. 10 In going beyond Roscher's work, B\u00fccher developed a theory of reciprocal exchange taking place even in the absence of a market. He co nsidered cases of mutual support as examples of such exchange relations. 11 The nonmarket forms of exchange described in the fi rst chapter of B\u00fccher's Development of the Economy ( Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft. II. ) are \"Gifts, Borrowing and Lending of Goods or Capital and Labor Provided in Exchange for Other Labor.\" 12 He has shown how gaps in the own provision lead to nonmarket exchange in negativ werden, H. Theil, Berlin: von Wiegandt, at the library of the University of Kyoto , Estate by Karl B\u00fccher. 9 Karl der Bemittelten we it \u00fcbersteigen.]\" Wilhelm Roscher. 1906 3. System der Armenpflege und Armenpolitik. (System of Poverty Care and Poverty Policy). Stuttgart and Berlin: J. G. Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, p. 76. 11 The subject of exchange in a nonmarket environment is still a neglected topic one typically does not find mentioned in a modern t extbook on microeconomics. See, for instance, 1922. Die Entstehung der 216 an economy, where markets for monetary exchange are lacking. These phenomena always belong to the early time of the closed house economy. If gaps in the own provision occur, one en deavors to get from other economies, what one does not own, but what one desi res for the one or other reason. In the case of goods, depending on the natu re of the goods, this leads either to the gift relationship or to borrowing and lending. In the case of labor input it leads to the provision of voluntary labor (in response to a request). In all of these cases it is not about receiving something without giving anything in return. Instead, this is giving with the purpose to receive something else in return, the amount of which one can determine up to a certain extent.13 The decision for exchange is made by groups of peop le striving for a common goal, but they are often represented by one person initiating the exchange. B\u00fccher has distinguished among the core family, the extended f amily, sometimes called \"the house,\" and the tribe. He has illustrated how gift- giving among natural tribes leads to exchange. The gift relationship is very important among natu ral tribes ... Not only food is shared voluntarily very often and never denied to t he hungry anyway, but frequently, all kinds of implements and utensils ar e turned over to others. These gifts, however, are not handed over while abandonin g any claim of response, but under the expectation of a gift in return, with the person bestowing the gift in the first place having a say in the characteristics of what specifically he will receive back in return. 14 While altruistic motives are not the primary motive s, they might play a certain role. Volkswirtschaft. II . T\u00fcbingen: Laupp'sche Buchhandlung, pp. II, op. cit. , p. 4. 217 This kind of gift relationship does not result fro m pity and mercy on the one hand, or need and poverty on the other; no religiou s or moral duty has to be fulfilled; it originates solely from the attempt to gain the favor of the receiver and to obtain benefits from it. At this stage of develo pment, the gift originates from egoistic motives; it is nothing else but a means to reach, what one wants and strives for, although altruistic motives might play a larger or smaller supporting role. 15 B\u00fccher has pointed out that the gift is intended to set off an exchange which would help to relieve a gap in provision faced by the giver. It is in particularly significant that the gift at this stage of development is not initiated by the one who has an excess of means of which he wants to make others aware of, but by the one who is facing a gap and who is looking for a remedy to overcome that shortage. Despite this inte ntion, the gift leads to a feeling of satisfaction on the side of the receiver , because it comes unexpectedly and because never there exists a legal claim to a gift. 16 When a gift is expected and not received, then a fe eling of dissatisfaction will result. B\u00fccher has noted that a gift will usually come unex pected and without being asked for in order to create an introduction for future busin esses act that had otherwise not taken place. A gift is transferred in order to initiate a business contact, but a gift unwanted or of low quality can be returned for a more suitable gift in order to start an exchange. B\u00fccher has described the control mechanism in the g ift relationship as follows: Rejection of the gift would be a serious insult to the giver; acceptance of the gift will always oblige the receiver to confer a gift in return, and the gift relationship is only definitive when the first giver has expressed satisfaction with what has been passed over to him in exchange for his origina l gift. Up to that point, the 15 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Wir h aben es also bei dieser Art und cit. , p. 6. 16 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Da is t weil sie Geschenk besteht.\" 1922, II, op. cit. , p. 6. 218 initial gift can also be called back. 17 Hospitality is a special case of the gift relations hip. In return for the gift, the guest is allowed to travel freely through the territory, and receives protection by the host. (1922, II, op. cit. , p. 8). B\u00fccher has noted that exchange is a characteristic of both, gift-giving as well as borrowing and lending of tools, machinery, and othe r productive capital. In some cases, slave labor was also subject to borrowing and lendi ng. In contrast to a gift which refers to the act of c onferring a subject permanently into someone else's property, lending means the tem porary transfer of use to another person under the provision that the good wi ll be returned undamaged. This provision is likely to be fulfilled, if the le nder, in need of something himself, asks the borrower of the good for whatever he is la cking. Among people who lead a simple lifestyle, borrowing and lending can be observed as a custom around the entire world. ... The reason that Roman jurists have so carefully created and treated the contract form of Commodatum is most likely that in the common life next to the overwhelming type of moneta ry exchange the borrowing-for-use relationship was also fairly impo rtant. 18 As B\u00fccher has pointed out, borrowing and lending is based on custom and was important as an early type of credit. It is not an abstract credit based on money. Rather, as in today's Islam it is a credit based on a parti cular purpose, an activity, or a function, and it is embodied in an asset that reflects this p urpose such as a ship. These embodied credit relationships require norms in orde r to be credible. Moral hazard needs to be avoided. These norms as they develop ar e tied to those specific customs, 17 The original German quote reads 1922, II, op. cit. , p. 7. 18 The original German quote reads as pp. 11, 12). In Rome, both, renting of slaves in exchange for monetary compensa tion and borrowing and lending of slaves were common. 1922, II, op. cit. , p. 12. 219 techniques, and purposes, and perfected thereupon. This process of perfection is an evolutionary process and can yield superior busines s practices. However, as Schmoller has pointed out in his discussion of these issues, the superiority comes at a price. \"Over time, flexibility gets lost due to the rigidi ty of law and social customs.\" 19 Societies based on these embodied credit institutions experie nce difficulties with entrepreneurship and technical change. A special form of borrowing and lending discussed b y B\u00fccher is labor provided in exchange for future help (\"Bittarbeit\"). \"It is sim ilar to the gift, and also to borrowing and lending where in return of a performance a counter performance is expected, and in all of these cases a precise counter deliberation is no t possible...\" 20 as the issues involved are not commensurable. Hence, the incentive for a h igh-quality performance lies in the reciprocity of the relationships. B\u00fccher has shown that in all cases of nonmarket for ms of exchange the value cannot be determined easily. This does not cause a problem , because due to the reciprocal relationships all potential participants are motiva ted to deliver a high quality performance. If they do not follow the social conse nt as expressed by the social custom they will be faced with sanctions such as unfriendl iness in their immediate environment and exclusion from future exchange. In modern economic terms, the attention shifted fro m social customs to social norms which are at the basis of social customs and import ant determinants of our behavior. 21 Social norms are defined as rules, which are compli ed with, although they are neither promulgated by any legal source, nor legally enforc ed. What are the incentives for obeying social norms? As B\u00fccher has pointed out, fe ar of ostracism is an incentive to follow social norms. Ostracism refers to the refusa l of other group members to let an individual participate in any advantageous transact ions. The incentive to the ostracizer is to avoid future costs from dealing with the norm breaker. In this sense his or her behavior might privately and socially be cost-justi fied. An additional incentive to obey social norms becomes important in B\u00fccher's analysis . Social norms are self-enforcing, when norm compliance confers private benefits. An e xample includes complying with those sets of rules, which govern gift exchange, an d borrowing and lending. The norms surrounding those exchanges are too subtle to be ba cked by law as a precise counter deliberation of the values is not possible. In this case self-selection is present, because the parties have accepted to participate in the exc hange and along with it agreed to the 19 In the original, this reads as follows: Munich, Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot, p. 53. 20 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Sie g leicht darin p. 17. 21 Richard A. Posner. 1997. \"Social Norms and the Law \", American Economic Review . May 1997, 87 (2), pp. 365-369, see in particular pp. 365-366. 220 social norms governing this behavior. In this case, social norms are likely to be obeyed, because the private costs of complying are low and the benefits are substantial. B\u00fccher clearly distinguished \"social custom\" from l aw. In studying the transition of societies, he has pointed out that \"help among neig hbors as far as I can see has never been regulated by law. But help among neighbors is thoroughly rooted in the social custom.\" 22 If the common consent as expressed by the social c ustom is replaced by law then nonmarket forms of exchange may become dif ferent and even cease to exist. The historical institutions of gift exchange and vo luntary exchange of goods, services, and labor in some cases have developed into forms o f taxation customs duties and futile liens with the emergence of the tax state. 23 In the next section, we will look at the relevance of B\u00fccher's analysis to health care. The question arises whether we can observe the elem ent of exchange in nonmarket phenomena of health care. 9.3 Nonmarket Exchange in Health Care As B\u00fccher has pointed out, the exchange of performa nces can regulate behavior in a nonmarket environment. In modern economies, economi c life is typically coordinated by markets and regulated by law, but there are stil l important sectors where other mechanisms are present. Health care is an outstandi ng example where charity plays a role. In his contributions to Economic History ( op. cit. ), B\u00fccher has given the example of the Beguines who joined a lay sisterhood and were devot ed to a religious life, but did not belong to an approved religious order. The Beguines first appeared in the beginning of the thirteenth century in Belgium, and later spread to the Netherlands and Germany. B\u00fccher has described them as a group of women who c ould not get married. They lived together and it was the city's duty to protec t them. In return, the lay sisters performed good deeds and charity, preferably in hea lth care. The Beguines came from the upper class, later middle class. They were rich and had a considerable influence in the city. 24 Help was performed as a reciprocal relationship, a condition under which 22 In the original German quote this reads as follows : \"Nirgends ist die Bittarbeit, fest verankert.\" 1922, II, op. cit. , p. 17. 23 In the original German quote this reads as follows : \"Under certain conditions, the gift relationship becomes a tax and customs duty, a nd voluntary labor exchange becomes servitude.\" The original II, op. cit. , p. 18. According to B\u00fccher, such conditions could involve an unequal distribution of the land, or if the common consent is turned into law. 24 Karl B\u00fccher. 1922. Beitr\u00e4ge zur Wirtschaftsgeschichte. II. T\u00fcbingen: Laupp'sche 221 according to B\u00fccher a high quality of goods and ser vices will be provided. The modern political discussion of health issues of ten centers between legal regulation and the market as governance principles of health c are. The third alternative as proposed by B\u00fccher, mutual support based on recipro city, has often been overlooked. It is the purpose of this section to see whether a niche could be identified that allows for nonmarket exchange in health care. The issue of quality is crucial to blood donations. Low-quality blood and blood borne diseases such as HIV/AIDS are a challenge to transf usion medicine in the United States. The nationwide, blood collection and distri bution system of the United States consists partly of voluntary and partly of commerci al donors. As a consequence of self selection, the pool of commercial donors has a high er degree of poor (contaminated) blood than the pre-selected voluntary donors provid e. For instance, if there is a blood drive among a particularly healthy segment of the p opulation, the sample is different from people who walk in from the street and give bl ood for a small monetary reward. While the solution to the problem of low quality bl ood donated has been looked for in the development of antibody testing and other medic al advances, the organizational shortcoming has been overlooked. According to B\u00fcche r's theory, the crisis of low blood quality could be solved if one would introduce the condition of reciprocity into blood donating, for instance if a person in exchange for donating blood would receive regular health check ups for free. Under the current Americ an system, the donor remains anonymous, because he or she cannot get a response from the receiver of the blood and will typically not be involved in a future exch ange such as a regular health check up. Someone who has donated bad blood will not see the consequences of his action. If reciprocity could be employed in the process, fo r instance in a nonmarket exchange, then the quality of the blood donated would probabl y increase. Fundraising is an important aspect of the health ca re industry. If a company wants to promote its brand in conjunction with a good cause, such as a charity, then the condition of reciprocity differs from the cases B\u00fcc her has discussed. In their marketing efforts, some companies try to reassure consumers t hat the businesses they patronize are willing to share their profits with charities, or community-related causes. Here, the benefit to the donor neither stems from the respons e of the direct receiver such as the charity, nor the ultimate receiver such as the pati ent to be cared for, but consists in the act of giving which yields a reputation that will d istinguish the company from others. Major gifts are regularly donated in the areas of h ealth care, education and the arts. Donation of major gifts is an industry by itself. T he institutions and people receiving major gifts focus on the exchange relationship. It is the task of the fundraiser to find out what makes the exchange attractive to the major don or. The challenge of this professional's position is to create an exchange. I ncentives a fundraiser can use is to provide a donor with the social status and tax-exem ptions. It will also be his or her duty to determine the size and form of the gift the char ity should aim for. This can be a difficult task, for instance if the gift is given i n shares and depends on market revenues. To a donor interested in an exchange it is importan t to have a good estimation of the Buchhandlung, p. 277. 222 value of the gift in terms of the value of the shar es, etc. in order to present it in the company's reports. B\u00fccher's analysis explains the exchange taking plac e in fundraising from a positive point of view, but does he also give a hint for the question whether fundraising for charities such as a medical center is justified fro m a normative point of view? Here, the positions of a welfare state advocate favoring gove rnment funding of health care drift apart from someone who takes a more liberal stance. For instance, the welfare state advocate argues that charities lack ultimate accoun tability to the electorate, thereby creating the danger of arbitrariness. 25 This position ignores that only in a direct democracy ultimate accountability is given by way o f a referendum. Further arguments against fundraising include that private charities often take a piecemeal approach without the possibility of recourse and that funds of charities are often insufficient. In order to add to the funding, special interest chari ties often get government subsidies. The more liberal politician would respond that due to the constraint of scarce resources government funding can also lead to a piecemeal app roach, and that charities often work with tax brackets instead of government subsid ies, thereby not reducing government funding but adding to it. An additional point of the welfare state advocate is that receiving charity can undermine the dignity of someone, who has to regard himself as the recipient of charity, rather than as a citiz en whose rights include the right to health care. (Ackerman, op. cit. , p. 428.) Here, the liberal will mention the avail ability of health insurance and a minimum safety net provided by government for people with insufficient funds on their own. While we cannot re fer to B\u00fccher for normative guidelines in this controversy, we can still refer to his lesson from a positive point of view. In modern welfare states, the possibility of creating an exchange relationship in health care in order to create a high quality servi ce or product should not be overlooked. While fundraising for charities in the health care sector has shortcomings on the normative side, from a positive point of vie w it can add to government funding rather than distract from it. Nonmarket exchange is based on social custom. As B\u00fc cher has observed, nonmarket exchange might cease to exist if laws are introduce d which replace the social custom. Similar observations can be made with respect to mo dern health care and are the topic of a book written by Richard A. Epstein who looked for unintended consequences of government regulation. 26 Epstein assumed altruistic behavior, but has not m ade explicit the element of exchange that can be involved in non market transactions. He gave the example of hospitals, which occasionally have admit ted patients with insufficient funds to emergency rooms. If those hospitals were require d by law to admit all patients to emergency rooms, then at least some of them would b e forced to close down for financial reasons. This, however, would lead to a r eduction in the long-term supply of emergency rooms, and is thus contrary to the intent ions pursued. (Epstein, 1997, op. 25 Felicia Ackerman. 1996. \"What is the Proper Role f or Charity in Healthcare?\" Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics . Cambridge University Press, Vol. 5, No. 3, Summer 1996, pp. 425-429, in particular pp. 427-428. 26 1997. Mortal Peril. Our Inalienable Right to Health Care? Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, Massachusetts. 223 cit. p. xiv). A problem of undersupply might result if one relies entirely on donations which are based on altruism, even if this gives the person do nating a sense of belonging to a group or the satisfaction of having performed a goo d deed. An example is the donation of organs for transplants. The current government r egulation of the United States allows for donative transactions only. Epstein has illustrated how this practice leads to a persistent shortage of organs. 27 The most desirable organs come from people who died in accidents. It is estimated that the demand of organs would be met if all of those organs could be harvested. Currently, only 1/3 of s uitable donors actually donate organs, and the number remained stable since about 1983. (Epstein, 1997, op. cit. pp. 240, 241). If the motivations of the donors are alt ruistic, then the incentive to give may be too weak, and the supply of donations may fall s hort of the needs of potential receivers. Epstein only saw the aspect of altruism, but did not explicitly recognize the element of exchange in charity. The question here i s what incentive can be provided to stimulate the supply of organs. In order to increase the numbers of donors it has b een proposed to introduce a market. As organ transplantation technology has changed, in creasing the rate of successful transplantations, Epstein has argued that contracts for the sale of organs should legally be allowed in the United States so that physicians and individuals could take advantage of it. While a market could remove the im balance between organ supply and demand, there are several objections that prevent i ts introduction. From a normative point of view, the dignity of low income participan ts might be affected. There is the concern that organs of low quality might be offered from people who are pressed for money and the fear that this market will be open to criminal behavior. Furthermore, when asked whether the market or charity is the pre ferred alternative, physicians tended to choose the charity mechanism to deal with the constraints of scarce resources, while economists clearly preferred the m arket as a means of allocation. 28 As an alternative to a market for organs, as well a s to the system of voluntary donations of organs, a type of nonmarket exchange o f organs has been discussed which resembles the case of gift exchange as descri bed by B\u00fccher. An example of this proposal is the following: 27 The numbers of organs needed for transplant show a strong increase over time: in the US, there was a shortage of almost 14000 kid neys in 1988, the number increased to about 34000 in 1996. Similarly, the ne ed for hearts increased about threefold from 1030 to 3706, as well as that for pa ncreas from 163 to 319. The shortage for livers and lungs was 616, resp. 69 in 1988 and showed a much stronger increase than the numbers for kidneys, hea rts, and pancreas to 7239 resp. 2274 in 1996.

March 1996, Vol. 86, No. 1. * Presidential Address at the one-hundred eighth meeting of the American E conomic Association, January 6, 1996, San Francisco, California. 224 At age 18 (or 21), all men and women would be requ ired, in the presence of a witness, to sign a statement declaring whether or n ot they are willing to be organ donors. There would be no government pressure to de cide one way or the other. However, one criterion for being eligible to recei ve a donor organ would be whether or not the individual is signed up as a don or himself. Those who were not willing to donate organs would be placed lower on the waiting list than all individuals, however sick, who had agreed to be don ors. 29 This plan can be expected to increase the number of donors, because those people who receive preferential treatment should an organ transplantation be required would have to be listed as suitable donors. 9.4 Summary and Conclusions In his work B\u00fccher has focused on exchange based on nonmarket transactions in the market economy. He has also analyzed nonmarket form s of exchange before the advent of markets. In studying nonmarket phenomena, B\u00fccher built on a well- established tradition in German economic theory. Al ready von Th\u00fcnen pioneered the idea of gift-giving through his will and Roscher, B \u00fccher's predecessor, has pointed towards the economic importance of nonmarket exchan ge. B\u00fccher has shown how gaps in the own provision lead to nonmarket exchange in an economy, where markets for monetary exchange were l acking. He placed particular emphasis on the gift relationship, borrowing and le nding, and the voluntary exchange of labor. All these forms have in common that the v alue cannot be determined easily. A set of social norms, B\u00fccher himself speaks of socia l custom, makes it possible that the exchange takes place. Due to the reciprocal relatio nships, all potential participants are motivated to deliver a high quality performance. Th ose participants who do not adhere to the rules are faced with unfriendliness and excl usion from future exchange. The relevance of B\u00fccher's analysis to health econom ics is twofold. On the one hand, his examples can be applied to health care directly . He has observed that in particular in small villages it was often a social duty of nei ghbors to help each other with work on the fields, building homes, at harvest time, or in case of illness. This was a mutual exchange relationship. He also described the exampl e of the Beguines who performed work in hospitals and health care in exchange for t he protection of the city they lived in, so that a mutual exchange situation was given as we ll. As we have seen above, the condition of reciprocity ensures that a high qualit y of goods and services will be provided. On the other hand, B\u00fccher's analysis of gift exchan ge, borrowing and lending, and 29 Charles J. Wheelan. 1998. \"To Get an Organ, Offer to Give One.\" The Wall Street Journal . December 29, 1998. 225 voluntary labor is relevant to health economics in an abstract sense. He has delineated reciprocity of exchange as the element that leads t o high quality performance in a nonmarket exchange. We have considered four example s in health care, where this element is important. In the case of blood donation s, reciprocity could be introduced by setting up a nonmarket exchange. This would probabl y lead to an increase in the quality of the blood donated. In the case of fundra ising in health care, the nonmarket exchange consists in the act of giving which yields a reputation that will distinct the donating company in its marketing efforts from othe rs. The discussion between liberals and welfare state advocates shows that fundraising for charities in the health care sector has shortcomings on the normative side, but from a positive point of view it can add to government funding rather than distract from it. A similar case is the hospital which occasionally has admitted patients with insuf ficient funds to emergency rooms and which would have to shut down for financial rea sons, if it were forced to admit all patients with insufficient funds. The hospital migh t have accepted indigent persons for treatment because of altruistic reasons or because it wanted to have the reputation of a humane hospital. A law requiring the hospital to ta ke all indigent persons would destroy the underlying exchange process, and the consequenc e would be less supply of emergency rooms than before. B\u00fccher has shown that nonmarket exchange ceases to exist if legal regulation becomes too strong. In th e case of organ donations, nonmarket exchange could be introduced if persons who are wil ling to donate an organ receive preferential treatment in receiving an organ if the y need one. This type of nonmarket exchange could avoid the disadvantages of the marke t in this area and still increase the supply of organs which under the current system based on altruism is not sufficient. What are the conclusions to be drawn? Voluntary hel p provided by friends and neighbors might increase if it is based on a mutual basis. If one could strengthen social norms in health care, then cost-containment might b ecome less of a problem in this sector of the economy; however, there is substantia l doubt whether modern social norms allow for enough room for nonmarket forms of exchange as described by B\u00fccher to develop.

The so-called Althoff System refers to the systematic approach standing behind A lthoff's science policy. 1 This had an effect on all sciences, but here, we will concentra te on the implications for medicine and public health. 2 At the time, the industrial development had signif icant effects in relation to disease. For instance, new diseases eme rged among the proletarian class of the cities, and this required new ways to view a nd treat these diseases. Althoff took patronage of medical research by supporting scholar s with maverick ideas. He founded institutes and hospitals to further experimental an d diagnostic research. Under Althoff, Germany introduced public health legislation, as in the case of combating tuberculosis. An increase in speed of scientific progress in the field of medicine, as well as other fields could be shown during and shortly after the era Althoff. 3 The relevance of the Althoff System concerns the organization of scholarship in genera l and in this sense of health issues in particular. Althoff is a special case among the personalities w hose work is discussed in this book. Whereas the others are selected because of their th oughts on `economics of health' as expressed in their writings, Althoff is portrayed a s an exceptional organizer of science 1 The Althoff System has been analyzed from an economic perspective in the contributions to The Economics of Science Policy: An Analysis of th e Althoff System , J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, guest editor, 1993.

He viewed health policy as an independent policy that systematically builds on other sciences. Science de velopment led to new insights for more livable cities, improved architec ture, and better infrastructure. 231 and scholarship who created incentive compatible st ructures to the benefit of medical science and its applications, next to the other dis ciplines. By making use of an informational network, he discovered talented schol ars and made the way free for them to get ahead by cutting through cultural, religious or historical barriers. He was skilled in finding financial donors for particular projects, b ut his contribution went much further than fundraising. The funds, accumulated in foundat ions, since they had to be held in public bonds (war bonds), had lost their value duri ng the First World War, but the organizational structures for research and teaching he created had a lasting value. They allowed talents to prosper that would otherwis e never have come up through the strict academic structures. In the introduction, a look at Althoff's life and c areer follows. In section 10.2, the focus is on incentive compatibility as well as the major ele ments of the Althoff System . In section 10.3, it is shown how the Althoff System raised the level of research, teaching, and training, in particular in the fields of medici ne and public health. In section 10.4, these organizational structures and policies are an alyzed from an economic point of view mainly that of property rights theory. The cha pter ends with a summary and conclusions. Friedrich Althoff was born in Dinslaken in 1839. He studied law at the University of Bonn and began his career as an interrogating magis trate and lawyer. He held several positions, including being justice at the Superior Court of Justice in Berlin. 4 His career was interrupted by the French-German War. Like Niet zsche, he served as a member of the nursing staff. After the war, he returned to pr acticing and studying law, before he accepted an offer in 1871 to become a legal advisor in the Committee for Religious and School Affairs in Stra\u00dfburg. In the Alsatian public administration, Althoff was responsible for the appointment of the academic staff at the newly opened University of St ra\u00dfburg. He wrote the university's application and incorporation charter. In Stra\u00dfburg , he met Schmoller for the first time. In addition to his administrative duties, Althoff h eld the position of extraordinary professor of French and Modern Civil Law at the Uni versity of Stra\u00dfburg. In 1882, Althoff was appointed to the Prussian Mini stry of Culture and Science overseeing culture and research and teaching in par ticular universities. Here, he looked into faculty matters. His formal position was that of a referendary, but informally, he took on responsibility for all matters of science p olicy. In 1897, he became director of the first division, and in 1900, director of the sc ientific division for medical sciences. This position created the basis for Althoff's contr ibutions to the organization and administration of institutions to further science a nd scholarship. His contributions with respect to medical sciences will be described below . Althoff became the leading public administrator of science in Prussia. Declining furt her promotions, and even the offer to become Minister of Culture in 1906, he remained in his position until 1907, when he 4 Compare Vereeck, op. cit. , pp. 29-31, chapter three. His documentation of th e life and career of Althoff has been embedded in a d escription of the \"Prussian Public Administration in the Second Empire.\" 232 resigned from office for reasons of bad health. Alt hoff died in Berlin in 1908. Althoff was nationally and internationally recogniz ed for his merits. 5 He received five honorary doctoral degrees, among them the honorary degree of law from Harvard University (1906). Harvard particularly emphasized his role in restructuring organizations in which instruction and research tak es place. Althoff stood behind the innovative science policy in the Prussian administr ation. Important academic innovations included the introduction of the semina ry method, the foundation of research institutes, and setting up a modern librar y system. In order to create new structures, he needed the support of the Emperor. T he Emperor was also King of Prussia. As the Emperor, he had the prestige, as Ki ng, he had the power to create new structures. In the case of efforts towards the redu ction of infant mortality, the name of the Empress added publicity to the cause. Althoff's attempt was supported by Emperor William II (1888-1942), who wanted to modernize the Prussian universities and emphasized advanced technological research. He was also interested in relieving the Social Question . Under his reign, Prussia was developing from a rather backwards towards a rapidl y developing, prosperous state with many opportunities for social shortfall. The s ystematic science policy with Althoff at its helm was central to the success of the Empire o f William II. It was unique in Europe that Althoff had the right of immediate access to t he Emperor (Immediatrecht). He could gain undistorted information of the Emperor's goals . An example of the fruitful cooperation between Althoff and the Emperor is the campaign against tuberculosis. Althoff's attempt to modernize the Prussian univers ity system through the foundation of technical universities and the insistence of granti ng them academic privileges equal to those of traditional universities was supported by Emperor William II. This created new opportunities for the universities to conduct techn ological research and led to many innovations. The outstanding success of the Prussian-German acad emic system at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century h as been attributed to the policies by Althoff which have been traditionally referred to a s the Althoff System . The Althoff System has been documented by Vom Brocke who attributed t he number of Nobel Prizes which Germany received before and after the First World War to the conditions Althoff had created. 6 Nobel Prizes in medicine and chemistry were given to Behring 5 Peter Senn. 1993. \"Where is Althoff?

Althoff ha d an important influence on shaping academic institutions for almost a century; his int erest went far beyond medicine, encompassing natural sciences, as well as social sc iences. He collaborated closely with leading German scholars, for instance Schmolle r, who was able to gain the broad support of other professors to realize his ambitiou s program. 8 In this chapter, we are mainly interested in the organizational reforms and policies that created a financial basis and led to advances in the field of medicine. 10.2 The Althoff System and Incentive Compatible Structures The Elements of the Althoff System Despite his formal position, which did not allow hi m to shape the Prussian science policy, Althoff reached informal power through vari ous strategies. Personal traits helped him to strengthen his position, as well as close co ntacts to the Emperor, but most important, behind his various strategies stood an a pproach referred to as the Althoff System . The term was originally coined by Max Weber, a fe rvent critic of Althoff, who described Althoff's policies as a system of connect ed points that work together. 9 By looking at the following categories, \"academic info rmation,\" \"academic appointments,\" \"academic of the Althoff System can be identified. (Vereeck, op. cit. , pp. 63 - 81). Althoff ordered several statistical studies in orde r to obtain reliable information about the university system. (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 63, footnote 146). In addition to this accumulation of quantitative data, he set up an inf ormational network, which allowed him to discover talented scholars and to gain infor mation which was not easy to come by. His network of confidential advisors encompasse d academics, politicians, bankers and industrialists, and provided Althoff with quali tative academic information and information about financial resources. Through his network, he obtained information 7 This Dutch researcher was only enabled to conduct his research successfully after his appointment to Berlin. 8 The vantage point of launching his research progra m was the foundation of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik . Behind the decision stood the Althoff System . The entire field of social sciences served the purpose of soci al policy. Compare J\u00fcrgen Backhaus. Life's Work. A Analysis Perspective). D\u00fcsseldorf: Verlag Wirtschaft und Finanzen, pp. 31- 76. 9 The term Althoff System was adopted widely and soon lost its original, neg ative connotation. Bernhard vom Brocke, 1980, op. cit., p . 111, footnote 313. 234 about the state-of-the-art in each discipline, abou t the areas where promising scientific progress was to be expected, and about the performa nce of specific researchers. This was in particular important with respect to his app ointment policy. 10 Althoff took control of academic appointments at Pr ussian universities in order to employ the best scholars he could identify national ly and internationally. While his informal approach of centralized control and relyin g on a network of confidential advisors often met with criticism, Althoff received credit for the results he achieved. (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 67). In a cautious manner, Althoff interfered with the selection procedures of traditional universities. He had obse rved that faculty proposals to fill vacancies not always reflected true scholarship of a candidate. Other aspects such as nepotism played a role. By relying on expert opinio n of his informational network, Althoff was able to present the candidate who was b est qualified for the position. In general, Althoff respected the wishes of the local faculties, but not, if he suspected the protection of vested interests. (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 69). This gave local faculties an incentive to propose qualified candidates for a vac ant position. Althoff's appointment policy not only concerned sel ection procedures, but he also created new research facilities in order to attract talented scholars. \"He opened academic jobs for members of previously excluded mi nority groups like Catholics, Jews, Social-Democrats and atheists. He also upgrad ed the secondary education for girls, so that by 1908 German women were allowed to study at Prussian universities.\" (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 72). In putting up these topics, Althoff took advantage of his immediate access to the Imperial family. 11 Through this immediate access, for instance lunching with the Imperial family, he was able to p ut specific topics on the Imperial agenda, including women's access to universities, t he tuberculosis research, or basic research, i. e. the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (Emperor Wilhelm Society). The protection of academic freedom as guaranteed by the constitution of 1850 was another important element of the Althoff System . By cutting through cultural, religious or historical barriers, Althoff made the way free f or talented scholars to get ahead. They did not have to fear the competition from mainstrea m scholars for reasons of their opinion. With some exceptions, the Ministry of Cult ure protected scholars from \"oligarchic faculties, academic interest groups, po litical parties and government.\" (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 74). At the same time, the Ministry of Culture followed the parity principle and appointed scholars holding different views who had to work alongside each other. (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 75). Finally, the Althoff System is characterized by its innovative methods with re spect to financial resources. Under Althoff, the Prussian st ate gave up its monopoly under 10 A list of persons belonging to the academic networ k of Althoff has been provided by Vereeck, op. cit. , pp. 65, 66. 11 Althoff, who came from a family of Westphalian far mers, declined to be knighted. As a rule, only persons of nobility could see the Emperor. This is why, as a rule, the Emperor knighted the provincial gove rnors, whom he tended to recruit from academic commoners. 235 which the central state financed the university sys tem. \"Building on his confidential network, Althoff set up an innovative multi-source financing system, in which the Prussian state, local authorities, academies, indus try, banking and private sponsors participated.\" (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 75). Through skilled fundraising, Althoff was able to create new research institutes, to fund new academi c chairs, and to finance particular projects. For a better coordination, he held the pr ivate financial sources under central control. In 1911, these funds developed into the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft . (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 79). The funds devoted to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft had to be public bonds. Incentive Compatible Structures Althoff created incentive compatible structures in research and teaching. Incentive compatibility means that agents in an organization face incentives to further the organizations' goals; since the understanding is th at every agent follows his or her own goals primarily, and the more difficult it is to mo nitor his or her behavior, incentive compatibility requires that the agents' goals match as perfectly as possible the organizational goals. 12 Traditional university structures created many inc entive incompatibilities, and it was Althoff's lasting ach ievement to resolve many of these by implementing new organizational forms. Transaction costs depend on the specific constellat ions of institutions, in which transactions take place. They can take many forms. In principle, we distinguish between three types of costs, depending on the phas es that any transaction has to go through. Information needs to be gathered, a contra ct, the performance of which can be monitored, needs to be negotiated and concluded, and this contract performance needs to be policed, that is monitored and sanction ed. Hence, we distinguish between information, contracting and policing costs. There are transaction costs in the market, but there are also transaction costs in the firm. 13 In this chapter, intrafirm transaction costs are most important, where the firm is the uni versity as a whole or a specific research institute. In choosing his policies, Althoff was aware of the economic properties of academic knowledge. (Vereeck, 1993, op. cit ., pp. 15-19). It is a characteristic of academic knowledge that we cannot know what is being discove red, and it is therefore difficult to assess the expected returns of research. Even the e valuation of new knowledge causes problems, as well as the measurement of acad emic performance. In order to study the effects of an improved academic structure , for instance on the rate of innovations, it is useful to clarify the nature of academic output. Academic output is a public good and as such it is characterized by non- rivalry in consumption. Under these 12 Compare Laurie J. Mullins. 1993 (3). Management and Organisational Behaviour . Great Britain: Pitman Publishing. 13 Ronald H. Coase. 1937. \"The Nature of the Firm\". I n: The Firm, The Market and the Law . 1988. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, pp. 3 3-56. 236 circumstances, it would not make sense to exclude a nyone from its consumption. According to Samuelson, non-rivalry in consumption and the principle of non-exclusion are the two characteristics of a public good. 14 In the case of a public good such as knowledge, the producer of knowledge will not be able to collect the full value of the knowledge pro duced, because someone else can use it without paying for it. For this reason, a fr ee market is likely to under produce knowledge. Under certain conditions, it is feasible to exclude others from knowledge. An example is the patent system which makes it poss ible to exclude others from knowledge temporarily. By way of a patent, private property rights can be assigned for a certain time span. With the prospect of a patent which allows to reap the benefits of an innovation, people have a stronger incentive to produce knowledge. When the patent expires, the knowledge can be applied by oth ers and applications can be imitated widely. In some cases, patents are not applicable. The publ ic good character of knowledge causes a problem for companies with large investmen ts in research and development such as pharmaceutical companies. We have seen in t he first chapter on Paracelsus that competition in the case of pharmaceutical comp anies is by way of innovation. Here, Schumpeter's argument can be applied that in such a case even a monopoly structure can be appropriate in order to give the c ompany an incentive to invest in research and development leading to innovations. Knowledge as a public good can also have external e ffects. Vereeck ( op. cit ., p. 17) gave the following example: Medical research and instruction affect the indivi duals who suffer from particular diseases. It also creates important external effect s, because it is a determining factor of public health. Although an individual mig ht never be ill himself, public health may affect the costs of the labor force he e mploys. The characteristics of public goods make it difficu lt to assess their value. Non- purchasers, or free-riders, cannot be excluded. The y know what the public good is worth to them, but they have no incentive to reveal their true preferences. Due to the public good character of knowledge, residual claima ncy is important in the field of research and development. 15 Vereeck argued that the value of academic output i s 14 Paul A. Samuelson. 1954. \"The Pure Theory of Publi c Expenditures.\" Review of Economics and Statistics . 36, pp. 387-389. 15 Levy showed for American institutions that basic r esearch led to successful applications for defense and agriculture. Here, gov ernment served as a central monitor and residual claimant. He posed the questio n whether government should become more active as a monitor in the other sciences as well, and justified this with the following argument by Schum peter: \"Since some new knowledge is not patentable, perhaps special treatm ent is justified to encourage the provision of knowledge. The most dramatic case for special treatment is based on a famous argument made by Joseph Schumpete r. Schumpeter 237 even more difficult to assess, if external effects are present in the sense that private benefits and costs fall apart from social costs and benefits. ( Op. cit ., p. 18). The chain of effects is often long and indirect, and cannot e asily be reflected by simple quantitative indicators. 16 Althoff's science policy systematically reduced tra nsactions costs such as costs of information, monitoring and policing. For example, coping with infectious diseases was originally only possible by measures of quarantine. Quarantine was a common practice in Europe from the fifteenth century onward. 17 Again, the case of Marseille is interesting as an entire island was used for preventive quarant ine before seafaring merchants could enter the port. Modern systems of vaccinating substantially reduced transaction costs. Similar, before boarding ships to the Americ as would-be immigrants had to spent weeks of quarantine in the ports of Hamburg or Brem en, because the concentration on the small space of ships multiplied the risk of inf ectious diseases. Again, the transaction costs in this case of maritime transpor t could drastically be decreased by such health measures as vaccination. The history of immunology as a science began with the experiments of Louis Pasteur, whose instit ute was set up in 1888, and the experiments of the Berlin bacteriologists around Ro bert Koch. 18 As progress has been made with respect to bacteriology, parasitology, an d pathology, immunizations became possible. As compared to quarantine, immunizations reduced transaction costs substantially. 19 maintained that a monopoly - because it is able to garner more of the benefits to the industry from R&D (because a monopoly is the in dustry) - will have an incentive to invest more heavily in R&D than would a competitive industry. In economic jargon a monopoly can internalize more of the R&D benefits than a competitive industry can. Although Schumpeter himse lf did not argue for special treatment of R&D on this basis, the argument could be made.\" David M. Levy. 1993. \"Research and Development.\" David R. Henderso n, Editor. The Fortune Encyclopedia of Economics . Pp 78-81, p. 80. 16 Vereeck showed this for citation counts, which he considered to be useful to get an overview of research topics, but which might be inappropriate indicators when deciding about the allocation of resources. Th e presence of citation cartels or the disadvantages to young scholars, who cannot possibly have a long list of citation quotations, are just two examples to show that citation counts can be flawed indicators when evaluating academic output. Op. cit ., p. 19 - 21. 17 Compare Kenneth F. Kiple. Editor. 1995(4). Cambridge World History of Human Disease. Cambridge, New Jersey: Cambridge Universit y Press, p. 359. 18 Compare Kenneth F. Kiple. Editor. 1995(4), op. cit. Cambridge, New Jersey: Cambridge University Press, p. 127. 19 The opportunity costs of people, who are locked aw ay and cannot perform their regular duties, are measured in time. Opportunity c osts are a subjective way to determine costs. Opportunity costs become part of t he transaction costs. Transaction costs are a form of costs that can have subjective and objective components. 238 Althoff changed the academic landscape and the orga nizational setting, in which medical research and training took place. This had implications with respect to the entire economy. Althoff's policies and strategies w ith respect to medicine are described in the next section. Considering the nature of acad emic knowledge, it is shown in section 10.4 that Althoff created incentive compati ble structures. The economic theory of property rights is applied to explain his polici es and strategies with respect to medicine and health care. 10.3 The Althoff System and the Organization of Medicine Medical discoveries have also been made in other co untries and in Germany outside of Prussia, but in Prussia, the state promoted science in a particular way. Althoff undertook efforts to improve physicians' training a nd introduced post university continuing education for physicians. His innovative multi-source financing system allowed the foundation of new hospitals and enlarge ment of existing institutions. Particular projects such as cancer research, the ca se of tuberculosis, a reduction in the mortality of newborns, or the introduction of measu res of hygiene attracted Althoff's attention. He supported outstanding medical researc h. He opened career opportunities to gifted outsiders; many of them thanked him their career. While Althoff's personal style roiled many, he also received thanks. The phy sicians of the Charit\u00e9 hospital which Althoff turned into a large research organization w rote in the Berliner Aertze- Correspondenz of January 11, 1902: \"We physicians are happy abou t the Althoff System und we are glad about the man who represents it.\" 20 In January 1900, the professors of the Charit\u00e9 decided to erect a bust o f Althoff at the hospital's entrance. 21 The Althoff System advanced the organization and administration of th e field of medicine and helped German medicine to achieve inte rnational recognition. Physicians' Training and Post University Continuin g Education By the introduction of research professorships, dis sertation and thesis requirements, Althoff wanted to improve the quality of research a nd teaching at universities. New 20 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Wir M ediciner freuen uns des Systems Althoff und uns des Mannes, der dies es System repr\u00e4sentiert.\" Eckart, 1991, op. cit. p. vo m Brocke. Editor. Wissenschaftsgeschichte Althoff in historischer Perspektive . (History of Science and Science Policy in the Industrial Age. The Althoff System in Historical Perspective,) pp. 15 - 44, p. 22. 239 rules were directed towards improving the medical e ducation of students. In 1901, the Imperial Chancellor decreed rules for examining and certifying physicians in the German Empire, as well as the requirement of a prac tical year for entry-level physicians, a measure which can be attributed to Al thoff. 22 Althoff founded two large academies for practical m edicine at Cologne (1904) and D\u00fcsseldorf (1907). Attached to the academies were t eaching hospitals offering specialized education to entry-level physicians for performing their practical year. It was difficult for the teaching hospitals to find enough candidates. Beginning physicians had a free choice as to where they wanted to perform th eir practical year. They tended to prefer lucrative entry-level positions at practices or other hospitals to the positions offering a high-quality continuing education, but a lower salary. While at the central level these efforts of physicians' ongoing educatio n failed, smaller academies for the ongoing education in practical medicine were also f ounded at the communal level. These smaller, local teaching hospitals operated su ccessfully. The Protestant church launched an institute for tro pical medicine in T\u00fcbingen in order to educate missionaries and physicians who wanted t o work as missionaries. In response to this effort, Althoff supported the foun dation of a similar institute at the Cologne academy that would provide education in tro pical medicine to certified physicians and Catholic missionaries. Althoff promoted decentralization in medical practi ce and ongoing education of physicians. He gained the support of the Berlin sur geon Ernst von Bergmann (1836- 1907), who together with other Berlin physicians fo unded an association with the goal to further physicians' continuing education. One of Bergmann's goals supported by Althoff was that surgeons not only worked at univer sity hospitals, but also at smaller local hospitals. Together with Bergmann, Althoff al so prepared the foundation of a center for ongoing education in Berlin, where physi cians could gain information on new procedures and methods. These efforts led to the fo undation of a teaching hospital, the Kaiserin-Friedrich Haus f\u00fcr das \u00e4rztliche Fortbildu ngswesen (Empress Friedrich House for Continuing Medical Education) in 1906, for whic h Althoff could gain substantial private support from industry and financial institu tions in Berlin. Foundation and Reorganization of Hospitals and Med ical Schools Under Althoff, important new foundations of hospita ls and reorganizations of existing health care centers took place, as well as the foun dation of new research facilities and medical schools, for which he was able to gain the financial support of various private and public sources. This allowed him to offer caree r possibilities to outstanding researchers whom he had discovered first through hi s thorough study of various informational sources and a network of confidential advisors. Among the new 22 Eckart, op. cit. , p. 376. Due to these measures, the quality of med ical care was expected to rise. 240 foundations of hospitals were the Berlin Imperial Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases (1891), the Prussian Mental Health Clinic in Halle (1891), the Children's Hospital in Breslau (1895), the Public Institute for Serum Research and Testing in Steglitz (1896), the Marburg Institute for Experimental Therapy (1899), the Imperial Hygiene Institute in Posen (1899). (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 379). The neurological institute of biology was a private foundation, which Althoff attached to Berlin University. The faculty at Berlin resisted A lthoff's plan. With the financial support of one million Mark by the Krupp foundation it coul d later be turned into the Kaiser- Wilhelm-Institute for neurological research. Since 1891, Althoff pursued the reorganization of t he Charit\u00e9 in Berlin. This work included the acquisition of suitable plots of land, supervision of construction activities, taking place from 1897 until 1916, and securing the financing of rebuilding the hospital complex. 23 It was Althoff's special wish that an institute fo r cancer research was added to the Charit\u00e9 to be headed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Paul Ehrlich. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 381). Althoff supported the transformation of the Academy at M\u00fcnster into the Westfalian Wilhelms-University and facilitated the introduction of medical studie s. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 381). In Shanghai, Althoff supported the foundation of th e German Medical School (1907), financed by the Berlin banker and industrialist Leo pold Koppel. 24 The German Medical School was in operation until 1937, educating many Chines e students who often finished their studies at German Universities. Afte r submitting and defending their dissertations, 145 foreign students, all of them ph ysicians, went back to their home country. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 382). The incentives Althoff used in order to finance aca demic research included the presentation of honors and licenses to the donors. An example is Althoff's method of financing a new chair in ear, nose and throat disea ses at the University of Marburg. He convinced a retired, extraordinary professor in med icine, Otto K\u00f6rner, who was independently wealthy, to renounce his pension in e xchange for an honorary and unsalaried professorship. The money of the pension was used to finance the new chair. (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 76). Similarly, in order to cover the deficit in the construction of the Marburg Polyclinic, Althoff arranged a prestigious mark of honor to be given to the publisher August Scherl who made a contribution of 100,000 Mark which covered the deficit. 25 In the case of Emil Behring's research at the Inst itute for Experimental 23 In order to illustrate the creativity and opportun ism by Althoff to gain financial means, Lode Vereeck has reported that Althoff used the boycott of the Charit\u00e9 Hospital by the Health Insurance Funds and the Soci al Democrats in order to obtain more funds for the reorganization of the hos pital from the state. Op. cit. , p. 76. 24 The Koppel foundation of one million Mark financed several projects, and also part of the international professorial exchanges. V ereeck, op. cit. , p. 79. 25 Thanks to the tactical moves by Althoff, the Emper or distinguished Scherl with 241 Therapy and Hygiene at Marburg, Althoff obtained fu nds for the Institute from the Hoechst Corporation in return for the license to ma ss produce the anti-diphtheria serum. As Vereeck has noted, this was not only in t he interest of the Hoechst Corporation, but also in the interest of the Prussi an state. The latter would set the price on the serum, and by encouraging wide adoption, it would promote public health. (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 81). This selection of hospital foundations and reorgani zations illustrates Althoff's efforts with respect to fundraising. 26 Through new foundations and reorganizations he was able to create career opportunities for outstanding scholars. He encouraged medical research and public health policy, in particular in the areas of infant mortality, tuberculosis, and hygiene. By hiring outstanding pr ofessionals, he created the infrastructure for new research opportunities. At t he same time he established the infrastructure to promote public health. Efforts to Reduce Infant Mortality In Prussia and in the German Empire, infant mortali ty reached its peak late in the 1870ies, while already being on the decline in Engl and and Wales, France, and Sweden. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 382). Diphtheria was considered an important cause of infant mortality. The Empress became engaged and un dertook efforts that would lead to a reduction in infant mortality. Her advisor was Philipp Biedert (1843-1926), a nutritional specialist, who saw diphtheria not as t he major cause of infant mortality, but who also included social factors as possible causes . (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 383, note 43). In 1905, Althoff asked the general pediatrician Ott o Heubner (1843-1926), who followed a different approach, to participate in th e plans of the Empress. In an autocratic move, Althoff offered him a chair at the Charit\u00e9. In order to finance the project, Althoff created a foundation of which he b ecame chairman and he was able to gain the financial means from industrialists and ba nkers. In 1909, the teaching hospital and research institute Kaiserin-Auguste-Victoria-Haus zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der S\u00e4uglingssterblichkeit (Empress Auguste Victoria House to Fight Infant Mo rtality) could be opened. Althoff became chairman of the board. At the same time, a journal was founded for publication of research results on the causes of infant mortality and on measures of its reduction. the \"Red Eagle.\" For a detailed explanation of Alth off's strategy see footnote 211, Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 80. 26 Vereeck has provided a list of private foundations established under Althoff. Several of the funds are devoted for medical purpos es. Vereeck, op. cit. , footnote 208, p. 79. 242 Fighting Tuberculosis The campaign against tuberculosis resulted from the close cooperation between Althoff and the Emperor. When in 1902 the first internation al tuberculosis conference took place, Althoff used the opportunity to launch the f ormation of an international central committee for the reduction and eradication of tube rculosis. Its main task was to edit the international journal Tuberculosis . Editor of the bilingual journal (French and German) was Gotthold Pannwitz (1861 - 1926). Five i nternationally renowned tuberculosis scholars were members of the editorial board, as well as Althoff himself. Later, the journal also appeared in the English lan guage. In November of 1908 an obituary notice of Althoff' s death by G. Pannwitz was published in three languages in the journal Tuberculosis . In it Pannwitz states that Althoff was \"the founder of the International Antituberculosis Association\". He also states that Althoff received the \"Gold Meda l for Tuberculosis\" [53, p. 445]. This activity and recognition is more evidence for a lasting contribution in international affairs on the side of goodwill towar ds all mankind. Adolphus Harnack's speech at Althoff's funeral is also printed in English in the same issue of Tuberculosis . Although the speech is in the spirit of de mortuis nil nisi bonum , he does mention that Althoff's conscientiousness was often misunderstood, that he was not easy to understand a nd that he was an opportunist - judgments which certainly stand up in the light of present-day scholarship. (Senn, 1993, op. cit ., p. 210). The foundation of hospitals in order to heal tuberc ulosis was still a responsibility of the national committee for tuberculosis that was sponso red by Althoff as well. In 1901, 14 public and 16 private hospitals in order to heal tu berculosis had been established, 19 were under construction and plans called for an add itional 16 institutions. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 385). Hygiene Since 1901, Althoff promoted public health by estab lishing research institutes for medical hygiene. These were either set up as govern ment institutions at the local or regional level, or, typically, connected to univers ities. Based on the Imperial Vaccination Law of 1874, the hygiene institutes also promoted vacc ination of the population, but their task went beyond the promotio n of public health. 27 According to 27 The German Empire framed the Imperial Vaccination Law in 1874, and its provisions deserve study and imitation. It containe d the following provisions: (1) Each child shall be vaccinated within the calendar year of its birth, unless it has passed through an attack of variola. (2) Every pupi l shall be revaccinated when 12 years of age, if he has not had variola within t he past five years. (3) Every vaccinated person must present himself to the physi cian who vaccinated him 243 the hygienist Max von Pettenkofer (1818 - 1901), it was Althoff who established the field of hygiene at the University level. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 385). Support of Outstanding Medical Research Althoff took patronage of medical and other researc h, in particular maverick ideas. He supported Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), whose work in cellular pathology formed a cornerstone in the fight against many infectious di seases including tuberculosis. Robert Koch (1843-1910), another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Althoff, laid the foundations for a scientific approach to bacteriology. In 1882 - 83 he identifie d tuberculosis and cholera bacteria. In consequence of his research and its subsequent d iscoveries, Prussia introduced a public health legislation that was directed towards the goal of eradicating tuberculosis as a disease. In 1905 the Emperor held the internat ional Tuberculosis congress in Berlin chaired by Althoff. During the Tuberculosis congress, Emil Behring (1854-1917) announced that he had discovered an immunization su bstance which would prevent bovine tuberculosis. Behring had been called by Alt hoff to head the Hygienic Institute at Marburg. Another outstanding medical scholar whom A lthoff gave a research institute was Paul Ehrlich (1845-1915), a student of Koch, wh o was famous for his research in experimental therapeutics. By giving him a research institute, Althoff created the environment he needed to conduct his research. A lo ok at the biographies of these outstanding medical researchers shows how important Althoff was for their success by creating the appropriate environment for their work . Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) Virchow studied medicine at the Friedrich-Wilhelm I nstitute in Berlin and began to work at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, after he had obt ained his degree. He graduated in medicine at the University of Berlin (1843), where he became prosector of anatomy. He shared the companionship with other scholars, for e xample with Henle, Schwann, Br\u00fccke, Helmholtz, and Du Bois-Reymond, who later b ecame discoverers of important medical facts as well. 28 In 1847, he became lecturer at the University of B erlin. Soon afterward he was commissioned by the government to investigate the causes and treatment of typhus in Silesia. In his report he se verely condemned the Prussian government for its lax hygienic and social laws, an d he made a strong appeal for a democratic form of government in Silesia. At that t ime, he founded the successful medical journal Archiv f\u00fcr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie (Archive for between the sixth and eighth day after vaccination. (4) Medical certificates proving successful vaccination at the legal ages sh all be preserved by parents and guardians. \"Vaccination.\" 1923 (2). The New International Encyclopedia .

Vol. XXIII, p. 175. 244 Anatomy and Physiology), 29 which he edited throughout his life. Next to this journal, he also established a political journal, Medical Reform , but this was a short-lived publication. 30 As another forum for his political opinions, he fo unded a democratic club, where he frequently gave speeches. Due to his antim onarchical views, he was expelled from Prussia in 1849. In the same year, Virchow accepted a call to the ch air of pathological anatomy in W\u00fcrzburg (Bavaria). His lectures at that university were widely popular for the novel views which he advanced, particular in cellular pat hology. He gained a high reputation for his work. In 1856, he was recalled to Berlin. I t was Althoff, who insisted on calling Virchow back to Berlin, despite of his antimonarchi st views. In Berlin, a pathological institute was provided for him. He occupied the cha ir of pathological anatomy, until his death in 1902. In 1858, he published Cellular Pathology and gained an international reputation. (Lelland J. Rather, op. cit. , p. 152). In 1861, Virchow became a member of the Berlin city council. He did much to improve city conditions, in particular with respect to publ ic health and sanitary conditions. In 1862, he was elected Deputy to the Prussian Diet an d soon took over the leadership of the opposition. He was one of the founders of the p rogressive party (Fortschrittspartei). Later, he became also a member of the left-leaning of the two German liberal parties, of the Free Thinkers (deutsch-freisinnige Partei). From 1880-1893 he served in the Reichstag. Virchow the \"blood and iron\" uni fication policies of Bismarck, but took his side in the so-called \"Kulturkampf.\" (Lell and J. Rather, op. cit ., p. 152). During the wars of 1866 and 1870-71, the Franco-Prussian W ar, Virchow formed and trained hospital corps and ambulance services. He managed t he Berlin military hospital, set up hospital trains, and oversaw the sanitary arrangeme nts of the troops in the field. After the war ended, Virchow became a member of the sanit ary bureau of the city of Berlin. His task was to solve the problem of disposal of th e sewage. Under his direction, huge sewage farms utilizing sewage for agricultural purp oses were built and operated. 31 On the one hand, sewage farms were planned so that the y would remain adequate with the growth of the city, and on the other hand, at t he same time, they had to generate sufficient revenue, so that their maintenance was p aid for. Virchow remained active in research. He made contri butions in pathology, hygiene, and 29 The journal was also known as Virchow's Archiv . See \"Virchow, Rudolf,\" op. cit. , p. 152. 31 crops best suited to sewage farming are peren nials like the grasses, although vegetables and a variety of other crops ha ve been successfully grown with sewage.

The International Encyclopedia . Dodd, Mead and Company. Vol. XX, p. 754. 245 also excelled as a parasitologist, but he did not r eadily accept the newer views and discoveries of Koch and Behring with respect to tox ins and antitoxins. (\"Virchow, Rudolf,\" op. cit ., p. 176). By praising Virchow's contributions alo ng with those by Koch in the fight against infectious diseases, Althoff f inally succeeded to integrate Virchow's contributions into the new field of microbiology. ( Eckart, op. cit. , p. 390). Virchow was politically active and a member of the Prussian Diet. When in 1897 the Emperor wanted to fire Leo Arons, a lecturer at the Philosophical Faculty, for his critical views of public institutions, Virchow heavily criti cized Althoff. Arons was Jewish and a Socialist. Althoff did not follow the wish of the E mperor to fire Arons immediately, but created the legislative basis on which Arons could be fired a year later. This was a controversial measure, referred to as Lex Arons . (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 388). After Virchow withdrew from politics at the national level, he ke pt his seat in the state diet until his death. He was also a distinguished archaeologist, w ho contributed greatly to the success of Heinrich Schliemann. Robert Koch (1843-1910) Robert Koch started out as a district physician in West Prussia. Althoff was decisive in enabling Koch's career. 32 In 1890, after having discovered Tuberculin, Koch asked the Prussian Ministry of Culture to establish a researc h institute with a clinical part, so that he could combine experiments in bacteriology with r esearch and therapy of infectious diseases. In order to pursue the new endeavor, he w anted to give up leadership of the Berlin Hygiene Institute of which he had been direc tor since 1885. The Prussian Diet approved the project and the Ministry of Finance pr ovided an amount of 500 000 Mark for building the Institute of Infectious Diseases. However, while the Prussian Diet was in the process of approval for annual running costs of 165 000 Mark for the almost finished institute, the early successes of Tubercul in began to dissipate. Outspoken opponents were against approving funds for the inst itute, among them Virchow. In a patriotic speech, Althoff convinced the majority of the members of the Diet to vote for approval of the institute's annual funds. He stress ed Virchow's role in the advancement of microbiology and his fight against infectious di seases, and was thereby able to reduce Virchow's opposition to the project. At the same time, he emphasized Koch's role in innovative bacteriology, which could lead t o progress in healing infectious diseases. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 391). In 1891, Robert Koch became the directo r of the new institute; among its 25 employees were Emil Beh ring and Paul Ehrlich, both proteg\u00e9s of Althoff. Emil Adolf Behring (1854-1917) Behring studied medicine in Berlin. He became an ar my surgeon and started research 32 Vom Brocke wrote that without Althoff, Koch had ne ver been able to receive a chair in Berlin, to become director of the Institut e of Infectious Diseases, and to become a member of the Academy. 1980, op. cit ., p. 93. 246 on specific bacterial toxins. This work he continue d as an assistant of Koch at the Institute of Infectious Diseases in Berlin. Togethe r with Shibasaburo Kitasato (1859- 1956), another assistant of Koch, Behring showed th e formation of antitoxins. (Eckart, op. cit ., p. 393). This marked the beginning of blood seru m therapy. Behring wanted to ward off infectious diseases with antitoxins to be produced by the body itself in an immune response. Althoff met Behring in 1892 when h e presented his research on tetanus. In 1894, he appointed him as a professor a t the University of Halle, but Behring was not happy with the environment. He rath er wanted to be at Marburg, but the faculty rejected him. After threatening to take an appointment outside of Prussia, Behring received in 1895 a call from Althoff to hea d the Hygienic Institute at Marburg which was modeled after the Institute Pasteur in Pa ris. 33 Behring discovered the diphtheria antitoxin and made contributions to the study of immunity. Diphtheria was a major cause of death for children. Early in the nin eties, his work led to the production of a vaccination serum for diphtheria and tetanus. In 1901, Behring received the Nobel Prize in medicine for his discovery of the diphther ia serum. He devoted the money associated with the Nobel Prize to Marburg tubercul osis institutions. In the same year, he also received a Prussian hereditary knighthood. In 1904, a contract with Hoechst was concluded and the private Marburg research labo ratories became independent as Behringwerke . When the contract with Hoechst ended, serum was p roduced in Marburg. In 1905, Behring discovered a substance fr om the tuberculosis virus, which could be used in immunizations to prevent bovine tu berculosis. In 1913 he discovered a new diphtheria serum. His major publications incl uded Die Blutserumtherapie (Blood Serum Therapy), 1892, 1894, and Beitr\u00e4ge zur experimentellen Therapie (Contributions to Experimental Therapy), 1900. 34 In his book on diphtheria, Behring thanked Althoff for his help and support. 35 Paul Ehrlich (1845-1915) Althoff gave Paul Ehrlich an institute where he cou ld perform his medical research. Being Jewish, he had worked at Koch's institute wit h little hope of a regular university career. Paul Ehrlich was famous for his research in experimental therapeutics. He studied at Breslau, Strassburg, Freiburg, and Leipz ig, receiving his degree of M.D. in 33 Behring kept close contacts to the Institute Pasteur and to French medicine. For more details, compare Harry W. Paul. 1990. \"Die Ent wicklung der Bestehens. (Research between Politics Society. History of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-/Max-Planck-Gesellschaft ). Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, Emil Adolf.\" 1923 (2) The New International Encyclopedia , op. cit. , Vol. III, p. 76. 35 Zeiss, H. und Bieling, R. 1941. Behring. Gestalt und (Behring. Man Work). Schultz Verlag, p. 93. 247 1878. In 1885 he was appointed assistant in the Uni versity clinic at Berlin, where he became Privatdozent in 1889. In 1890, he became a m ember of the new Institution for Infectious Diseases and professor in the University . In 1896, he was appointed director of the Royal Institute for Serum Research at Steglitz. When it became too encumber some to work at the small institute, Althoff got in contact with the mayor of Frankfurt for funding the new institute. He succeeded and the cit y of Frankfurt almost entirely financed the new institute. After the institute had moved to Frankfurt, in 1899, it became the Royal Institute for Experimental Therapeutics . It was part of the city hospital of Frankfurt and in the vicinity of Hoechst Farbwerke , the main producer of vaccines at the time. Althoff succeeded to gain the financial means from a foundation for building a larger institute, the Georg Speyer-Haus which was opened in 1906. The financial means provided also covered running research expend itures for experimentation. In a letter to Althoff, Ehrlich wrote: \"I personall y owe you my entire career...\" 36 Among many orders and decorations, he received honorary d egrees from G\u00f6ttingen, Chicago (1904), Oxford (1907), and Breslau (1911). In 1908, he received the Nobel Prize for medicine, together with Metchnikoff. Among his cont ributions are important studies in the histology of the blood and in immunity reaction s and research work in cancer. He also did research work on the sleeping disease and discovered salvarsan and neosalvarsan, arsenic compounds, of great efficacy in the treatment of syphilis. The examples presented in this subsection illustrat e how the Althoff System operated in the domain of medicine and health care. Althoff had a vision of the direction in which to go in the domain of medicine and health care. He took different measures to realize his objectives. One of them was regulation of exami nation and certification of physicians. A second measure was foundation of new institutes, such as a teaching hospital, two academies for practical medicine, an institute for education in tropical medicine, with a number of new hospitals, general a s well as hospitals for healing tuberculosis, an institute for neurological researc h, and an institute focusing on the reduction of infant mortality. As a third measure, Althoff undertook reorganization and extension of existing institutes, such as the Chari t\u00e9 hospital in Berlin and the introduction of medical studies at the University o f M\u00fcnster. He used his informational network to track important new developments in medi cal research and to identify talented researchers, such as Koch, Behring, Ehrlic h, and Virchow. He used his authority to push through their appointments. In th e process, academic freedom and diversity were enhanced. Opportunities for innovati ve research and teaching were created and could be realized thanks to Althoff's i ngenuity in attracting finances from various public and private sources. It is difficult to directly trace the effect of the Althoff System with respect to the output it produces. In the area of medicine and health care, the output is an improvement of the health states of people. Because of the difficulty of direct measurement, an indirect approach is proposed. In what follows, the Althoff System will be interpreted from the perspective of property rights theory. 36 In the original German quote this reads as follows : \"Ich 248 10.4 The Althoff System from the Perspective of Property Rights Theory Behind Althoff's science policy stands a systematic approach that has been subject to investigation. 37 By studying the Althoff System , insights into the institutional conditions for productive academic research can be gained. 38 The economic theory of property rights of Alchian and Demsetz is used here as a par adigm in order to understand how the Althoff System works. 39 Alchian and Demsetz have identified three bundles o f property rights which characterize the structure of a firm that will lead to the efficient production of output and behavior of the firm. The same set of property righ ts can be used to analyze academic organizations as producers of research and teaching . The Althoff System can be interpreted as a policy transforming the traditiona l set of property rights into academia. The conditions and basic property rights with respe ct to the Althoff System have been summarized as follows: The first bundle of three rights concerns the use ( usus ) of resources in the firm and involves more specifically the: (1) control over inputs and outputs; (2) control over the composition of the membership of the production team (hiring and firing); (3) consolidation of all contracts a firm enters i nto the hands of one contracting agent. The second bundle consists of just one right ( usus fructus ) and involves the (4) right to claim the residual profit after all e xpenses have been met. Finally, the third bundle ( abusus ) represents (5) the prerogative to change the organization, se ll it or liquidate. 37 See, for instance, the contributions to the confer ence volume: \"The Economics of Science Althoff Syste m.\" J\u00fcrgen Backhaus. Guest editor, 1993, op. cit. Althoff's program has been reprinted in the contri bution by vom Brocke, 1991, op. cit. dissertation by Lode Vereeck ( op. cit. ). He investigated the influence of institutional change on behavior of sc holars and productivity, and worked out the conditions for an efficient allocati on of academic resources. 39 In order to describe the behavior of an organizati on, it is useful to look at the property rights structure of the organization. If a change occurs, the members of the organization will respond to the change by exer cising the prerogatives they have. In economics, these prerogatives are called p roperty rights. Armen A. Alchian and Harold Demsetz. 1972. \"Production, Info rmation Costs, and Economic Organization.\" American Economic Review . 62, pp. 777-795. 249 This constellation of property rights will emerge if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Team production is more productive than indivi dual production. This implies that the individual contributions to the to tal product are not separable and there is consequently a measuring problem in de termining the individual marginal productivity of the team members. (2) The marginal productivity of the individual fa ctors of production is best determined by monitoring input performance. If both of these conditions are met, the classical firm is likely to arise. The classical firm is characterized by the specific bun dle of property rights mentioned above. Its rationale is the composition of several inputs into one production process. The need for this composition is also the reason for the requirement that all contracts have to be concentrated with one decision maker. 40 In looking at the process of academic research and teaching in general, and medicine in particular, we should first try to determine whe ther the two conditions are met. With respect to the first condition, the question is whe ther individual contributions can be separated in the production process or whether it i s more effective to produce in a team. In the simplest case, there is a single profe ssor who performs his own research. Complicated conditions, however, require a team, an d most likely a more intricate team structure. The rise of the medical profession requi red large clinical compounds so that the value of new medical procedures and drugs could be tested by comparing a large number of similar conditions. Institutes were requi red that could not be sustained by the traditional university system, but were supported b y and sometimes attached to industry. The second condition is also met, because the marginal productivity of the different members of the team is difficult to measu re in output terms, hence input behavior is typically observed. Hence, in the case of academic production both conditions are met for the classical firm to arise. In what follows, we take a look at the Althoff System and interpret the changes it brought about in the academic organization according to the five property rights summarized ab ove. Althoff's strategy is seen here as a set of interventions analogous to the role pla yed by the owner/manager of a firm, who uses his property rights in setting up and runn ing a firm. Concerning the first bundle of property rights abou t the use of resources in the firm we can note that Althoff took control over inputs and outputs of the academic production process in various ways. Traditional restrictions a t the universities hindered the flow of personnel inputs. Althoff opened up the traditional university system to talented researchers belonging to minorities and to the outs ide by facilitating travel and introducing international exchange programs for pro fessors. 41 These measures were 40 These conditions are according to J\u00fcrgen Backhaus. 1993, op. cit ., pp. 15, 16. The conditions mentioned are necessary, but not suf ficient conditions. Other alternative constellations of property rights might exist which are equally efficient. The necessary conditions mentioned indic ate why the classical firm has emerged in the present form. 41 The letter by Ehrlich, in which he thanked Althoff for his career, is at the same 250 directed towards improving the quality of academic output. As has been shown in section 10.2 above, academic output is a public goo d loaded with externalities and, hence, it can not be evaluated easily. In the tradi tional university system, the main instrument of control remains the enforcement of pr ofessional standards by peers which occurs in a self-regulating environment. (J\u00fcr gen Backhaus, 1993, op. cit ., p. 17). In his fight against slack and nepotism, Althoff st imulated the system of peer control. By requiring faculty members to write research reports listing publications and projects undertaken he reached more transparency, a measure directed to reduce slack. In some cases, however, he added qualified outsiders t o the faculty or researchers who followed a different approach. An example is the ap pointment of the general pediatrician Otto Heubner, whom Althoff, in an auto cratic move, had offered a chair at the Charit\u00e9. Heubner followed a different approach from his colleagues concerning the methods to reduce infant mortality. Heubner's influ ence terblichkeit (Empress Infant Mortality) was subst antial. (Eckart, op. cit. , p. 383). Another example is the appointment of Behring. The faculty at Marburg had rejected Behring for three times, before Althoff called him to Marburg. Althoff was a successful fundraiser, who tapped fin ancial resources from industry and banking, private sources, communities, and higher s tate levels. 42 For instance in a period of four months he convinced German sponsors to grant a total of 1.5 million marks for the Empress Friedrich Institute for Postg raduate Education in Medicine in Berlin (1906). (Vereeck, op. cit ., p. 78). The new institute structure, supported b y Althoff as an institutional response to further scientific developments, required more funds than the traditional university system. Financing i nstitutes and special projects was a challenge, Althoff met in many ingenious ways. For instance, at Marburg Althoff financed a new chair in ear-, nose-, and throat dis eases without the support of the Minister of Finance. By convincing Otto K\u00f6rner to r enounce his pension for an honorary professorship, he was able to endow the chair. The incentives Althoff used in order to finance academic research included the presentation of honors and licenses to the donors. (Vereeck, op. cit., p. 76). In order to coo rdinate the different sources of funding, Althoff created a central fund which later became t he Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft . (Vereeck, op. cit. , p. 79). Despite Koch's success in research on tub erculosis, the illness remained a disease threatening broad circle s of the population. (Eckart, op. cit. , p. 384). By centralizing funds, Althoff brought the so-called Heilst\u00e4ttenbewegung , a movement and fund-drive of ordinary citizens to fin ance hospitals and treatment of tuberculosis and lung-related diseases, to a succes s. Initiated by the internist von Leyden, the movement reached the attention of the C hancellor of the Empire, but suffered from splintering in many different local e fforts, before Althoff undertook action. Althoff's efforts at directly monitoring output inv olved the establishment of an time a strong criticism of the traditional universi ty system. Ehrlich belonged to a minority and had thus almost no access to a regular university career. 42 As has been shown in section 10.2, academic resear ch and teaching are public goods which produce externalities. This implies tha t the academic production process is difficult to finance. 251 informational network. In medicine, the size of the informational network was substantial. In the case of the appointment of Behr ing, Althoff contacted the following experts: A. Laubenheimer, professor at Farbwerke Hoechst ; R. Pfeiffer, expert in bacteriology; H. Schaper, director of the Charit\u00e9 hospital and surgeon; E. Hitzig, H. both belonged to the Marburg faculty. 43 In the case of appointments, Althoff sought the advice of different experts in the same or closely related fields. He established an informati onal network in virtually every discipline. While the benefits are better informati on, networking does not come without cost. It is a time-consuming affair as it consists in extensive correspondence and meetings necessary for building up personal relatio ns. Moreover, this feature of his work sometimes met with fierce criticism, in partic ular when it was perceived as a threat to academic freedom. Althoff took direct and indirect control over the c omposition of the membership of the academic production team. The traditional faculty h ad the co-optation right. This means that the professors of the various disciplines form ing the faculty would vote on a new appointment and decide by majority rule. While the final appointment was by the sovereign of a country, it was expected that the so vereign followed the faculty's recommendation. The co-optation right was an import ant safeguard of academic freedom, but had a severe drawback. It enabled nepo tism, a tendency towards hiring mediocre candidates who would not pose a challenge to the old faculty members. By overruling the majority vote of the faculty, Althof f put an end to such practices. If he had the better qualified candidate, he simply would app oint him without taking the preferences of the faculty into account. In this se nse, Althoff took direct control over the composition of the membership of the faculty. He al so took indirect control, because he gave the traditional faculty an incentive to seek i nformation and to subsequently hire the best qualified candidates available in order to secure its right of co-optation. In some cases, when he wanted to push a certain candid ate, Althoff tried to provide the faculties with information before a decision was ta ken. Towards the end of the 19th century, the academic p roduction process underwent a change. The old faculty structure of individual pro fessors loosely connected to each other could no longer deal efficiently with the new challenges posed by industrialization. The industrial development had significant effects in relation to disease. New diseases emerged among the proletarian class of the cities, and this required new ways to view and treat these diseases. In order to meet these ch allenges, Althoff created new organizations in health care. He founded institutes and hospitals to further experimental and diagnostic research. 44 The institute structure required team production. 43 Althoff's informational network in the case of the appointment of Behring has been documented by Eckart, op. cit ., 1991, p. 394. 44 This approach was not restricted to medicine, but related to other disciplines as well. The Schmoller program is an example that illu strates the new approach in social research. J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, 1989, op. cit. , pp. 48-49. 252 Concerning the first bundle of property rights, all contracts became consolidated into the hands of one contracting agent, the appointed c hair holder or institute director, who worked out a clear cut research program. All of the institute's resources served this program. Concerning the second bundle of property r ights, we can note that the institute director had the right to claim the resid ual profit after all expenses have been met, thus ensuring that the residual income would b e used for the benefit of the institute. With regard to the third bundle of prope rty rights, we find that the institute director had the right to substantially change the institute structure by virtue of its research program. Both conditions, under which this constellation of property rights will emerge, are met. Under the institute structure, pro ductivity of the team is higher than productivity of the sum of individual team members producing separately. This implies that individual contributions are not separable. Th e marginal productivity of the individual team members cannot be measured, but as a substitute indicator one can monitor input behavior. Criteria are the specific r esearch procedures and teaching approaches, which follow from the institute's progr am. The traditional university structure with loose cha ir holders still remained important in the era Althoff. Among the loose chair holders, Alt hoff himself was the central monitor. He pushed for a unification of examination requirem ents and the harmonization of faculty bylaws, thus improving the quality of resea rch and teaching. The professors belonging to a traditional university faculty had n o common research program. By providing information to the individual chair holde rs, Althoff improved the decision- making process of the faculty. (J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, op. cit ., pp. 20, 21). He also tried to become the residual claimant, for instance by cappi ng lecture fees above a certain amount. Professors had the right to collect lecture fees from each student. Althoff set a limit to the amount of lecture fees that professors were allowed to keep. Lecture fees gathered above the limit were to the benefit of the university. This was a measure to lessen the intensity of competition among professor s. By raising base salaries and capping lecture fees, while at the same time increa sing capacity and making faculties more attractive through outstanding appointments, h e transmuted himself (the Ministry of Culture) into a residual claimant. The characteristics of basic research as a public g ood loaded with externalities make it difficult to find marketable applications. 45 Despite this difficulty, Althoff was interested in applications of basic research. An illustration is the following case: Sometimes basic research can be readily applied an d the residual may be partly claimed in order to channel funds back into the res earch activity. The case of Behring is illustrative. Mass production of the dip htheria serum was clearly in the interest of the state, since it clearly affected th e health status of the population. Granting the right to mass produce the serum to the Hoechst Corporation created a rent for which the company was willing to fund Behring's research institute. The state took its cut by regulating the national prices for the serum. (J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, op. cit ., p. 22). 45 If the academic product is marketable, then residu al claimancy can even extend to the tax state, an implication Althoff was aware of. 253 Althoff was a central monitor and residual claimant . In some cases, he established a monopoly, as in the case of serum production at the Hoechst Corporation. Within the institute structure, he assigned the ins titute director the role of central monitor and a residual claimant. Within the faculty structure, he was the central monitor and residual claimant himself and set incentives to make better informed decisions. While property rights analysis leads a long way tow ards explaining the features of the Althoff System , there are competing theories which lead to additi onal insights. For instance, Tullock posed the question whether the ba ckwardness of the social sciences is a result of the prevailing social organizations in the social sciences. 46 He held that institutional changes in the organization of academ ic institutions could improve the quality of research and teaching. For the American environment, Tullock arrived at the result that the multiplicity of methods, as well as controlled experiments, led to an advantage of natural sciences over social sciences. He found that moral and political views held by the profession mattered. As measures to raise the quality of the social sciences, he suggested to create transparency, and to add highly qualified professionals to the faculty, even if they were out siders. In this light, we can interpret the so-called Lex Arons , (as discussed above) to which not only Virchow, b ut also Schmoller was opposed. By creating a legislative ba sis for the lay-off of the physicist, Althoff at least achieved transparency in an undesi rable matter, perhaps preventing similar events from happening. 47 We have seen above that he opened the universities to outsiders, for instance to Koch and Ehrlich, who otherwise could not have had a career in the Prussian university system. By these strategies and the introduction of new organizational forms, Althoff created incentive compatible, academic structures. 10.5 Summary and Conclusions Friedrich Althoff received an honorary PhD from Har vard University for his successful efforts at restructuring the university and teachin g landscapes in these parts of Germany, where his influence prevailed. Harvard par ticularly emphasized his impact on restructuring organizations in which instruction an d research takes place. The term Althoff System , interpreted as a set of connected points that wor k together, proved felicitous in emphasizing that medicine and health policy are two areas that have to be seen as interrelated. Here lies the strength of Alt hoff's effort in the area of health. As should be plain from the discussion in this chap ter, the Althoff System changed the conditions for science and scholarship and this had implications for the structure of medicine and public health, the focus of this chapt er. For instance, Althoff tried to 46 Gordon Tullock. 1966. The Organization of Inquiry . Durham: Duke University Press. 47 Academic freedom had to be protected at the time. J\u00fcrgen Backhaus, op. cit ., p. 23. 254 improve the quality of studies by influencing unive rsities' bylaws regulating studies and exams, including dissertations and habilitations. I n medicine, this would lead to better physicians and a higher quality of health care prov ided. Other major efforts towards an improvement in the quality of health care included the foundation of new institutes both within and outside of universities, depending on th e requirement of a project. This opened up new lines of research, leading towards un foreseen applications. Diverse sources for funding, both public and private, had t o be identified and organized. Althoff tried to find the candidates best suited for a posi tion, independent of other characteristics such as religion. He also offered c hairs to Jewish scholars, who otherwise had little chances at traditional univers ities. Sometimes a professor was named to head an institute even against the wishes of the faculty, as in Behring's case. Hospital foundations and the reorganization of exis ting hospitals took place. Althoff supported physicians' continuing education. During the era Althoff, progress has been made with respect to administration and legislation . Two major projects pursued by Althoff included the campaign against tuberculosis and the reduction in the mortality of newborns. The economic theory of property rights of Alchian a nd Demsetz is used here as a paradigm in order to understand how the Althoff System works. Applying property rights theory, the Althoff System can be interpreted as a systematic effort to trans form the right of using the resources within an academic institution, the right to reorganize it and the right to claim residual profits within the institution, in such a way that the switch from individual to team production could be made, t hus realizing the benefits of higher productivity of a team compared to separately worki ng individuals. The essential points in the present chapter have be en, first, to show that Althoff improved the informational basis. On this basis, he secondly tried to make the best university or academic appointment and opened the s ystem to the outside by promoting international exchange programs. Third, h e ensured academic freedom and diversity of ideas by giving outsiders a chance. Fo urth, he used multi-source financing in order to further maverick ideas. In his policies , he combined a rise in the quality of medical education with an improvement of public hea lth.

He identified overcrowding, poor foo d, exposure to cold and damp, prolonged and exhausting work, and unhealthy occupa tions as factors lowering the resistance to disease and making people prone to il lness and early death. Oppenheimer widened his scope and studied what he c alled \"social illness.\" 1 He proposed the agricultural cooperatives ( Siedlungsgenossenschaften ) as the basis for a healthy life. While health economics is typically d one in terms of looking at the specific health conditions, institutions, and costs, Oppenhe imer looked at the social and economic conditions, which gave rise to poor or bet ter health. In this sense, he is a meta health economist. Franz Oppenheimer was born 1864 in Hanover; the fam ily later moved to Berlin, where his father was a preacher in a Jewish Reformed Comm unity. 2 Oppenheimer became a physician, but as he noted in his autobiography, th is was an increasingly frustrating experience. He described that he often was not able to treat tuberculosis patients, despite a method of treatment available, because he was not able to keep them out of an health endangering job for a period long enough so that their health would be completely restored; he often could not help infant s, who died, because they received spoilt milk or were kept in overly heated and crowd ed rental quarters. (1929, op. cit ., p. 77). Oppenheimer realized early in his practice of how important economic, environmental and social circumstances were for peo ple's health. Oppenheimer practiced medicine for ten years, befor e he decided rather abruptly to switch the approach, but not the basic preoccupatio n. While hiking in the Harz Mountains one night, the basic idea of his work str uck him like a flash of lightning. The land rent operates like a \"lock\" on economic develo pment ( Bodensperre ). 3 Any \"social 1 Oppenheimer was by no means the first physician to realize that epidemics, illnesses and deaths are related to the environment such as crowding, poverty, and other social causes. As Paracelsus noted himsel f, there is a strong correlation to the environmental circumstances unde r which people live and their health state. He proposed to look for the remedy in the immediate environment of a patient.

(Extended 261 ill\" that he diagnosed in society, he ultimately tr aced back to the \"lock\" of the land rent. His new area of research became the state sciences, in particular economics and sociology. In 1909, he received in Berlin his habil itation at the behest of Schmoller and Wagner by the faculty of the humanities for both, e conomics and sociology. He himself used to emphasize that his field was economic and sociological theory . In 1919, he accepted a call to the chair of sociology and econo mics in Frankfurt. He left the chair in 1929 and went back to Berlin in order to establish his projects of cooperative agricultural settlements. After the National-Social ists came to power, he published in Amsterdam, but did not leave Germany until 1938, wh en he emigrated via Japan and Shanghai to the United States. Oppenheimer died in Los Angelos in 1943. 4 The experience as a physician left an imprint on Op penheimer's work in economics and sociology. In his autobiography, he also mentio ned important precursors: So I came to my real profession with completely cl ear concepts of the natural sciences, of the structure and functioning of a hig her organism in health and illness; and here I found the leading thoughts for my work of life. This becomes even obvious to someone, who is only slightly famil iar with my work. The same can be said of the many physicians before me, who b ecame famous in the history of the social sciences: Bernard de Mandevil le, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, Charles Hall, Thompson, Victor Aim\u00e9 Huber and other s.\" 5 One of the physicians, who had turned to the social sciences before him, was Bernard de Mandeville (1670-1733). He wondered how people c ould promote their common interests, if they all acted individually in their own self interest. He found that by acting in the own self interest, people also further the i nterests of society as a whole. This he illustrated in a poem, \"The Grumbling Hive, or Knav es Turn'd Honest,\" (1695). In the poem, he described a hive of bees that abolished th e evils of their society, and then found that the society had vanished with the vices. They had been prosperous while wicked, but poor when they reformed. 6 Mandeville considered self-interest as a vice, Landholding and the Social Berlin: 2, pp. 514-517. 5 The original German reads: \"... So aber ich mi t e in Bernard de Mandeville, ein Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, ein Charles Hall, ein Thompson, ein Victor Aim\u00e9 Huber und andere.\" Oppenheimer, 1929, op. cit ., p. 77. 6 Hayek described Mandeville as a forerunner of the laissez-faire economy, whose work had been read by Adam Smith. Friedrich A . von Hayek. 1966. \"Dr. 262 and self-denial as a virtue. He showed that society is based on vices such as pride, self-interest, and the desire for luxury. Thus, vic es are at the basis of economic well- being of a society. In 1714, he portrayed a complex society in The Fable of the Bees . Co-operation of individuals occurred unknowingly, b ecause they all acted in their own self-interest; for instance, pursuing the vice of l uxury would result in employment opportunities of the poor. On the basis of these th oughts, Mandeville concluded that the economic well-being of society was best achieved, w hen there was a minimum of government interference, or interference by charita ble organizations. Like Mandeville, Oppenheimer was concerned with the question of how the common best of society could be reached, but he did not th ink that this should be reached by pursuing vices. Oppenheimer was opposed to Mandevil le's social policy recommendations. For instance, Mandeville wanted to keep the working class in a state of dependency. Limited schooling and low wage s were among the measures to hold the working class down. Mandeville thought tha t it was necessary to have a pool of people who were looking for employment. If every one would pursue the vice of luxury, then there were not enough people, who were willing to work. Oppenheimer opposed this conclusion by Mandeville, but shared w ith him the lead question and also the dislike for government and charity interference . Oppenheimer was also influenced by the work of Fran \u00e7ois Quesnay (1694-1774), a surgeon, who was compelled to abandon surgery for m edicine because of defective eyesight. In 1749 he became physician to Madame de Pompadour ( i.e. the French King's powerful mistress), and he was appointed phy sician to the King in 1752. This position offered him free time for philosophical an d economic studies. In 1756, he published in the Encyclop\u00e9die articles on \"Fermiers\" and \"Grains,\" in which he analyzed the deficiencies of French agriculture. He advocated the adoption of capitalistic methods in farming and the abolition o f the vexatious taxes and restrictions, which were impoverishing French peasants. Quesnay a dvanced the doctrine that the sole source of national wealth is the surplus of ag riculture, the produit net . In 1758 he published his Tableau \u00e9conomique .7 Quesnay is the founder of the School of Physiocracy. Like Quesnay, Oppenheimer focused on t he rural sectors of the industrial society, but his approach was different. By proposi ng the cooperative settlement, or Kibbutz , and thus making farm workers capital-owners, he f ound an original solution to the Social Question .

Trying to Overcome Communism in a Positive Way by S olving the Problem of 263 Oppenheimer demanded the abolishment of large lande d estates and foundation of cooperative agricultural settlements. He further de veloped the topic in his other major works Grossgrundeigentum und soziale Frage [ Extended Landholding and the Social Question ] (1898), 10 and Theorie der Reinen und Politischen \u00d6konomie [ Theory of Pure and Political Economy ] (1919). 11 Oppenheimer is the founder of a system of sociolog y, System der Soziologie , which appeared in three volumes (1922-1924). 12 He was also a co-founder of the American Journal of Economics and Sociology . Oppenheimer's analysis of the role of the individua l in the family is fundamental to health economics and will be presented in section 1 1.2. His basic idea of the \"lock on land\" and consequences for the \"health\" of society and economy will be discussed in section 11.3. A summary and conclusions follow. 11.2 The Individual's Circle of Provision In his Theory of the Pure and Political Economy , Oppenheimer distinguished human actions caused by the economic impulse from the mor e playful ones, which he excluded from economic consideration. (1919 (4), op. cit. , p. 22). According to Oppenheimer, individuals and groups of people are b usy with the acquisition and administration of material goods in order to satisf y needs of all kinds, an activity that goes beyond the egoistic self-provision with goods. It also includes the provision with goods of those family members, who are not able to work. The core family not only consists of working members, but also encompasses p ersons, who are not yet or no longer able to work such as children, the handicapp ed, the mentally ill, or the chronically ill. (1919 (4), op. cit. , p. 143). Therefore, Oppenheimer argued that the c ore family cannot form the basic unit in the economic s ociety. Rather, the individual with its circle of provision forms the normal, elementary or gan of an economic society. (1919 (4), op. cit. , p. 144). In order to undermine his view, Oppenhei mer gave the example of an isolated individual, which could not be the basi c unit of society, because men are not able to survive in an isolated state. A baby ca nnot feed itself and an isolated human being cannot be reproductive. (1919 (4), op. cit. , p. 5). Hence, the family is the collective organism of the smallest size, but the r elevant unit of decision-making is that individual family member, which carries responsibil ity for others. Like Sch\u00e4ffle, Oppenheimer used analogies to the hu man body in order to explain social and economic phenomena, but he thought that Sch\u00e4ffle carried the analogies too far. 13 Oppenheimer identified as the fundamental differen ce between individuals and Cooperatives and the Agricultural Question). Berlin : Vigh, Deutsches Verlagshaus. 1923/24: Jena: Gustav F ischer. 13 By comparing the body of men to the body of societ y, Sch\u00e4ffle developed a thoroughly sociological system. He continued the ol d tradition of \"body politic,\" 264 society the life-cycle, to which individuals are su bject to, but society is not. According to Oppenheimer, illness and death are related to an in dividual's ability to adjust. In the case of an older person, the ability to adjust to o uter changes approaches zero. A person becomes ill and eventually dies, if the oute r changes are too strong to cope with, for instance, caused by a trauma such as an i njury from falling, getting hurt in an accident, by a vicious infectious disease, or by an unhealthy way of life. 14 While individuals are subjected to a life-cycle, society is not, and can thus not be compared to a functioning organism. Herein, Oppenheimer saw the limits of using analogies to the human body in order to explain economic and sociolo gical phenomena. While individual lives end with death, society renews its elf and is virtually immortal. Oppenheimer tried to explain the forces that shape the social process, an approach he called the theory of organicism . He is the founder of a system of sociology, which has been published in three volumes. 15 It can be noted that Oppenheimer's treatment of the core family might have reflected the social reality of his time, but he did not inve stigate the economic consequences of support relationships. It was, for instance, not un common that children, providing support to their elderly parents in the case of fai ling health, in exchange took over the family property at no price or at a reduced price. Did this make the parents entirely dependent on the children? The parents' economic an d social status might remain high, despite the support they receive from their c hildren. Oppenheimer's treatment of the difference between the individual and society a lso remains superficial, because not only individuals are subject to a life-cycle, but s ocieties can be abolished as well. In what follows, attention will not be paid to his ext ensive sociological contributions, but to his economic work, in particular with respect to he alth. 11.3 The Basics of Land Rent Theory In investigating the Social Question , Oppenheimer saw poverty in rural areas and the labor question of the cities as related to each oth er. As a physician, he looked for the leading cause in order to explain rural poverty, lo w wages of the workers in the cities, economic misery, and unhealthy conditions such as m oral and hygienic squalor. These which presumed that the harmony of the body was ref lected in the harmony of society. Albert Sch\u00e4ffle. Bau und Leben des Socialen K\u00f6rpers .

He found that the dominant cause consisted in the ownership of large properties of land. (1898, op. cit. ). Oppenheimer coined the term \"Bodensperre\" (lock on land) in order to illustrate the impossibility for the workers to get access to the land. He considered it a shortcoming in Adam Smith' exchange economy that th e ownership of the land did not play a major role, a \"phenomenon of law,\" which he polemically called \"bastard of law,\" \"expression of the law of violence\" (Oppenheimer , 1898, op. cit. , p. 94). He held that the ownership of the land in the hands of a few lar ge property owners was a major factor in maintaining an unequal distribution of we alth and notably life chances. His reasoning was as follows: In his Theory of Pure and Political Economy , Oppenheimer distinguished between an economy before and after accumulation of wealth. He inquired whether the unequal accumulation of wealth was due to individual differ ences. Individuals differ according to skills and levels of energy so that they are distin guished in their ability to perform, and they differ in temper and character as well. (Oppen heimer, 1898, op. cit. , p. 93). Over time, however, Oppenheimer has found that the wealt h of the individuals has not increased according to their productivity or other individual characteristics. 16 Therefore, he continued to inquire into other causes. Oppenheimer identified a more fundamental source re sponsible for the unevenness of distribution of goods than existing individual diff erences, namely differences in the land rents between the cities and rural areas. On the ba sis of D\u00fchring's theory, Oppenheimer formulated an answer to the question, h ow an uneven distribution in land could come into existence. 17 He went far back into cultural history in order t o explain differences in wealth. When nomads started to have herds of cattle, men captured in wars became valuable as a force of labor, and there fore did not get killed when being captured, but lost their freedom. They became slave s of the nomads, who now could afford to have larger herds, for which they needed more land. Wealth increased predominantly around the property of the already ex isting owners of herds, thus creating the beginning of wealth differences. (Oppe nheimer, 1898, op. cit. , p. 26). Oppenheimer described another historic example of s lavery in order to show that the concern for health and life of slaves depended on e conomic considerations. Slave owners in North America were concerned about the de aths of the slaves, because it affected the profitability of slave investments. De ath rates reflected, and were in part determined by, such factors as diet, physical treat ment, hard labor, and the quality of medical care and housing. All these factors were un der the control of the slave owners. Oppenheimer showed that at the time, when the price of the slaves was low due to the high quantity of slaves supplied, the slaves were f orced to hard labor and a high death rate resulted (1919 (4), op. cit. , p. 404). In times, when the price of the slaves w as high due to a limited supply, the owners of the slaves w ould treat them better, which was 16 Franz Oppenheimer. Critical History of Economics and Socialism). Berlin: T. Grieben. 266 reflected in a lower death rate. (1919 (4), op. cit. , p. 405). Similarly, the freedom of the fiefs in the feudal p roto capitalist economy was restricted. Oppenheimer studied the economic, social, and legal constraints of the fiefs. Since they are tied to the land, they cannot seek alterna te, more productive employment and therefore have a low value, not even a market price as a slave does. Accordingly, their treatment is often marked by neglect. Their status of fiefs prevents them from entering the labor market. Due to this market restriction, e xclusion from the labor market, poverty hit rural areas first, long before it appea red as a problem in the cities. The structure of feudal land ownership works like a \"lo ck\" on economic development, because the land cannot freely change hands. The fi efs are tied to the land and so they are tied to the \"lock.\" They cannot leave the land, nor have access to their own. Their reproductive behavior reflects the lack in outlook. The rate of birth was high among the fiefs, but the rate of infant mortality was also hi gh, so that the rate of reproduction was below that of the current generation. When capitali sm emerged, it gave the fiefs, who had not been able to choose in virtually any area o f their own life, freedom by moving to the cities. The emergence of capitalism had effects on the land rents. In the large cities where industrialization started, the land rents were very high. The result was that industrial workers had to live in crowded quarters under unhea lthy living conditions. Despite this situation, Oppenheimer has argued that for workers living in poverty in rural areas, the move to the large cities, where they become part of the reservoir of unskilled industrial workers, would still be an improvement. They gain f reedom and face at least a slight chance to get ahead. By competing with each other f or work, workers are pressing the wages down. The consequences are decreasing prices in general, which have a repercussion on the industrial worker class. As pri ces decrease, entrepreneurs increase production by hiring more workers. Oppenheimer's diagnosis is that of an \"ill economy; \" 18 more workers are attracted to the cities at ever lower wages. In this situation, poverty, illness, and a very low standard of life characterize the industrial worker class. I n an effort to survive, the workers turn to beggary, criminal behavior, and prostitution. They not only lose their inner moral standards, but social and legal regulations also fa il to protect them. (Oppenheimer, 1896, op. cit. , Cooperative Settlement , pp. 608). Oppenheimer used the term \"phenomena of social illnesses\" (soziale Krankheits erscheinungen) to refer to the plight of the large cities. Capitalism has freed the fiefs by giving them the f reedom to move to the city. Oppenheimer argued that for the fiefs, this meant a social improvement, despite the fact that they added to the large number of the poo r living in the cities. 19 In material respect, however, the industrial worker might be in a condition that is worse than that of 18 Franz Oppenheimer. 1898. Grossgrundeigentum und soziale Frage . (Large Property Ownership and Social Question ). Berlin: Vita, p. 165. 19 This is in contrast to Marx, who saw the dominant reason of the plight of the industrial workers in capitalism and its inherent c ontradictions. 267 a farmhand. Oppenheimer described this as a tradeof f. An industrial worker generally receives less to eat than a farmhand, but enjoys mo re social freedom, more social interaction with other people of his class, and the re is a chance, even if it is only small, that by luck and diligence he will move up into the class of entrepreneurs. (Oppenheimer. 1898. op. cit ., pp. 165, 166). With a better industrial development, participation in world trade becomes feasible. Due to an increasing exposure to world trade, crises oc cur. Crises have an effect on land rents in both, the city and rural areas. In the lar ge industrialized cities, the process described above would only push those proletarians into poverty, who are ill and weak, but the young and healthy workers could reach a cer tain standard of living. However, ever recurring crises ruin even the young and healt hy industrial workers in economic, physical, and moral respect. (Oppenheimer, 1898, op. cit. , p. 166.) Oppenheimer saw crises as the main root of the high rate of mortality among workers and their families. Crises push men and women into crime and mass prostitution, they are the cause of mental disorders and even lead to the degeneration of entire nations. In a situation were crises prevail, the industrial workers' class faces no exit. Forces of pressure and counter pressure are at work on both, the industrial workers' and the capitalist employers' class. For instance, pressure within is felt by industrial workers as a force to form coalitions in order to defend their common interests, while counter pressure by workers leads to revolts and strikes. In rural areas, the consequences of recurring crise s are severe, too. The owners of the large estates are less well able to sell their agri cultural products at the market and are likely to suffer financial losses. This leads to a decrease of the land rents. Due to a reduced demand, a reduction of the prices of land i s likely to follow and, eventually, impoverishment of the estate owners. This worsens t he situation of the fiefs, who will keep moving from rural areas to the cities. Oppenheimer argued that in a situation of crises pr evailing, the industrial worker question can only be solved by addressing rural con ditions. (Oppenheimer. 1898. op. cit. , p. 168). He considered it as difficult and even i mpossible to improve the situation of the unqualified workers in the cities, as long as m en keep moving from the country to the cities and therefore proposed to solve the Social Question by setting up cooperative agricultural settlements. (Oppenheimer. 1896, op. cit. ). This would create a labor market in rural areas, which had not been available to the fiefs. Oppenheimer saw the feasibility of this solution, because of the develo pments in the land rents. Recurring crises bring down the land rents in rural areas and lead to under populated areas. The \"lock\" on land in the hands of a few estate own ers vanishes, making it possible to buy land and develop an alternative method of produ ction. Oppenheimer designed a scheme to buy out defaulted large agricultural rura l estates and turn them into small agro-industrial farms. Single individuals would not have the capital to buy the land and machinery necessary to start an agricultural operat ion. By forming cooperatives (Siedlungsgenossenschaften ), agricultural settlements could be established. Oppenheimer suggested that workers took their unemp loyment insurance claims as 268 down payments to acquire the land and that credit u nions would be established in order to provide credit for further investments. He wante d to turn the agricultural settlements into small agro-industrial firms, which would provi de in basic needs and where workers could engage in a specialization or learn a skill t hat was marketable. 20 While cooperative agricultural settlements offer a health y environment to work and live in, they can only be the starting point of a developmen t that will end in the formation of many small cities with a large agricultural backgro und. Oppenheimer entertained the vision of garden cities forming in the future with many small centers, instead of centralized urban areas. 21 Over time, cooperative agricultural settlements fac e incentive problems. (1896, op. cit. ) What starts out as a cooperative - since the new la ndowners have no credit lines and no own capital and hence have to share machinery bo ught on credit from the cooperative settlement bank - over a generation or two assumes the character of a joint stock company. The capital accounts of the members of the cooperative do necessarily diverge over time with their different life profile s. Some members keep reinvesting, some old members are replaced by new members. The p rinciple of \"one member - one vote\" cannot be sustained with that diverging capit al ownership. The work related share and the capital related share diverge. Some members of the cooperative retire and sell their capital shares to others, originally only to fellow cooperators, but later also to people outside. The market widens, step by step the cooperative turns into a hybrid cooperative/joint stock corporation. Slowly, the co operative transforms into a joint stock company. Although Oppenheimer saw this development, which he called the \"law of transformation,\" he nevertheless felt that the coop erative was a necessary step to \"unlock\" the land and thereby the fates of the work ers and move them into a free capitalist society. 22 11.4 Summary and Conclusions Oppenheimer's approach goes beyond the scope of mod ern health economics. He was thoroughly interested in finding the roots of \"soci al\" illness, a cluster of illness, pauperism, crime and prostitution, and found them i n the \"lock\" of land ( Bodensperre ). In rural areas, the \"lock\" of land prevented worker s from acquiring and farming their 20 In this same way, he also saw the Kibbutz , which are cooperatives for consumption and cooperatives for production at the same time, as a transitory stage for a free, capitalist Israel. Oppenheimer we nt to Israel in order to promote the Kibbutzim movement as a natural extension of the cooperative s (Siedlungsgenossenschaften ) he had propagated in Germany. 21 This was a popular vision at the time. Health reas ons were the the main concern to establish garden cities. Compare, e.g. , Karl Ballod, 1920. Der Zukunftsstaat. Produktion und 57-61. 22 Oppenheimer was Ludwig hard popularized the term \"freie Marktwirtschaft.\" 269 own land, so that workers kept moving to the cities . In the cities, crowded living conditions for a large part of the industrial worke rs' population led to illness and deterioration of moral standards. Being a physician turned economist, one can interpret Oppenheimer's contributions as that of a meta healt h economist, who diagnosed the causes of the Social Question and prescribed agricultural cooperatives (Siedlungsgenossenschaften ) as a remedy. Judged by the standards of his time, this was a sensible solution. In studying the beginnings of the inequality of wea lth among men, Oppenheimer found that the treatment of nomads and slaves improved wh en they became valuable as a work force. He described that the fiefs during the proto-capitalist period had no alternative of employment due to the lack of a labo r market in rural areas. Their poverty and low standard of living were reflected in high c hild mortality. The root of their plight was that they had no access to the land, because th e land was divided among large agricultural estates, the so-called \"lock on land.\" The emergence of capitalism freed the fiefs. They c ould achieve a social improvement by moving to the large industrial cities. In the ci ties, where high land rents prevailed, they had to live under crowded conditions. The mass es of the workers suffered from what Oppenheimer called \"social illness.\" By compet ing with each other, they pressed the wages down and prices fell accordingly. The eff ect of recurring crises was, however, that even the young and healthy workers wo uld face unemployment, followed by a decline in moral standards and pauperism. Crises, for instance due to world market exposure, not only affected the industrial sectors, but also rural areas. It became more diffi cult for the large agricultural estate owners to sell their products. Their difficult econ omic position led to a fall in the land rent in rural areas. As a consequence, agricultural land becomes available. Oppenheimer proposed to set up agricultural coopera tives (Siedlungsgenossenschaften ), which could buy and farm the land. He was trying to create an agricultural base for industry, thereby e nhancing a trend towards a dramatic increase in agricultural labor-productivity, which was later indeed to materialize. According to the \"Law of Transformation,\" the agric ultural cooperatives would turn into joint stock companies over time. Oppenheimer remained skeptical about the ability of markets to solve the Labor Question and proposed to establish agricultural cooperative s. As a conclusion, it can be noted that in a time of cost-containment in heal th care, cooperative solutions should not be overlooked. 270 References Backhaus, J\u00fcrgen G. 1999. \"Land Rents and Ecologica l Crisis: The Case of the Oder River Valley.\" The American Journal of Economics and Sociology .

Joseph A. Schumpeter (1883 - 1950) provided an answer to this question in the seventh chapter, \"The Economy as a Whole,\" of Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung [The Theory of Economic Development] , published in 1912. 1 He entertained the vision that innovation takes place in institutions and organizational structures, and because of the interrelationships between the diffe rent sectors not only affects the entire economy, but promotes the evolution of socie ty as a whole. The key concept of his theory is \"the entrepreneur,\" that is the ag ent, who has the capability to innovate and is willing to face and accept the poss ibility of failure. He was also interested in how sectors other than the economy pr oper provide a fertile \"playground\" for entrepreneurial talent that can en d up in economic affairs. Schumpeter tried to cover the interrelationships be tween the different sectors of the economy as the entrepreneurial initiative, not only the successful, but also the failed innovations, reverberate through all the sectors. H ealth issues are an example of phenomena which belong to all sectors at the same t ime. For this reason we see Schumpeter as an economist whose writings on econom ic, institutional and social development are relevant for health economics. We c onceive of the discipline not as narrow, but as a broader social science based enter prise in scholarship. In the introduction, a brief look at Schumpeter's l ife and work follows. In the next section, samples from the seventh chapter illustrat e Schumpeter's approach to economic development. This approach has many so-cal led \"filiations,\" an expression coined by Schumpeter himself. 2 Filiations to health will be discussed in section 12.3. A summary and conclusions follow in section 12.4. It can only be speculated, why Schumpeter dropped t he seventh chapter in the second edition of The Theory of Economic Development (1926). A hint can be found when looking at his biography. Born in 1883 in Trie sch (Moravia) to parents who owned a textile factory, Schumpeter was familiar wi th that business environment when he studied law and economics at the University of Vienna. 3 In 1906, he received his PhD in Law from the University of Vien na, and in 1908 the habilitation 1 Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot. This part of his work appears only in the first edition and has been omitted from later editions, a s well as the 1934 English translation. 2 Joseph A. Schumpeter. 1954.

(Biographical Handbook of German speaking Economist s Emigrating after 1933), pp. 639-642, p. 640. 275 followed. On the basis of his habilitation thesis, he wrote Das Wesen und der Hauptinhalt der theoretischen National\u00f6konomie [The Essence and Principal Contents of Economic Theory] , (1908). For a short period of time, Schumpeter worked as a lawyer and investment banker in Kairo. In 1909, he received a call for the chair in Czernovitz and one year later, he acce pted a call as a professor of economics at the University of Graz. In 1913, he be came an exchange professor at Columbia University in New York. The publication of two major works fell in that time period, The Theory of Economic Development (1912, op. cit .), consisting of seven chapters, and Epochen der Dogmen- und Methodengeschichte [Economi c Doctrine and Historical Sketch] , (1914). 4 In 1919, Schumpeter served as a minister of finance in the socialist post-war government of Austria, but was dismissed in the sam e year. Thereafter, he became the chairman of a bank, but the crash of 1924 wiped him out financially and he was dismissed from his position as chairman of the bank . The motivation of Schumpeter's political and entrepreneurial activities, as well a s the experience of World War I found its theoretical expression in several publica tions, the most important one being entitled Die Krise des Steuerstaates [the Crisis of the Tax State] published in 1918. 5 In 1925, Schumpeter accepted a call to the Universi ty of Bonn as a professor of public finance where he also taught economic theory . In 1926, when the second German edition of his 1912 book was published, Schu mpeter dropped the seventh chapter. 6 When he was offered a professorship at Harvard Uni versity, he emigrated to the United States in 1931. Schumpeter remained a t Harvard until 1949, teaching the main course in economic theory. In 1948, he bec ame president of the American Economic Association. In 1950, he died in Taconic ( Connecticut). In the preface to the second German edition of The Theory of Economic Development (1926, op. cit. ), Schumpeter himself gave a hint why he dropped th e seventh chapter. He made the reader aware of a chan ge in the character of his work. At Harvard University, this change in the character of his work became quite obvious. In his writings in the English language he only published what belonged to the core of the theory. 7 This change in method occurred well before he emigr ated to the United States in 1931. To Schumpeter, the criticism of his teacher E ugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk was an 4 Max Weber. Editor.

Studies of the Historical School have also been omitted, but this could have to do with the fact that the work was unfinished. 276 important factor for dropping the seventh chapter. B\u00f6hm-Bawerk emphasized the need for economic theory to be based on empirical r esearch in the way that both theory and research reinforce each other. 8 In this process of refinement, theories have to be improved in order to lead to a better un derstanding of empirical facts, while at the same time, the systematic discovery of relevant empirical facts leads to better theories. In the case of the seventh chapter, Schumpeter felt that the readers were distracted from the underlying economic theory and concentrate d their attention on those aspects of cultural sociology, which are also conta ined in the chapter. He was afraid that readers perceived the seventh chapter as an al ternative to economic theory. In addition, he did not want to be associated with tho se economists, who were opposed to theorizing. For these three reasons, Schumpeter dropped the far-reaching chapter, but later, he returned to the topic. In hi s seminar on Pareto at Harvard, as well as in his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (1942), he made a new effort to formulate a unifying theory of developmen t containing cultural and sociological elements. 9 It can, however, reasonably be argued that other a uthors have better reached the goal of formulating a unify ing theory than Schumpeter himself. 10 Sombart or Pareto went beyond the confines of econ omic theory proper and therefore had a better framework for explaining what Schumpeter is insisting on explaining within - al is it a rather broad - econo mic paradigm. 12.2 Samples from the Seventh Chapter In the seventh chapter, Schumpeter drew a rather br oad picture. His goal was to formulate one single theory that explains both, eco nomic development and its societal consequences. The arts, politics, the soci al and other related sciences should be covered by this unifying single theory. A s expressed by the subtitle, hypothesis non fingo , he followed the deductive method. 11 The seventh chapter is 8 Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk referred to this process of refinement as Tatsachenforschung .

He compared his own theory of development with those of the classical authors, but in contrast to the first six chapters, the focus is on cultural and sociological aspects in order to expla in the entire life of a country. 12 The following samples from the seventh chapter refer to Schumpeter's criticism of the classical theory of development and to the alternat ive process of development he devised on this basis. Schumpeter envisioned the en trepreneur as the driving factor of development. In the seventh chapter, he is conce rned with the repercussions that occur in all the different sectors in the economy. These repercussions, among other effects, can bring about the downward movements tha t typically accompany development. The point of departure is a discussion of the class ical, static theory of development. Static theory found that changes in the equilibrium were caused by outside factors, but did not provide a coherent theoretical explanat ion for the movement from one equilibrium to the other. Schumpeter distinguished between static theory leading to adaptation on the one hand and dynamic development on the other. The question of static theory was: \"How, based on its entire circum stances of life, does a population reach a particular level of the economy?\" In additi on, he addressed dynamic development by asking: \"How does any economy make t he transition from one level to another level?\" (2001, op. cit. , p. 94). He compared dynamic development to waves that do not oscillate around a given level, b ut where a transition takes place from one level to another. The transition from one level to the next is caused by innovations, carried out by entrepreneurs, who have the vision and courage to try out and push through new combinations, for example in t he form of new products, new methods of production, or new types of organization . According to Schumpeter, static activity itself cha nges the data of the economy; this was a characteristic of development, which has been overlooked by the classical theory. Schumpeter distinguished between the follow ing changes in data: an increase in population; an increase of capital; pro gress in the method of production as well as in the economic organization of the indu strial society; and development of needs. While Schumpeter considered the theory of th e classics as commensurate with his own point of view, he did not think that t he classics really explained the core of economic development. They rather remained on th e surface or looked only at partial effects. This can be illustrated by the exa mple of the consequences of a population increase, which is one of the examples o f data changes mentioned above: 13 12 Wolfgang F. Stolper, - A Critical Interpretation). Recktenwa ld, Horst Claus, Scherer, Frederic M., p. 68. 13 Since the seventh chapter is not generally availab le in English, I am quoting from my own translation. 278 In fact, there is hardly an economist who would no t think of the increase of the population as a lever of economic progress. This is always the first issue to be identified when looking for the causes of economic development. It can be observed in the scientific literature as well as in popular discussions of daily questions. What is our response to this kind of arg ument? In particular one has to clarify the chain of effects consequent to a population increase. The first effect is a rise in the demand for luxury goo ds and a rise in labor supply. Within the economy, the influence of an increase in population can have no other consequences than those. The rise of the labo r force brings about an increase in an original factor of production. This factor of production thereby becomes cheaper to the businessman. At the same tim e, it permits a higher level of production of goods in the wider economy. Even if the wage were to fall to unprecedented low levels due to an increase in labor supply, the total sum of wages generally will rise. Hence, there is n o doubt about it that an increase in demand will ensue. Of course, the situa tion of the labor class could get worse. Therefore, the economic result ach ieved by an increase in population could be ambiguous. Nevertheless [476] o ne could still speak of economic development. The appearance of the economy has changed. In this, we try to make neither a judgment nor an eval uation of the progress. 14 Now, it is important to know how the increase in la bor supply will be allocated. Provided that the only change taking place is an increase in population and nothing else varies, and the supply of labor grows, then nothing much will change in the basic lines of the economic system of value. The additional supply of labor will be used for those purposes whi ch have already been served by the existing supply of labor, and for tho se marginally less productive functions immediately adjacent to the pr esent use. On the whole, the same static value system will be kept intact, e xcept that those economic agents who can take advantage of the lower prices o f labor will experience a higher degree of satisfaction of wants. This chain of events has already been analyzed in detail by the classics. In principle, i t has been described correctly. The prices of products based mainly on labor will d ecrease. On the other hand, land rent will rise because the new laborers will demand more products from the same supply of land. In addition, other pe ople will also be in need of more land, for instance, all those industrialists w ho are expanding their firms. The classics only thought of these effects both centering on the lan d rent increase. The evidence that the classics only thought of these effects and not others lies in the fact that they - and foremost Ma lthus, of course, - only saw the negative consequences of population increase ov er and beyond a certain level. And they were justified within the terms of their model, because if there were really no other effects than the ones describe d, then it would not take long before a dull pressure of the masses of worker s builds up against the 14 It is well-known that within the reach of Malthus' influence the pessimistic concept is predominant. But even from the point of view of Malthus one should admit that the movement of the population is a driv ing force of development, even if this force could possibly lead to poverty a nd devastation. 279 prevailing organization of production. [477] By a d ecrease in the wage and an increase in the prices of foodstuffs the situation of the workers would get worse in two ways: on the one hand this scenario wo uld doubtlessly lead to the consequences as described by Malthus. And on th e other hand, it is also beyond doubt that only the landowners would realize a substantial improvement in their situation. But something else can happen, too. The increase i n population can be an incentive to reshape the economy, and this new form of the economy could lead to an improvement for the increased number of people in comparison with the lower level enjoyed by the former smaller number. This is exactly what we observe in reality. Therefore, one has to r efer to yet an additional group of effects. The fact that the classics restri ct themselves to the consideration of the first group of effects shows b etter than anything else that they restrict themselves to static considerations. They did not imagine that there could be an alternative concept to the static economy. But then it becomes clear that other effects can occur only, if the economy is not simply passively adjusting to the increase in population; if it does not only behave in a static way, but if it responds actively. In other words, if a development in our sense comes forth. Nothing else shows better that o ur theory is finally based on and is a refinement of that of the classics. In order for this other group of effects to appear, the economy has to take on new f orms. These effects do not automatically happen, but have to be caused by the mechanism described above. 15 Due to the wage decrease, the entrepreneur may fin d it easier to undertake some particular tasks and, hence, he migh t undertake reorganizations. If not, if no such creative activi ty exists, then nothing else happens indeed but that dull pressure on the entire economy. This is yet another example that illustrates the fruitfulness o f our distinction between static and dynamic [478] economic activities. Schumpeter considered the reasoning by Malthus as o ne-sided that an increase in population through a chain of reactions in the end will lead to a shortage in food. According to the economic classics such as Malthus (1803), the health states and mortality of a population strongly depend on econom ic conditions. 16 Malthus' 15 Schumpeter here refers to the mechanism of entrepr eneurial activity, described in chapters 2 - 6. 16 Thomas Robert Malthus, 1803. An Essay on the Principles of Population. New edition by Patricia James for the Royal Economic So ciety. 1992. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. In his essay, first pub lished in 1798, Malthus proposed a basic description between population gro wth and income leading to the so-called Malthusian trap . \"According to Malthus, when population size is small, the standard of living will be high, and pop ulation will grow as a natural result of passion between the sexes. When populatio n size is large, the standard of living will be low, and population will be reduced by either the \"preventive check\" (intentional reduction of fertil ity) or by the \"positive check\" (malnutrition, disease, and famine). 280 prediction was that population growth would come to a halt, either intentionally, or due to the rise of poverty leading to malnutrition, bad health, and high mortality. In contrast to this view, Schumpeter held that an incr ease in population can lead to less poverty and better health if \"something else\" happe ns. Repercussions on population growth could take place, but they require the creat ive activity of an entrepreneur. 17 According to Schumpeter, the classics arrived at th eir one-sided conclusions, because they focused on static analysis and did not take dynamic considerations into account. Schumpeter agreed with Marx who held that \"capitali sm stamped populations out of the ground.\" 18 He stated that a particular increase in population would have been much smaller, if the economic space for new people had not been created before. Similarly, he considered innovations rather a conse quence of economic development than its cause. In the same way, he thought that no t the satisfaction of needs would cause new needs, but that development itself causes new needs by way of rising expectations. Consequently, in a dynamic setting eq uilibrium cannot be achieved, and if an equilibrium is achieved anyway, then it h as to be seen as a force against dynamic development and can only be of a short-term nature. Long run development then consists of a string of consecutive partial sh orter periods of development. Therefore, economic policy plans can only be made i n the short term. 19 According to Schumpeter, the larger, secular moveme nts cannot be determined economically. [492] One has to look at other factor s such as social and cultural aspects in order to describe development in the lon g run. Here, a concept becomes important that lies very much in the cultural and s ocial sphere of the economy, that of the entrepreneur. Schumpeter distinguished between entrepreneurs and other agents. Those agents, whose behavior can be regulat ed and who will prosper under regulation, \"differ substantially\" from the entrepr eneurs, whom he saw as the motor of economic development. [469] This [Seventh chapter] is an attempt to pres ent a theoretical analysis of The Malthusian model implies that, in the absence of changes in technology or in the availability of land, the size of the popula tion will be self-equilibrating. Further, increases in available resources will, in the long run, be offset by increases in the size of the population. Countries with superior technology will have denser populations, but the standard of living will not be related to the level of technology, either over time or across countries .\" This implication is referred to as Malthusian trap .

We look first at a general cause for the changes in the fundamental structure, i.e. in the level of the circular flow. We locate this cause in the fact that - as we expresse d it - new combinations get driven through. We saw that when new combinations a re carried through this can be attributed to the actions of a particular ty pe of economic agent whom we called an \"entrepreneur.\" The behavior of the en trepreneur differs substantially from that of other economic agents, w ho fit into the scheme devised by static theory to account for the economi c activities of people. Finally we learnt about the different means with wh ich the entrepreneur, in our sense, drives through the new combinations in the d ifferent organizational forms of the economy, through which he selectively channels the economy in new directions. These means have in common that wit h their help the agents of the static economy will be forced to serve new f unctions. The particular character of these means gives its stamp to the eco nomy and thereby gives it a particular form. They are the principal distingui shing features of the different organizational forms - to a much higher degree than the aspects normally cited. In Schumpeter's vision the entrepreneur, by carryin g out an innovation and taking the chance to fail is the driving force of the proc ess of economic change which in turn changes society. The entrepreneur is an entity that carries out and implements \"new combinations.\" They may take the form of intro ducing new products, new methods or processes, identifying new markets or so urces of supply, or creating new types of organization. More generally, any entity t hat can bring about new combinations, for instance, organizations, or even entire firms in Schumpeter's approach can serve the role of the entrepreneur. Th is holds not only for market processes, but also for those in politics, administ ration, the nonmarket- nongovernment sector, and society as a whole. There are interdependencies between the sectors, wh ich Schumpeter illustrated with the example of a physician. From an economic point of view, a physician in the traditional style with no capital equipment, just h is acumen, experience, and judgment (and probably his family relations such as many dependents) is to be considered a worker. The underlying economic model has three factors of production: land, capital, and labor. This spirited , but impecunious doctor falls into the category of labor from that classical point of view. Sociologically speaking though - sociology was a new discipline that has been foun ded shortly before the seventh chapter was written - this very same, gifted physic ian is an entrepreneur, thinking about new therapies, but also about his own well-be ing and that of his dependents. 20 For instance, the physician from an economic point of view belongs to the factor labor, but from a sociological point of view he doe s not. He is a professional, which is reflected in his social status and prestige and not necessarily in his economic well- being. He cannot share the class consciousness of a proletarian worker, but he 20 Allen Janik and Stephen Toulmin. 1973. Wittgenstein's Vienna . New York: Simon and Schuster. 282 cannot join the Viennese opera ball, either. He is the owner of his own means of production and latently an entrepreneur. These mean s of production are not alienable; they have no market value, but can be th e basis for entrepreneurial capital, for instance a clinic. In Schumpeter's own words, introducing the notion of the social pyramid, this reads as follows: The social pyramid does not consist in economic bu ilding blocks. Economically, a successful physician has to be clas sified as a worker. Socially, however, he does not belong tout court to the working class. [Schumpeter, 1912, op. cit. , p. 528] Of course, he becomes a Schumpeterian entrepreneur only, if he implements \"new combinations\" such as new therapies, treatments, me dicine and the like. The medical profession and this may be an important pol icy conclusion, lends itself to entrepreneurship and may become a fertile cradle of innovation. The physician, by necessity, has to contend with both, risk and uncer tainty: risk in the therapeutical outcome, uncertainty in his diagnostic work. In contrast to Marx, Schumpeter saw next to the div ision of labor and capital the \"social pyramid\" as an important factor explaining the development of an economy. In capitalism, the entrepreneur has to hold a high social position in order to create a position of power, but entrepreneurship is not tied to capital ownership. The position of the entrepreneur is of a short-term nature and c annot be bequeathed to other persons. His position as entrepreneur is tied to his perfor mance and does not survive his energetic ability to succeed. His position as e ntrepreneur is essentially only a temporary one, namely, it cannot also be tra nsmitted by inheritance: a successor will be unable to hold on to that social position, unless he inherits the lion's claw along with the prey. 21 The company, the goods which are present in the company, are just the dead shell of the [entrepreneur's] driving impulse. [Schumpeter, 1912, op. cit. , p. 529] In the seventh chapter, Schumpeter discussed the re percussions of innovation outside the sectors, where the entrepreneurial init iative was taken. Not only the successful, but also the failed innovations have su ch repercussions, which reverberate through all the sectors. Economic devel opment is not only characterized by upward effects, but also accompanied by downward movements. Adversely affected are those sectors, firms, and their accomp anying institutions, which are substituted by successful innovations. Entire profe ssions will disappear, while others need to be developed including the institutions, wh ich they need for their prosperity. Schumpeter described the adverse consequences of gr owth and expansion as follows: 21 Here, Schumpeter is using a powerful metaphor. He refers to the company and the assets of the company as \"prey\", and the \"lion' s claw\" as the entrepreneurial capability that generated the company in the first place. 283 The movement described is just one of two, the upw ard movement. Its counterpart is the downward movement in the situati on of many economic agents. The downward movement is anchored in those static processes of production, which are particularly hurt by the pric e decrease, apart from the case that means of production as a consequence of d evelopment have to be delivered more cheaply than before. We have [502] a lready discussed this in the chapter on crises. There, we have also seen tha t the strongest of these effects, even if they are steady, are attached to p articular periods in time. 22 Old forms of management and outdated production pro cesses, all goods of a longer duration of life now will also for this reas on be devalued - and not only by the increase in costs of the upswing period. Thi s hurts all static firms more or less and will only exceptionally be compensated by repercussions. Therefore, the static economic agents suffer as pro ducers get further and further pushed back. Also, often the leaders of yes terday belong to that case. They often fall in their position almost to unimpor tance. This process would also take place in case of an immediate response, b ut it is made worse by the fact that the most immobile economic agents do not respond fast enough and not thoroughly enough to it. Often, this is through a lack of intelligence and means. The craftsman cannot imitate any technical p rocess, the owner of horse-driven carriages cannot open a second railway line next to the one which destroys his business. Often, there is also a lack of inclination. The skilled master of his own business might not be wil ling to turn into a factory employee, the factory owner might not want to becom e a salaried manager of a large company, even if this were the proper thing to do. Therefore, the prosperity or despair of economic agents is often i nseparably connected to a certain type of management or method of production. The decline of that particular type of technology of production and man agement will necessarily bring about the decline of this type of economic ag ent. In the exchange economy, this gives a special character to the repl acement of the not so suitable [ways of doing things, methods, etc.] by t he more suitable. The inevitable debasement of what has been existing bef ore therefore appears in a different light as compared to the current state reached by development. [503] So, a process of stunting, a decline in status and class of wide circles goes hand in hand with the upward movement. A lot of fri ctional profits disappear, which, however have only been a consequence of defi ciencies in the mechanism of competition, but to which the economy had adapted and which have been the basis for many a person's livelihood. By development, entire layers of society lose the ground under their feet. Certainly not suddenly, but slowly. Through generations, the people in question live a poorer and ever 22 In principle, these would be the periods of liquid ation. But many of these effects are slow in pushing through. Hence, it is more real istic to say that these are the periods which appear together with the periods of l iquidation. They differ from the latter with respect to the length of time; thei r phenomena are broader, but less intense in violence. 284 poorer life with ever more bleak hopelessness. Slow ly, they lose the moral and intellectual level, the more so, the darker the economic prospects around them are becoming. Their firms become poorer and po orer, tumble into ever more unfavorable situations, become breeding ground s for social grievances and fall into the hands of ever more despicable pub lic persuaders. These companies dry up and decay. Compared to the magnitu de of development as a whole, an alien observer would hardly pay attenti on to these phenomena. The losses are only the reverse side of development . They result because the services which have been the basis of economic life for those economic agents, are now being performed in an improved, bet ter way. Even the pain which these losses cause, have their function in th e faster removal of the outdated, in the incentive towards activity. But th ose people who participate in the drama themselves, and those who are close to th em, have a different point of view. They would still be of a different o pinion, even if they thoroughly grasped the nature of the process, which is all too often not the case. They cannot close their ears to the cries of those about to be crushed, when the wheels of the new era roll over them. This decline in status and class of many companies has, of course, an unfavorable effect on wages and rents. Moreover, th e agents of these companies are either workers or people who live off rent, so that the devaluation either falls on wages or on the rents o f land. If we still do not see this, then this is because those particular workers and landowners do not easily communicate their decline to the others [504 ]. In this respect, they rather form a special group. They are more strongly attached to outdated modes of company leadership than the others. In the seventh chapter, the analysis of development is broader than the standard Schumpeterian view as espoused in his later book on Business Cycles ( op. cit. ). 23 Sociological and cultural factors such as the \"soci al pyramid\" and the physician as entrepreneur are no longer part of the explanation. Similarly, in his later works the analysis of entre preneurship differed from that of his earlier works. Shortly before his emigration, Schum peter described the entrepreneur not only as a theoretical concept, but also as a co ncrete actor who could bring about structural change. 24 Even later, Schumpeter did not distance himself fr om these 23 The standard Schumpeterian view is as follows: inn ovating entrepreneurs are the initiating agents of change. Due to the herd li ke behavior of imitators and adaptors of the innovation, investments in new tech nology, etc. occur in clusters spreading through the economy and speeding up the p rocess of development. The old equilibrium is left and evolves in a new eq uilibrium at a higher level. Innovations occur in rhythms which suddenly and vig orously push the process of development out of equilibrium and, later on, sw ing back to a new equilibrium. 24 Compare Joseph A. Schumpeter. 1929. \"Der Unternehm er in der Volkswirtschaft von heute.\" (The Entrepreneur in th e Modern Economy) In: Strukturwandlungen der Deutschen Volkswirtschaft . Hobbing, pp. 303-3 26. Reprint: Wolfgang F. 285 contributions, but referred to his own earlier work , for instance in the following reply to Arthur H. Cole: \"In his presidential address at the 1946 meeting of the Economic History Association, Professor Arthur H. Cole level ed an indictment at economic analysis of the \"theoretical\" type to the effect th at it has neglected throughout the phenomena of economic change. 1\" In the footnote (1), the editor, Bernhard Harms, wrote: \"This article was probably written in 1946 i n response to a suggestion by Arthur H. Cole, who at this time was planning a res earch center in entrepreneurial history.\" 25 In his later works, Schumpeter described entrepren eurship as a narrower concept, focusing on large scale entrepreneurship. 26 As becomes obvious in the seventh chapter, Schumpeter was in his earlier work s also concerned with small- scale entrepreneurship such as the physician as an entrepreneur and the entrepreneurship by organizations and other such en tities. He also saw entrepreneurship in relation to structural change. In Schumpeter's early analysis of economic developm ent, not only economic aspects are important, but also social and other factors. I n order to illustrate this, he gave the example of a successful physician. The health secto r is an example, where other but economic considerations are important as well so th at a pure economic analysis cannot be applied. The analysis has to be open so a s to take other but economic variables into account. Cultural, social, and ethic al aspects have to be included. In the seventh chapter, the emphasis is on the origins of change on the one hand, and the reverberations of this change through all secto rs of the economy, polity, and society. All sectors are somehow affected, yet each differently. 27 12.3 Schumpeter on Health: many \"Filiations\" Schumpeter tried to cover the interrelationships be tween the different sectors and the processes of change as they start in one sector and reverberate through all the others. Health issues are a prime example of phenom ena which belong to all these sectors at the same time. For instance, the AIDS ep idemic, in particular in Sub- Saharan Africa, as it affects a particular age grou p (young, educated males) has severe repercussions in the management echelons of business firms, the civil service, and the officer core of the military. This translates into repercussions in Stolper, Christian Seidl. Editors. 1985. Aufs\u00e4tze 6-247. 25 Joseph A.

He proposed to build a healthy city by forming coopera tives for housing and credit unions. Schools and houses had to be built so that the living environment was healthy and this posed new demands on architecture. Compare chapter 11. 286 politics and in cultural life. Any policy directed at the epidemic has to be implemented so as to take into account all these repercussions. An isolated approach such as focusing only on the medical condition and an effec tive pharmaceutical innovation is insufficient. 28 In his early work, Schumpeter proposed a different way of causation than the classical economists. An example is the explanation of a population increase and its consequences. The standard Schumpeterian explanatio n based on his later writings would be that innovating entrepreneurs through incr eases of productivity create life chances for more people. In the seventh chapter, he stresses the obverse line of causation. He held that the increase of the populat ion was possible, because the economic room for it was already there. Entrepreneu rs took advantage of this economic room. As a consequence, new combinations h ave created more employment opportunities and made it thus possible to feed more people. In Schumpeter's early approach to economic developm ent, progress in medicine is one aspect of those new combinations which create m ore supply and, according to Say's Law (supply creates its own demand), more demand. More advanced therapeutical possibilities even create more demand in traditional forms of care. More people find employment and hence, more people can be absorbed in the growing cities, leaving the countryside, where the \"new combinations\" have not yet arrived, and where the social activity remains in a previous stage of development. This issue is relevant for the World Health Organiz ation (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stance on population control based on a Malthusian theory (compare footnote 16). Economic development, notably if it is homegrown, creates many new lines of work and gives rise to de mand for labor. It also increases the production of food supplies. On the supply side it increases the opportunity costs of having and rearing children. In developed countr ies, children are luxury goods and not necessities as in developing countries. Therefo re, an increase in the cost of raising them can even lead to an increased demand. Instead of imposing physical means of birth control, a Schumpeterian approach wo uld emphasize growth and economic development. 29 28 An example of a step in this direction is the Nord rhein-Westphalian report on health goals to be implemented in between 2005 and 2010. Next to goals directed towards improving medical conditions, it c ontains structural goals such as health promotion and preventive measures among y ouths, attenuating factors that lead to illness in a working environme nt and strengthening the responsibility in particular of chronically ill pat ients. Compare: Birgit Fischer. 2005. Gesundheitsziele NRW is support for Schumpeter's theory of innova tion driven development on the basis of Cameralism and the Althoff system (com pare chapters three and nine). The Cameralists were population oriented and treated people as a wealth of the small states. A closer look at the Al thoff system showed that Althoff, an entrepreneurial bureaucrat of the Minis try of Culture, facilitated the 287 Schumpeter's approach is more complex than a simple type of causation. This can be illustrated by looking at the following example of a simple type of causation: \"... it can reasonably be argued that the increase of popul ation in the 19th century was due to progress in medicine, and that it exerted im mense economic and political pressure and was a major driving force behind the i ntroduction of mass production systems.\" (Peukert, op. cit. , p. 81). Here, progress in medicine is directly re lated to an increase in population and an improvement of the economy. One could even say that it is not so much medical progress, but econom ic advances which lead to the growth of the population and better health. While S chumpeter accepts this argument as a simple type of causation, his approach is more complex. Medical progress can be a necessary condition for population increase, b ut it is certainly not a sufficient condition. Sustained population increase is possibl e without improved health states of the population, but improved health states can l ead to population decline as we currently witness. The mere ability to reproduce do es not explain the choices people make in having children. Since children can be luxu ry goods, improved fertility and a higher income can lead to population decline. 30 In contrast to standard analysis in health economic s, a Schumpeterian approach discovers a pan plea of entrepreneurs in health car e trying out \"new combinations\" for diagnosis, treatment, and coping with adverse m edical conditions. There are entrepreneurs among the various participants in the health industry, physicians and other health care providers, patients, the pharmace utical industry, providers of health insurance, manufacturers of health products, etc. B y looking at the different actors in the field of health products and services, a wide e ntrepreneurial potential comes to mind. Some patients are more capable than others and can better cope with a handicap. They find new ways of doing things, of organizing t hemselves, perhaps gadgets that help them to better function within the social and cultural environment. Those patients behave just like an entrepreneur as descri bed by Schumpeter. 31 State immense medical progress taking place in Prussia.

Meijer, W. J. M. Heijman, J. A. C. van Ophem & B. H. J. Verstegen. Editors. The Maastricht Isini-Papers , Vol. II. If we let the health industry turn to the market, we f ind that certain services can be provided in a cheaper way. Leen has argued that thi s is partly due to the entrepreneurial potential of the consumer. In our c ase, the consumer is a patient. Schumpeter did not make the same argument. He also saw entrepreneurial potential in government policies. 288 health and other policies could protect those entre preneurial niches and even create room for entrepreneurship, but it is crucial to ide ntify entrepreneurial potential. How can entrepreneurial potential of patients be re cognized? There is a problem in interpreting empirical data, if two distributions h ave different means, but overlap considerably. For instance, a sick older person may be more capable than a healthy young one, if the older person started out at a hig her level of capability and maybe has learned to cope with the illness. The older, bu t \"entrepreneurial\" patient might still be fit for some kind of employment. While tho se people belonging to the entrepreneurial group are not in need of much suppo rt, those of the less capable group could be offered employment or educational pr ograms that would help them to better cope with reality. Preventive measures would include the identification of groups at risk. Special attention should be given t o those groups in society which are adversely affected by economic change. Schumpeter wrote that two firms or two individuals are at the same point, but one is moving upward and the other one is going downward. The costs they face will be different as the upward moving company has able and flexible employees and the other one does not. What looks at the outset to be similar or almost the same can be radically different because one institution has ent repreneurial potential and the other goes by routine and will fail. The relevance for pu blic health administrations and new corporate forms which can embody entrepreneurship i s obvious. Many concrete proposals can be readily derived. 32 A policy that is directed towards an average company such as an average hospital, will fail as o ther qualities count and these are sometimes those of the outsiders who show entrepren eurial talents. All these conditions have a political dimension and only econ omic and political entrepreneurship combined holds out hopes for sensi ble solutions. This is the central message of Schumpeter's seventh chapter with respec t to the issue of health. Instead of facilitating entrepreneurship, regulatio ns can prevent entrepreneurial initiative. Examples are medical malpractice suits. As Epstein has pointed out, \"a strict liability rule could make a physician or hos pital attentive to the treatment of those patients that come into their care, but it ha s (empirically) the greater vice of leading physicians and hospitals to withhold servic es in the first place. They do not believe that they can charge in fees enough to cove r what they must pay in damages 32 For instance, in the areas of care for the homeles s, care for the elderly, and for those who have difficulties adjusting to techni cal progress, care for people who are windfall losers of system change, people wh o immigrate through the prostitution circuit, people who immigrate through the drug circuit, people who suffer long-term consequences due to incarceration and the socialist regime, people who suffer long-term consequences because of malnutrition in their early years of childhood, people affected by anabol ic substance supported sports programs, people with psychic trauma as a co nsequence of secret service activities in the family, and finally peopl e drafted for work in contaminated sites with no adequate protective clot hing. In all these cases, a middle of the road industrial firm will not be a su ccessful player. 289 and defense costs.\"33 Physicians and hospitals face medical malpractice suits in case of bodily harm done to patients. In being care ful to avoid a malpractice suit, they cut their potential for innovation. The pharmaceutical industry focuses on innovations. For instance, the case of Thalidomide and its repercussions illustrate that i nnovation can be a highly charged political matter. Thalidomide which caused a major medical, but also social and political crisis, is basically an effective medicat ion for sleeping disorders with few side effects. If, however, prescribed contra indica tion to pregnant women, it can lead to a major disfigurement of the fetus. The case led to a regulatory wave, and only in recent years Thalidomide has reestablished its stro ng reputation. Here, the entrepreneurial uncertainty could not be contained, whereas the risk could be contained through regulatory and prescription instr uctions. Each innovation carries some residual uncertainty; events (positive or nega tive) nobody had imagined would ever happen. Frank H. Knight's (1885-1972) distinction between r isk and uncertainty is of major importance here. Knight emphasized the distinction between risk, which is insurable, and uncertainty, which is not. This is why risk can be regulated, but uncertainty cannot. Risk relates to recurring events whose rela tive frequency is known, while uncertainty relates to unique events whose probabil ity can only be subjectively estimated. Insurance companies exploit the law of l arge numbers in order to reduce the risks. They pool the individual risks by settin g a price that is based on the relative frequency with which an event in that particular gr oup happens. 34 \"Knight observed that while the entrepreneur can \"lay off\" risks muc h like insurance companies do, he is left to bear the uncertainties himself.\" 35 Schumpeter developed the role of the \"entrepreneur\" as an actor who creates uncertaintie s in the first place, but who is able to transfer this uncertainty into risk. To the bank, which lends money to the entrepreneur, his undertakings represent a risk, no t an uncertainty. The intricacies of the Thalidomide case are that th e risks associated with the correct medication were well contained. The catastrophe ens ued as a consequence of the unforeseeable, uncertain and wrong medication. Stra ngely, little research is available into what caused this peculiar prescriptive behavio r. In this section it has been illustrated that despit e scant direct analysis on health and 33 Richard A. Epstein A. 1997. Mortal Peril. Our Inalienable Right to Health Care? Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, Ma ssachusetts, p. 364. 34 Health insurances are regulated. As a consequence, \"risk pooling\" is no longer possible. Health insurances are not allowed to char ge fees according to marginal costs. In the presence of asymmetric infor mation, we face the problem of moral hazard. Health insurances are limited in c harging marginal costs - this has an effect on entrepreneurship on the side of th e patient. 35 Marc C. Casson. 1993. \"Entrepreneurship.\" The Fortune Encyclopedia of Economics. Ed.: David R. Henderson. New York: Warner Books In c., p. 631- 635. 290 health economics, the early Schumpeterian view on e ntrepreneurship and the interrelations between economic, social, and cultur al change offers a new perspective to study health issues. A summary and c onclusions follow. 12.4 Summary and Conclusions The seventh chapter of Schumpeter's Theory of Economic Development , omitted in 1926 from the second edition, is not only a summary of the first six chapters, but also contains new elements which Schumpeter subsequently worked out in later works. By formulating one single theory, Schumpeter wanted to explain economic development and its societal consequences. The arts , politics, the social sciences, all these fields should somehow be covered by this unifying single theory. According to Schumpeter, the source of development lies in in ternal dynamics facilitated by entrepreneurial initiative. Economic change is driven by internal dynamics whic h creates the room for innovations. The entrepreneur recognizes this room and by creating recombinations can take advantage of it. The same principle of int ernal dynamics accounts for all other sectors of the social system. There are inter dependencies in entrepreneurial activity. From the point of standard economic theor y the physician is a worker, but for Schumpeter's theoretical purposes he has to be cons idered an entrepreneur. This is reflected in his social status and prestige and not necessarily in his economic well- being. In health economics, it is important to distinguish among different groups of people. Current health care policies do not seem to take di fferent levels of individual entrepreneurial capability into account. Regulation is necessarily based on the principle of equality and tends to treat every case in an equal manner. This makes it difficult to distinguish between the subjectively d ifferent cases and backgrounds, notably when they look objectively similar. A consequence of a comprehensive regulatory scheme is that there is hardly a niche for small-scale entrepreneurship. Yet, at the same time we can observe some great innovations in health care, for instance the clonin g of embryos for stem cell research. It is a paradox that on the one hand, we see entrep reneurship in the health care market based on leading-edge research, but on the o ther hand we find that small- scale entrepreneurship is more or less subdued. A l arge portion of potential technological change, that part caused by small-sca le entrepreneurship, is thus stifled by regulation. 291 References Backhaus, J\u00fcrgen. 1979. \"Pareto on Public Choice.\" Public Choice . 33, I, . of German speaking Economists Emigrating after 1933), pp. 639-642, p. 640.

It has been stated at the outset that pol icy relevance is given with respect to the time for which the major classical works dis cussed have been written. This can be illustrated with respect to three common themes tying the work together: cultural development and health, the principle of subsidiari ty, and the role of the public sector. The relationship between cultural development and h ealth is central in the works of Justi, Roscher, Schmoller, Menger, Oppenheimer, and Schumpeter. The principle of subsidiarity concerns a basic organizing principle of society. It has been introduced by Wolff as a principle of natural law and plays an important role in the work of Justi, Roscher, and Schmoller. B\u00fccher's proposal of nonmar ket exchange, as well as Oppenheimer's idea of cooperatives based on self-he lp can also be interpreted in this context. The role of the public sector in health ca re has been highlighted from various angles. For instance, public preventive health care measures were addressed by Justi and Wagner; health care legislation was discussed b y Justi, Roscher, and Schmoller; government as a source of finance, as well as the l imits of government, were stressed by Wagner; an innovative role of government was rea lized by Althoff, who created efficient incentives in the organization of medical research; and the introduction of mandatory catastrophic health insurance was propose d by Schmoller. 13.2 Cultural Development and Health In his work, which dates from around 1750, Justi ha s pointed out that a healthy population should be counted as national wealth. Fr om this point of view, health care expenditures are not consumption, but investment th at restores, maintains and raises the productivity of labor. Roscher, whose work is i n the tradition of Cameralism, has worked out the implication of this view. Increasing industrialization and rapid urbanization brought along the demand for highly sp ecialized labor. One-sidedness of labor came about carrying negative health effects. Roscher has also described related developments such as long working days, working eff ort to the point of exhaustion, and child labor which causes ill health of the labor po pulation. As a consequence, he predicted cultural and economic regress on a large scale. It was for this reason that Roscher pleaded for regulation of labor conditions in industry and a regime of strict monitoring and sanctions to enforce such legislatio n. Again the costs of such legislation can be viewed as investment in national wealth. Thi s was one side of his proposal; the 297 other side went far beyond the factory and labor en vironment by directly addressing cultural progress. Mentoring and voluntary labor in communities by successful managers and other high-standing persons in the com munity, so Roscher, can prevent one-sidedness of labor and enables the disadvantage d to gain first-hand knowledge, thus leading to cultural development and better hea lth. In his Lectures to Crown Prince Rudolph, Carl Menge r (1840 - 1921) stressed the importance of cultural development with respect to health.1 He also saw the importance of health as a factor contributing to the developme nt of a nation, which is brought about by individual planning and provision for the future . His contributions are contained in his major work of 1868, Grunds\u00e4tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre (Principles of Economics), which is the point of departure of Austrian Economi cs. His successors, Friedrich Freiherr von Wieser von B\u00f6hm- thought and established the repu tation of the Austrian school of economics. The major cornerstones of Austrian econo mics are methodological individualism, methodological subjectivism, and an emphasis on time. Menger's remarks on health issues concern individual provisi ons made for the future and errors that are the more likely to occur, the lower the cu ltural development of a nation. It has been illustrated that the idea of a subjective disc ount rate has found entry into modern health economics (compare chapter seven). Menger's concept was broader because it contained the possibility of error depending on the cultural context. Menger shared with Schmoller and Wagner the focus o n cultural development, but they emphasized different aspects of health issues. Schm oller wanted to strengthen the subsistence economy as an important aspect of cultu ral and economic development, and he wanted to strengthen the position of women s o that they could be the breadwinner of the family. From both measures, he e xpected a positive effect on the health of families. However, he considered these me asures not as sufficient in order to support those who have fallen ill and their depende nts. To guarantee that the appropriate care and sufficient income will be avai lable, Schmoller saw a role for the state as legislator of obligatory insurance against catastrophic risks, such as health risks. The role of the state in relationship to cultural d evelopment was analyzed by Wagner. He developed his Law with respect to a rise in culture. One of the majo r implications was an increase in preventive measures, not only in health care, but in all areas of life. Wagner interpreted economic and technological devel opment as consequences of cultural development. Hence, with a rise in culture , the role of the state would rise over time. Unlike Justi, Roscher, Schmoller, Menger, and Wagne r, Schumpeter put the downside of economic development central in the Seventh Chapter (Leipzig, Verlag von Duncker & Humblot, 1912). Here, he has focused on t he relationships between cultural and economic development and structural ch ange. This part of his early work 1 Compare Erich Streissler and Monika Streissler. Ed itors. 1994. Carl Menger's Lectures to Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria . Aldershot: Edward Elgar. 298 appears only in the first edition of his Theory of Economic Development in the German language and has been omitted from future ed itions and from the English translation. In Schumpeter's theory the decline of old branches of industry is as much a part of the process of economic development as the emergence and deployment of new, innovative sectors. Stagnation and decline of a sector has negative economic effects such as falling incomes and unemployment in the first place. There are secondary effects which go even deeper: a long and deep reaching socio-psychologic and cultural malaise among the population, in parti cular in the localities and regions where the stagnating and declining sectors are conc entrated. In the omitted chapter, Schumpeter entertained the vision that innovation takes place in institutions and organizational structures, and bec ause of the interrelationships between the different sectors not only affects the entire economy, but promotes the evolution of society as a whole. The key concept of his theory is \"the entrepreneur,\" that is the agent, who has the capability to innova te and is willing to face and accept the possibility of failure. In the Seventh Chapter , Schumpeter discussed the repercussions of innovation outside the sectors, wh ere the entrepreneurial initiative was taken, thereby also looking at the downside of economic development. He was also interested in how sectors other than the econo my proper provide a fertile \"playground\" for entrepreneurial talent that can en d up in economic affairs. He widened his scope to encompass innovation in other social r ealms, in political, artistic, or scientific processes. He tried to cover the interrelationships between th e different sectors of the economy as the entrepreneurial initiative, but also the failed innovations, reverberate through all the sectors. Health issues are an example of phenomena which belong to all sectors at the same time. For this reason we see Schumpeter as an economist whose writings on economic, institutional and social development are relevant for what later became the subdiscipline of health economics in a more narrow form. We conceive of the discipline not as narrow, but as a broader social science base d enterprise in scholarship. [GAP here] Schumpeter's theory seems to imply that such sector al and local downfalls and its degrading effects on mental and on physical health are the price a society has to pay for its economic progress. Franz Oppenheimer (1864- 1943) who was writing in view of a few decades of ongoing industrial development too k a different position when in the industrial quarters of Berlin he was confronted wit h the type of distress described by Schumpeter. The type of legislation to safeguard th e labor population, as proposed by Roscher and Schmoller and partly introduced since t hen could not prevent the second Founders crisis that led to the economic downfall o f large segments of the population, both rural and urban. Oppenheimer developed a diffe rent solution. He identified overcrowding, poor food, exposure to cold and damp, prolonged and exhausting work, and unhealthy occupations as factors that lower the resistance to disease and make people prone to illness and early death. Oppenheime r widened his scope and studied what he called social illness : he saw the root of illness and epidemics in poor social and economic circumstances. He proposed a reform that l eads to rural agro- industrialization and urban deindustrialization: th e establishment of agricultural 299 cooperatives ( Siedlungsgenossenschaften ) to create work, to develop faculties and to restore the physical and mental health of farmer fa ctory workers. While health economics is typically done in terms of looking at the specific health conditions, institutions, and costs, Oppenheimer looked at the social and economic conditions, which gave rise to poor or better health. From a Schumpeterian perspective the basic question is: where is the innovation to support the economic sustainability of the type of structural rearrangement proposed by Oppenheimer. If that is lacking there is little hop e that Oppenheimer's experiment can be successful on a larger scale. Oppenheimer wanted to create islands of innovative centers. The land bought by the members of the coop eratives was small, and therefore he suggested the use of intensive agricultural meth ods, requiring innovation by the members of the cooperative. The cooperatives are in tended to be self-sufficient, which leads to the second major theme of this study, the principle of subsidiarity. 13.3 The Principle of Subsidiarity The principle of subsidiarity as a principle of nat ural law was introduced by Christian Freiherr von Wolff (1679-1754), who founded economi cs within his general system of natural law ( jus gentium ). His focus was on the house, defined as the exten ded family or several extended families together, and not the individual as the relevant unit of decision making. This is important, since much heal th related services can best be provided within the immediate vicinity of the perso n to be treated. Even today, many such services are provided by the family directly. Conversely, individuals' health often depends directly on the lifestyle of the family. B ased on Wolff, Roscher and Schmoller stressed the role of breadwinners and their depende nts and Oppenheimer, much later, saw the individual with its circle of provision as the relevant unit. On this basis, he proposed the establishment of cooperatives that are self-sufficient. They form a house in the Wolffian sense. B\u00fccher has shown that exchange takes place in famil ies and neighborhoods, based on the division of labor within the house or between h ouses. In its most basic form, exchange is in the form of gifts. It takes place in an environment where trust already has been established. The motive for gift giving or other nonmarket exchange as described in chapter nine is altruistic, but B\u00fccher has made it clear that a counter gift is expected, hence an exchange takes place. In line wi th von Th\u00fcnen's and Gossen's work, B\u00fccher held that nonmarket economic behavior is grounded in the principle of marginal utility. His observations and interpretati on of nonmarket exchange are included in this book because of the relevance of n onmarket arrangements in health care. The issue of nonmarket exchange in health car e has become all the more important with the gradual collectivization of this sector. As has been shown in the third chapter, members of a house should only receive help, if they cannot shoulder a task themselves. Th is means that the state or any other entity should not automatically intervene. Wi th respect to health care, the 300 subsidiarity principle is a safeguard against both, the inefficient incentives that would result from a system of positive rights to health c are each individual can claim from the state; and it also implies a restriction to wha t can be left to the free market. Herein lays the relevance of this contribution. Tod ay, the principle of subsidiarity became an important principle of the European Union . 13.4 The Role of the Public Sector Invoking the principle of subsidiarity, Wolff assig ned the state an important role with respect to regulation and supervision. The state is not any public authority, but meant as an entity that makes sense; for instance, bureau cracy is not part of this concept of the state.2 The theoretical basis for these measures starts wi th Wolff and Paracelsus. The collective area, in the late medieval time, the se were municipalities, church related charities and foundations, required health policy. The main example discussed in the book is the development and implementation of healt h insurance as shown by Schmoller (compare chapter eight).3 A different aspect was pronounced by the Cameralists (chapter four): the welfare of an econo my can be increased by a better health state of the people. If one were to interpre t the Cameralists narrowly, as the Physiciocrats did, one could even say that they saw health care as an area of public activity where state income could be nourished. Acc ording to this view, a better health state of the people means that the tax base can be broadened, and consequently that the state income can be increased through public he alth policy. Of course, this narrow view does not do justice to the Cameralists, who em phasized the well-being of the people, not just state income. In either case, heal th policy was a central concern. Five hundred years ago, Paracelsus (1493-1541) saw a moderate role for the State with respect to quality considerations. Paracelsus lived in a highly regulated environment, where local monopolies prevailed throu gh church and guild regulations. He fought against the negative consequences of thos e monopolies. An example given in chapter two were high prices of pharmacies, when Paracelsus' own and effective medicine was inexpensive, but when local regulation s did not allow him to give it directly to the patients. He demanded patents for h is own work, because his medicine and his texts were often copied, sometimes in an in correct way. Patents allow for the authenticity of the work. They also allow reaping t he benefits of an investment in research and development. In Paracelsus' case, thes e were the efforts to obtain knowledge through his wanderings and various contac ts. Schumpeter later made the case with respect to the R & D expenditures of the pharmaceutical industry. 2 This refers to the Hegelian concept of the state, compare Birger Priddat. 1990. Hegel Schriften. Berlin: Duncker & Humblot. 3 Despite a steadily growing literature on Schmoller and the 'Historical School,' the implementation process has not been documented very well. Compare Erik Grimmer-Solem. 2003. The Rise of Historical Economics and Social Reform in Germany 1864-1894. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 9. 301 Today, Paracelsus' achievements in the areas of med icine, philosophy, linguistics, and theology are widely acknowledged. For his socia l-political writings he is less well known, because this work has been found too late in order to be included in the complete Paracelsus edition. It contains his contri butions to comprehensive health sciences including economic aspects of health. What tends to be overlooked is the core of Paracelsus' central message. Integrating th e science of medicine into the broader context of what today is social science but also, in his particular case, pharmacology. Oddly enough, today the regulation o f medical practice makes exactly impossible what Paracelsus stood for. While Paracelsus emphasizes the need of looking at each specific situation and medi cal condition in each locality and circumstance in order to develop a tailormade cure and prophylaxis, current regulation emphasize unification and standards irre spective of specific dispositions and circumstances. The connection of legal and economic analysis by Ch ristian Freiherr von Wolff (1679- 1754) led to the creation of the field of political economy, which formed the intellectual basis, on which Cameralism further developed. After the disastrous events of the Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648), human capital mattered. H ence, Cameralism emerged as a science of economic policy, which was directed towa rds economic development. It was not incompatible with intellectual developments els ewhere, notably in France, but yet totally different in its emphasis on economic devel opment and the human factor in production. The most prolific writer of the Cameral ists, who fully developed the science, was Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi (1717 - 1771) . To him not only the quantity, but also the quality of the population mattered. Since health has an influence on both, he elaborated policy measures that would improve the h ealth of the population in order to make economic development possible and to sustain f urther growth. Justi proposed measures to be taken by the state that would create incentives to stimulate agriculture and thus encourage an improvement of the nourishmen t of the population in order to enhance health; he came forward with ideas how to r aise the quality of health care, for instance, he proposed the introduction of a supervi sory board for health care provision; and he was concerned with the health of soldiers. A s was common in Cameralism, Justi considered people the wealth of the nation. H ealth is therefore a matter of investment, not consumption; the healthier the popu lation, the higher the wealth of the population. Based on Cameralism, Wilhelm Roscher's (1817-1894) work contains important tenets for health economics. Roscher has introduced the hi storic method to economics. He used an eclectic, descriptive approach in order to describe the evolutionary laws governing the development of the economy of a natio n. A nation is characterized by its law, the state, and the economy, but also by religi on, language, art, and science. Roscher concentrated on the first three factors of influence in order to explain the political economy of a nation. In line with Aristot le, he saw the family unit as the beginning of any nation's economy, and not the indi vidual. The policy measures he proposed included the institution of early social w elfare services, for instance a compensation scheme for accidents, as well as publi c regulation to protect vulnerable groups in society, such as wage laborers, women, an d children. He was a fervent 302 advocate of the introduction of factory inspectors and was politically active in the implementation of these policy proposals In the Kin gdom of Saxony. Adolph Wagner (1835-1917), the public finance theor ist and advocate, was interested in the limits of the state as a part of the economy . His prediction of the likely long-term development of the tasks of the state is known as Wagner's Law . He showed that with an advance in the culture of a society the tasks of the state will grow in the long run. Wagner has formulated the conditions under which th e state can and should intervene in the economic process and thus created a basis fo r legislation. The motive of \"Daseinsf\u00fcrsorge\" was important in areas considered as basic to society, such as railways, coal, or health care. For instance, he fo resaw a role of the state with respect to health care if a highly volatile private investm ent was the alternative. Wagner identified major factors that explain the increase of health care as a state task, but did not take into account others such as negative effec ts of bureaucracy. When Wagner formulated his law, capital markets had not yet eme rged and institutions were not fully developed. In order to show the relevance of Wagner's Law today, aspects of both, the presence of capital markets and modern institutions , have been included in the discussion in the chapter. When combined with the Baumol-Bowen Hypothesis and research results of the theory of bureaucracy, Wagner's Law gains relevance today. Gustav Schmoller (1838 -1917) treated health issues as part of the larger Social Question which had arisen during Germany's industrial revol ution. Farmers and workers had moved from the country to the cities to find employment in the new established and expanding factories. A proletarian class formed and dissatisfaction was high. Schmoller wanted to insure the major risk s in workers lives. By establishing state institutions of social insurance he wanted to create the basis on which further markets for insurance could develop. Hereby, he con sidered health a central variable which had an influence in his proposals for economi c policy. Schmoller created the scientific basis for the social reform in Germany ( 1864 - 1894). To this effect, he organized a professional think tank of his colleagu es, the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik . If Schmoller's idea were followed today, we only had o bligatory basic health insurance and a moderate state influence in health care. The sector of health would not be treated differently from any other industry and not as a policy field. Therefore, many issues that today are at the center of health econo mic debates would become mute and irrelevant. Friedrich Althoff (1839-1908), the leading Prussian administrator in the Ministry of Culture and Science for more than a quarter of a ce ntury, created incentive compatible structures in which science and scholarship could t hrive. The so-called Althoff System refers to the systematic approach standing behind A lthoff's science policy. This had an effect on all sciences, but here, we concentrated o n the implications for medicine and public health. At the time, the industrial developm ent had significant effects in relation to disease. For instance, new diseases emerged amon g the proletarian class of the cities, and this required new ways to view and trea t these diseases. Althoff took patronage of medical research by supporting scholar s with maverick ideas. He founded institutes and hospitals to further experimental an d diagnostic research. Under Althoff, Germany introduced public health legislation, as in the case of combating tuberculosis. 303 An increase in speed of scientific progress in the field of medicine, as well as other fields could be shown during and shortly after the era Althoff. The relevance of the Althoff System concerns the organization of scholarship in genera l and in this sense of health issues in particular. Althoff was an entrepr eneur as described by Schumpeter in the omitted Seventh Chapter . 13.5 Final Remarks The earlier authors stress the relationship between cultural development and health, which is not independent of the role of the public sector. For instance, the Cameralist states competed with each other for human capital a nd resources not by military means, but by way of cultural and economic developm ent. The principle of subsidiarity, introduced by Wolff as a principle of natural law, formed the basis of their policies. Based on this principle, there is o nly a minimal role of the state, a recurring theme in the works discussed. The three themes discussed distinguish the historic approach from the new health economics. The first two themes, culture, and the p rinciple of subsidiarity, do not figure prominently in this work, and are even missi ng in most current textbooks in the field.4 With respect to the third theme, it has been shown in the preceding chapters that the historical approach focuses on a minimal r ole of the state and stresses the development of markets. In contrast, the more moder n approach concentrates on market failure.5 Therefore, the contributions presented in this boo k can only partly be subsumed under the concepts of current health econo mics. The thesis in this book is that parallel to what we can observe in other disci plines, the difference between the old health economics and the new health economics lies in the extreme specialization of the new health economics, whereas the old health ec onomics was based on all sciences of the state and even beyond, including et hics and technology. 6 Hence, the perspective of the historical authors is much broader than what is available now. 4 Compare e. g.

Yet, as has been shown in the preceding chapters, since five hundred years, scholars have been interested in eco nomic issues of health including the social and political sphere. Their contribution s are typically ignored in modern health economics. In this final chapter, the questi on arises how the old generation of health economics differs in perspective from the ne w health economics. A. Culyer has defined health economics as the \"appl ication of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated with health.\" 2 This definition includes the contributions of the historical authors, but does n ot consider the social and political aspects discussed by the German and Austrian author s writing on health issues. 3 As has been shown in chapter thirteen, the common them es, culture, the principle of subsidiarity, and the role of the state, are embedd ed in the theoretical context of the state sciences and give a glimpse of what is missin g. From a methodological point of view, a theory or an argument needs to be first reconstructed and then appreciated in the context a nd in the terms in which it had been proposed. Historical authors should not be judged a ccording to terms, which have not been present at the time when they were writing ( whig history of economic thought). 4 In order to fulfil this requirement, the following ter ms have been derived from the preceding chapters: demand, supply, information, op timal contracts, the market for pharmaceuticals, insurance, technology, institution s (hospitals/ nursing homes), evaluation of life and injuries, social insurance, and policy and future issues.5 Most of 1 Kenneth Arrow. 1963. \"Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care.\" American Economic Review .

Paracelsus (1493- 1541) made early contributions to health economics, which can be summarized with respect to the terms on the vertical axis as follow s: (A / 2) Demand The demand for health is distinguished from the dem and for health services, which is partly dependent on the demand for health. 6 Paracelsus emphasized both, demand for therapies and demand for health. He identified the conditions of live and work with the causes of disease. Therefore, he emphasized tha t the cure can only be found in the immediate environment of the condition. An example is his work on the causal relationships between economic conditions and pract ices and resulting medical conditions such as in the case of miners' diseases in the silver mines in Tirol. In contrast to this approach, in contemporary healt h economics the local aspect is not mentioned as an important factor for the demand for health or health services. (B / 2) Supply Paracelsus discussed medical supply in his critique of physicians' behavior. In addition, he described monopolistic tendencies within the org anizations of physicians and pharmacists and delineated welfare consequences; fo r instance, it was difficult for new talent to gain access; poor care at excessive p rices resulted. In the second chapter, Paracelsus' analysis has been related to t he phenomenon of rent seeking in health care. The relevance of Paracelsus' approach lies in the r ecognition of all kinds of barriers that prevented medicine then to be effective - and still do now. Although he was not an academic outsider, having earned his doctorates in both, internal and external medicine, at the University of Ferrarra, he noticed that the use of the Latin language was a barrier to exclude newcomers. Paracelsus also was upset about local monopolies such as local doctors and pharmacists. F or instance, he accused some of the local doctors to concentrate on diagnosis and o n making money, instead of therapy and human dignity. This relates to the modern hypot hesis that doctors may create more patient demand than there would be if they act ed purely in the interest of the patient. 7 Paracelsus has provided early evidence in favor of the hypothesis of supplier- induced demand, but clearly goes beyond. For insta nce, a patient's trust in the physician offers the possibility of fraud by the he alth care provider. He described all kinds of fraudful behavior by health care providers . Further, he showed how legal 6 Compare the entries \"Demand for Health\" and \"Deman d for Health Services,\" Antony Culyer. 2005. The Dictionary of Health Economics. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, pp. 91-92. 7 Compare the entry \"supplier-induced demand\" in The Dictionary of Health Economics, op. cit. , p. 333. 309 protection of the pharmacists makes it possible tha t the effective medicine is provided at an artificially high price. This, howev er, sometimes meets with the interest of patients, who - provided that the subst ance is effective in both cases - might prefer the more expensive medicine over the i nexpensive version. (C / 2) Information Paracelsus recognized information asymmetries. For instance, he explained the phenomenon that some patients prefer the more expen sive medicine over the cheaper one as arising from a lack of information o n the side of the patients. He sometimes added gold or other precious metals to th e effective substance in order to make his medicine more acceptable to such a patient . Another information asymmetry mentioned by Paracelsus was the lack of k nowledge on the side of patients on how much effort it took a physician to learn about available cures and to gain the experience needed. He therefore suggested charging income related prices. In the modern discussion on health economics differ ent positions with respect to information asymetries prevail. Culyer has noted th at in health care, information asymmetries \"have deep-reaching consequences for it s organization, regulation and financing, mainly in order that the lay person (pat ient, potential patient, carer) is not exploited.\" ( op. cit. , p. 175). Goodman and Musgrave take the contrary p osition. According to their view, health care is no differen t from other markets, where complicated products are sold; consequently, the co nsumer (patient) does not need special protection.8 Paracelsus' time was far less specialized; markets hardly existed. He combined the search for the \"just\" price for medical care with d iscourses on professional ethics and stood for income-based fees in medicine. He took in to account that only highly trained, experienced professionals could provide re liable health services. (D / 2) Optimal Contracts Optimal contracts are characterized by incentives l eading towards efficient behavior (compare the discussion of incentive compatible str uctures in chapter ten). In the case of Paracelsus, we find that he insisted on pat ents for his medicine and medical authors' copyrights, clearly understanding the ince ntive for effective propagation of knowledge. Patents and copyrights serve two functio ns: first, they provide an incentive to gain knowledge, and second, they allow for authenticity. In the case of Paracelsus, his writings were often copied, and in many cases errors were added in the process which he sought to prevent by a medical author's copyright. In modern medicine, plagiary is still a concern, even on a gl obal scale. 8 Compare, for instance, John C. Goodman, Gerald Mus grave. 1992. Patient Power. Solving America's Health Care Crisis. United States of America: Cato Institute. 310 (E / 2) The Market for Pharmaceuticals Paracelsus is the founder of pharmaceutical medicin e. When he did research in the mines of the Fuggers in Tirol, he criticized them f or charging too high prices and, in one instance, even for providing ineffective medici ne. In Basel, he criticized local pharmacists for overcharging patients. Paracelsus o ftentimes provided inexpensive medicine to his patients, which he prepared himself . He noted that the effective substance was inexpensive to acquire or to make. He further demanded patents and copyrights, because he wanted to remove barriers to medical progress. In the context of innovations, Schumpeter has made this argument later in a refined form. Schumpeter's protective argument applies to t he pharmaceutical industry (compare footnote 15 in chapter ten). In the case o f high costs for R&D, a monopoly might be preferred to a competitive market, where t hese expenditures might not take place. The argument has to be put in a broader cont ext when a licensing procedure is involved. Successful innovations require three part s: first, the process of discovery may lead to an invention. The invention needs to be per fected so as to arrive at a product. The prototype can be patented. The patent, however, is not sufficient for marketing the product. The licensing requires repeated tests for safety and effectiveness. In many cases now, in the pharmaceutical industry, but also in car parts, the time required for licensing the product by far exceeds the time for r esearch and development (death valley). Obviously, this detracts from the duration of the patent protection and thereby reduces the patent rent, which in turn is the incen tive for developing the product in the first place. Current health policy is also directed at the pharm aceutical market beyond the stage of patenting and licensing. For instance, a variety of cost-containment measures are directed to offset some consequences of third-payer reimbursement. Schemes of own contributions, listings of medicine to be reimburse d, and incentives to pharmacists for providing generic medicine instead of the more expe nsive brands raise awareness and responsibility with respect to the use of medicine among patients, phycisians, and pharmacists. In this highly regulated political environment of p harmaceutical markets, the question arises, where does the economic contribution of Par acelsus consist in? Paracelsus shows an efficient solution for the pharmaceutical market by demanding patents and medical authors' copyrights. On this point, his vie w can be seen as a precedent of what is presently current in health economics, but his p erspective is broader. Paracelsus is the founder of pharmaceutical research. To him it i s a matter of finding the effective agent and to overcome the Aristotelian medicine. In modern health policy discussions the view prevails as if the effective agents are kn own. In contrast, Paracelsus was always in search of the effective medicine and dema nded patents and copyrights, because he did not want to hinder medical progress. (F / 2) Insurance In the absence of health insurance, Paracelsus' pat ients paid for the cure out of 311 pocket. Health care spending was constrained by mar ket prices, but the resulting market prices were not always perceived as just by Paracelsus. As has been shown in chapter two, several causes played a role: the p resence of monopolies, fraud by physicians, information deficits on the side of the patients and poverty of patients. Paracelsus proposed to provide health care for free to patients, who could not afford it, and to charge income-related fees otherwise. How to deal with the uninsured is still a challenge to health economic policy. Paracelsus' example has been discussed by Epstein, who has shown that the voluntary provision of health care services by phys icians and hospitals for free to those uninsured patients, who needed it, is preferr ed to the mandatory provision of health care.9 As has been shown in the discussion in chapter eig ht, if physicians and clinics are required by law to provide health care for free to the needy and to people without health insurance, it is well likely that so me physicians and in particular small hospitals will have to close their practice, becaus e they cannot afford the amount of free care they have to provide. The result is that less health care is being supplied than before. For this reason, Epstein, a supporter of free markets in health care, concluded that the decision for the supply of free health services has to be a voluntary one by the single physician and hospital rather than a mandatory decision by the state. (G / 2) Technology According to Paracelsus, nature does not provide us with goods ready to use. Men have to work in order to develop those goods. While God has given us iron, he has not told us, what could be made of it. God wants men to develop crafts and sciences. 10 (H / 2) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) Paracelsus urged people to help each other. He note d the danger of infection when the sick are at one location, notably at battlefields, but did not make similar remarks with respect to hospitals and nursing homes. In his time , charities, in particular churches ran hospitals. (J / 2) Evaluation of Life Paracelsus asked, who can tell the value of a life? And related, who can tell the value of physicians' services? The roots of early life in surance based on evaluation of life 9 Richard A. Epstein. 1997. Mortal Peril. Our Inalienable Right to Health Care? United States of America: Cato Institute. 10 Compare part III, \"Mensch und Werk,\" (Man and Work), Paracelsus. Walter Verlag, pp. 149-206. 312 reach back into his time. (K / 2) Social Insurance Paracelsus demanded that people should not have mor e income than they needed. If they have more, then they should give it to those, who are in need of income. (L / 2) Policy and Future Issues Paracelsus' extensive writings contain visions of p olicy and future health issues. In conclusion, we can state that Paracelsus wanted physicians, pharmacists and other health care suppliers to compete with each ot her in order to meet patients' needs with high-quality services. He combined the i dea of competition with ethical considerations. His basic economic concern was to r emove all kinds of barriers that prevented the medical marketplace from working. Her ein lays the main difference from what we observe currently, namely an increase in the regulations surrounding health and health care. The regulation of medical p ractice today is at odds with what Paracelsus stood for. Although he would make the ca se for undistorted markets in health care and a reduction of bureaucracy, he woul d not forget the needs of the poor. A modern health policy proposal on the basis of Paracelsus' work would call for an integration of the science of medicine into the broader context of social sciences. It would call for less regulation of medical practi ce. Christian Freiherr von Wolff (1679-1754) In Paracelsus' writings, the definition of a scienc e was not yet given explicitly. More than a century later, Christian Freiherr von Wolff (1679-1754) formulated the conditions, which disciplines have to fulfil in ord er to become a science. (A / 3) Demand Central in the third chapter stood Wolff's perspect ive of the order of society and its implications for health and health care. According to Wolff, society is not based on individuals, but on social units such as families, which form the basic unit of decision making. In the families, a division of labor takes place according to individual skills and endowments. Wolff introduced the principle of s ubsidiarity. Extended families should only receive help, if they cannot shoulder a task themselves. In the case of health care this means that the state or any other entity should not automatically intervene. According to Wolff, optimal medical care is based in the extended family, \"the house.\" This is an environment that in the tim e of Wolff included the sphere of production. 313 (B / 3) Supply Quality considerations stood central in Wolff's ana lysis of supply of health care. For the field of medicine, he provided clear definitions an d demanded more rigorous methods for medicine to become a scientific discipl ine. For instance, he recommended the use of protocols in order to evalua te different healing methods, which should be applied repeatedly under similar co nditions. Over time, medicine became a more rigorous, scientific discipline, whic h made rapid strides, but the basic economic problem has not been solved: how to pay fo r it? With the principle of subsidiarity, a principle of natural law, Wolff lai d the basis for an answer. (C / 3) Information Wolff contributed to the flow of information by sys tematizing the knowledge of his time. (D / 3) Optimal Contracts When Wolff developed the principle of subsidiarity, one could hardly speak of free markets, because the influence of the church was st ill dominating public life. Nevertheless, it can be presumed that Wolff had the vision of a free market. As has been shown in chapter three, on the one hand the subsidiarity principle is a safeguard against the inefficient incentives that w ould result from a system of positive rights to health care each individual can claim from the state; on the other hand it implies a restriction to what can be left t o the free market. Herein lays the modern relevance of this contribution. Both, a free market approach to health care, as wel l as a national health care system could gain from Wolff's thought.11 In proposals, which are in favor of a free market in health care, a restriction to the workings of the f ree market is typically missing. Similarly, if we look at the other extreme, in a na tional health care system, there is provision of health care by the state and the resul t is a shift of care provided from the family or other social entity to hospitals, nursing homes, etc. The question arises whether the state is the more efficient provider of health care. (Compare the discussion of economies of scale in chapter six, in particular footnote 13). This question is addressed by Victor Fuchs, but he does not mention the subsidiarity principle. Fuchs wrote: \"Whether a dependency relat ionship with prove less burdensome [than intrafamily dependency relati onships, my add., U.B.] remains to be seen. There is also the question of whether t he efficient provision of impersonal 'caring' is feasible.\" 12 As has been discussed in chapter thirteen, the sub sidiarity 11 A national health care service can either be finan ced by taxes or by compulsory health insurance. 12 Victor R. Fuchs. 1986. The Health Economy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: 314 principle concerns a basic organizing principle of society, which goes beyond what is now discussed as optimal medical care. (E / 3) The Market for Pharmaceuticals Wolff was concerned with the quality of medicine in cluding pharmaceuticals, which he wanted to improve by raising the scientific stan dards of production and development. He did not deal with economic aspects of the subject. (F / 3) Insurance Wolff deductively dealt with the conditions that ar e at the basis of insurance, but followed a different route. He studied these condit ions and devised the principle of subsidiarity accordingly. (G / 3) Technology With respect to technology, Wolff described the sta te-of-the art of all crafts and sciences of his time. He did not deal with economic aspects of technology. (H / 3) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) Exept for his description of measures of hygiene wi thin hospitals and other institutions, Wolff did not focus on the subject. As has been sho wn in the second chapter, Wolff relied on deductive reasoning, and in his argument there was little room left for Christian mission. 13 At his time, institutions were mainly charities ru n by the church. His main political adversaries were the Pietists, Franc ke and Lange. Francke is the founder of a major charity, the socalled Franckeschen Stiftungen . (J / 3) Evaluation of Life In Wolff's time, early life insurance was present, but Wolff did not attempt to mathematically deduct the value of life. (K / 3) Social Insurance An important theme by Wolff was the provision of ca re to the elderly and the elderly ill. Harvard University Press. 13 Wolfgang Drechsler, 1997, \"Christian Wolff (1679-1 754). A Biographical Essay.\" European Journal of Law and Economics. Kluwer. 4, pp. 111-128, see p. 113. 315 The answer he derived within the framework of the p rinciple of subsidiarity is both effective and efficient. (L / 3) Policy and Future Issues Wolff studied all sciences and provided a systemati c overview. On this basis, he also discussed policy and future issues. When he describ ed the Chinese system as an admirable example, mainly for its philosophy and et hics (Confucianism), but also for its educational system and methods of health care, he had to leave the University of Marburg, as well as the city of Marburg. Behind the se measures stood the Pietists, his political adversaries. Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi (1717 - 1771) Wolff followed the mathematical-deductive method an d a priori reasoning, an approach he does not share with the Cameralists (co mpare chapter four). Wolff has in common with the Cameralists the pursuit of basic values, which he considered as contributing to the happiness of people.The Cameral ists valued health, education, and virtues such as a good work attitude as factors contributing to the wealth of a state, which they wanted to increase. The focus of the third chapter was on the contributions with respect to health and health car e by Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi (1717 - 1771), the most prolific writer of th e Cameralists. (A / 4) Demand The Cameralists recognized the importance of higher productivity from a work force, whose health could be maintained or restored beyond what was possible during or right after the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). They considered a healthy population the basis for wealth creation. Health is thus seen as part of a state's capital endowment. By focusing on so-called population meas ures, Cameralists tried to improve the health, education and work attitude of the population in order to increase the wealth of the country. Since the happiness of t he people is the focus of Justi's analysis, their health is his central concern and h e considers every conceivable aspect in which the state through policy and admini stration can improve the health state of the populace. For instance, he focused on agricultural policy in order to prevent starvation and starvation-related diseases. He tried to improve sanitary conditions and initiated public health laws. He sug gested that war should not be led in wintertime in order to minimize human losses. In conclusion, we find that the perspective of the Cameralists differs substantially from the current mainstream, where demand of health and health services does mean a personal investment in health when interpreted as stock and not as flow. (Culyer, op. 316 cit. , p. 92). This interpretation does not take into ac count a country's higher productivity from a work force, whose health can be maintained o r restored beyond what was possible before. Cameralists have interpreted the s tock of people's individual health not only as a personal investment, but as part of the w ealth of a country. (B / 4) Supply Justi recommended measures to improve the quality o f health care provision, for instance by the introduction of local supervisory c ommittees composed of professional health care providers and by setting u p statistical databases on illnesses and deaths in order to study the causes o f diseases. (C / 4) Information In order to reduce mortality and morbidity, the Cam eralists gathered information on illnesses and the causes of deaths. They set up sta tistical databases in order to improve the effectiveness of the health care system . The resources saved by keeping in check the threat of epidemics could be a ccounted for. The emphasis was different. In current statistics, there is little e mphasis on health benefit accounting. The resources saved by health care measures do not enter national budgets on the benefit side. The Cameralists' concern for quality of health care services provided is also a concern in a time of cost-containment in health care. By in troducing more efficient procedures some hospitals are able to improve the quality of h ealth care provided. 14 Other examples point in the opposite direction. Control a nd monitoring of the quality of medical procedures and of pharmaceutical products o ften increase bureaucratic requirements, leaving less time for the physician t o spend with the patients. This might negatively affect the quality of individual care. T he quality of a nations' health care system might be affected, if certain therapies were excluded from reimbursement, or if treatment options are not made available in that co untry. (D/ 4) Optimal Contracts As has been shown in chapter four, the policies pro posed by Justi and other Cameralists contain incentives in order to achieve the desired goals; a healthier, better nourished, basically educated and more stabl e population leads to higher economic growth. 14 Compare Wolfgang Pf\u00f6hler. 2005. Wir wollen jedes zehnte Krankenhaus in Deutschland.\" Hospital in Germ any). Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. October 23, 2005, p. 39. 317 (E/ 4) The Market for Pharmaceuticals Cameralists believed that professional councils sho uld take a bigger role in the regulation of production and sale of pharmaceutical s. Their main concern was to improve the quality of medicine. (F / 4) Insurance Following the tradition of Wolff, Justi developed a catalog of duties of men. These are partly in response to the conditions, under which i nsurances would arise otherwise. (G / 4) Technology The Cameralists furthered technolocal research and use of technology. They introduced the Cameralist sciences at Universities. The question how to finance technology was a central question of Cameralism. To Roscher, who firmly stood in the tradition of Cameralism, the financing and developm ent of technology was the key issue to cultural and economic development of a nat ion. (Compare chapter five). (H / 4) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) Cameralists addressed institutional care and measur es of hygiene within institutions. For instance, the encyclopedic work by Johann Peter Frank, a physician and cameralist, appeared in nine volumes and contains d etailed instructions of hygienic measures with respect to medical procedures, care o f patients, and the environment, hospital rooms and homes. (Compare footnote 25 in c hapter four). The work is considered basic to the science of hygiene. (J / 4) Evaluation of Life To Cameralists, the value of life was high. For ins tance, Justi undertook efforts to abolish the death penality and to facilitate jail s entences. He was concerned about the loss of human lives during warfare. (K / 4) Social Insurance The duty of men included to work as long as possibl e, only the elderly ill should be housed and cared for in nursing homes. (L / 4) Policy and Future Issues 318 By creating a statistical basis of socio-economic d ata, the Cameralists created the basis to devise and implement policy measures. They combined practical experience with the study of Cameralism, which they establishe d and developed. Wilhelm Roscher (1817-1894) Wilhelm Roscher continued in the tradition of the C ameralists (compare chapter five). He is generally recognized for the introduct ion of the historic method in economics. Based on Aristotle, he saw the family un it as the beginning of a nation's economy, the basis for his social-political and eco nomic approach to health and health care. (A / 5) Demand Roscher has called attention to negative health eff ects of the work in factories. He held that overtime work, work by children, and an e xtreme division of labor could lead to illness, both physical and mental, and even tually to cultural regress. He was an advocate of factory inspectors in order to remed y the inhumane conditions in factories. As pointed out in chapter five, the changes brought about by the industrial revolution were affecting individual and family responsibiliti es and led to profound changes in society, such as an increase in the specialization of labor over time, which can lead to negative health effects. As a relief from the on e-sidedness of the work performed, Roscher has recommended that professionals serve ti me at their local communities. They could serve as mentors to the members of the l ower classes. This would also be a contribution towards closing the gap between t he employed and the unemployed. Society could eventually achieve a high er cultural level, which Roscher considered the prerequisite for better health and b etter education. (B / 5) Supply Roscher noted that the freedom to run a business ha s to be restricted in the case of physicians and pharmacists, where harm can be done to the patient or consumer. He feared that in the case of freedom of concession, s ome physicians would start mixing poison and produce medicine for abortion as evidenc e from North America and Imperial Rome has shown. He predicted that in the c ase of freedom of concession, specialists would not be affected severely, but tha t family doctors, whom he considered the most useful part of the profession, would sink deeply.15 Therefore, he advocated for restricted access to the profession and in the trad ition of the Cameralists for state control of the science of medicine. 15 Wilhelm Roscher. 1913. 8 System der Volkswirtschaft . und \u00a7 57, pp. 304, 305. 319 Roscher has also noted that professional help could not arbitrarily be replaced by motivated, but unprofessional volunteers as this wo uld lead to a loss in the quality of health services provided. This was in particular re levant for charities. (C / 5) Information According to Roscher, a follower of Christian ethic al principles, providing information is not sufficient to make Adam Smith' \"invisible ha nd\" of the market work. In the example of medicine, laws of concession, profession al ethichs, regulation with respect to consumer and worker security, and a heal thy morale of the people are also required.16 The main task of the factory inspector is to gain information from within the factory. The factory inspector has to ge t the information from the \"factory population\" and provide it to the state with the go al to initiate state regulation (Roscher, op. cit. , \u00a7 60a., p 339). Roscher does not consider the loc al level as the appropriate level, because communities were too dep endent on local industries (Roscher, op. cit. , \u00a7 60a., p 340). (D / 5) Optimal Contracts Roscher thought about how Christian ethic could be applied in the mid-nineteenth century. He \"paid due tribute to the social achieve ments of the massive, well- organized Roman Catholic charities of his time, but preferred the more discriminating Protestant institutions.\" (H. R. C. Wright, op. cit ., p. 151) Roscher was not in favor of services that would help the able-bodied in general , such as soup kitchens. He considered them as too tempting for many people to participate. He preferred a more selective charity where only deserving people shoul d receive help sufficient to the case. (E / 5) The Market for Pharmaceuticals For apothecaries Roscher demanded concessions like those described for physicians. His concern was that under free competition, pharma ceuticals were not available on Sundays and at night. He also thought that many of the seldom used medical products, which were nevertheless indispensable, would not be offered anymore (Roscher, op. cit. , \u00a7 57., p 305, fn. 4). 16 Harold R. C. Wright. 1995. \"Wilhelm Roscher and En glish Christian social thought.\" Wilhelm Roscher the \"Historical Method.\" l of Economic Studies . Vol. 22, pp. 149-158, p. 150. 320 (F / 5) Insurance With respect to accident insurance, Roscher has sug gested that the factory owner as the employer should carry the costs of an accident when an employee is involved, independent of who caused the accident. The victim and his dependents should receive reimbursement. Therefore, a factory owner h as to take out accident insurance, which should then become part of the price of the p roduct and thereby is shifted onto the consumer (Roscher, op. cit. , \u00a763, p. 380). (G / 5) Technology Roscher was critical of state regulations concernin g technology. In principle, he wanted to leave the initiative to introduce technic al changes and to develop new products to the free forces of the market (compare Roscher, op. cit. , \u00a7 58, pp. 318- 324). (H / 5) Institutions (Hospitals/ Nursing Homes) Roscher was in favor of an open society. For instan ce, in the case of health care he opposed locking up the mentally ill and suggested t o integrate them in society, as far as this was feasible. The mentally ill pose a burde n on society and Roscher demanded tolerance from society. In current health economics, we also find evidence in support of integration of the mentally ill in society (compare footnote 11, chapt er one). The modern evidence is based on a comparison of costs and benefits of inpa tient and outpatient treatment programs. Roscher's argument was driven by ethical considerations. (J / 5) Evaluation of Life An important part of Roscher's methodological effor ts was to put attention to the statistical methods of economic investigation. The statistical methods to evaluate life in early life insurance schedules were part of these e fforts. \"Although his approach to statistics was far different from today's, his atte mpts brought widespread recognition of both the value and the problems of the use of mathe matics in economics.\" 17 (K / 5) Social Insurance Based on Aristotle, Roscher saw the family unit as the beginning of a nation's 17 Peter R. Senn. 1995. \"Why had Roscher so much infl uence?\" Wilhelm \"Historical St udies . Vol. 22, pp. 53-105, p. 93. 321 economy, the basis for his social-political and eco nomic approach to health and health care including social insurance. This was al so consistent with his religious views and the experience of the time in which he li ved. (L / 5) Policy and Future Issues Roscher's main point discussed in the fifth chapter , to look into the work environment in order to prevent negative health effects, has a place in any modern health economic program. The one-sidedness of labor, even for high-standing professionals, and the deep division between those employed and those unemployed could lead to negative health effects su ch as depression and emotion- related diseases on both sides. Roscher's idea to o vercome this division between the employed and the unemployed could become part o f any modern employment concept. Adolph Wagner (1835-1917) Adolph Wagner followed the deductive method, but wa s politically engaged in the same sense as Roscher and Schmoller. As has been sh own in the sixth chapter, his social-political and economic contributions conside red are both positive and normative. (A / 6) Demand An implication of Wagner's Law is that preventive measures in medicine (and other fields such as jurisprudence) will become more impo rtant in the future than curative measures. This affects demand of health services, b ut how precisely demand will be affected Wagner left open. (B / 6) Supply The implication of Wagner's Law that preventive measures in medicine will become more important in the future than curative measures also affects supply of health services; presumably in the direction of more sophi sticated and complex health care provision, but this was not described by Wagner. (C / 6) Information Information is crucial to a highly developed societ y as referred to by Wagner. He predicted that the state will become more influenti al over time with an increase in the amount and quality of information by cultural and t echnical development and the general sophistication and interconnectedness of a complex society. This prediction 322 is referred to as Wagner's Law or the law of increasing state purposes. It does n ot necessarily follow from Wagner's Law that public expenditures will grow over time, but that the influence of the state will grow. It i s derived under the provision that only the state, an efficient provider of goods and servi ces, could provide sufficient capital to finance expensive technologies. Of course, this was formulated before the emergence of national and global capital markets. A s has been shown in the sixth chapter, Baumol and Bowen have refined Wagner's rea soning by including national and global capital markets. (D / 6) Optimal Contracts Wagner provided an early formulation of the public goods theory by formulating the conditions under which the state can and should pla y a role in the provision and finance of goods and services. For instance, privat e investment can be highly volatile. If continuous funding is required for fin ishing a long-term research project, then this would according to Wagner be a reason for public funding or state intervention in order to secure private funding. Wi th these systematic normative conditions for a role of the state in the provision of services Wagner created a basis for legislation. (E / 6) The Market for Pharmaceuticals There is broad evidence that Wagner's prediction wi th respect to a major focus on preventive medicine is right. In recent years, medi cine's focus has indeed been shifting from palliative to preventive measures for curing major diseases and developing regenerative therapies. Research in the development of pharmaceutical products, medical technology, biotechnology and rel ated fields requires a high amount of capital for funding, but the prospect of potential cures and regeneration might improve the rate of return on investment. In terms of human capital and productivity, especially among older, experienced w orkers, medicine is becoming a more justifiable expense so that private investment might take place. In case of high volatility of private investment, Wagner suggested public funding. (F / 6) Insurance A health policy program following the tradition of Wagner would consider the capacity of the medical industry to be an engine fo r the economy, both incorporating and supplanting much of current high-tech industria l developments. This would have to be combined with an insurance system providing a minimum social safety net as proposed by Wagner and later postulated by Baumol a nd Bowen. The insurance system would take care of basic needs, but would no t be restrictive to those patients, who wanted to purchase health care beyond what is p aid for by insurance. This way, new technology can continuously be developed and re fined. New economies of scale and scope could be realized by further automa tion. Eventually, the technology 323 would be affordable by those who have to rely on in surance payments. As Baumol and Bowen have shown, a factor limiting the introdu ction of technology in medicine would then be the minimum of individual care requir ed. (G / 6) Technology Wagner's point of departure was the recognition tha t there is an increase in the cultural and technological complexity of society ov er time. His basic conclusion should be kept in mind that the cultural and techni cal development of a society leads to an increase in the influence of the state, for i nstance in the legal and health environment, where preventive measures become more important over time. In an effort of cost-containment, modern health economic policy proposals are often directed towards a restriction of the introduction of medical technology, a short- sightedness from Wagner's point of view. (H / 6) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) The altruistic and help motive was central to Wagne r. He wanted private initiative and the churches to set up hospitals and nursing homes. For the state, he foresaw only a supervisory role. (J / 6) Evaluation of Life As a protestant Pietist, Wagner did not consider ev aluation of life as an economic topic, and therefore did not make contributions. (K / 6) Social Insurance To Wagner, the help and altruistic motive was stron g. With respect to social insurance, he requested help by close family member s and the circle within the church, in contrast to Schmoller, to whom the actua rial principle was central. (L / 6) Policy and Future Issues Wagner contributed to both, positive and normative health economics. With his systematic normative conditions for a role of the s tate in the provision of services he created a basis for legislation. The current so-called explosion of health care expe nditures is partly due to factors identified by Wagner, such as a shift toward preven tive services and technological advance, but partly also to deficiencies in the hea lth care organization, such as bureaucratization and generous reimbursement paymen ts by health insurances. 324 Policy relevance requires a distinction between the se two sets of causes. Meanwhile, his analysis has been refined in many ways. For ins tance, public choice economists focused on the aspect of bureaucratization, and Bau mol and Bowen studied productivity differences among various sectors of t he economy in order to explain the development of the public influence over time. Thes e refinements have led to a more realistic explanation of what we currently observe. Carl Menger (1840-1921) Carl Menger focused like Roscher, Schmoller, and Wa gner on the role of education and economic development in order to raise the cult ure of a nation. (A / 7) Demand Menger showed that the behavior of those people who plan ahead for the future is wealth-enhancing, and their life-style is healthier than that of others. They are more likely to make investments which will raise the cul ture of a nation. (B / 7) Supply Menger was a proponent of low state influence. He d escribed the medical market as a competitive market, where in the absence of healt h insurance patients pay out of pocket for medicine and treatment. Today, the option that patients pay for the desired treatment and medicine out of their pockets is not always available. Moreover, fo r reasons of cost-containment, in some countries certain treatments and drugs are wit hheld from the market by state regulation. Health economists are often seen as pro fessionals who help to draw the lines between wasteful expenditures of health insur ances and expenditures for what is considered legitimate patient demands. In a coun try, where this advice is politically binding, the therapies excluded will no longer be a vailable, not even to the patients who would be willing and have the means to pay for them. If we apply Menger's analysis, there is no such role of the health econo mist that would lie in the exclusion of effective therapies and treatments. Menger would never accept a state appointed and paid health economist. Patients would have to f ind a consultant in the private market and they would have to pay for this service. (C / 7) Information In a low-standing culture, where the amount and qua lity of information is at a low level, individual time-horizons tend to be short an d people are more prone to make errors with respect to the recognition of their sta te of illness and the effectiveness of medicine than in a higher developed culture. The hi gher the culture, the longer will be the individual time-horizon, and the less likely people are to make errors. The 325 argument that people make errors was later criticiz ed as paternalistic by Ludwig von Mises, another proponent of the Austrian School. Menger's point of errors is relevant in current hea lth care. Information about health- related topics is widely available; as the Internet and the media flood consumers with medical data, some patients have started demanding specific drugs and treatments from their physicians. They might be wrong in what they consider the proper treatment, and their hopes might be unrealistic. No t only patients can be wrong, physicians are also likely to make errors. Danzon, Pauly and Kington (1990) have shown the effects of medical malpractice costs on t he costs of health care. Evidence from the study suggests that higher costs of medica l malpractice, which are reflected in higher costs for physician's liability insurance , are passed on to patients' fees. 18 In contrast to Menger's point of errors, which did not receive much attention, the impact of time preferences on health became one of the main pillars of health economics. Individual time preferences are importan t in cost-effectiveness studies, which involve the modelling of health effects; for instance, the improvements in health brought about by an intervention (compare th e discussion in the seventh chapter). Subsequently, health effects can be trans lated into estimates of capacity to work and ability to function. Time preferences also play a role in the explanation of addictive behavior of persons, who discount or igno re future consequences of their behavior; and time preferences are an important fac tor in the decision to buy insurance coverage. (D / 7) Optimal Contracts Menger never made institutional arrangements a subj ect of his analysis. He did not see the problem of incentive compatibility. (E / 7) The Market for Pharmaceuticals Menger did not discuss the market for pharmaceutica ls. (F / 7) Insurance Individual time preferences are likely to influence the decision to buy health insurance coverage. Under a scheme, where health in surance is voluntary, a preference for present consumption can lead to unme t health care needs in the future.19 Those people, who evaluate the benefit of a presen t consumption as higher 18 Compare Patricia M. Danzon, Mark V. Pauly, and Ray nard Klington. \"The Effects of Malpractice Litigation on Physician's Fe es and Incomes.\" The American Economic Review . 80.2, May 1990, pp. 122-127. 19 Compare Friedrich Breyer and Peter Zweifel. 1999 ( 3). Gesundheits\u00f6konomie . 326 than that of a future consumption, are likely not t o take out sufficient insurance or do not save enough as a provision for old age, and pol iticians, interested in being re- elected, typically represent the same, short-sighte d preferences. Therefore, interference by politicians would not solve the pro blem. (G / 7) Technology Menger did not explicitly discuss issues of medical technology. (H / 7) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) Menger did not give applications with respect to ho spitals and nursing homes. (J / 7) Evaluation of Life The \"evaluation of life\" issues did not belong to M enger's topics. (K / 7) Social Insurance Menger did not treat social insurance as a topic. (L / 7) Policy and Future Issues In chapter seven, the connections between individua l time preferences and human capital investments have been shown. Human capital investments are determined by outside conditions and opportunities, but driven by individual decisions reflecting individual abilities, dispositions, knowledge, and experience. These economic and psychological insights are often overlooked in mode rn health policy proposals. From the point of view of health policy, one has to dist inguish between innate factors or those otherwise immutable, i.e. not subject to choice, and those that are subject to choice. Only those that are subject to choice can b e influenced so as to change health related behavior. (Health Economics). Berlin: Springer, p. 158. 327 Gustav von Schmoller (1838-1917) His scholarly counterpart in the question of method , Gustav von Schmoller (1838- 1917), agreed with Menger, in line with Roscher and Wagner, on the purpose of political economy to raise the cultural level of th e population with health being an important aspect of culture. Schmoller focused on t he creation of markets as the basis of the economy. He considered insurances base d on actuarial principles as an important part of the economy. (A / 8) Demand Schmoller investigated the life and work environmen t with respect to the causes of illness and accidents. He saw demand for health ser vices not as an isolated cause, but in relation to poverty and the social question. (B / 8) Supply According to Schmoller, the supply of basic health care services had to be provided through the market. (C / 8) Information Insurance companies based on actuarial principles n eed information about the probabilities and impact of an event occurring in o rder to set the premium in relation to the real experience of a population. Schmoller p roposed to set up company based insurances and insurances based on other small grou ps of society so that sufficient information on probability and impact of risks woul d be available (compare the discussion in chapter eight).20 (D / 8) Optimal Contracts Schmoller discussed optimal contracts in the contex t of his industry and guild studies. He described incentive compatible contract s. 21 20 Schmoller proposed the cooperative solution: small groups would form their own group insurance companies. This solution minimizes negative consequences stemming from moral hazard and avoids adverse selec tion. Compare Kenneth Arrow. 1963. \"Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care.\" American Economic Review . 53 (5), pp. 941-973. 21 Compare the Elgar Companion of Law and Economics 328 (E / 8) The Market for Pharmaceuticals Schmoller did not discuss the market for pharmaceut icals (F / 8) Insurance Schmoller investigated insurance solutions for prev enting hardship for families. He laid the basis for an insurance system based on act uarial and, by implication, market principles, but guaranteed by the state. He wanted to introduce catastrophic health insurance, which would be obligatory, and beyond th at open up the market so that people could buy additional health insurance for mo re encompassing coverage. (G / 8) Technology Questions of technology are central factors of expl anation in Schmoller's work. (H / 8) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) Schmoller discussed questions of institutions (hosp itals and nursing homes) in the context of the so-called \"New Social Institutions.\" (J / 8) Evaluation of Life In his study on the costs of war, Schmoller took up early questions of the evaluation of life. (K / 8) Social Insurance Schmoller was the architect of social insurance, bu t had reservations about unemployment insurance. In the case of basic sickne ss, old-age, and accident insurance he was in favor of general, compulsory in surance-based compensation through a variety of independent insurance funds at the local level, run jointly by workers and employers and with scope for choice bet ween different schemes. Schmoller was not in favor of a large bureaucracy, for instance in order to administer the accident insurance, but of policies which can b e abolished when the market grows. 22 Schmoller considered market failure as a problem o f development. 22 International comparative studies of liability law and worker compensation had shown that in many cases damages could not be claim ed, because proof of 329 Modern discussions about such issues as care for th e elderly, catastrophic illnesses and epidemics, although in principle open to an ins urance based approach, are often dealt with by specific tailored programs. For insta nce, in Germany the old age care insurance system (Pflegeversicherung) is a politica l solution to what, in principle, is a problem that any insurance market could readily han dle. This specific political solution, designed by Dr. Bl\u00fcm to garner the vote o f the elderly, is laden with disincentives and hence inefficiency and predictabl y has produced a large deficit; this deficit has to be counted under the Maastricht criteria. Had a market based approach been opted for, the political electoral ef fect could not have been attained, but the deficit, if one had occurred, would not be a mortgage on current fiscal policy. The insurance based approach has the advantage of c reating incentives to reduce risks and losses. This is not true for most program based projects. (L / 8) Policy and Future Issues In contrast to Roscher, who excluded many issues du e to his religious beliefs, Schmoller included those issues and founded an enco mpassing social science. While Schmoller has propagated insurance solutions to be provided by the market, he also saw the need of state provision of catastro phic health insurance which he wanted to make obligatory. While current health eco nomics emphasizes market failure and uses market failure as an argument for state intervention, Schmoller took the opposite approach and argued for political inte rvention in order to support and trigger market forces so as to provide market solut ions for social policy objectives. Instead of emphasizing market failure, Schmoller tr ied to create the conditions under which markets can evolve. Karl B\u00fccher (1847-1930) Karl B\u00fccher recognized that the market could not so lve the problems of the time (compare chapter nine). Instead of demanding politi cal interference, he took a different route. He has contributed an organizing p rinciple, which affects both, supply and demand of health and health care services. (A / 9) Demand By focusing on the nonmarket elements in health car e, B\u00fccher has shown that next to provision of health care through the market and/ or the state, nonmarket exchange is an alternative method of organization. By pointi ng out the characteristics of nonmarket exchange, B\u00fccher has shown how high quali ty goods and services such negligence was not possible. For this reason, Schmo ller opted for compulsory industrial accident insurance. Grimmer-Solem, 2003, op. cit ., p. 211. 330 as health care can be provided outside the market. Reciprocity, as it occurs in gift exchange, borrowing and lending, and the voluntary exchange of labor, is a precondition for the provision of high quality. As has been shown in chapter nine, a focus of the c urrent discussion in health economics is on altruistic behavior on the one hand , and market solutions on the other. Under a system relying heavily on altruism, not enough health care services might be provided and often not in the quality requ ired. While market solutions in health care tend to provide sufficient quantity of supply, they are loaded with ethical problems and require a close control of quality. If B\u00fccher's concept is compared to these alternatives, then the added value of his con tribution becomes clear: his concept assures the provision of high quality servi ces. B\u00fccher's principle could be introduced as a supplement to any existing system i n health care. From this chapter the suggestion follows that state policy towards he alth issues should focus on fostering such reciprocal relations instead of prov iding services directly. (B / 9) Supply B\u00fccher emphasized the cooperation between physician and patient in a non- standardized relationship. He was not in favor of r egulation, for instance through standardization of treatment, because valuable info rmation pertaining to the individual case can get lost. (C / 9) Information B\u00fccher described very specific information that was for instance at the basis of gift exchange. (D / 9) Optimal Contracts B\u00fccher studied cultural and political institutions in order to see how economies worked. He did not describe standardized relationsh ips, but very specific circumstances. (E / 9) The Market for Pharmaceuticals B\u00fccher did not study the market for pharmaceuticals . (F / 9) Insurance B\u00fccher's estate at Osaka shows that a focus of his interest was on banking and insurance, in particular with respect to asymmetric information. 331 (G / 9) Technology B\u00fccher did not study technology as a factor of expl anation. (H / 9) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) B\u00fccher studied different examples of institutions i n order to identify those that have been successful. (J / 9) Evaluation of Life Evaluation of life was not a topic studied by B\u00fcche r. (K / 9) Social Insurance B\u00fccher looked for alternative arrangements in the f amily circle and beyond. (L / 9) Policy and Future Issues For policy issues, he referred in particular to his torical studies. He searched for those policies that have been successful in the past. Friedrich Althoff (1839-1908) Friedrich Althoff, the legendary Prussian administr ator in the Ministry of Culture and Science, showed how to set up a university system b y the state in a meaningful way. Through his skillfully designed science policy, he created an institutional environment in which science and scholarship could thrive. The focus in chapter ten was on medical science and scholarship. (A / 10) Demand In the field of public health and the introduction of public health legislation, Althoff's influence was visible. He tried to take effective m easures to control and eliminate tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. If one would follow Althoff, then one would investigate the value of the latent, but cont inuing, benefits of averting outbreaks of epidemics caused by temporarily vanqui shed diseases and count them as a real product in the national health economy. M edical-economic issues would not be ignored by governments in arriving at health car e budgets. 332 (B / 10) Supply The promotion of excellent medical researchers, who m Althoff provided with an adequate working environment, led to more innovatio ns and generally an improvement of the quality of health care services supplied. (C / 10) Information Althoff's science policy included a network of scho lars who gathered relevant information on science and scholarship. This networ k was an important pillar of the Althoff System . (D / 10) Optimal Contracts It has been shown for medicine and public health th at an innovative push was brought about through a change in the incentive str uctures of research related institutions such as polytechnic institutes, univer sities, and hospitals. Several measures taken by Althoff led to this change. For e xample, he improved the informational basis by setting up a statistical dat abase and subsequently an informal network, through which he discovered talented schol ars. He supported them and created new positions by founding research institut es and hospitals to further experimental and diagnostic research in health care . By offering chances to outsiders and opening the borders, Althoff contribu ted to a system of science and scholarship that was excellent. (E / 10) The Market for Pharmaceuticals The example of Behring shows that Althoff took adva ntage of the willingness of the pharmaceutical industry to provide funding for phar maceutical research. As has been shown in the chapter, Althoff combined a public goo d, basic research, with a private good, in this case patents resulting as a by-produc t, and was thus able to gain funding for the public good. (F / 10) Insurance Schmoller's work on insurance was well-known to Alt hoff, who supported Schmoller's research program and the appointments Schmoller pro posed. 333 (G / 10) Technology Althoff is particularly relevant on issues of medic al innovation and technology. Currently, health policy initiatives are largely fo cused on cost-containment. In contrast, Althoff emphasized the performance aspect pushing for research innovation and technological improvement. At the sa me time, as has been shown in chapter ten, he developed innovative methods of fin ance for the new research and development. (H / 10) Institutions (hospitals/ nursing homes) Althoff's projects concerning foundation of new hos pitals and modernization projects have been described in the chapter. Althoff tried t o represent the different groups of society. For instance, he gave funds for the develo pment of a Protestant institute for tropical medicine, but then also supported the foun dation of a Catholic one. (J / 10) Evaluation of Life His fight against tuberculosis shows that Althoff w as aware of the value of life as an economic category. The value of life could be incre ased if the disease could be prevented and the life could be extended for those tuberculosis patients who could be healed. Althoff made the fight against tuberculosis a government policy. (K / 10) Social Insurance In his appointment policies, Althoff favored those who stood behind Schmoller's social insurance system. (L / 10) Policy and Future Issues From chapter ten the conclusion follows that the st ructure of the organization matters. Althoff's approach focuses on innovative funding an d the promotion of excellent researchers, whom he discovered and for whom he cre ated an appropriate work environment. His science policy with respect to med icine has no equivalent in modern health policy. Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943) The contribution by the physician Franz Oppenheimer , who looked for a solution that leads to a decline in morbidity and mortality of th e population, lies largely outside of the account of modern health economics (compare cha pter eleven). 334 (A / 11) Demand After Oppenheimer had recognized that the main sour ces of mortality and diseases are to be found in the social environment, he turne d to the social sciences and developed his vision of a new order of society. Cen tral to his vision were individual freedom and a healthy social and productive environ ment. Oppenheimer wanted to create a healthy social envir onment of work and production. In order to reach this goal, he proposed a land ref orm and the establishment of cooperative settlements. Confronted with massive un employment in the industrial quarters of Berlin, crowded living conditions and i llness, he devised a scheme that would bring industrial laborers back to the land by buying defaulted estates and turn them into small agro-industrial farms. With respect to health, he tried to achieve both, a reduction in exposure to infection and an improve ment in the individual resistance to infection. Sufficient nutrition and rest, as wel l as adequate housing and sanitary conditions are factors that increase the individual resistance to disease and make it thus less likely to become ill or die of a disease, but central to Oppenheimer was individual freedom. He expected that people who liv e in freedom in a cooperative settlement are healthier than those who live in cro wded industrial quarters or those who live under fiefdom at the countryside. (B / 11) Supply As a physician, Oppenheimer, the son of a reformist Rabbi, was rather unpriviledged. He had to work in the proletarian quarters of Berli n, where he witnessed urban housing problems. In this environment he had the thought th at economics is the medicine of society. (C / 11) Information Oppenheimer noted that medicine requires informatio n on social conditions. (D /11) Optimal Contracts Oppenheimer did not make contributions with respect to optimal contracts. (E /11) The Market for Pharmaceuticals Oppenheimer is more interested in the therapeutical side, including social therapy, than in the market for pharmaceuticals. 335 (F / 11) Insurance After his emeritation in 1917, Schmoller insisted t hat Oppenheimer became professor and continued giving the introductory lecture to st udents, where insurance was a central topic. (G / 11) Technology Technology did not belong to the central explanator y variables by Oppenheimer. (H / 11) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) According to Oppenheimer, institutions make medical success possible. The cooperatives he created on estates east side of the Elbe were financed with the proceeds from the unemployment insurance and should create conditions that would never lead to unemployment again. (J / 11) Evaluation of Life Oppenheimer did not consider evaluation of life as an economic topic. (K / 11) Social Insurance Oppenheimer saw self-sufficiency as a criterion of social insurance. (L / 11) Policy and Future Issues Oppenheimer's proposal adds to what is currently di scussed in health economics and goes beyond in providing a realistic political pers pective in developing the underpopulated countryside of, for instance, parts of Germany with undervalued real estate for whatever historical reasons. As has been shown in chapter eleven, Oppenheimer's proposal centers on land rent; land i s meant in the sense of natural resources in general. As has been shown in chapter thirteen, the implications of Oppenheimer's, Althoff's and Schumpeter's work go b eyond what is represented in the matrix, which serves as the guideline for this chap ter. Joseph Schumpeter (1883 - 1950) In his early works, Schumpeter tried to integrate t he discipline of economics in a larger social-economic context (compare chapter twe lve). 336 (A / 12) Demand Based on Schmoller's empirical (historical) approac h, Schumpeter looked for one and the same theory that could explain both, econom ic development and its cultural consequences. In the omitted \"Seventh Chapter\" of The Theory of Economic Development 23 he also sketched the broader picture of health in economic development containing important implications for h ealth policy. The entrepreneur, although explicitly not the last cause, is a drivin g force in his explanation of development. Schumpeter has pointed out that demand for health services, as well as supply, occur both in the same social and cultur al context. A medical supply structure has first to be in place, before demand c an be met. (B / 12) Supply In his early work of 1912, Schumpeter defined the e ntrepreneur as any entity developing new combinations. He described the examp le of the physician as entrepreneur, which has implications for both, dema nd and supply of health services as the physician partly determines demand. Patients have entrepreneurial potential, too. People can do much themselves to improve their health. We can observe an increasing interest in nutritional supplements or e xercise into late life, thus providing fertile markets for spas, health-related tourism, a nd other sectors of the economy. Schumpeter also saw the possibility of a public ent ity acting as an entrepreneur. Althoff is an example of a state bureaucratic entre preneur in a Schumpeterian sense who devised an efficient state system, in this case for education. The implications of Althoff's actions in particular for medicine have b een shown in chapter ten. (C / 12) Information Schumpeter has described information as a cultural condition, for instance, a common language and common ideas about treatment are requi red in the relationship between patient and physician. (D / 12) Optimal Contracts A situation and the state of development are depend ent on culture. Schumpeter described behavior as being optimal in one situatio n, but not in another, dependent on the cultural context. 23 Leipzig, Verlag von Duncker & Humblot. 1912. 337 (E / 12) The Market for Pharmaceuticals In his early work on development and the cultural c ontext, Schumpeter was not so specific as to include the market for pharmaceutica ls. His later argument concerning the justification of a monopoly in the presence of high costs of R&D stems from his more mature work and is now a central argument in t he literature on the market for pharmaceuticals. (F / 12) Insurance Schumpeter was not specifically interested in quest ions of insurance. (G / 12) Technology Basic research in medicine can lead to effects on a pplications developed in the commercial sector such as the cosmetics industry. T hese applications widen the scope of the economy. We could think of medicine as an e ngine driving technological change. New applications might be possible because of secondary and tertiary benefits of certain drugs and therapies and there a re interrelations to other sectors of the economy. Progress in medicine could transform t he entire economy, leading towards a better economic performance. This conside ration is clearly outside the scope of current health economics. (H / 12) Institutions (Hospitals, Nursing Homes) Institutions are central in Schumpeter's work. (J / 12) Evaluation of Life Evaluation of life was too narrow a concept to Schu mpeter. (K / 12) Social Insurance Depending on the cultural context, problems of soci al insurance can be very different, but the basic problems are the same. Schumpeter was interested in interrelationships in general and repercussions. (L / 12) Policy and Future Issues As Schumpeter has pointed out, dependent on the cul tural context one cannot choose one and the same political program for every countr y. In practice, this means that 338 dependent on the cultural context different health policies have to be implemented by the World Health Organization. 14.3 Summary and Conclusions By pursuing a thought to its origin \"that which see med dogmatic, objective, ideal or fixed\" can be brought into motion. 24 Grimmer- Solem has compared the different sciences and found that \"in the social sciences, an d particularly in economics, this process is still in its infancy.\" ( op. cit. , 2003, p. 1). For health economics, such an attempt has been made in this book. This defines on e of the purposes of this study. In this chapter, the old perspective has been document ed and related to what is available now. A recurrent theme among the demand issues is the im portance of social and economic conditions as determinants of health and t hrough this of the demand for health care. Paracelsus points to the life threaten ing work conditions in the silver mines. Roscher has focused on unhealthy factory wor k and makes a pledge for factory inspectors. Oppenheimer witnessed the terri ble housing and sanitary conditions as a major threat to health and saw the connection to unemployment. He advocated a return to the country side and agricult ure. Schumpeter explained how structural economic decline can undermine the psych ic health of the polulations dependent of the declining industry. Prevention is a second thread of thought. Justi and other Cameralists proposed a broad policy, ranging from agricultural development to improving provision with food and sanitary measures. Wagner predicted that preven tion would be of increasing importance in the future and involve a larger role for the state. Althoff provided a practical example. His policy in health care resear ch was geared to prevention by eliminating infectious diseases, such as tuberculos is. The impact of living conditions and prevention belo ng both to the fringe of modern health economics, but in a far less specialized age the perspective of the historical authors was broader. Through their efforts, Paracel sus, Wolff, and the Cameralists tried to improve the science of medicine. Althoff p romoted research and looked for talents to help reach his goal. By changing univers ity structures, he wanted to achieve excellence. His idea was that excellent res earchers were better able to achieve progress, not only with respect to preventi on, but also with respect to social, cultural, economic, and scientific goals, for insta nce functional architecture, efficient organizational structures, or the development of ne w products as a by-product of chemistry and physics. Wagner wanted the state to p ay for state-of-the-art technology in order to promote better results. 24 Erik Grimmer-Solem. 2003. The Rise of Historical Economics and Social Reform in Germany 1864-1894. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 1. 339 In the discussions of supply side issues the author s show a keen eye for the absence of markets, and in addition to market imper fections, when early markets were present. Paracelsus did know from his own expe rience about supplier-induced demand and about the opportunities to exploit the p atient for the benefit of the doctor and perhaps also for the benefit of the patient. Ce nturies later, Menger was much more critical about doctors who give in to the misp laced demands of patients who are in error. Another source of the absence of mark ets and market imperfection is lack of competition between suppliers of health car e. The barriers to entry can be erected by the group of suppliers, such as the requ irement to speak Latin, mentioned by Paracelsus; or barriers are erected with the sup port of the (local) public authority such as the legal monopolies or cartels for pharmac ists. There was also discussion of policies against such medical market imperfectio ns and about the proper role of public authorities with regard to the supply side. Public supervisory committees proposed by Justi should be of help in fighting mal practice by professionals who exploit the absence of markets or market imperfecti ons. As Roscher pointed out there is no easy way out by opening the field for n on-professionals, even if they have a good general education and perform well. Imperfec t capital markets can be be another obstacle to development of medicine. In the nineteenth century, capital began to play a role at the supply side, in particu lar in pharmaceuticals. Wagner suggested that the state might come up with finance if capital does not come forward from the private sector due to underdeveloped capit al markets. Althoff showed the way how the state can force development of medical technology through a well designed research policy - supported by state inves tments in research. Absence of markets, market imperfections, and publi c intervention to counter them, had been part of the main repertoire of health econ omics from its beginnings on. This history emphasizes health economics before Arr ow identified market imperfections. Information problems can show up at the individual, group and national level. Paracelsus highlighted information asymmetries at t he individual level of the patient and his doctor. At the group level lack of informat ion can thwart actuarial calculations which are necessary to set efficient insurance prem iums. Therefore Schmoller proposed insurance geared to small, homogenous grou ps expecting that for such groups it would be possible to build up the necessa ry information. Data gathering with respect to relevant health related issues at t he collective level of the state was one of the concerns of the Cameralists. Two hundred years later Althoff improved and extended that type of collecting statistical in formation. He also did solve the information problem in searching for top research t alent by building up and exploiting a network of experts in the field of science and me dicine. In modern health economics, the notion of a fully-informed and price -taking consumer deciding upon what quantity of health care services to purchase h as been modified in order to meet the characteristics of this field. (Compare Ellis, McGuire, 1993, op. cit. , p. 137). The issues that have been described under the category of information are diverse and more complex than what we typically discuss in mode rn health economics. The category 'optimal contract' in the matrix conce rns the discussions of incentive 340 structures leading to efficient behaviour. They are quite diverse. Paracelsus demanded that there should be patents for medicine and copyrights for medical authors. In today's textbooks such property rights are presented as incentives to innovation by enabling the innovator to appropriate the market value of his creation. What for Paracelsus mattered in the first place was the recognition for the innovator and even more the guarantee of authenticity and qua lity of the product. Wolff described the house as an integrated production and consumption unit which can largely support itself. The demarcation between the houses and public institutions creates on the one hand incentives that discourage free riding on public services, on the other hand the demarcation also implies incenti ves for the house to rely on the market for medical relief only when incapable to he lp itself. By offering opportunity and finance, Althoff's policy created incentives fo r institutes involved in research and for ambitious individual researchers to undertake p athbreaking research. Incentives are discussed here in a context quite different fro m the analysis of incentive structures in modern health economics. In Paracelsus' time health care insurance did not e xist and from his own experience he knew that poor patients had not the means to pay the doctor. As a solution he proposed that the doctor should treat the poor free of charge. Those who could afford to pay more should contribute more according to the value they ascribed to health care services. It was not Paracelsus' intent ion that the doctor was entitled to cross subsidize the treatment of the poor by chargi ng higher prices to his well-to-do patients. Health policy as a means of redistributio n is a more recent idea. The roots of early life insurance went back into th e time of Paracelsus, but local accident and health insurances in the form of mutua l funds for people connected by profession, trade union or otherwise developed much later during the nineteenth century. Schmoller, who was concerned with the deve lopment of markets, investigated actuarial principles of insurances. He saw that large parts of the working population remained without coverage and pointed to the necessity of intervention of the state, in particular by making catastrophic hea lth insurance a legal obligation for wage dependent workers. His ideas on insurance are embedded in the system on social insurance, which he stood for. Wagner predicted that the growing cultural complexi ty of society would require the state to play an increasingly large role, not only in financing the necessary investments, but also with respect to regulation. I n particular, he predicted more preventive measures such as better quality of water , housing, working conditions, health and sanitary policies. Althoff showed how th e state could speed up technical progress in medicine by entering in public-private partnership, funding basic research with the revenues from its commercial appl ication through patents. How crucial basic research is as a source of inventions and their spin-off in innovation and economic development was brought to light by Schump eter one hundred years ago. It suggests that one can investigate the potential of the medical sector and its basic research as an engine driving economic growth. It i s a perspective quite different from the conventional focus of health economics on the economic expenditures of the medical sector. Baumol and Bowen divided the he alth care sector into a 341 technically advanced part, where private initiative can be found. Here, they see what Schumpeter described, but they also pointed towards another part of health care: when labor cannot be substituted by capital, they c haracterized it as a stagnating sector. This phenomenon can be observed in health c are. For instance, long-term care of the elderly can be characterized as a stagn ating sector. Paracelsus frequently struggled with questions of t he value of life and related to it, the value of medical art. He asked who can pay a ph ysician, if life is so valuable. The Cameralists, Justi included, were among the first t o view an improvement in the general health of the population as an increase in human capital, not only because of the higher productivity of healthy workers, but als o because of other intangibles. In contrast to Adam Smith' \"wealth\", Justi was writing about \"happiness of the states,\" which requires both, a healthy and happy population as a prerequisite. Benefit analysis today is narrower, using wages or added va lue per worker for evaluating gains in person years. The Austrian concept of time preference, introduced by Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, is also of importance for the eval uation of life. The roots of social insurance go back to Wolff who identified the extended family as the basic provider of support for the member in nee d of help. Important is here the notion of subsidiarity: within the family those who are fit have the obligation to lend a helping hand. He viewed them as an institution of m utual support. Later, the role of reciprocity in networks of mutual exchange was made explicit in the work of B\u00fccher. He basically viewed them as systems of exchange wit hout the use of money. Hundred fifty years after Wolff in the nineteenth c entury Roscher still did see the family as the economic basic unit. However, he had an eye for the social context in which families live, in particular the social situa tion. Remember his suggestion to let the mentally ill within their families and place of residence and also his thoughts about the moral obligation of the well educated and capable citizen to serve the local community. In the early twentieth century Oppenheim er's agricultural cooperatives were supposed to create not only a healthy physical and social environment for the workers and their families but also to provide supp ort to its needy members in case of unemployment, illness, disability and old age: b asically an integrated system of social security based on the same principles of coo peration as Wolff's house. Finally one should keep in mind that the first idea s on mandatory insurance against catastrophic risks of ill health that were brought forward in the nineteenth century by Wagner and von Schmoller reflect their awareness of a deep seated social problem of a national scale that had to be addressed. It wa s an alternative insurance based concept of the welfare state which has been replace d by the British concept of the welfare state (Beveridge report, \"Full Employment f or a Free Society\") almost throughout Europe. The overview provided in this chapter underscores t he thesis that the old health economics is different in perspective than what is currently available in the professional literature in health economics. This chapter contai ns only flashpoints of what is back in the dissertation, but serves the purpose: to sho w that the old perspective is much broader than what we have today. It was a far less specialized age, and to a large 342 part, it was concerned with the development of mark ets. It was concerned with how to make markets work, and thereby assigned a minimu m role to the state.

Summary and Conclusions In this book, the core ideas of famous social scien tists and economists on health are explained, beginning with Paracelsus and ending wit h Schumpeter. In between are chapters on Wolff, Justi, Roscher, Menger, Schmolle r, B\u00fccher, Oppenheimer, and Althoff. The authors covered examined main aspects of the issues of health from an economic, social, and political point of view. From their analyses it follows that over the past centuries the field of health economics ha s developed different contours from how it looks today. A history of the theoretical development of health economics cannot be a whig history written as if the current state of health e conomics were a necessary and logical outcome of work that had been done as far b ack as centuries ago (compare footnote 10, chapter 14). Recent years have seen a dynamic increase in the volume of publications in health economics. This has been largely fueled by increasing state involvement in the industry of health care. For ins tance, the nationalization of the British health care service brought with it to trai n civil servants in the area. Knowledge became more specialized and geared toward s the new institutional arrangements and possibilities, but also restrictio ns and constraints for health care delivery and finance through regulation and specifi c policy making. In the process, chances are that ideas got lost, in particular if t hey are locked up in a foreign language. In this sense, this book makes health eco nomic contributions available to the scholarly literature. Those authors have been chosen whose contributions are classical and of lasting value, but which are not well known. Part of the re ason why they are often overlooked is that they are often locked up in anot her language but English, the lingua franca these days. The scope, emphasis and focus of their work have been very different from what now passes as the mainstre am of health economics. The earlier authors focus on cultural development and h ealth, they rely on the principle of subsidiarity, and they prefer a moderate role of th e public sector. Policy relevance of their studies is given in the time under considerat ion, but the hope clearly is that we also can learn from these authors today. Each major country has a health care crisis, and each case is different. What cannot be accompli shed with this book is to provide a generic solution to these crises all at once. What, instead, can be provided is a set of pegs opening questions on how to approach these iss ues. We have gone back to those authors who raised the issue of health as a p ublic policy problem explaining how they defined and analyzed the problem. After all, i f one wants to fix a structure successfully, one has to understand the master-plan upon which the structure had been built in the first place. 346 347 Appendix Abstracts, Keywords, J.E.L codes A History of German and Austrian EconomicThought o n Health Issues 348 Chapter 2 Paracelsus, Theophrast von Hohenheim (1493-1541): A Holistic Approach to Health Including the Social Scientific Point of View Abstract Paracelsus (1493-1541) renewed in a consistent and comprehensive manner the basis of medical theory of his time. He collected a vast amount of medical and empirical knowledge not only through the study of m edicine, but also through observation, practical experience and contacts with barbers, healers, gypsies, and executioners practicing folk medicine. Today, his a chievements in the areas of medicine, philosophy, linguistics, and theology are widely acknowledged. Many of the works by Paracelsus have been published posthum ously. Only between 1549 and 1658, 175 editions appeared. The research by Ka rl Sudhoff, who edited fourteen volumes of his medical and philosophical work creat ed a scientific basis for further investigation. For his social-political writings he is less well known, because this work has been found very late in order to be included in the complete Paracelsus edition. It contains his contributions to comprehensive heal th sciences and health economic aspects, which are the focus of this chapter. Keywords Health, Health Economics, Paracelsus, 3 Christian Freiherr von Wolff (1679-1754): The House as the Relevant Context of Health Provisi on Abstract Christian Freiherr von Wolff (1679-1754) was a scho lar, who founded economics within his general system of natural law ( jus gentium ). From today's point of view his concept is challenging. For every aspect of life, his focus was on the household and not on the individuals. This is important, since much health r elated services can best be provided within the immediate vicinity of the person to be t reated. Even today, many such services are provided by the family directly. Conve rsely, individuals' health often depends directly on the lifestyle of the family. Wo lff also introduced the principle of subsidiarity. It is relevant in questions of occupa tional and environmental health that go beyond the control of individual households; there is a case of application when young people make provisions for old age; and it became a n important principle in the health care policy of the European Union. Keywords Health, Health Economics, House, Principle of Subsi diarity, Christian (Freiherr von) Wolff von (1717 - 1771): Health as Part of a State's Capital Endowment Abstract In this chapter, the contributions of the Cameralis ts are investigated, in particular those of Justi (1717 - 1771), to the understanding of wha t later was to become health economics. After the disastrous events of the Thirt y Years' War (1618 - 1648), human capital mattered. Hence, Cameralism emerged as a sc ience of economic policy, which was directed towards economic development. It was n ot incompatible with intellectual developments elsewhere, notably in France, but yet totally different in its emphasis on economic development and the human factor in produc tion. The most prolific writer of the Cameralists, who fully developed the science, w as Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi. To him not only the quantity, but also the q uality of the population mattered. Since health has an influence on both, he elaborate d policy measures that would improve the health of the population in order to ma ke economic development possible and to sustain further growth. Justi proposed incen tives that would stimulate agriculture and thus encourage an improvement of the nourishmen t of the population in order to enhance health; he came forward with ideas how to r aise the quality of health care and proposed the introduction of a supervisory board fo r health care provision; and he was concerned with the health of soldiers. As was commo n in Cameralism, Justi considered people the wealth of the nation. Health is therefor e a matter of investment, not consumption; the healthier the population, the high er the wealth of the population. Keywords Cameralism, health, healthcare, Johann Heinrich Got tlob Chapter 5 Wilhelm Roscher's (1817-1894) Historic Method and Health Issues Abstract Wilhelm Roscher (1817-1894) has introduced the hist oric method to economics. He used an eclectic, descriptive approach in order to describe the evolutionary laws governing the development of the economy of a natio n. A nation is characterized by its law, the state, and the economy, but also by religi on, language, art, and science. Roscher concentrated on the first three factors of influence in order to explain the political economy of a nation. In line with Aristot le, he saw the family unit as the beginning of any nation's economy, and not the indi vidual. In his work, we find important tenets for health economics. Roscher prop osed the institution of social welfare services as well as public regulation to pr otect vulnerable groups in society, such as wage laborers, women, and children. He was a fervent advocate of the introduction of factory inspectors. In the Kingdom of Saxony, he was politically active in the implementation of his policy proposals. From to day's point of view, his contribution lies in building institutions for health care servi ces and in his reflections on what could be called, parallel to constitutional public financ e, constitutional health economics.

Codes D13, H4, I1 352 Chapter 6 Adolph Wagner (1835-1917): The Increasing Role of the State in Health Care Abstract Adolph Wagner (1835-1917), the public finance theor ist and advocate, was interested in the limits of the state as a part of the economy . His prediction of the likely long-term development of the tasks of the state is known as Wagner's Law . He showed that with an advance in the culture of a society the tasks of the state will grow in the long run. Wagner has formulated the conditions under which th e state can and should intervene in the economic process and thus created a basis fo r legislation. He foresaw a role of the state with respect to health care, which will b e the focus of this chapter. In the introduction, Wagner's work will be put in context by providing a short biography. Section 5.2 focuses on Wagner's Law , and an application to health care follows in the next section (5.3). When Wagner formulated his law, capital markets have not yet emerged and institutions were not fully developed. In order to show the relevance of Wagner's Law today, aspects of both, the presence of capital ma rkets and modern institutions, will be discussed in section 5.3 and 5.4. The chapter ends with a summary and conclusions (5.5). Keywords Baumol-Bowen Hypothesis , evolution, health economics, Adolph Wagner Chapter 7 Carl Menger (1840-1921): Perceptions of Health in the Economy Abstract This chapter is devoted to discussing Carl Menger's (1840 - 1921) contributions to health economics. The founder of the Austrian Schoo l of economics saw the importance of health as a factor contributing to th e development of a nation, which is brought about by individual planning and provision for the future. His contributions are contained in his major work of 1868, Grunds\u00e4tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre (Principles of Economics), the point of departure of Austrian E conomics. His successors, Friedrich Freiherr von Wieser B\u00f6hm- thought and established the repu tation of the Austrian school of economics. The major cornerstones of Austrian econo mics are methodological individualism, methodological subjectivism, and an emphasis on time. The focus here lies on Menger's contributions, because with respec t to health economics, his successors did not develop his ideas much further. In order to put Menger's contributions to health economics in context, a sho rt biographical sketch is given in the introduction. In section 6.2, a selection of Carl M enger's remarks on health issues follows, in particular his discussion of individual provisions made for the future. The idea of a subjective discount rate has found entry into modern health economics as will be illustrated in the discussion presented in secti on 6.3. The chapter ends with a summary and conclusions.

Schmoller treated health issues as part of the larger Social Question which had arisen when during Germany's industrial revolution farmers and workers had moved from the c ountry to the cities to find employment in the new established and expanding fac tories. A proletarian class formed and dissatisfaction was high. The Social Question was a main concern to Schmoller. He had the idea to insure the major risk s in workers lives. By establishing state institutions of social insurance he wanted to create the basis on which further markets for insurance could develop. Hereby, he con sidered health a central variable which had an influence in his proposals for economi c policy. Schmoller created the scientific basis for the German welfare legislation in the 1880ies. To this effect, he organized a professional think tank of his colleagu es, the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik . In this chapter, the focus is on health aspects in Schmolle r's work.

In contrast to the classical economists, of whom he was critical for f ocusing on market exchange processes, B\u00fccher has considered mainly that part o f economic behavior which constitutes exchange without a market. As he has no ted, nonmarket economic behavior accounted for a large part of the economy in its earlier stage of development. His illustration of nonmarket behavior includes suc h phenomena as the gift relationship, borrowing and lending of goods and services, and la bor provided in exchange for future help. These kinds of nonmarket exchange are charact erized by a give-and-take relationship and should therefore be distinguished from actions born out of altruism. In line with von Th\u00fcnen's and Gossen's work, B\u00fccher he ld that nonmarket economic behavior is grounded in the principle of marginal u tility. His observations and interpretation of nonmarket exchange are included i n this book because of the relevance of nonmarket arrangements in health care. The issue of nonmarket exchange in health care has become all the more imp ortant with the gradual collectivization of this sector.

The so-called Althoff System refers to the systematic approach standing behind A lthoff's science policy. This had an effect on all sciences, but here, we will concentra te on the implications for medicine and public health. At the time, the industrial deve lopment had significant effects in relation to disease. For instance, new diseases eme rged among the proletarian class of the cities, and this required new ways to view a nd treat these diseases. Althoff took patronage of medical research by supporting scholar s with maverick ideas. He founded institutes and hospitals to further experimental an d diagnostic research. Under Althoff, Germany introduced public health legislation, as in the case of combating tuberculosis. An increase in speed of scientific progress in the field of medicine, as well as other fields could be shown during and shortly after the era Althoff. The relevance of the Althoff System concerns the organization of scholarship in genera l and in this sense of health issues in particular.

Codes I, P, H10, H30, Q 357 Chapter 11 Franz Oppenheimer's (1864-1943) Social Economic Approach to Health Abstract Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943), the physician who la ter turned to economics and the social sciences, saw the root of illness and epidem ics in poor social and economic circumstances. He identified overcrowding, poor foo d, exposure to cold and damp, prolonged and exhausting work, and unhealthy occupa tions as factors that lower the resistance to disease and make people prone to illn ess and early death. Oppenheimer widened his scope and studied what he called \"socia l illness.\" He proposed the agricultural cooperatives ( Siedlungsgenossenschaften ) as the basis for a healthy life. While health economics is typically done in terms o f looking at the specific health conditions, institutions, and costs, Oppenheimer lo oked at the social and economic conditions, which gave rise to poor or better healt h. In this sense, he is a meta health economist. Keywords Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943), cooperative agricult ural settlement, morbidity and mortality, Social Question . J. E. L. Codes B, A, H 358 Chapter 12 Joseph Schumpeter's (1883-1950) Broader Picture and Health Issues Abstract Can one and the same theory explain both, economic development on the one hand and societal consequences of economic development o n the other? Joseph A. Schumpeter (1883 - 1950) provided an answer to this question in the seventh chapter, \"The Economy as a Whole,\" of Theorie 1912. (Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot.) This part of his work appears only in the first edition and has been omitted from later editions, as well as the 1934 English translation. In the omitted chapter, Schumpeter entertained the vision that innovation takes place in institutions and organizational structures, and bec ause of the interrelationships between the different sectors not only affects the entire economy, but promotes the evolution of society as a whole. The key concept of his theory is \"the entrepreneur,\" that is the agent, who has the capability to innova te and is willing to face and accept the possibility of failure. In the seventh chapter, Schumpeter discussed the repercussions of innovation outside the sectors, wh ere the entrepreneurial initiative was taken, thereby also looking at the downside of economic development. Schumpeter was also interested in how sectors other than the economy proper provide a fertile \"playground\" for entrepreneurial talent t hat can end up in economic affairs. He tried to cover the interrelationships between th e different sectors of the economy as the entrepreneurial initiative, but also the failed innovations, reverberate through all the sectors. Health issues are an example of phenomena which belong to all sectors at the same time. For this reason we see Schumpeter as an economist whose writings on economic, institutional and social development are relevant for health economics. We conceive of the discipline not as narrow, but as a broader social science based enterprise in scholarship. Keywords Economic Development, Entrepreneurship, Health, Jos eph A.
