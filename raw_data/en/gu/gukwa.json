On Friday, the FDA [approved](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-first-treatment-cd55-deficient-protein-losing-enteropathy-chaple-disease) Veopoz, a subcutaneous injection, for treating adults and pediatric patients with CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), also known as CHAPLE disease. This condition is an inherited disease that causes the immune system to become overactive and attack the body's own cells. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, impaired growth and can lead to life-threatening severe thrombotic vascular occlusions. The agency's action makes Veopoz the first treatment for the ultra-rare blood disease, which affects less than 100 patients worldwide. On the same day, the FDA greenlit a high dose of Eylea, Regeneron's eye disease treatment. The 8 mg injection is now approved for treating patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Approval came after Regeneron produced data from two 48-week studies evaluating high dose Eylea as opposed to the standard 2 mg injection. Both trials met their primary endpoint. The injection was jointly developed by [Regeneron](https://www.mmm-online.com/?s=regeneron) and Bayer AG, though Regeneron holds the exclusive rights to Eylea and Eylea HD in the U.S. Bayer has the exclusive marketing rights internationally and regulatory filings for Eylea HD are under review in Europe and Japan, according to the companies. \"More than 10 years ago, we fundamentally changed the way that certain serious retinal diseases were treated with the introduction of Eylea. With the approval of Eylea HD, we have elevated the high standard that Eylea set,\" said Regeneron's chief scientific officer George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. [in a statement](https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/eylea-hd-aflibercept-injection-8-mg-approved-fda-treatment-wet). \"Our continued commitment to retinal diseases resulted in an important scientific innovation \u2014 evolving the proven efficacy and safety of Eylea into a new treatment, Eylea HD, that provides lasting vision control with even fewer injections to further benefit those living with wet age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinal diseases.\" The regulatory approvals were announced shortly after Regeneron acquired Decibel Therapeutics and its lead hearing loss candidate DB-OTO for $109 million earlier this month. That transaction also came after Regeneron posted its quarterly earnings, with profit and revenue figures exceeding expectations thanks in part to a bump in collaboration revenue. The company reported $3.16 billion in revenues, marking an increase of 11% year-over-year. In light of the positive momentum at Regeneron's back, BMO raised its stock price target on the company to $985 Monday morning, reiterating an outperform projection. "}
