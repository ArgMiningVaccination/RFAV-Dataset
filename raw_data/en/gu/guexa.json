History: \"Thieves Oil\" is based on a popular legend about a group of thieves who stole from the sick and dead during the years of the Bubonic Plague in Europe. When the thieves were captured, they were offered leniency if they shared the secret of how they avoided contracting the infection. The men described a concoction of herbal extracts which they rubbed on themselves before committing their crimes. Over the years, various herbalists and aromatherapists have developed a number of popular cleansing and immune support blends of essential oils made from the herbs and spices the legendary thieves had used.
