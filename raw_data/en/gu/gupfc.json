How To Use Media Genetic Tests Research The Science Behind ingredients In Detox Hx\u00ae Research published in Antioxidants reported on how N-acetylcysteine (NAC) benefits oxidative damage, liver health, and brain function. Other reviews have discussed the use of NAC as a dietary supplement for brain function by itself or in conjunction with other supplements. NAC along with Alpha-Lipoic Acid helps to produce Glutathione. Glutathione is often referred to as \"the mother of all antioxidants\" and helps to activate phase I and Phase II detoxification pathways. [1] Research published in Biomolecules looked at how Alpha-Lipoic Acid is used as a therapeutic tool in health. ALA has numerous clinically valuable properties. It acts as an enzymatic cofactor and is also involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and manages gene transcription. ALA also acts as antioxidant because it not only improves but also restores the antioxidant systems, and supports their production or cell accessibility. [2] Research published in Experimental and Clinical Sciences Journal found sulforaphane to have tremendous health benefits in humans. Found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, sulforaphane has to be antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and neuroprotective. The immune system effects of sulforaphane demonstrates it to alleviate chronic inflammation by targeting monocytes and macrophages. Supplementation with sulforaphane was found to be very useful for improving liver function through the reduction of oxidative stress. [3] [1] 571-577. Related Products Customer Reviews "}
