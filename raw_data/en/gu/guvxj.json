In addition, the rapid development of imaging technology increases the chances of discovering adrenal incidentalomas. Therefore appropriate practice guidelines are needed, so we, the committee for clinical practice guidelines of the Korean Endocrine Society, have established these practice guidelines for adrenal incidentaloma in Korea. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ADRENAL ADENOMA [1](#B1) [2](#B2)]. The prevalence of adrenal incidentaloma increases with age, and there is no difference between genders. It frequently accompanies obesity, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension [ [1](#B1)]. With advances in imaging technology, the prevalence of adrenal incidentaloma increases to 4% in middle age and up to 10% in the elderly [ [3](#B3) [4](#B4) [5](#B5)]. It is very low in childhood and adolescence. Non-functional benign adenoma is found in 80% of adrenal incidentaloma cases. The prevalence of other disease causes varies by study due to differences in selection criteria and patterns in moving patients to advanced hospitals: the prevalence of pheochromocytoma is 1.5% to 23.0% and that of adrenocortical carcinoma is 1.2% to 12.0%. The types of adrenal incidentaloma reported from abroad are shown in [Table 1](#T1)[ [6](#B6)]. The prevalence of cancer and functional tumors might be exaggerated because previous research included many patients with surgery or a past history of cancer. Recent studies reported the prevalence of adrenocortical carcinoma to be 2.0% to 5.0%, adrenal gland is a location of metastasis for a variety of cancers (lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, etc.), and one cancer patient cohort study claimed that 50% to 75% of adrenal incidentalomas were metastases [ [9](#B9)]. [10](#B10)], but other studies [ [11](#B11) [12](#B12) [13](#B13) [14](#B14)]. There are several types of functional tumors: pheochromocytomas, with an average incidence of 6.2% (range, 2.1% to 20.0%); Cushing's syndrome (including symptom-free), with average of 8.1% (range, 3.0% to 11.3%); and hyperaldosteronism, with an average 3.9% (range, 1.5% 10.0%). tumors (range, 0.7% to 15.0%). [15](#B15)]. If a tumor becomes a functional tumor, subclinical hypercortisolism is the most common finding; overproduction of catecholamine or aldosterone is rarely seen during follow-up. The incidence of overt Cushing's syndrome is less than 1%, and that of asymptomatic hormone abnormality has been reported to be up to 11% [ [5](#B5) [16](#B16)]. A relatively large tumor, larger than 3 cm, has a high potential to cause asymptomatic hormone hypersecretion, with the risk peaking 3 to 4 years later [ [15](#B15)]. Also, when there is an increase in uptake on an NP-59 scan, there is a higher incidence of asymptomatic hypercortisolism [ [17](#B17)]. One hundred and fifty-nine patients with non-functioning adrenal tumors were monitored (for an average of 15.0 to 23.1 months) in parts of the Korean studies mentioned above. Subclinical hypercortisolism was diagnosed in three patients, and pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in one patient [ [10](#B10) [13](#B13) [14](#B14)]. The tumors increased by more than 1 cm in size in three patients, but they were not malignant. METHOD FOR DEVELOPING THESE GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ADRENAL INCIDENTALOMA [Table 2](#T2)). We then searched key overseas practice guidelines and papers and domestic papers related to the selected core propositions. We used \"adrenal incidentaloma\" as a search keyword on all data published in English or Korean from 2000 to the present, targeting meta-analyses, practice guidelines, reviews, etc., on humans (not animal experiments or in vitro studies). We used the databases of KoreaMed, KMbase, and RISS for domestic articles and the databases of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for overseas articles. [Table 3](#T3), we set the recommendation levels depending on strength of the selected literature. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Q. What testing is required when an adrenal incidentaloma is found? R1.

(5) (E) Surgery should be considered when an increase in size is observed during a follow-up period of 4 years. (6) (E) Surgery should be considered when symptoms of organ rupture, bleeding, etc., occur. R15. Tests and pretreatment should be performed when adrenal incidentaloma is found in patients prior to surgery or procedure. (1) (A) Patients with adrenal incidentaloma must undergo biochemical tests for excessive secretion of adrenal hormones or adrenal insufficiency before proceeding with surgery. (2) (C) If pheochromocytoma is suspected or cannot be completely ruled out, treat with an -receptor blocker for 7 to 14 days before proceeding with surgery. (3) (C) When findings, such as high blood pressure accompanied by hypokalemia, suggest an aldosterone-producing adenoma, correcting the hypokalemia and hypertension before surgery is recommended. An aldosterone antagonist is recommended in this case. Q. How should follow-up tests for nonfunctioning benign adrenal incidentaloma be conducted? Q. How should adrenal incidentaloma patients in special situations (the elderly or people under age 40) be managed? RATIONALE FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS What testing is required when an adrenal incidentaloma is found? Biochemical examination [18](#B18)]. According to some hypersecretion of hormones such as aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines has been found in 12% to 23% of adrenal incidentaloma patients without a history of malignant disease [ [19](#B19)]. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the lesion is malignant and whether hormonal hypersecretion is present at the initial diagnosis of adrenal incidentaloma [ [20](#B20)]. [6](#B6)]. [21](#B21)]. Screening tests for Cushing's syndrome are extremely important because it is the most common diagnosis with adrenal incidentaloma. Although there is some controversy about the ideal screening test for asymptomatic hypercortisolism, we recommend a 1 mg overnight DST rather than a 24-hour urinary free-cortisol measurement or a midnight (late-night) cortisol measurement [ [20](#B20) [22](#B22)]. Despite continuing disagreement about the reference range, the sensitivity of the DST is higher than 95%, and its specificity is 70% to 80% when the serum cortisol baseline is set at 1.8 \u00b5g/dL (50 nmol/L); its specificity is higher than 95% but sensitivity decreases when the baseline is set at 5.0 \u00b5g/dL (138 nmol/L) [ [6](#B6) [23](#B23)]. A test value of less than 1.8 \u00b5g/dL is generally normal; a value of 5.0 \u00b5g/dL or more implies asymptomatic hypercortisolism; and a middle range of 1.8 to 5.0 \u00b5g/dL requires additional examination for diagnosis [ [6](#B6) [23](#B23)]. More accurate diagnosis is possible by checking for a low adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level [ [2](#B2)]. Although plasma free metanephrine is known to be the most sensitive screening test for pheochromocytoma, plasma free be performed [ [24](#B24)]. The plasma aldosterone/renin activity ratio is the best initial screening test for primary aldosteronism [ [25](#B25)]. Imaging test [26](#B26)]. Typical tests used to determine the characteristics of adrenal tumors include CT, MRI, and CT attenuation coefficient, expressed in HU, is the best way to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors [ [27](#B27)]. Past studies mostly used an attenuation coefficient of 10 HU in a non-contrast CT as the diagnostic criterion for benign adenoma, and the specificity of this criterion was 71% to 79% with a sensitivity of 96% to [6](#B6) [28](#B28)]. However, 10% to 40% of adrenal masses have low fat content and thus show an HU value >10. Therefore other findings should also be considered when making a diagnosis [ [21](#B21)]. The size of the lesion and pattern after contrast enhancement (called washout) is also an important criterion to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions [ [22](#B22)]. [18](#B18) [26](#B26) [29](#B29)]. [30](#B30)], which makes it a better tool than the size of the tumor in differentiating malignancy [ [6](#B6) [22](#B22)]. Contrast washout should be measured in addition to HU when the initial CT finding is indefinite because many malignant lesions appear to be benign [ [20](#B20)]. The percentage of washout can be determined in imaging delayed 10 to 15 minutes after contrast administration, and the two methods, absolute percentage washout (APW) and relative percentage washout (RPW), can be calculated using the following respective formulas [ [31](#B31)]. Sex steroids or steroid precursors [33](#B33)]. High blood steroid precursor levels have also been observed in patients without clear clinical findings. According to a recent study, adrenal adenomas can be distinguished from adrenal cancer by analysing a urine steroid metabolomics [ [34](#B34)]. [35](#B35)]. There is a much higher risk of malignancy with findings such as masculinization or feminization, increased 17-ketosteroids, or simultaneous hypersecretion of multiple hormones [ [35](#B35)]. Therefore, measurement of sex steroids and steroid precursors, such as androstenedione, testosterone, DHEA-S, and 17-estradiol, can prove the adrenocortical nature of the adrenal mass. Also, the results can also be used as tumor markers after surgery [ [36](#B36)]. Bilateral adrenal incidentaloma [37](#B37)]. Most are benign lesions, bilateral cortical adenoma or nodular hyperplasia, but adrenal hyperplasia, bilateral pheochromocytoma also appear as bilateral adrenal hyperplasia [ [8](#B8)]. Metastatic lesions are usually heterogeneous and have irregular margins, but they are bilateral in only 10% to 15% of cases [ [38](#B38)]. Patients previously diagnosed with cancer require special attention. In consultation with an oncologist, tumor-specific marker tests, contrast-enhanced CT, and location-specific MRI of the chest/abdomen/pelvis should be performed. FDG-PET/CT can be helpful in finding metastatic lesions outside the adrenal gland in cancers with good affinity to FDG, such as lung or breast cancer. Although fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) can be used to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic lesions, a biochemical evaluation for pheochromocytoma must be performed first [ [39](#B39)]. Additionally, all patients with bilateral adrenal involvement should undergo assessment for adrenal insufficiency [ [38](#B38) [40](#B40)]. [41](#B41)]. An adrenal tumor of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [ [42](#B42)], and most such tumors are benign [ [43](#B43)]. Diagnosis is made by identifying the accumulation of each steroid prior to the affected enzyme, and levels of cortisol precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone should be measured during the ACTH stimulation test to rule out 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which accounts for 90% to 95% of all such cases [ [44](#B44)]. What test is to be performed if an additional test is needed in adrenal incidentaloma? MRI or PET scan [45](#B45)]. Therefore MRI may be used selectively when the CT finding is ambiguous. Various studies have used MRI to distinguish between adenomas and non-adenomas [ [46](#B46)], but they found no significant advantage for MRI over a CT scan, and the expense of an MRI was considered a weakness. Chemical shift MRI is better at diagnosing adrenal incidentaloma than conventional MRI, with findings such as reduced T1 signal and increased T2 signal suggestive [ The sensitivity of an 18F-FDG-PET or PET/CT is moderate, and the fact that some adrenal adenoma and pheochromocytoma show false positive results should be taken into account. However, unnecessary surgery can be avoided for nonfunctional tumors with low 18F-FDG uptake, and similarly, surgery can be considered when 18F-FDG uptake is increased because the negative predictive values of those exams are excellent [ [52](#B52)]. One study reported that an 18F-FDG-PET scan was more sensitive than an 131/123I-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan in finding tumor metastases in 17 patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma [ [53](#B53)]. But an 18F-FDG-PET scan cannot distinguish malignancy. Therefore, an 18F-FDG-PET scan can be used as a secondary method of inspection when pheochromocytoma is suspected but no mass is found on other imaging studies. Fine needle aspiration biopsy [54](#B54) [55](#B55)]; however, 6% to 50% of tissue is reported to show indefinite biopsy results. Side effects vary depending on the skill of the operator and are reported to occur in 2.8% to 14% cases. Although rare, serious side effects such as pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, and pancreatitis can occur [ [56](#B56)]. Also, cases have been reported in which adrenal cancer spread into the peritoneal cavity via the biopsy needle [ [8](#B8)]. The need for FNAB has decreased as the accuracy of imaging tests for the adrenal glands has improved [ [57](#B57)]. [57](#B57) [58](#B58)]. It is important to rule out pheochromocytoma before performing FNAB [ [40](#B40)]. What testing confirms adrenal incidentaloma is functioning? [59](#B59)]. The serum cortisol test has a higher diagnostic accuracy than the urinary free-cortisol test [ [60](#B60)]. [58](#B58)]. Plasma catecholamine measurements can be helpful when pheochromocytoma is strongly suspected but the urine test result is ambiguous. [61](#B61) [62](#B62) [63](#B63)]. Asymptomatic hypercortisolism [63](#B63)]. This is the of functional adrenal incidentaloma, accounting for 5% to patients [ [12](#B12) [14](#B14)]. That great difference in prevalence is mainly due to inconsistent diagnosis criteria. [6](#B6) [64](#B64)]. Many retrospective studies and cross-sectional studies have reported an increased incidence of high blood pressure, central obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and fractures in asymptomatic hypercortisolism patients [ [16](#B16) [65](#B65) [66](#B66)]. [67](#B67)]. A retrospective cohort study of 206 people observed an increased mortality rate among asymptomatic hypercortisolism patients, and the main causes of death were cardiovascular and infectious diseases [ [68](#B68)]. However, most research in this area has been limited to retrospective studies, so whether asymptomatic hypercortisolism patients face an increased mortality rate compared to the general population is not yet known [ [64](#B64) [69](#B69)]. [65](#B65) [70](#B70)]. In another retrospective study of 20 patients, eight of the 10 patients who received an adrenalectomy showed improved hypertension or hyperglycemia, and those that did not receive surgery deteriorated [ [71](#B71)]. A prospective randomized controlled study of 45 asymptomatic hypercortisolism patients for an average follow-up period of 8 years found that two-thirds of the 23 patients who received surgery showed improved diabetes mellitus and hypertension, but some of the patients who received conservative treatment showed worsened blood glucose levels or blood pressure. Three patients underwent surgery due to an increase in the size of the adrenal tumor without progression to overt Cushing's syndrome [ [72](#B72)]. On the other hand, another retrospective study reported no difference in metabolic indicators or risk factors for atherosclerosis between patients who received an adrenalectomy and those who or bilateral adrenalectomy for a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma will need steroid replacement therapy to prevent hypoadrenalism after surgery [ [76](#B76) [77](#B77)]. Because ACTH secretion is suppressed by hypercortisolism, cortisol stimulation is insufficient after surgery. Cortisol secretion after surgery can be lower than normal because of atrophy in the opposite adrenal gland [ [78](#B78)]. However, little research has been done on steroid replacement therapy during surgery for a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma, and no clear guideline exists for steroid replacement therapy before and after surgery. For patients undergoing major surgery, endogenous cortisol generally increases with the start of anesthesia to reach a blood concentration of 75 to 150 \u00b5g/dL and then returns to preoperative the plasma concentration 24 to 48 hours after surgery [ [79](#B79) [80](#B80)]; therefore, 100 mg of hydrocortisone is usually administered intravenously right before anesthesia so cortisol in the blood will reach a maximum concentration at the time of the adrenal resection. An additional 100 mg of hydrocortisone is administered right after the adrenal gland resection or every 8 hours after the dose immediately before anesthesia for 24 hours [ [75](#B75)]. However, excessive steroid medication should be avoided because it could slow recovery, increase the risk of infection at the surgical site, and lead to hyperglycemia during and after surgery. [81](#B81) [82](#B82)]. To prevent venous thromboembolism, have patients wear an intermittent air compression device or compression stockings during and after surgery or administer low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin until they can move completely. [77](#B77)]. Patients and their families should be educated about the symptoms of and remedies for hypoadrenocorticism [ [77](#B77)]. If cortisol secretion is normal, steroid replacement therapy is to be discontinued [ [5](#B5)] after performing an adrenal cortical function assessment via morning cortisol, an ACTH stimulation test, and an insulin-induced hypoglycemia-induction test on steroid replacement therapy. It usually takes 18 months for cortisol secretion to recover to normal after resection of a cortisol-producing adrenal tumor [ [83](#B83)]. [84](#B84)]. Vaccination can be considered during steroid replacement therapy, depending on the age of the patient [ [77](#B77)]. Pheochromocytoma [85](#B85)]. Therefore, treatment to reduce pre-/postoperative cardiovascular complications in pheochromocytoma patients before surgery should be conducted, and -blockers are recommended as the drug of choice. No randomized clinical study has compared the efficacy of non-selective -blockers with that of selective 1-blockers [ [86](#B86)]. A calcium channel blocker is the drug most commonly added to improve the regulation of blood pressure in patients already receiving -blockers [ [87](#B87)]. Calcium channel blocker monotherapy is not recommended unless the patient has very mild hypertension or severe orthostatic hypotension when treated with -blockers. Simultaneous preoperative administration of -blockers can be used only to control tachycardia after -blocker administration. The use of -blockers without -blockers is not recommended because of the risk of a hypertensive crisis caused by unilateral stimulation of the -receptor. No evidence suggests that non-selective or selective -blockers are superior to each other. Metyrosine inhibits the synthesis of catecholamines and can thus be used preoperatively with -blockers to reduce blood loss and volume deficiency during surgery and to stabilize blood pressure [ [88](#B88)]. [89](#B89)]. In addition, injecting 1 to 2 L of normal saline the day before surgery can help. A high-sodium diet and normal saline injection before surgery is recommended because -blockers alone can restore blood volume contraction in only about 60% of patients [ [90](#B90)]. Special attention is needed when volume loading in patients with heart failure or renal insufficiency. [91](#B91) [92](#B92)]. [93](#B93)]. Understand that hypertension and tachycardia during surgery cannot be completely prevented, even when a combination therapy of antihypertensive drugs and other medications is administered. [94](#B94) [95](#B95)]. Thus, minimally invasive adrenal surgery, such as is recommended for most adrenal pheochromocytoma. Open adrenal surgery is recommended for tumors larger than 6 cm and infiltrative pheochromocytoma to guarantee complete resection of the tumor and prevent tumor rupture and local recurrence. No studies have yet compared the difference between the recurrence rates after different types of surgery. [95](#B95)]. The retroperitoneal approach is better for patients who have previously received abdominal surgery or those who need bilateral adrenal resection [ [96](#B96) [97](#B97)]. [89](#B89)]. There are many reports about hypoglycemia after surgery, but no research has been done on the exact prevalence. Medication, including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, should be considered even when the plasma aldosterone/renin activity ratio is positive, but no additional tests to confirm the presence of an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma or evaluate the subtype are available [ [105](#B105)]. Treatment for excess aldosterone is necessary because complications myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular mortality increase even when hypertension and hypokalemia are controlled, if excess aldosterone is not corrected. Primary aldosteronism patients should have their blood pressure and serum potassium corrected before surgery, and surgery should be postponed if hypertension and hypokalemia are not regulated. Use antihypertensive drugs, including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, for hypertension and hypokalemia correction. [61](#B61)]. Potassium supplements and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy should be discontinued the day after surgery. Adjust the dosage of antihypertensive drugs according to the change in blood pressure after surgery. To prevent hyperkalemia caused by hypoaldosteronism, which is a result of chronic of the contralateral adrenal gland in aldosteroneproducing adrenal adenomas, allow free ingestion of salt for several weeks after surgery. Continuous hypoaldosteronism that requires fludrocortisone replacement therapy can occur in up to 5% of patients who received an adrenalectomy. Creatinine elevation and microalbuminuria after surgery and a decreased glomerular filtration rate before surgery are meaningful predictors of postoperative hyperkalemia [ [106](#B106) [107](#B107)]. What a malignancy in adrenal incidentaloma? [3](#B3) [31](#B31)]. A malignant tumor of the adrenal gland accidentally discovered through imaging does not present any symptoms when there is no abnormality in hormone secretion. In some cases, flank pain, obscure abdominal discomfort, fever due to internal bleeding, and abdominal distension caused by pushing on the surrounding tissues can occur, but it is impossible to differentiate malignant tumors based only on clinical features. However, if a patient has a history of extra-adrenal malignant tumors, the chance that an adrenal incidentaloma will be metastatic cancer is nearly half, so it is important to check patient history of malignancy [ [108](#B108)]. Metastatic cancers of the adrenal gland are often from lung, kidney, colon, breast, esophagus, pancreas, liver, or stomach cancer, and the metastases are often bilateral. [109](#B109) [110](#B110)]. When suggesting surgical treatments, consider the age of the patient and the associated disease. [111](#B111)]. [112](#B112)]. [109](#B109) [110](#B110)]. When [6](#B6)]. The laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the most useful treatment for excising tumors. It generally shows better results than open surgery in terms of hospital stay and recovery speed when it is performed by experienced surgeons. Open surgery is still recommended when the tumor is large or suspected to be malignant, but that recommendation remains controversial [ [2](#B2)]. [8](#B8)]. The possibility of malignancy increases if the tumor grows more than 1 cm, so tumor growth above that size should trigger consideration of surgical resection [ [109](#B109)]. Surgical treatment should also be considered in the presence of symptoms such as pain, organ rupture, or bleeding caused by other tumors. [113](#B113)]. Typically phenoxybenzamine has been recommended as the primary drug, though doxazosin can also be used. Aldosterone-producing adenomas also require preoperative treatment for high blood pressure and hypokalemia [ [24](#B24) [109](#B109)]. How should [8](#B8) [109](#B109)]. Considering the increases in health care costs, the relatively common false-positive results, and the risk associated with radiation exposure from CT scans, follow-up test is unnecessary in some cases [ [7](#B7)]. When the tumor is less than 2 cm and the non-enhanced attenuation value is 10 HU, repeated imaging tests are of limited utility. If the tumor does not change in size over a period of more than 1 year, we recommend no further follow-up [ [6](#B6)]. [114](#B114)]. [115](#B115)]. If an adrenal incidentaloma with indeterminate radiological features increases in size more than 0.8 to 1.0 cm during 3 to 12 months of follow-up, consider an adrenalectomy [ [116](#B116)]. [117](#B117)]. Relatively large tumors, larger than 3 cm, have a high possibility of causing asymptomatic hormone hypersecretion, and that risk reaches its peak in 3 to 4 years. Therefore, it is reasonable to conduct annual hormone tests for at least 5 years when the tumor is larger than 3 "}
