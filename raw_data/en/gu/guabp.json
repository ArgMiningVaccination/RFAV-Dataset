Shirodhara cleanses the mind and senses. Make use of this time and avoid unnecessary stimulation after your therapy. Avoid large crowds and make the remainder of your day peaceful. This is your time for mental rest and rejuvenation. Eat lightly before the therapy. Shirodhara has an effect on the digestive system and a full stomach is not advised. Your hair will be oily after Shirodhara. Dress appropriately and comfortably. Wear an old shirt, something you don't mind getting oil on. It is advised to leave the oil in your hair for at least a few hours following the therapy. Please cover your head following the therapy. If the weather is cool, windy or cold, bring an old warm hat, again something you don't mind getting oil on. An old scarf works well to cover the head and hair in warmer weather. A plastic shower cap also works well. Post-Shirodhara Tips - How to wash the hairs - If your shirodhara was done with oil and you have a lot of hair, the easiest way to remove the oil is to add the shampoo to your hair before adding water. The shampoo will grab hold of the oil so it can be easily rinsed out. - Avoid Caffeine For A Few Days - Caffeine creates disharmony in the body and will have an immediate negative effect on your nervous system. You can take fresh fruit juice instead. - Enjoy Some light and nutritious food - Kitchari is a perfect combination of protein and carbohydrate, very light and has cleansing properties. It also helps to maintain the balance of the Bio- energies (doshas). Some Important tips for Self-Care It is possible that for some people the effects of your shirodhara may not be immediately known. Continue to care for yourself and over time you will notice a change. If the effects of your shirodhara were felt immediately follow the below three tips to maintain the peaceful qualities. - Keep healthy Diet and Lifestyle - Eat well. A diet high in sugar, caffeine, salads and refined products will eventually take its toll on the body and mind. Choose whole grains like rice, oats and whole wheat. Enjoy fresh fruit for a snack and eat cooked vegetables daily. Choose high quality protein and dairy products. - Follow fixed daily routine for eating and sleeping habits - A regular daily routine maintains health of the doshas. Wake and sleep with the rise and setting of the sun. - Meditate - Meditation is the ultimate cleanser for the body and mind and the only other process I am aware of that has the same benefits of shirodhara - relaxation, separation from thought, rest and renewal.
