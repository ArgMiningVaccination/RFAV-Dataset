Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits applications that will advance understanding of vaccine regimens and immune responses that sustainably suppress virus in HIV-infected individuals. The FOA will support small, multi-arm, comparative clinical trials designed to identify correlations between levels of induced immune response and HIV virologic control. Vaccines may be combined with adjuvants and/or other modifiers of the immune response to HIV. HIV-infected persons currently require lifelong treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The development of therapeutic vaccines that induce HIV-controlling immune responses could end the need for lifelong treatment. However, it has proven exceptionally difficult to induce protective immune responses using vaccination strategies. Despite a number of clinical trials, effective products have not been developed. Substantial evidence suggests immune responses can reduce viral loads (VL) in HIV-infected persons. Some individuals naturally suppress VL to low levels without cART. These elite controllers often produce CD8 T cell responses recognizing specific HIV peptides. Other individuals maintain low VL after cART is withdrawn. The CD4 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in these post-treatment controllers display enhanced functional activity. Finally, some infected individuals develop broadly neutralizing HIV-specific antibodies (bNAb) that exhibit antiviral activity when cloned, manufactured and administered passively to infected persons. Together, these observations suggest HIV should be susceptible to vaccination-induced immune-mediated control. However, robust correlates of immune-mediated VL control in HIV-infected persons have yet to be identified, and there are sizable gaps in both our knowledge about the most effective mechanisms for suppressing HIV and how to sustainably maintain protective responses. Chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation persist in HIV-infected persons despite VL suppression with cART. These conditions have a variety of effects on immunity that may interfere with vaccine responsiveness. One prominent aspect of the dysregulation is T cell exhaustion, characterized phenotypically by upregulated expression on T cells of \"checkpoint\" receptors like PD-1. In experimental models of HIV infection, and in human cancer patients, therapeutic blockade of checkpoint pathways can increase and/or broaden T cell responses. Thus, therapeutic vaccine strategies for HIV may benefit from co-administration of immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory agents that antagonize suppressive checkpoint or inflammatory pathways. The VL rebound that follows withdrawal of cART is thought to result from activation of HIV reservoirs comprised of latently infected cells containing integrated HIV DNA. The latently infected cells may be invisible to the immune system if they do not express sufficient levels of HIV antigens. It may be possible to expose these quiescent reservoirs through the use of latency reversing agents (e.g., HDAC inhibitors, PKC agonists, TLR agonists). However, some reservoirs may reside within \"sanctuaries\" that are inaccessible to cytotoxic T cells. Thus, therapeutic vaccine strategies targeting HIV reservoirs may benefit from co-administration of agents that induce expression of HIV antigens and/or disrupt the capacity of HIV to hide within sanctuary sites. Perhaps the largest challenge to therapeutic vaccine strategies is the capacity of HIV to escape from immune responses. The dominant T cell responses elicited during acute HIV infection typically target regions of the virus that can mutate without substantially diminishing viral fitness, and the HIV reservoirs in patients on cART are replete with proviruses harboring mutations that have escaped from dominant T cell responses. Thus, therapeutic vaccine strategies may need to overcome the robust priming of these dominant but ineffective responses, perhaps by targeting conserved regions of HIV that are unable to mutate without compromising viral fitness. HIV also escapes from B cell responses, making it difficult for antibodies to bind and neutralize its envelope glycoproteins. Nevertheless, some individuals produce measurable titers of bNAb that recognize many HIV variants. Researchers are designing sets of immunogens engineered to guide the de novo maturation of bNAb-producing B cells. While primarily designed for preventive HIV vaccines, some of these constructs may be useful in therapeutic settings as well. Non-neutralizing antibodies also appear to protect against HIV acquisition, perhaps via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or phagocytosis. Thus, the induction or administration of HIV-specific antibodies may be an important component of HIV therapeutic vaccine strategies. The goal of this FOA is to support research that will advance understanding of vaccine regimens and immune responses that sustainably suppress virus in HIV-infected persons. Specifically, it will support hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies utilizing small, comparative, multi-arm, clinical trials. Vaccination approaches that aim to sustainably elicit, boost and/or activate HIV-specific T cells, NK cells, antibodies, or other effector mechanisms are responsive to this FOA, as are approaches that aim to elicit combinations of protective mechanisms. This FOA will support both a primary trial and a follow-on trial designed to confirm the observed correlations between specific immune response and virologic control and further optimize the response. The goal is to incrementally develop effective therapeutic vaccination strategies by increasing our understanding of protective responses and working iteratively to improve the potency of those responses. The target population is HIV-infected persons virologically suppressed by cART. Accordingly, the proposed readout assays must be able to quantify the effects of the therapeutic interventions on measures of persistent virus in this population (e.g., low-level viremia, cell-associated HIV RNA). The use of novel immune and virologic assays is encouraged, as is the use of functional assays (e.g., viral inhibition/suppression assays) and the extensive characterization of responses pre- and post-vaccination. The proposed interventions must include vaccines, perhaps in combination with adjuvants and/or other modifiers of the immune response to HIV. To ensure timely initiation of studies, applicants are strongly encouraged to use agents already approved for human use or agents that are ready to be tested in clinical trials. The first trial must open to enrollment within 12 months of award and can be conducted at no more than 2 clinical research sites located within the United States. Specific areas of interest Applications including the following types of research will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed: Clinical Trial and Regulatory Support All clinical trial planning activities for the first trial must be completed by the time of application submission. The first trial must open to enrollment within 12 months of receiving the award. This FOA will NOT support clinical trial planning activities for the first trial, such as: This FOA will support clinical trial planning activities for the second trial, such as: This FOA may support activities related to the conduct of the clinical trial, including, but not limited to: NIAID reserves the right to specify: 1) whether an IND (Investigational New Drug)/IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) application should be submitted to an appropriate regulatory agency; 2) the entity (NIAID, primary awardee, etc.) who will hold the IND/IDE; and 3) the requirements for the establishment of a DSMB (Data Safety Monitoring Board)/SMC (Safety Monitoring Committee). In most cases, it is expected that the NIAID will not hold the IND/IDE. Applicants should review the NIAID Clinical Terms of Award and associated guidance documents, policies, and procedures that will be made terms of these awards ( [https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/niaid-clinical-terms-award](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/niaid-clinical-terms-award) ), and the DAIDS Clinical Research Policies and Standard Procedures Documents ( [https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/daids-clinical-research-policies-standard-procedures](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/daids-clinical-research-policies-standard-procedures)) that describe requirements for DAIDS-funded clinical research.

Milestones Delineation of milestones is a key characteristic of clinical trial awards made under this announcement. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity. Milestones commensurate with opening enrollment within 12 months of award start date and completing both clinical trial(s) within the period of award will be incorporated into the terms of award. Funding will be provided for the first trial; funding for the second trial will be contingent upon the results from the first trial meeting criteria to warrant an additional trial aimed at further strengthening or focusing the relevant immune responses. NIAID may negotiate funds or the period of performance based on lack of achievement of milestones. If requested by NIAID, a Scientific Advisory Board will be established by the applicant, approved by NIAID staff, and convened to review progress and provide the applicant with evaluations, advice, and recommendations concerning the ongoing and planned research activities.

Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/limited-english-proficiency/index.html. The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html); and [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html). Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. Also note it is an HHS Departmental goal to ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. For further guidance on providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services, recipients should review the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care at [http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53](http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53). In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies. The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an \"assistance\" mechanism (rather than an \"acquisition\" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the NIH as defined below. The PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for: NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below: NIAID Project Scientists will be responsible for: Additionally, an agency program official or IC program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice. Areas of Joint Responsibility include: A Steering Committee (SC) composed of the PD/PI(s), Key Personnel, representatives from sites, representatives from laboratories, and the NIAID Project Scientist (Medical Monitor) will have primary responsibility for facilitating the conduct and monitoring of studies and reporting study results. As the components of the SC may be geographically dispersed, the SC should meet with monthly conference calls, supplemented as necessary by face to face meetings. Each full member of the SC will have one vote. A NIAID Project Scientist (Medical Monitor) will have voting membership. Awardee members of the SC will be required to accept and implement policies approved by the SC. Additional details and responsibilities of the SC may be negotiated at the time of award or post-award. Dispute Resolution: Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16. When multiple years are involved, awardees will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161) [A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the ] [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
