Enter with a mindset for conversation, not debate. I rely on my oncologist; not a friend of a friend who swallowed baking soda and currently 3 types of stage 4 cancer they have. Are there any real, peer reviewed, double blind, scientific human studies that prove cure or life extending benefits of natural things. I heard tumeric might be a legitimate dietary change, but not sure that's been proven. My view: my oncologist picks the best treatment based on statistical outcomes and chance of cure. He is not persuaded by pharmaceutical companies, kickbacks, bribes, fancy trips or anything else nefarious. The other angle I get all the time is the narrative that big pharma refuses to study these because they are not patentable. This makes no sense to me either. Compounds are derived from plants and nature all the time, patented, and used for cancer and other diseases. I'm sure convinced Arm and Hammer would pay whatever it takes to prove that baking soda kills cancer, and they aren't a mom and pop baking soda company. "}
