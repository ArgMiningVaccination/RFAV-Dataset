COVID -19 vaccine s protect against the SARS -CoV-2 virus (also known as COVID -19). The virus causes an infection in the lungs and airways and is a type of respiratory illness. In some cases, the infection can cause problems with other organs or other parts of the body. Go to ahs.ca/covid to learn more about COVID -19. The following COV ID-19 vaccines are approved for use in Canada : mRNA vaccines: Pfizer -BioNTech Moderna Bivalent vaccines are available in Alberta. The Novavax vaccine may not be available in Alberta, and its availability is not guaranteed . For information about the mRNA vaccines, read the vaccine information on ahs.ca/immunize. Who can get the protein -based COVID -19 vaccine? Everyone is at risk of COVID -19. You can get a protein -based COVID -19 vaccine if you are age 12 years or older and you cannot have or do not want an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine . COVID -19 vaccines are free. Do I need a vaccine if I have already had COVID -19? If you have already had COVID -19, it is not yet known how long your protection will last or how much protection you will have agains t variants. It is important to get a COVID -19 vaccine even if you have already had the virus. The vaccine may giv e you better protection if you wait a while after having COVID -19 and then get a vaccine. How long to wait depends on your health history , the number of doses of COVID -19 vaccine you have had, and your risk of getting very sick from COVID -19. If you have had COVID -19 in the past, check with your healthcare provider about when to get a COVID -19 vaccine. What if my child is getting a COVID -19 vaccine? Consent for a COVID -19 vaccine for children under age 18 years is provided by a parent or guardian. If a pa rent or guardian cannot be at the appointment, they can give consent in writing using the consent form at ahs.ca/VaccineUnder18 . In some cases, children under age 18 years may be able to give their own consent. How well do COVID -19 vaccines work? How well the vaccines work agains t COVID -19 is different for each variant of the virus . COVID -19 vaccines are the best way to lower your risk of getting COVID -19 or getting very sick from it. The mRNA vaccines give the best protection. The Pfizer -BioNTech Bivalent and the Moderna Bivalent vaccine s are the only vaccine s available in Alberta made to protect against Omicron variant s, which are the strains that are currently spreading . However, a ll the vaccines work very well to lower your risk of getting seriously ill and needing to be in the hospital. What vaccine can I get? Primary series The primary series of a vaccine is the initial number of doses you need to get protection. It is recommended that you get a bivalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccine for your primary series. If you cannot get or do not want a bivalent mRNA vaccine, you can get the protein -based vaccine , if available, if you are age 12 years or older. Usually you get the same vaccine for all your doses. If your first -dose vaccine is not available or you cannot have it, you can get a different COVID -19 vaccine for your next dose. Whichever vaccine you get to complete your primary series protects you against COVID -19. Booster doses A booster dose helps to keep you protected for longer after your primary series . It is recommended that you get a bivalent mRNA vaccine for your booster dose. If you cannot get or do not want a bivalent mRNA vaccine, you may be able to get th e protein -based vaccine , if available, if you are age 12 years or older. Talk to your healthcare provider about which vaccine is best for you. How many doses of the protein -based COVID -19 vaccine do I need? Primary series You need at least 2 doses in your primary series of the protein -based COVID - 19 vaccine . (If you got a viral vector -based vaccine for a primary series, you need at least 2 doses if you got the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine and 1 dose if you got the Janssen vaccine. These vaccines are no longer available in Alberta .) For some people, 2 doses may not give enough protection. You may need a third dose to complete your primary series if you have a health problem that weakens your immune system . For example : You have had or will have an organ or stem cell transplant . You have kidney dis ease and need dialysis . You have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) . You take certain medicine s that weaken your immune system . Studies have shown that a third dose may provide better protection for adults with a weak immune system. In children with a weak immune system, an extra dose may also give better protection, but research is still happening to learn more. If you get a 3 -dose primary series of the protein -based vaccine, this is considered \"off -label use\". This means the vaccine is not licensed (approved for use) in this situation but is supported by vaccine experts. Booster doses You can get up to 2 booster doses of the protein -based vaccine, but if you got a protein -based vaccine as a booster dose on or after September 21, 2022, then no further doses of the protein -based vaccine are recommended. However, you can still get at least 1 booster dose of a bivalent mRNA vaccine, or 2 doses if you are at high risk of severe illness. When should I get my booster dose? You need to wait 6 months after getting your last dose of COVID -19 vaccine or being infected with COVID -19 before you get a booster dose . Waiting 6 months helps the booster dose give you better protection . If you have had a stem cell transplant or are getting CAR T-cell therapy (a type of treatment for certain cancers) , talk to your healthcare provider about when you can get your booster dose . If you get a booster dose of the protein -based vaccine and it is sooner than 6 months after your last dose, or if you have already had a protein -based vaccine booster dose, or if you are age 12 to 17 years of age, it is considered \"off -label use\". Vaccine experts support using the vaccine this way . Talk to your healthcare provider about when you should get your booster dose.

There have been very rare reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart) shortly after getting the protein -based vaccine. The reported cases were mild and got better with treatment. It is still not know n if these events were caused by the vaccine, and research is happening to learn more about the risk of these rare events after getting the protein -based vaccine. The inflammation can cause shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or a very fast or abnormal heart rate. Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms. It is not know n if having a history of m yocarditis or pericarditis puts you at higher risk of having these rare events after a COVID -19 vaccine.

What if I had or am getting another type of vaccine? You can get most vaccine s at the same time as, any time be fore, or any time after the protein -based COVID -19 vaccine. However, certain vac cines have a waiting period. If you had another vaccine in the last 2 weeks, check with your healthcare provider about when you can get the protein -based COVID -19 vaccine. Who should not get the protein -based COVID -19 vaccine? You may not be able to get the protein -based COVID -19 vaccine if: You have an allergy to any part of the vaccine . You had a severe (serious) or unusual side effect after this vaccine or one like it . You are under age 12 years .
