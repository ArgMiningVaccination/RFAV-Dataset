News Briefs NATIONAL Father receives maximum penalty for killing son DENVER (AP) -A father was given a maximum 96-year prison sentence for fatally beating his 8- year-old son with his fists, a wood\u00ad en stick and a lead pipe. \"This was abuse ... torture and torment. This is the most egre\u00ad gious case I've ever heard of in my life,\" Denver District Judge Nancy Rice told 32-year-old Allen Spencer at the sentencing Friday. When paramedics arrived at Spencer's home on Sept. 2, 1993, they found his son Robert's body a mass of bruises from punches and blows from an l8-inch lead pipe and a thick wooden rod, prosecutors said. Robert Spencer died after he was hit in the stomach with a blunt object -probably a fist - which severed his intestine. Doctors said that kind of death is slow and painful. The jury convicted Allen Spencer of second-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. Robert Spencer had confided to a friend that his father would dunk his head in a toilet and hit him with a stick if he fell asleep while standing in a corner. Pet snake decapitated after attack on boy INDIANAPOLIS (AP)-A 13- foot pet python that slithered out of its cage and began wrapping itself around a 4-year-old boy was killed by rescue workers. After five men were unable to pry it off the boy Friday night, res\u00ad cuers cut off the snake's head, said police spokesman Mike Brown. The boy suffered a bite to his right leg and was hospitalized in good condition, Brown said. The 30-pound snake had wrapped itself around the boy's chest and legs and was cutting off the child's circulation, said Sgt. Dan Eland, a Marion County ani\u00ad mal control officer. MSomehow it got down to the basement and the kids were down (there) playing,\" Eland said. \"And apparently one of them stepped on it or kicked it and it started wrapping itself around the 4-year\u00ad old.\" INnl X Personalities 3A Calendar / News of Record 4A Nation & World ........................

The break was reported lit 12:52 a.m. and businesses on the Pedes\u00b7 trian Mall were without water until about 10 a.m. Iowa City water superintendent Ed Moreno said the backup may have looked like dirty water because the water was coming out of the ground, but none of it was sewage. \"When you have a main break of that size, you carry everything around with it, including dirt. When a main break occurs, the water shows on the surface.\" Some students coming home from bars were disgusted at the sight of the ankle-deep water. \"It was terrible,\" UI junior Kevin Dillingham said. \"There was a lot of shit all over. It was a big mess.\" Chris Nunnally, assistant manager of Burger King, 124 S. Dubuque St., said the restaurant ran out of water. \"They shut off the water at 1:45 a.m., but they didn't tell us,\u00b7 he said. \"We couldn't serve pop. A lot of drunks were really unhappy.\" The water made the area smell, Nunnally said. \"It stunk, but it was really cool watching water shooting out of the flower bed,\" he said. Jolene Connolly, oWner of JT Con\u00ad nolly's Tobacco Bowl, 111 S. Dubuque St., said the shop didn't have any problems, but customers complained about the water. \"People came in and told me about it,\" she said. \"I didn't see any\u00b7 thing at all, though.\" Hardee's, 125 S. Dubuque St., did not have any water for two and a half hours, from 7-9:30 a.m. \"They were shut off during repairs,\" Moreno said. \"Planned Parenthood complained of brown water; they thought it was some\u00ad thing else. With breaks, when the water is turned on, it may look brown. The water is shifting and breaks loose stuff in the pipe.\" Representstives from Planned Par\u00ad enthood of Greater Iowa, 2 S. Linn St., were unavailable for co=ent. Water mains are 5 feet under the ground, and Saturday's pipe break was caused by the ground shifting, Moreno said, adding that 8-inch main pipes can cause damage when they break. \"It will move cement, raise bricks,\" Moreno said. \"It's possible and probable with an 8-inch main.\" WOMEN'S CARE PRESENTS -currently enrolled; -28 or more semester hours earned by May, 1995; eO.ne\\8dlaV, November 9 Ticket Information -one year on-campus enrollment July, 1995; -minimum UI cumulative GPA of 2.25; -ability to work effectively with individuals as well as groups.

The primary role of the Board of Supervisors is to provide stewardship for the community's land and resources, Stutsman said. \"J'm real supportive of the direction the board has taken getting the input from people who provide the different services, such as the sher\u00ad iff's department, the roads and the ambulance,\" she said.

By the year 2000, the senior citizens will outnumber the working adults 2-to-l in Johnson County.\" Fearing, who is a retired UI and Cedar Rapids Prairie High School math teacher, said the key to success is to keep bright graduates in the county. \"They all want a good\u00b7pay\u00ad ing job and a good starter home,\u00b7 he said. \"We can bring types of industry, the kind of job that will bring in more . than the minimUM wage.\" Fearmg Fearing doesn't favor giving tax breaks to attract new businesses to the county because he said it is not fair for the established business and the county would lose that potential tax rev\u00ad enue. \"When I first heard (tax breaks), I thought, 'Oh yeah, it'll bring all these jobs,' Fearing said. \"But it hurts the people here too bad, and it cuts down on the tax base.\" Items on Fearing's agenda range from contino ued funding for social programs for the elderly and for crime prevention . In addition, Fearing said he won't try to spend everything in his bud\u00b7 get just so it will be the same or increased the follOwing year. \"J'm going to try to give retarded citizens the same benefits all other people have. I want the county to keep control of the SEATS,\u00b7 Fearing said. \"J'm a protector of the small farm, hiring one or two more county deputies and more accessibility to board meetings.\" Profiles by Mick Klemsrud POLICE Ted D.

'''\"4jj:l.';,.,'I'''''''''''',I1\u00b7'@: .-------------- Pope confesses to relying on cane Victor L. Simpson Associated Press SIRACUSA, Sicily -Pope John Paul II has acknowledged what has been obvious to millions. He walks with a cane. Using humor as a weapon, the pope appears to be striking back at critics who say his papacy is slow\u00ad ingdown. The pope even knocked his own recently published book, which has become a best seller in Italy and in the United States. After months of walking almost surreptitiously with a cane follow\u00ad ing hip-replacement surgery April 29, the pope has begun waving it, joking about it and asking people what they think. \"Are you pro-cane or anti-cane?\" he asked young people Saturday night during a three-day trip to Sicily. \"Some say it makes me look older, others that it rejuvenates me.\" Long known for his vigor and his image as a pope who skis and hikes in the mountains, the 74-year-old pontiff is trying to make the best of the contrast. The pope put his leg to the test on the Sicilian journey, his first major outing since he canceled last month's visit to the United States because of slow recovery from the hip surgery. Rumors have swirled for months that the pope, possibly suffering from bone cancer or Parkinson's disease, is seriously ailing. The Vatican has repeatedly denied he has any serious ailments. During a Mass Sunday to dedi\u00ad cate the Madonna in Tears sanctu\u00ad ary, the pope used his bishop's staff for support while an aide gripped his arm when he climbed the steps to the altar. But the pope made clear in Sicily he intends to keep traveling, ' with his next overseas trip an Asian tour in January. \"I'm preparing to go to Manila with my cane. I'll get there and I think my cane will, too,\" he said at Saturday's youth rally. He also made his first public mention of his recently published book, \u00b7Crossing the Threshold of Hope,\" telling young people, \"If you haven't read it, don't bother. It's not a book, it's an interview .\u00b7 The book was based on questions submitted by an Italian journalist in advance of a TV interview that was later canceled. The pope's stop at the shrine, dedicated to a Madonna statue said to have broken into tears in 1963, gave him a brief pause from his relentless attacks on the Mafia. Instead, the pope spoke of the \"tragic events\" of World War II, cit\u00ad ing the Holocaust of the Jews and the threat to Europe from Soviet communism. Later, standing under a white umbrella during a driving rain storm, he returned to his theme of urging Sicilians to stand up to the Mafia. The pope decried \"violence that still leaves blood running\" and a disorientated youth pressed by the need for consumer goods. Meeting with youngsters Sunday afternoon, the pope spoke of the weapons of Christ -prayer, for\u00ad giveness and sacrifice -not \"knives and pistols as you see on television and which unfortunately appear in real life.\" STUDENT GOVERNMENT SELF-HELP & CHILDCARE SIIIPS NOW AVAILABLEI Students eligible for the $200 leH-Help lebol.pblp. must work at least 15 hours per week and have a 2.5 G.P.A. or above.

Deal with it. On the positive side, Americans can be fairly confident in their elected officials' voting habits and will be able to judge candidates' future votes accordingly . For example, it is likely that a liberal senator will vote for gun control measures, just as a conservative would most likely vote against such measures . It takes the guesswork out of voting. Unfortu\u00ad nately, it turns the electoral process into an alternative to thinking for oneself. Voting along party lines has made a mockery of what a democ\u00ad racy is supposed to be. The last session of Congress demonstrated exactly how pathetic the Ameri\u00ad can political system has become. Republicans set out at the begin\u00ad ning of the session to block every piece of Democratic legislation which was put on the floor from the crime bill to health-care reform. They did 80 just to be able to go to voters during their elec\u00ad tion campaigns and blame the Democrats for not getting any\u00ad thing done. Never mind that the ~publicans initiated gridlock in the flrst place. Republicans used this past ses\u00ad sion of Congress to manipulate the democratic process in order to gam control of as many House and Senate seats that they could get their hands on. The scariest thing is that it seems to be work\u00ad ing and laying the groundwork for Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign . A majority of polls show Republicans are going to make major gains in the number of members in Congress . For the first time since the Eisenhower administration, Republicans may control Congress . The fact that Republicans may control the House and possibly the Senate shouldn't scare the electorate as much as the wording which is used. A small group of people is goi ng to \"control\" the Jaws which are being made in this country. That is not a democracy, that is an oligarchy. In an oli\u00ad garchy the citizens have no con\u00ad trol; it is government by the few over the many -not a govern\u00ad ment by the people, of the people and for the people. Any candidate for public office should be commended when they vote against party lines for the mere fact that they had the guts to stand up to the established order. Take, for example, Bonnie Campbell's rejection of the Iowa Democratic party platform. She rejected it on the basis that it called for the legalization of same-sex marriages. Although her reasoning may be faulty, she stood up to what everyone else said was right and stated what she believed in. Not only did she state it, she stood by it. Don't let partisan politics make your decision for you in the voting booth Tuesday. Think about what your vote means and vote with your conscience. Also, when dis\u00ad cussing the money-grubbing scumbags you are thinking about voting for, love your country but fel!I the government .

Viewpoints Focal Point: The race for Iowa's governor Once every four years, Iowans are encouraged to participate in the voting process to either re-elect an incumbent governor or to select a new one. With Election Day Tuesday, five 01 Viewpoints staff members examine the candidates for governor and campaign issues in detail. An elegy for election Tuesdays gone by When I was a child, politics had human meaning . It's funny because I grew up while Paul Powell was busy stuffing money into shoe box\u00ad es in lllinois and Governor Otto Kerner was borrowing trouble as well. Hell, Chicago mayor Richard Daley had people voting from 6 feet under the ground. Daley'S ward politics-driven city was the birthplace of the saying, \"Vote early and vote often.\" I didn't know that yet, though. Most people didn't for a long time. 1 grew up in a small town on the western side of Illinois. The family didn't have much money, but Dad knew what was what, and as the late 50s became the early 60s that meant you were a Democrat . He participated in precinct politics, knocking on doors and making sure all his pals had the right bumper stickers for their Chevro\u00ad let Impalas. He and his wife had five kids and precious little else, but there was ample respect for them and more than enough love to go around the small ramshackle house we rented. It was the blue-collar big heart of the Democ\u00ad ratic party which my father loved, I'm sure. Democrats -even Brahmans like that Kennedy kid out in Boston -gave a damn about human beings. You could hear it in their words and feel it in the way crowds were drawn to them on the campaign trail. Over the decades, we have learned much about our politicians -far too much not to become cynical. But I remember when it was dif\u00ad ferent. I remember my infatuation with Abe Lin\u00ad coln, another lllinoijl kid who grew up with few advantages . 1 checked out library books four at a time on the man, feeling the pull toward some-\"II'ltW:_ one who shared some of my troubles. I liked that Lincoln had a well-known streak of melancholia . It was fitting, somehow , that a man ceaselessly taunted about his looks, height and backwoods origins had the blues in him and carried those blues all the way to the White House. I read about Abe as I sat on a kitchen heating register with the early night coming on in win\u00ad ter. I would stretch the flannel nightgown taut over my pulled-up knees to create a tent that filled with hot air rising from the furnace. Later winters found me consumed hy a com\u00ad memorative book dad bought after JFK's assas\u00ad sination. Its biggest picture -and my favorite -showed mourners filing past the casket in the middle of the night. The faces were many differ\u00ad ent colors, but everyone's tears seemed to cry the same as grief wrote terrible words across each face in the same ravaging hand. Those were times when the loss of a politician was broadly perceived as a loss of civil and humane direction in government. That feeling is absent now. Watching the funeral of former President Richard Nixon, I was ashamed of my cynicism toward this man who had lived in the service of the public. It was an unpleasant view\u00ad ing experience for many Americans -we knew too much. As we recalled willful abuses of power, we didn't know where to put feelings of disgrace long enough to let the funeral procession pass by unassailed . We managed, though, which is what we do now with our politicians and their abuses. They are little more than a necessary evil. Today, campaign issues ring as hollow as the candidates . Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad makes an issue of crime, although crime is objectively not a significant issue in Iowa. His opponent , Bonnie Campbell, buys into the issue of crime for the soulless reason that she can't afford to be seen backing away from him. To appear more mainstream than the incum\u00ad bent, Campbell has disavowed her party's plat\u00ad form. She says the party platform is no place to discuss issues which make people uneasy. She is referring to homoseX'Ual civil rights, but she could just as easily mean any other human rights issue. What she is really saying is this: The members of a political patty mustn't press candidates in a direction which challenges broadly held social assumptions and values. Their duty is to support the candidate. Don't judge her and never level public criticism when. she fails to explain a difficult and controversial opinion to the people of the state. Campbell insists the flaw in the platform has its origins not in her timidity but rather in our bad man\u00ad ners as a polity pressing for change. What gall it takes to make such a statement here in the Midwest, where the grand political free-for-all has found a home. How insulting to assume Iowans are too frail to discuss religion and sexuality with as much spirit and eloquence as they discuss trade and tariffs. I am reminded often these days that the object of political campaigns is winning, but let me remind you: Winning is like sex. What you make of it afterwards is far more important than the act itself. Without the moral courage to see beyond victory to governance from the very inception of a campaign, a candidate is simply a hollow apparition rattling across the political landscape seeking support. The emptiness of such campaigns is what we face in Iowa and across most of the country Tuesday. Vote as you will, and God help us all come the morning after.

EI!!=!J!ANI -_._-.. _. -. - TERRY \"THE EXECUTIONER\" BRANSTAD WE'RE CAPPING OFF TWElVE MONTHS OF MUDSLINGING WITH TWELVE ROUND.S OF NO\u00b7HOLDS\u00b7BARRED, MUD WRASSlIN' IN THE DREADED MUD PIT OF DEATH! vs BONNIE \"THE COSSACK\" CAMPBELL TICKETS AVAILABLE FROM YOUR LOCAL TICKETMASTER OUTLETS Voting is a people's duty in a democracy The 1994 midterm elections are Tuesday, and it is the public's duty to get out and vote. The American voting public has a reputation for apathy, which is a disgrace for the oldest continuous democracy in the world. The national average for voter participation in 1992 was a mere 55 percent -the low\u00ad est of the industrial democ\u00ad racies. Tuesday is a chance for people to redeem themselves and make a blunt statement to politicians concerning their conduct of public affairs. It is the obligation of all registered voters to voice their opinions concerning the performance of the local, state and national governments . However, the people have ducked their responsi\u00ad bility to hold their government accountable for its actions. The most common public complaints include: MI can't tell the difference between the candi\u00ad dates; it's a choice between two evils.\" \u00b7Special interests control everything. My vote doesn't count.\" \"l don't know anything about politics.\" Not only are these attitudes cliche, they show that the American public knows next to nothing about its own political proceas. This ia pathetic in the most information-saturated society in the world. We have acceas to a wealth of information not available to the rest of the world, yet most of the public does not make use of it. So how does the common citizen become active and make a difference in political affairs? It's easy: Register, become educated in politi\u00ad cal issues and vote. Though it is the public's responsibility to reg\u00ad iater themselves to vote -unlike in the Euro- 1 pean democracies -all you have to do here is fill out a form at the post office and mail it. If you are already registered somewhere else, you can vote absentee, which requires a request to the county auditor not more than 70 days before an election. Finally, for the busy voter who feels as though he or she does not have the time to vote on Election Day, there is early satellite vot\u00ad ing. Registering is the relatively easy part; the hardest part of being a responsible voter is stay\u00ad ing informed. People do have a legitimate gripe when it comes to deciding who the best candidate is for the job. Our system emphasizes the individual candidate over a strong party identification. Local party members feel alienated because a small cabal of glitzy media operatives packages candidates and cuts the average person out of the process. In political science circles, this phe\u00ad nomenon is called the.\"permanent campaign.\" Another problem with the system is negative campaigning. Politicians go negative because it works. The public is susceptible to 30-second sound bites, and it loves any sort of personal controversy. An educated electorate which demands constructive debate can compel politi\u00ad cians to stick to discourse on the issues and not devolve to personal attacks. The power of \"special intereatsn makes the electorate feel powerleas in the political process. Though apecial interest political action commit\u00ad tees (PACa) wield great JIOwer, they cannot buy a representative'a vote -there are too many out there to hord very much influence. Politicians pay attention to their constituents; they have large staffs at the local and national levels. A large, well-organized, grassroots group of constituents can wield as much power as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. ( I A look at the German political system can put our interest group situation in perspective. In Germany, special interests have so much sway that one-third of the parliamentary delegates directly represent their interest group . Also, interest groups exist at a semigovernmental lev\u00ad el and they are major financiers of all parties. However, the Germans do not feel powerleas in the face of such power. The voters are just as skeptical of their system as we are, but they vote. In the Oct. 16 elections, 79.1 percent of the electorate voted. This shows that in an interest group-infested environment, people do have a voice. Our political system depends on an active informed populace to decide who repreaents their interests in governmental bodiea. The political parties do not decide who runs for office, you do. The precinct caucus and the primary election are forums for people to decide who rep\u00ad resent them at conventions and as candidates. Though 1994 is an \"off year\" election, much is at stake for the average citizen. Issues ranging from college tuition to rural land development to health care and crime are at the forefront this political season. Also, Republicans have a good chance of gaining control of an indecisive Democ\u00ad ratic Congress. If they succeed, a new, powerful agenda will sweep the land. If people do not participate, the 8yatem becomes staid and corrupt, with politicians who do not know the feelings of thia \"silent majority\"; a small politically active plurality decides policy. The electorate is upset with the system this year, and the regiatered electorate must do ita duty to vote for change. If you do not and notn\u00ad ing changes, you have only yourself to blame. Duane Nollen's column appears Mondays on the Viewpoints Pages. , MUDDY EMOTIONS Farmhouse to farmyard Le best thing to be said today about the governor's race is that it is almost over. New York's 42nd Street prosti\u00ad tutes have more shame than Gov. Terry Branstad. Attorney Gener\u00ad al Bonnie Campbell's campaign had the direction and focus of a corn husk floating on the Iowa River. Iowans should be proud of their choices. Early in the race, Branstad put on his best pinstriped suit, walked out of the governor's man\u00ad sion and crawled into the nearest, wettest and smelliest hog pen he could find. Not to be outdone, Campbell climbed the fence and nestled up to him. In short, the Democratic and Republican candidates have spent a record sum of money and con\u00ad siderably too much time validat\u00ad in~ every cynical notion ever to enter the collective mind of the electorate. As with most other campaigns, the minor candidates for governor couldn't raise the funds needed to buy commercial time. For this they should be thankful. They only embarrassed themselves in front of a small public-access audience rather than a statewide audience . The sad aspect of the governor's race is that the negative ads, the fruitless focus on crime and the death penalty, and the complete avoidance of important issues and positions all pushed effective but\u00ad tons in the minds of voters. On Election Day, 60 percent of the country's eligible voters stay home. Many of the voters Tues\u00ad day will cast ballots based on emotional reactions -not intelli\u00ad gently reasoned decisions. Iowa has the nation's lowest murder rate and the lowest rate of reported rapes. Despite this, Branstad showed how in-touch he was with the primal fears of Iowans and made crime and the death penalty the cornerstone of his campaign. The attorney general mini\u00ad mized her opposition to the death penalty and criticized the condi\u00ad tion of the state's economy. When she questioned the state's income and fInancial situation, he ques\u00ad tioned her personal income and flnances. To her credit, Campbell did draw a line and refused to respond to Branstad's attacks against her husband. People say they don't like nega\u00ad tive campaigns, but because neg-., ative campaigners keep winning, winners keep waging negative campaigns. Most working people don't have the time or inclination to read candidate positions published in the papers. Instead, they rely on television . Here the candidates sold the voters short. For each negative commercial that ran in the past months, a commercial proclaiming a candi\u00ad date's position could have run in its place. An issue can be staked out and supemcially explained in 30 seconds. It can be more thor\u00ad oughly explained in 60 seconds. ., Of all of the commercials tele\u00ad vised this campaign season, a ., very few actually mentioned a candidate's positions. Branstad said Iowa needs a death penalty; his commercials never explained why. Campbell's commercials said Branstad gave gun ownership rights back to a fe~ dozen convicted felons, but her commercials never fully explained what she had done to take illegal guns out of the hands of convicted felons.' Neither Branstad nor Campbell had com\u00ad mercials that dealt seriously with the future of the state. Campaigns like these are here to sta)'. Voters can demand less mud and' more information when they talk with candidates face to face, but little else will stem the tide. Now voters show their disgust by .taying home. Perhaps when politicians win races by margin~ of five votes to three, candidates will walk out of the barnyard, ' shake off the muddy emotional charges and step into the cleaner realm of ideas.

Margaret Richardson Iowa City The Daily Iowan -Iowa City, Iowa -Monday, November 7,1994 -7A Natural Law Party offers solutions, not rhetoric A Election Day '94 approaches , I would like to alert readers to the fact that there is one party which is actually speaking to the issues Ilnd offering sol utions to the problems facing our nation: the Natural Law Party. The Natural Law Party was founded in 1992 to \"bring the light of science into politicsn and to promote common sense and fieldtested and cost-effective solutions to our nation's problems . During the '94 campaign, the major themes of the Natural Law Party have been conflict-free politics and prevention-oriented government. We believe that candidates should engage in debate to illuminate the issues and to offer solutions, not to undermine and tear each other down. We believe that the proper role of government is to promote and implement programs which prevent problems from occurring rather than continuous\u00ad ly engaging in crisis management . The Natural Law Party promotes preventive health care. Proven preventive health-care pro\u00ad grams can reduce our overall health-care bill by 50 percent. This amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Those savings will go a long way toward eliminating the deficit, not to men-tion the benefits of vastly improved national health. The Natural Law Party holds that the problem of escalating crime will not be solved by building more prisons. The United States -the land of the free -already imprisons a greater percent\u00ad age of its people than any other nation except Russia. Crime is the consequence of collective stress and poor education . The Natural Law Par\u00ad ty'e solution to the problem of crime is to insti\u00ad tute measures for meaningful education , effec\u00ad tive rehabilitation and reduction of social stress -the root cause of crime. Specific programs to treat the symptoms of social stress -for example, crime, drug abuse and poor health -will be effective only if the underlying cause of those problems is treated. The Natural Law Party is the only party which offers to eliminate the cause of our social ms, which is stress in individual life and in the col\u00ad lective consciousness of society. The Natural Law Party program designed to eliminate stress and create coherence in collective consciousness is called \"A Group for Government \" It consists of the large-group (7,000 to 10,000 people) practice of transcendental meditation . This program was fieldtested in Washington , D.C., in the summer of 1993 and resulted in an 18 percent reduction in crime over two months. (A study documenting this project was published by the Institute for Science, Technology and Public Policy in Fair- field, Iowa.) If this idea sounds far out; consider that 20 years ago the idea of closing your eyes and doing a simple mental technique to reduce hyperten- \u00ad sion was also considered far out. Yet today we know that transcendental meditation is the most effective nondrug therapy for hypertension - and it has no negative side effects. Our society can be said to be suffering from \"societal hyper- tension.n The Group for Government will reduce ~ stress and hypertension for the body of society' the same way that transcendental meditation ,\u00ad does for individuals . The best thing that any voter who is unsatis\u00ad fied can do in this election is to cast their vote for I Natural Law Party candidates. Why? This vote -win or lose -will send a clear message to Washington and to the major parties that the c voters are fed up with politics as usual. It will also give support to the Natural Law Party themes of conflict-free politics and prevention\u00ad oriented government -ideas whose time has come. Michael Cuddehe is the Natural Law Party's congres\u00ad sional candidate for Iowa's First District. Columnist commended for government 'dream' To the Editor: Neither? Republican or Democrat?

OLDCAPlTOL I would like to applaud Kim Painter for her column titled \u00b7Opposed camps do not a community make\" (DI, Oct. 17). It is about time someone got out from under the blanket of parties and labels and got down the most impor\u00ad tant issue of all: that we are all human beings. Painter'S dream of living in a true community is mine as well. Un(ortu\u00ad nately, it is just that -a dream. Never has this fact been more clear than now, with the Election Day so close at hand. One can hardly turn on the tele\u00ad vision without hearing Branstad bash Campbell and Nagle bash Nussle or vice versa. Does anyone really know what the real issues of these campaigns are? I certainly don't have the time or the patience to wade through the slan\u00ad derous bickering to find the truth. Without clear sight of the issues, we are forced to return to the old standby: labels. Are you liberal or conservative? e S It goes beyond just this year's elec\u00ad tion, this obsession with labels. As diverse as Iowa City is, the separatism is evident to me simply walking through the Pedestrian Mall. Must we assume a person's character by their clothes, their friends or their political party? I should hope not. I, too, along with Painter long for the days when tolerance, acceptance and respect dominate, and \"factionalism and parti\u00ad san sniping.\" as Painter so wonderfully stated, are hard to find. But then, this is just a dream. Melissa A. Hyde Iowa City with chips and a dill spear $3.65 . ,. L' L New Donor Bonus Bring In ad and receive $15 for your first donation.

Donate life-saving plasma twice Resewehr's editor\u00ad ial titled \"Campaign is inhumane\" (01, Sept. 14), I really began to think about what Gov. Branstad is doing in his ~mpaign for re-election. The editorial was about the governor's use of little Anna Marie Emry's death in his cam\u00ad paign for the death penalty in the state MINNE'ITE DODERER, DEMOCRAT, of Iowa. HOUSE DISTRICT 45 MINNETTE DODERER HAS SERVED THIS COMMUNITY WELL. HER WORK IN STATE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTS A LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENT : 313 s. DUBUQUE ST. & Safe HoBday , I I think that Gov. Branstad has no 'ght to exploit her death in order to t votes. Her family and friends have en through enough without Anna arie's name being used in this way. eing from Grinnell, I witnessed the istress and despair in a town search\u00ad g for a missing little girl. And I saw e grief and horror after her body was iscovered. Her kidnapping and mur\u00ad er were senseless and horrifying, but e should now be left to rest in ace. Murder is no more immoral or iIIe- I now than it was before this tragedy curred. Anna Marie's death should ot be looked at as Branstad's only hance to get the death penalty, Ithough he obviously feels that it is e best way to play on the voters' mpathies and emotions in order to t himself elected for yet another rm. A letter to the editor on Sept. 16 rought it to my attention that the gov\u00ad rnor had also attempted to use the rake Diner murders to push his cam\u00ad ign to reinstate the death penalty in wa and the family asked Branstad ot to use the tragedy in his campaign. ill he ever realize that his use of ese violent acts is immoral and inde\u00ad ent, not to mention insulting to the amilies involved? Perhaps if our governor could take a al look at the issues and come up ith some plausible ideas of what Iowa needs, then he would be able to ccomplish his goals and campaign promises. Hopefully he will learn that some of his constituents, including me, could use a lot more facts and figures and a lot less appeals to our emotions. S. Met'k Iowa City Branstad political rarity To 1M Editor: In 1972, I retired from the FBI after 32 years of service. I met Terry Branstad in 1982 and have been close\u00ad ly associated with him ever since. I spent over four years as finance direc\u00ad tor of the Branstad Committee and raised thousands of dollars from indi\u00ad viduals all over the state of Iowa. After over 30 years with the FBI, I know something about integrity. Bonnie Campbell would have you believe that Branstad has accepted campaign contributions for political favors. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and Campbell knows' it. I know the man. I know the high standards. He is a rarity in today's political scene: an honest politician. Branstad is a man of integrity.

The use of RU 486 is not simple or painless, Sand said. A woman choosing to have an abortion will 'visit a clinic site approximately three times. she said. During the first visit, a woman will take a pregnancy test, get screened for health risu such as heart disease and hypertension and sign a consent fonn 8tating she _ understands the procedure and the risks before she takes three tablets of RU 486. The pills prevent the uterine lining from nourishing the embryo. A mlijor risk of the pill is that it does not Induce an abortion 4 per\u00ad cent to 6 percent of the time, so women must be willing to have a lurgical abortion in that caae, Sand ,aid. No studie8 have been done demonstrating what would happen w a baby if the mother refused to have a surgical abortion in the event the pill failed. During a second visit, between 36 and 48 hours after taking the ltU 486, a woman returns to the clinic to take two tablets of mis\u00ad prostol, which causes the uterus to cramp, contract and expel the fetus, usually within three hours, Sand said. This stage of the abor\u00ad tion is often painful for women, and Sand said vaginal bleeding lasts up to two weeks. \"It's not a magic pill without aide r 4\\ffects or complications,\" Sand .said. \"It's not quick, pain-free or \u00b7 easy.' A third, follow-up visit is con\u00ad ':ducted approximately three weeks later to check the woman's health. The entire procedure in France is about $350, but it ia free for women Jeffrey Mau, Davenport resident of her life -that's worse than death,\" Lowery said. Some residents remain undecid\u00ad ed about Smith's punishment or think further investigation and psychiatric help should precede any decision regarding the death penalty. UI freshman Dan Sheetz said he either officially or unofficially.\" Schoenbaum said he expects occasional informal complaints from students and professors . \"Higher education is not a beau\u00ad ty contest, not something to be put to a vote,\u00b7 he said. Mit is nice to be liked, but it is not a qualification to teach. The pursuit of truth Involves asking difficult questions. That is why college is often a diiJlcult, even threatening, experience for them.\" However, Hanley said student complaints can't be so easily dis\u00b7 miased. \u00b7When students make com\u00ad plaints like this, it is not proper to who test the pill in the United States. Pro-life groups have spread the misconception that women will abuse the pill and rely on it as a birth control method, Sand said. She said she doubts the pill will increase the number of abortions done In the United States. \"I don't think people wiU take it lightly,\" she said. \"I mean it's not that convenient -it's time-con\u00ad suming. I doubt people are going to quit using birth control when they are having sex and start saying, 'We'll just go take that abortion pill later.' \" The morality of the i88ue ia clear cut for the Catholic Church, Ed \"'It's not a magic pill without side effects or complications.

Another function of third parties I. to be a lource of new ideas. f years ago Smith told police she had been sexually molested. The inves\u00b7 tigation never led to any charges, the paper said, quoting unidenti\u00ad fied sources. Her allegation involved \"more than patting and touching,\" a for\u00b7 mer sheriff's investigator told the newspaper. Sheriff Howard Wells and others involved in the boys' diaappearance investigation refused to say whether Smith mentioned the alle\u00b7 gation and whether they thought it played a role In her alleged actions. Smith, 23, is under a 24-hour suicide watch at a state prison near Columbia. looked at the media's portrayal of the murders with a critical eye and he said it's too early to decide on a punishment for Smith. \"People need to take a skeptical view of stories when they first come out in the media,\" Sheetz said. \"The media will make (the murders) an issue in and of itself. This story is just another opportu\u00b7 nity to argue about the death penalty.\" Discussion of the death penalty is an impulsive reaction to the dra\u00b7 matic way the truth surrounding the murders unfolded, said Sbeetz's mother. Cory Stutts. Stutts agreed with her son that no punishment should be decided until Smith receives psychological help determining why she commit\u00ad ted the crime. UI senior Matt Miller said unin\u00ad fonned public opinion should have nothing to do with policy and pun\u00ad ishment.

MIt's certainly not right to berate students,\" he said. Mit's not right to call them stupid, for example, but it is not a technique that is the sole property of one professor and the University of Iowa, I can assure you of that.\" said. \"Planned Parenthood and oth\u00ad er abortion clinics promote them\u00b7 selves 88 American family plan\u00b7 ning clinics, but the fact is that 90 percent of pregnant women who go in there come out without a baby.' A woman's mental and physical health are at risk when abortions are done outside the walls of a clin\u00b7 ic, Cannon said. \u00b7It's very possible a young girl wlll literally watch her baby come out in the toilet -what can that do to a young girl?\" he said. \"The abortion won't happen in a con\u00b7 trolled clinic environment where a doctor cuts up the baby and sucks it out and a nurse pieces it back together to be sure they got it all out. There's danger of excessive bleeding and infection without close contact with a doctor.' Specific sites where tes ting is done cannot be released unless the center haa already gone public, said Sandra Waldman, director of public infonnation at the Popula\u00ad tion Council, which was granted permission from the FDA to begin testing RU 486. The 12 sites include Planned Parenthood clin\u00ad ics, university student health clin\u00ad ics and hospitals and health clinics across the country. RU 486 has not increased the number of abortions in France and will not in the United States. Wald\u00ad man said. -I doubt It wiU1ncrease the num\u00ad ber of U.S. abortions, but it will enable women to get an abortion earlier,' she said. MA surgical abor\u00b7 tion can't be done until the woman is seven or eight weeks along so the embryo is big enough to locate and remove. With RU 486. a woman can have an abortion as soon as she tests positive in a pregnancy test.\" Republicans and Democrats are more concerned with staying in the middle of the road and appealing to the masses than they are in embracing new ideas. Butler said. \"Historically, third political par. ties have been the 1OUrc8 of ideaa such a. the anti\u00b7monopoly law, women's suffrage,\" Butler said. -riling. we take for granted now were. originally conaidered totally radical and were introduced into the politieal proceaa by third par\u00b7 ti ea.

The dictionary defines it a8 Ma time-honored practice or the set of such practices.w The Iowa field hockey team defines it 88 a trip to the NCAA tournament. With their backs against the wall and a streak of 12 straight trips to the NCAA tournament on the line, the Hawkeyes soared to the occa\u00ad sion. Iowa beat Michigan State, Penn State, and Northwestern to capture the Big Ten tournament and more importantly, an auto\u00ad matic bid to the NCAA tourna\u00ad ment. MIt was awesome.\u00b7 Coach Beth Beglin said after Sunday's victory over Northwestern. MIt was unbe\u00ad lievable. I don't want to say disbe\u00ad lief, but I just felt we had a difficult road to win the tournament .\u00b7 That road included winning three games in three days, match- Iowa falls short in Big Ten dual Chris James The Daily Iowan If there W88 one thing that Iowa women's swimming coach Pete Kennedy wanted out of his team, it was for the Hawkeyea to swim tough against two of the top teams in the Big Ten. The Hawkeyes didn't diSappoint in the effort department, but came up short on the scoring end 88 they fell to both Penn State and Wiscon\u00b7 sin last weekend at the UI Field House pool. Iowa finished third out of the three teams with a score of 283. Penn State rolled to a first-place finish with 760 points. Wisconsin finished second with 611 points. Although Penn State ran away from the pack, Kennedy said his team hung in there. \"Penn State just had too many horses. They have one of the best teams in the conference and they were just too strong. Wisconsin is just as good. We gave it all we had. It's just too bad we had to face them the same weekend,\u00b7 Kennedy said. It was Iowa's first double dual meet of the season, and Kennedy said it gave him the chance to change BOme things up. \"I like these kind of meets. It gives you a chance to look at some people doing different events. You can change a lot of things and do some experimenting,\u00b7 Kennedy said. The two-day meet W88 dominat\u00ad ed by Penn State as the Nittany Lions ran up a season-high 760 points. They closed out the double meet Saturday in style, winning nine of the 18 heats. Iowa sophomore Jami Strauss said it W88 just a matter of being in the toughest conference in the country. \"The Big Ten is far and away the best conference in the country. It can be frustrating when your com\u00ad peting against these kinds of teams every meet. But it also can be exciting to know your swimming against the very best. It kind of puts things in perspective,\u00b7 Strauss said. Things don't get any easier for the Hawkeyes as they will travel to Ohio State and Indiana this week\u00ad end. Kennedy said going on the road will be no easy task. \"When you into anybody's back yard its going to be tough but its really what you make it. There isn't a huge home field advantage,\u00b7 Kennedy said. Cornhuskers knock off N itta,ny Lions in poll Rick Warner Associated Press College football's two mlYor polls now agree: Nebraska is No. 1. The Cornhuskers, already No. 1 with The Associated Press media, replaced Penn State as the top team with the USA Today-CNN coaches Sunday . \"Now we control our own destiny. If we play like we are capable of the rest of the season, we should be in good shape.\" Ed Stewart, Nebraska linebacker After Nebraska routed Kansas 45-17 and Penn State looked slug\u00ad gish in a 35-29 win over Indiana on Saturday, the Cornhuskers gained ground in both polls. Twelve coaches shifted their first-place votes from Penn State to Nebraska, giving the Cornhuskers a 42-20 advantage. Six media members pulled the same switch, increasing Nebraska'. first-place margin to 39-22. In total points, Nebraska leads Penn State by 18 in AP and 27 in USA Today-CNN. Nebraska coach Tom Osborne said he was surprised by the big swing in the coaches' poll. MI thought it would be close and we might possibly be rated ahead in both polls, but I wasn't sure that we would,\u00b7 he said. A week ago, a split national championship seemed like a dis\u00ad tinct possibility. Now Nebraska (10-0) is in the driver's eaat in both polls. \"I think it's good at this point to be the outright No. 1 team,\u00b7 line\u00ad backer Ed Stewart said. ~ow we control our own destiny. If we play like we are capable of the rest of the season, we should be in good shape.w If the Cornhuskers beat Iowa State and Oklahoma, then defeat No.5 Miami or No.8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl, they would probably be consensus champs. If Nebraska doesn't lose, tie or play poorly in a close victory, Penn State could go undefeated and not win any share of the title for the fourth time under Joe Paterno. Penn State spokesman Jeff Nel\u00b7 Ion said Paterno would not com\u00ad ment on the polls Sunday. ing Iowa's longest winning streak of the se88on.

SPECIAL TONIGHT ONLY The Best Beer in America! $2 Pinta $1.75 60ttIee 112 City, Iowa -Monday, November 7, 1994 -38 .Agassi notches fifth title of '94 Salvatore Zanca Associated Press PARIS -By achieving the No.2 ranking in the world, Andre Agassi is at the high point of his tennis career. He would like to move up one more notch, but the flamboyant American was too busy enjoying another first -victory in the City of Light -to concern himself with that. \"I have been to the final of the French Open at Roland Garros twice, but never won: he said after beating Marc Rosset on Sunday in the Paris Open. \"Now I know what it is like to win in Paris.\" Agassi, the 1992 Wimbledon and 1994 U.S. Open champion whose best previous ATP ranking was third in 1988, has another agenda. \"The best thing is to win Grand Slam tournaments,' he said after a 6-3,6-3,4-6,7-5 victory. \"Hopefully, some day you can say, 'Yeah, I was No. 1 for a while or for this long: But to win the Grand Slam tourna\u00ad ments is what is most important to me.\" It was Agassi's fifth ti tie of the Associated Press Andre Agassi reacts after he defeated Swiss player Marc Ros\u00ad set in th~ir final match of the Paris Open tennis tournament year and the 24th of his career. Agassi beat top-ranked Pete Sampras on Friday. Hawkeyes roll over Hoosiers in sweep Mike Triplett The Daily Iowan The Iowa volleyball team picked up its 18th win of the sea\u00ad son Saturday night with a victo\u00ad ry on the road in Indiana. The Hawkeyes (18-8, 8-6 in the Big Ten) swept Indiana, 16-14, 15-11, 15-8. It was the second win over the Hoosiers for Iowa this season. \"The players did what they needed to do,\" Iowa coach Linda Schoenstedt said. \"Nobody played brilliantly and nobody played awful. They just pulled together and got the job done. \"What they showed was a lot of poise,' she continued . \"That is a difficult place to come in and play, especially since we just flew in that afternoon .\" With just six matches remain\u00ad ing this season, Iowa looks to be well on its way to a berth in the NCAA tournament , where the Hawkeyes haven't been since going 22-11 in 1989. \"r think we're where we want to be,\u00b7 Schoenstedt said. \"We should play out the rest of the season with confidence, but you can never underestimate a Big Ten opponent .\" Next up for the Hawkeyes is a weekend home-stand against Michigan and Michigan State.

November 7, 1994 Arts & Entertainment M. ScoH Mahu~ey/The Daily Iowan A gallery patron examines photographs by Drake Gallery, 812 S. Summit St. The exhibition continues Hokanson, now on display at the Summit Street through Dec. 4. Photographer finds elegance in simple, mundane settings Charles Monson The Daily Iowan \"Photographs of a Small Place,\u00b7 the new Drake Hokanson show at the Summit Street Gallery, show\u00ad casea the work of an artist with a gm for finding texture and ele\u00ad gance in the most mundane of set\u00ad tings. An ordinary slice of country\u00ad side becomes a place of dignity and profundity when captured by Hokanson's lens. The exhibition is a study of Peterson, an unremarkable north\u00ad west Iowa hamlet which would never merit Hokanson's special attention had he not been born nearby. By distilling the flavor of this single average town into a series of landscapes, portraits and object studies, Hokanson makes a broad statement about the under\u00ad stated beauty ofllie rural Midwest. The Peterson shown in these photos is a quiet, humble place where nothing much happens but no one seems to mind. Most of the pictures are of farmland, farm equipment or people at work. Hokanson makes this interesting by photographing things from odd angles (the complex web of pipes in \"Grain Distributor, Farmers Co-op Association Elevator\") or including little that eay a lot about the sub\u00ad ject (the ceramic raccoon in \"Wilbur Tigges Garden, August\" and the steerhom hat rack in \"Eddie Beck, Eddie's Hardware, Main Street\"). Everything about Hokanson's work reflects careful consideration right down to the captions, His time\u00b7apecific titles (\"Eddie's Bird\u00b7 house, August,\" etc.) highlight the quiet sameness of each day in Peterson; they remind viewers that iji#WU1fI'UlfJt'll while the seasons may cycle, very little actually changes there, He backs this up by using occasional supplementary quotations to show how past and present writers have chara.cterized the town. The best is a passage from the \"History of Clay County' circa 1889: \"Its citizens and enterpris\u00ad ing .... Besides many social organi\u00b7 zations, there are two churches, and several secret societies, all .. , Hokanson's photos are a joy to look at. His expert use of light and shadow, as well as his careful geomet\u00ad ric compositions, allow him to coax artistic images out of commonplace scenes. What's more, the crystal clarity of his photos adds a valuable sense of immediacy. well-attended .\" Hokanson's photos are a joy to look at. His expert use of light and shadow, as well as his careful geo\u00ad metric compositions, allow him to coax artistic images out of com\u00ad monplace scenes. What's more, the crystal clarity of his photos adds a valuable sense of immediacy . One can almost feel a chill autumn breeze blowing off of the field and scrub study \"Elements of Land\u00ad scape, South ofThwn, October.\" Hokanson falters only in that a few of his images are just too emp\u00ad ty to be visually pleasing. In his attempts to capture the breadth and expansiveness of the Iowa countryside, he sometimes focuses on settings so sparse that they lack any of the elements necessary to make a picture interesting, It's a calculated gamble predicated on the hope that the photos' \"simple dignity' will carry them, and it doesn't always payoff. \"Burgeson Farm, October,' a shot which con\u00ad tains a little corn stubble but is mostly empty sky, is a case in point, Fortunately, this excessive mini\u00ad mizing is only a problem with Hokanson's standard-size prints. \"Photographs\" also contains many 8\u00b7by-20-inch panoramas ranging from studies oflate summer cotton\u00ad wood trees to a gorgeous series tak\u00ad en along the Little Sioux River in winter. The panoramic \"Peterson Thwnship, April,' showing a tiny community dwarfed by an impos\u00ad ing mass of gathering thunder\u00ad heads, is more effective at giving the viewer a sense of scale than all Hokanson's other attempts put together. Occasional misjudgements aside, Hokanson's choices of subject mat\u00b7 ter usually make for pictures which are visually striking as well as technically sophisticated. Overall, \"Photographs of a Small Place\" is not just a mature look at a vanish\u00ad ing way of life, it's also a beautiful art exhibition . \"Plwtographs of a Small Place\" is on display at the Summit Street Gallery, 812 S. Summit St., through Dec. 4. Hours are 5\u00b77 p.m. Mon.day through Friday and 1-4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Austrian writer relaxes with rap Free performance tonight showcases freedom-themed album David Lee The Daily Iowan Like most of his colleagues in the International Writing Program, Austrian fiction writer Josef Hallinger has recently been hard at work on a new piece; he flnished a 662-page novel just last week. Unlike mOlt, however, he'll be unwinding by performing selec\u00ad tions from his rap album. Wild Bill's Coffee Shop in North Hall will be hosting a free performance of Has1inger'lI music tonight at 8. Haslinger eays writing for long periods of time is difficult, 80 he relaxes and has fun by making music. \"It gives me new power to work on my novels,\" he said. Haslinger hal recorded three albums so far, but only AMERIKA bas been released. The album is a series of trombone instrumentals inte.rspersecl with German llpoken\u00ad word pieces. Haslinger said the pieces tell the first-person story of a nameless European. The album's character grows up with the movie \"Easy Rider,\" which inspires him to gain freedom by going to America. When he gets there, he drinks plenty of Budweiser and travels all over the country by car and plane. Unfortunately, he alJo bas all his belongings stolen and then trades the only item he has left, a laptop computer, for a flight inspector's pass, which he uses Cor 11 months before getting arrested. Aside from the album'lI 10- minute centerpiece, moat of AMERIKA seems more like tradi\u00b7 , tional spoken-word tales than rap. Haslinger said the one true rap track, \"Gutes altes Bud. Ein Rap,\u00b7 will be the highlight of tonight's show. He will be translating sec\u00b7 tions of the album into English for his performance. Haslinger feels the central theme \"In other countries, a man who ;s chained up still considers himself free because he can think whatever he wants. In America, freedom must exist in movement, where one must be able to go wherever he wants in order to be free. II Josef Haslinger, International Writing Program member, about his album AMfRIKA of AMERIKA is freedom. \"Despite all the incidenta the character must endure, he is still having fun because he is free,\u00ad Hulinger said. \"In other countries, a man who is chained up still con\u00ad Biders himself free because he can think whatever he wants. In Amer\u00ad ica, however, freedom must exist in movement, where one must be able to go wherever he wants in order to be free.- No matter .what happens to the man in AMERlKA, he is still free because no one is controlling the way he thinks, Haslinger said. A fiction writer and essayist, H8slinger was invited by the American Embassy in Vienna, Aus\u00ad tria, to be the first Austrian writer in the International Writing Pro\u00b7 gram for one semester. He holds a doctoral degree from the University of Vienna and has written two novellas and a collec\u00ad tion of ahort stories (all in Ger\u00b7 man), as well as numerous eeaays in German and English. Hulinger is also a co-founder of the Austrian anti-racist movement SOS\u00b7Mitmensch, or \"SOS-Fellow Human-Being,' in 1992. He has played a large role in battling the racist movement in Austria, a result of thousands of Central European refugees flooding into Austria because of the fall of the Iron Curtain. \"(The co-founders of SOS\u00b7Mit\u00ad mensch) felt as though Austria's critical voices were being choked in a stranglehold,' he said in an essay regarding the group's creation, Haslinger has spent many years writing for magazines and newspa\u00b7 pers, but his greatest joy is in cre\u00ad ative writing, he said. \"As a writer, you can work long on one idea,\" he sald. \"In (maga\u00ad zines and other journalistic types of writing), you must keep evol~ in order to keep up with the rest.'
