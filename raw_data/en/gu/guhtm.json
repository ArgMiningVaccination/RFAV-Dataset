Maarten van Huijstee Chief Executive Founder | Mentor Aito de la Rua Chief Transformation Founder | Mentor Paul Berger Chief Finance and Operations Janneke Krijgsman Head of Experiences Mentor | Teacher Liv Stig Content and Social Director Bram van Leeuwen Brand Philosophy Writer Josje Hermans Head of Operations Niek Schreurs Head of Sustainable Growth Jochem Laan Digital Product Owner Sasha Hauptmann Advisor | Shareholder Plant Advocate Saskia van Walsum Advisor | Shareholder STAK Board Facundo Garreton Advisor | Shareholder MAARTEN Van HUIjstee Chief Executive Founder | Mentor Maarten has been teaching meditation and assisting people to make the journey inward for over a decade. With silence, plants and fungi he guides people towards natural wisdom. Maarten has founded Delight Yoga, Wisdom in Business, Return to Sender and The Loft. These initiatives function as a network of organisations united around one sole purpose: inspiring a more natural and conscious way of living. Early in his career, he worked for some large companies which allowed him to think big in terms of organisation and communication. Leading several creative agencies taught him the power of storytelling. Spinoza forms the pinnacle of a personal journey with plant medicine starting in 1999 and has grown into an intelligent network of therapists and scientists united in the mission to experience and experiment with the health potential of natural medicine and nature therapy. Maarten is a proud father to Philip, Alexander and Victoria, and dedicated husband to Anna. AITO de la RUA Chief Transformation Founder | Mentor From early in his life, Aito has been interested in connecting people to knowledge. In the year 2000, Aito co-created Educ.ar, the first educational platform to connect public schools to the Internet, distributing content to both students and teachers in Argentina. Following the same principle, he co-founded Pure Design - the largest design event in Argentina - with the aim to connect artists and designers with a wider audience. Aito's life took an adventurous turn as he ventured into the music industry, devoting almost a decade to the management of worldwide renowned artist Shakira. After exploring several ancient and new practices, Aito joined the Nomade Hotel Group in 2017, which revolves around transformational experiences, music and wellbeing. Studying various ways of transformation combined with his interest in philosophy, he founded Spinoza, which merges his love for psychology, fungi-based therapies and sound as a healing modality. PAUL Berger Chief Finance and Operations Paul loves numbers. Not because of their looks but because he can see through them. Numbers have meaning and Paul aims to make them mean something positive out in the real world. Whether he's out tour-skiing, mountain biking or langlaufing, Paul infuses anything around him with positive energy. After studying Business Economics, and a career as an investment director at an international private equity firm, Paul decided to move into healthcare, taking on the role of CFO at a Dutch healthcare platform. Besides work, he's been active in a number of initiatives that aim for positive social impact, both in healthcare and sustainability. He's a proud father of three; daughter Nanna and sons Tom and Cas, and happily married to Alexandra. Paul believes that the best decisions are not taken by cognitive notions, but by a deeper intuitive intelligence. jannEKE KRIJGsman Head of Experiences Mentor | Teacher Janneke loves guiding people to reconnect to their most authentic self. For many years she has been teaching meditation, yoga and breathwork, while also exploring the fields of plant medicine.

LIV Stig Content and Social Director Liv loves people. This is why she loves bringing out the best in them. When she started her career in the event industry, she became enchanted by the magic that engulfs people at festivals. She was mesmerized by how open-minded, loving and caring people become once they are relieved of stress and to-do lists, but instead are infused with a feeling of freedom, colourful surroundings and, most importantly; music. Liv was born and raised on a houseboat in the center of Amsterdam. During her travels to India and South America she discovered yoga and has been exploring the spiritual world ever since. At the moment, she also studies to become an Ayurveda Practitioner. Lately she has been focussing on communication and marketing for brands that aim to create positive impact. Increasingly conscious of the briefness of our existence here on Earth and our privileged lives in the West, Liv devotes her energy to projects that aim to help people or the planet - regardless of their scale. Liv is a proud mother to her baby girl Sol. BRam van leEUWEN Brand Philosophy Writer Bram likes creating things. Whether it's in writing, drawing, short film or brand building, Bram addresses complex issues in a lighthearted and unconventional way. Bram's worldview consists of a blend of criticism, absurdism and altruism. He has been fortunate enough to wield strict selection standards regarding the clients he works with from early on in his career. Bram has been building brands with a conscience in terms of sustainability and social responsibility for over a decade and has been experimenting with psychedelic substances for an equal amount of time. He derives his inspiration from intuitive insights, creating deeper connections between people and ideas. Bram explores philosophy with a humorous approach and believes an open mind is a human being's greatest asset. He can turn a blank sheet of paper into colourful and alive brands and organizations with a clear and comprehensible vision. Bram lives in the centre of Amsterdam and enjoys his early morning kayaking trips on the canals.

Sasha is also active in the plant-based pharmaceutical industry, as he is part of the shareholder group and strategic team at Echo Pharmaceuticals based at the University of Leiden. Spinoza is a chance for Sasha to bring natural and plant based medicine to people around the world. Sasha is convinced that it's time to start preventing health issues - not merely responding to their symptoms. SASKIA VAN WALSUM Advisor | Shareholder STAK Board Saskia has since a long time been involved in all kinds of organizations and in mobilizing people. After twenty years of experience in commercial and financial management positions and having worked in global HR and CEO roles at multinational Heineken and Royal Friesland Campina, Saskia decided to change track. She (co-) founded an independent investment fund in entrepreneurial PE, which she led over the course of twelve years. During that period, she simultaneously studied the practice of energy fields for seven years, to understand and read people at deeper levels of energy and consciousness. This has influenced her profoundly. The last fifteen years, she has also been active as a coach and counselor for executives and teams; helping them to open up to their core values driving their behavior, and supporting leaders to absorb inputs and learnings into new practice and flourish. Saskia has served since then also on supervisory boards in different companies and still does. She keeps us with our feet on the ground and advises Spinoza on how to build a purpose-led and sustainable company. Saskia believes that being part of nature and breathing it in fully, helps us to open up and tap into our own intuitive wisdom. We can trust and listen to this open space, as it will guide us.
