Originating in India, Ayurvedic practices predate written records and have been handed down by word of mouth. In the mid- to late-20th century people from the west began to travel to India to discover the teachings of Yoga and Ayurveda. Ayurveda translates to \"knowledge of life,\" and the principles of this modality remind us that the entire web of life is intricately interwoven. With a unique emphasis on total wellness, the art and science of Ayurveda work to harmonize our internal and external worlds. Like Aromatherapy, Ayurvedic medicine aims to integrate and balance the body, mind and spirit. This balance is believed to lead to health, happiness and the prevention of illness. The principles of Ayurvedic medicine views everything that we experience to have a has certain qualities, be it a physical substance, a thought, or emotion. Ayurveda classify these qualities (called gunas in Sanskrit) into 10 pairs of opposites, making 20 qualities in total (for example, heavy vs. light. The foundation of Ayurvedic treatment relies upon recognizing when gunas have become excessive or deficient, as this is known to cause imbalance and lead to disease. Ayurveda applies the opposite qualities to return to balance. Each person has a particular pattern of energy, an individual combination of physical, mental and emotional characteristics; which comprises their own constitution. This constitution is determined at conception by a number of factors and remains the same throughout one's life. Ayurveda customises preventative wellness to the unique constitution of every individual, a treatment plan will take into consideration all factors of a person life and encompasses various techniques for assessing health. The practitioner carefully evaluates key signs and symptoms of illness, especially in relation to the origin and cause of an imbalance. They also consider the patient's suitability for various treatments. The practitioner arrives at diagnosis through direct questioning, observation and a physical exam, as well as inference. Basic techniques such taking the pulse, observing the tongue, eyes and physical form; and listening to the tone of the voice are employed during an assessment. Once all of these factors are understood, the practitioner can take appropriate actions to nullify or minimize their effects or eliminate the causes of imbalance and re-establish one's original constitution. Palliative and cleansing measures, can be used to help eliminate an imbalance along with suggestions for eliminating or managing the causes of the imbalance. Recommendations may include the implementation of lifestyle changes; starting and maintaining a suggested diet; and the use of herbs.
