Recent investigations demonstrate by fMRI how fast the stimulus travels and affects the brain arriving at 200 milliseconds or almost instantaneously. The response of the stimulus should yield an effect as fast as it arrives, at least in pain control. This fast response characterizes the Balance Method from I-Ching Acupuncture. If we place the needle in the correct spot the response should be immediate, within seconds or minutes after. To achieve such results requires a good knowledge of the Shu Points or Command Points, also known as Antique Points. These points are located distal to the Elbow and Knee. It requires knowledge of the different balancing systems, of the correspondence of the 12 joints, of the Imaging and Mirror concept, of the Global Balance concept, the 12 magical points, of the Ba-Gua, and the trigrams and hexagrams, of the 5 Elements Theory, Seasonal Balance and more. This knowledge will allow us to use distal more energetic points to obtain immediate results.
