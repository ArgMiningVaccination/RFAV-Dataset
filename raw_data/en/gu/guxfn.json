Looking at the whole person by balancing hormones, adrenals, and thyroid while focusing on gut health, stress reduction, and a healthy lifestyle is key. Cheryl is honored to partner with you on your journey! \"Early in my practice, I saw a void in traditional medicine as patients would come to me with ongoing complaints after costly testing and no answers. Our fast pace world has many external stressors and influences. Hormone dysfunction and adrenal dysregulation affects all ages. Proper tools are needed to maintain your body's optimal daily function, whether working with a male with low testosterone, a symptomatic menopausal woman, or a teenager with high stress or irregular cycles. The goal is LIVING instead of surviving! It is a joy to watch a person's life be transformed with the right education and resources. I would love to partner with you on your journey to wellness!\" - Cheryl Simmons, FNP-C Naturally Balanced Services Hormone Balance Menopause / perimenopause Premenopausal hormone imbalance Testosterone replacement (men / women) PCOS Infertility Adrenal Support Adrenal fatigue Sleep support Healthy lifestyle / stress reduction Mood / coping support Concentration / energy Thyroid Regulation Hypothyroidism Hashimoto's Subclinical Hypothyroidism Natural / supplement support Hair Restoration Painless hair restoration No recovery time 15 to 30 minute treatments Three treatments total Gut Health Food sensitivity / allergy testing Leaky gut testing / treatment Bowel regulation Nutrition counseling Weight Loss and Management Diet education Pharmaceutical management Vitamin / micronutrient testing Counseling / nutrition referral sources Introducing Alma TED: Your Hair Restoration Solution Alma TED is a cutting-edge hair loss treatment that utilizes advanced technology to stimulate hair growth and improve hair density.
