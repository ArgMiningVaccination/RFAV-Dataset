This is a healing method that relies on herbs as medicines for maintaining good health. The 5,000-year-old system of natural healing is originated in India's ancient Vedic culture. It was suppressed during the years of foreign occupation, but its medical practices have been enjoying a resurgence both in its native land and throughout the world. Early Greek medicine embraced many concepts originally described in classical Ayurvedic texts dating back thousands of years. Traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine also have roots in Ayurveda. Over time, Ayurveda has become the science of life, encompassing body, mind and spirit. This body of knowledge is believed to have been originally delivered by God to sages and seers, who were yogis renowned in their insight, intuition and keen observation of human behavior. They handed down their knowledge to their disciples. An important goal of Ayurveda is to identify the ideal state of balance of a person and offer solutions using diet, herbs, music, massage treatments and meditation to restore the body's balance. "}
