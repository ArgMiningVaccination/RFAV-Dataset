Risk factors for VTE include age, active cancer, previous VTE, reduced mobility, recent trauma or surgery, heart and/or respiratory failure, stroke, and sepsis.1 The latest American Society of Hematology (ASH) and American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) guidelines on thrombosis prophylaxis recommend the use of mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis for patients at risk of thromboembolism.2,3 for this indication. For each LMWH several 'prophylactic doses' are registered , as reflected by differences in authorized summary of product characteristics (SPC) in the United States and Europe, and by differences in dosing regimens that a re applied in clinical trials . The ASH guideline has identified 'information on optimal dosing of parenteral coagulation' as a research Several systematic reviews have evaluated LMWH for thrombosis prophylaxis in specific patient groups, but none have investigated benefits and harms associated with specifically a low or an intermediate LMWH dose.4-10 More importantly, risks of systematic and random error were often parsimoniously considered and not always incorporated in the results . We have previously conducted a systematic review with meta - analysis and trial sequential analysis evaluating the benefit s and harms of intermediate dose LMWH for thrombo sis prophylaxis (PROSPERO CRD42016036951) . In th e current systematic review we aim to assess benefits and harms of low dose LMWH versus p lacebo or no trea tment. 7 Objective s The objective is to perform a systematic review with meta -analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) of randomized clinical trials (RCT\u00b4s) according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions comparing the benefits and harms of low dose LMWH versus placebo or no treatment in patients at risk of VTE .11 Available evidence will be evaluated in the perspective systematic error (bias) and random error (`the play of chance\u00b4) . 5 [8-14] Methods This protocol has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis Protocols (PRI SMA-P) and will be online available at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ( PROSPERO ).12 We will conduct this systematic review according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and by applying the methodology as suggested by Jakobsen et al.11,13 8 Criteria for con sidering trials for this review We will consider all randomiz ed clinical trials for inclusion irrespective of language, blinding, publication status , or sample size. Quasi-randomized trials and observational studies will be excluded . Patients Only randomized trials including adult patients with an indication for thrombo sis prophylaxis who are allocated to receive either low dose LMWH, a placebo , or no treatment will be eligible for inclusion, regardless their underlying disease and irrespective whether they were admitted to the ho spital or visited the outpatients clinic . Control intervention The control intervention will be placebo or no treatment. There will be no restrictions on durations of interventions. Alternative intervention The alternative intervention will be low dose LMWH . All trials that evaluate LMWH in a low dose will be considered , independent of the type of LMWH or duration of treatment. Trials which investigat e ultra -low-molecular -weight heparin will also be included in this review. As the process of depolymerization of native heparin is different for each product, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and World Health Organization (WHO) have classified each LMWH as a separate drug.14 Different types of LMWH can therefore not be used interchangeably and each type may be registered for different clinical applications in different doses . In the United States three different preparations (e.g., enoxaparin, tinzaparin and dalteparin) are currently approved f or a range of clinical applications. In Europe, numerous LMWH preparations (e.g., enoxaparin, tinzaparin, dal teparin, nadroparin, reviparin, etc) have been licensed for the prevention and treatment of VTE. Table 1 summarizes the recommended low and intermediate prophylactic and therapeutic LMWH doses 6 according to the 'Summary of Product Characteristics' (SPC) as approved by diffe rent medicine evaluation authorities.15-21 Randomized clinical tri als may occasionally evaluate custom doses of LMWH which are not covered by Table 1. We have therefore classified LMWH doses to be either in the low prophylactic range or in the intermediate prophylactic range (Table 2) . This classification of low and intermediate dose ranges is based on the recommended SPC doses as summarized in Table 1 or, if the SPC is inconclusive, on dosing regimens applied in randomized trials . This systematic review seeks to answer the research question whether low dose LMWH is preferred over placebo or no treatment for the prevention of VTE, therefore, we will only include randomized trials in which LMWH was used in the low dose range as indicated according to Table 2. There will be no restrictions on durations of interventions. In case different types or doses (or weight adjusted doses) were used in one trial or even in one patient, we will classify the trial according to what dose was used most frequently . Randomi zed trials will be included based on the intention for LMWH use, i.e., prophylactic use. We will include unforeseen types of (infrequently used) LMWH not listed in table 1 and 2 in a sensitivity analysis. 9 Outcomes All outcomes will be graded from the patients' perspective according to GRADE (Table 3) .22 Co-primary outcomes 1. All-cause mortality at maximal follow -up 2. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism 3. Major bleeding Secondary outcomes 1. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 2. Clinically relevant non -major bleeding 3. Any VTE (diagnosed through screening of all patients in the trial and thus including both sympt omatic and asymptomatic events) VTE, either symptomatic or ( and pulmonary embolism ( PE). A diagnosis of DVT will be accepted when objectified by either MRI, CT, ultrasound, a fibrinogen uptake test, venography, plethysmography or autopsy . We will make no distinction 7 between distal or proximal lower extremity DVT. A diagnosis of PE will be ac cepted when objectified by a ventilation -perfusion scan, computed tomography, pulmonary angiography or autopsy. Major bleeding and clinically relevant non -major bleeding will be defined according to the criteria used in the individual trials. In case the a uthor's definitions are unclear, we will attempt to define major bleeding according to the definitions of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Appendix 2).23-25 SAE will be defined according to the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP) definitions .26 When trials fail to report SAE, we will calculate SAE using the available data on VTE, major bleeding, other serious adverse events, and mortality. 10 Search methods for identification of studies: We will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL ) in The Cochrane Library , PubMed/MEDLINE , Web of Science and EMBASE . The search will be conducted using the search strategy in Appendix 1. The references of the identified trials will be screened to identify further relevant trials. We will check the trial registers at www.clinicaltrials.gov , https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu, and www.centerwatch.com for any ongoing randomi zed trials. 11 Data collection Trial selection and extraction of data Two authors will independently identify the trials for inclusion. We will also list the excluded studies with the reasons for exclusion. Two authors will independe ntly extract the following data: study characteristics (lead author, publication year, country or region, number of participating sites, number of patients enrolled) , participant characteristics (age, sex and other baseline characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria), intervention characteristics (dose and duration of thrombosis prop hylaxis of both the alternat ive and control intervention, co -interventions), evaluated outcomes, and risks of bias . Any unclear or missing information will be sought by contacting the authors of the individual trials. If there is any doubt whether the trial reports share the same participants - completely or partially (by identifying common authors and centres ) - the authors of the trials will be contacted to clarify whe ther the trial report had been duplicated. We will resolve any differences in opinion through discussion. 8 12 Assessment of bias risk Two authors will assess risk of bias of the trials , independently, without masking of trial names. We will use the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2, October 9th, 2018) to assess risk of bias in the following five domains: ''Bias arising from the randomization process'', '' Bias due to deviations from intended interventions'', '' Bias due to missing outcome data '', ''Bias in measurement of the outcome'', ''Bias in selection of the reported result'' .27 We will consider trials that are classified as low risk of bias in all five domains as being at ' overall low risk of bias '. Trials with one or more of these domains scored as 'some concerns' or 'high risk of bias' will be judged as overall 'high risk of bias'.28 We will base our conclusions mainly on results from trials with overall low risk of bias and construct a summary of findings table based primarily on the overall low risk of bias estimates and only secondarily on all trials . We will resolve any differences in opinion through discussion. 13 Data analysis We will perform the meta -analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We will use the software package Review Manager 5. 3.5. Measures of treatment effect We will calculate the risk ratio (RR) with Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) -adjusted confidence interval (CI), adjusting for sparse data and repetitive testing, if there are two or more trials for an outcome. Data synthesis We will use a fixed -effect and a random -effects model for meta -analysis in the presence of two or more trials included under the outcomes. If the intervention effects of the two models are approximately equal, we will emphasize the result with the widest confidence interval . In case of discrepancy between the two models, we will emphasize the most conservative estimate (point estima te closest to the null effect). The analysis will be performed on an intention -to-treat basis whenever possible, otherwise, we will adopt the 'available -case analysis\u00b4. Assessment of significance We will adjust the thresholds for statistical significance to correct for multiplicity iss ues that arise because of multiple outcome testing , by dividing the prespecified P value threshold with the value halfway between 1 (no adjustment) and the number of primary or secondary outcome comparisons (Bonferroni adjustment , very conservative ). Since we will assess three co-primary outcomes, a n of (0.05/ ((1+3)/2)=) 0.025 will be used for the primary outcomes to keep the family wise error rate at or 9 below 5%. 13 In case of statistically significant RR we will calculate the number s needed to treat (NNT) or number s needed to harm (NNH) with either 97.5% confidence intervals . Trial sequential analysis Meta -analyses may result in type -I errors due to an increased risk of random error when few data are collected and due to repeated significance testing when a cumulative meta -analysis is updated with new trials .29-34 To assess the risk of random error we will use TSA.35 TSA combines required infor mation size estimation (i.e. the number of patients needed to detect an a priori specified relative risk reduction) for meta -analysis with an adjusted threshold for statistical significance in the cumulative meta -analysis .31,32 The latter, called trial sequential mon itoring boundaries, reduce type -I errors. The required information size will take into account the unweighted event proportion in the control group, the assumption of a plausible relative risk reduction and the anticipated heterogeneity variance of the meta -analysis . The addition of each trial in a cumulative meta -analysis is regarded as an interim meta -analysis and helps to clarify whether additional trials are needed or not. The idea is that if the cumulative Z -curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary, a sufficient level of evidence has been reached and no further trials are needed. If the Z -curve doesn't cross the boundary and the required information size has not been reached, there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion .30 We will perform TSA on all primary outcomes with an ov erall type -I error of 2.5% and a power of 90% . We will calculate the required i nformatio n size using the variance according to the meta -analytic model corresponding to the diversity adjusted information size , suggested by a plausible relative risk reduction (RRR) of 20%. We will calculate the model variance based ( diversity (D\u00b2) adjusted ) required information size since the heterogeneity adjustment with I2 tends to underestimate the required information size.36 TSA will be conducted using the control eve nt proportion calculated from the actual meta -analyses . Sensitivity TSA's will be conducted as described below. Assessment of heterogeneity Heterogeneity as I2 will be explored by the chi -squared test with significance set at p -value of 0.10. The quantity of heterogeneity will be measured by D2 as well.36 We will explore clinical heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses as reported below. Reporting bias We plan to use a funnel plot to explore small trial bias and to use asymmetry in funnel plot of trial size against tr eatment effect to assess this bias provided at least 10 trials are available.11 10 Subgroup analysis We intend to perform the following subgroup analyses: Trials with overall low risk of bias (adequate in all domains) compared to trials with overall high risk of bias (one or more of the domains of bias assessed as high risk or some concerns ). The intervention effect varying with the types of patients included (e.g., patients ha ving orthopaedic surgery, patients having non -orthopaedic surgery, medical patients, or critically ill patients). The intervention effect varying with the type of medication ( e.g., nadroparin, enoxaparin) The intervention effect varying with length of foll ow-up: trials with any follow -up smaller than or equal to 30 days versus trials with follow -up more than 30 days . The intervention effect varying with the duration of the intervention period: trials with length of the intervention period smaller than or equal to 30 days versus trials with length of the intervention period more than 30 days. Only subgroup analyses showing statistical subgroup differences (significant test of interactions; p<0.05) will provide evidence of an intervention effect pending the subgroup. Sensitivity analyses To evaluate robustness of conclusions we will conduc t the following sensitivity analyses : 1. We will conduct TSA using an estimated required information size based on the RRR as suggested by the conventional meta -analysis of the included trials with low risk of bias ; 2. When D2 = 0% in the primary TSA we will conduct a sensitivity TSA calculat ing the required information size based on the assumption of D2 = 25%; 3. For very rare events (<2% in the control group) we will calculate peto's OR with TSA -adjusted CI; 4. We will re-do all analyses including studies that use 'dose undefined' LMWH types ; 5. We anticipate that the reporting of SAEs in trials will vary considerably and that most trials do not apply the ICH-GCP definition stringently. For this reason we will conduct two additional exploratory analyses of the SAE outcome : A. We will do a meta -analysis adding up all reported SAEs assuming that all patients experienced one event ( this method disregards the fact that one patient may suffer from multiple SAEs and will lead to an overestimation of SAEs) 11 B. We will do a meta -analysis using the highest fraction of a reported SAE from each trial assuming that all patients having a n SAE in a trial also had this event ( this method avoids d ouble counts but will lead to an underestimation of SAEs). We will assume that the \"true\" effect on the proportion of SAEs will be in between the two estimates from these analyses. 6. We will assess the impact of attrition bias by conducting best -worst and worst -best case scenarios: a best -worst case scenario is one where all patients lost to follow -up in the intervent ion group are supposed to have a beneficial outcome, while all patients lost to follow -up in the control intervention group have developed a h armful outcome . A worst -best case scenario is the reverse .13 12 Product Prophylactic Therapeutic dose Low dose Intermediate or 100 IU /kg twice daily Enoxaparin (Clexane\u00ae) 20 or 30 mg (=0,2 - 0,3 ml) 40 mg (=0,4 ml) once, or 30 mg (=0,3 ml) twice daily 1,5 mg /kg once daily or mg /kg 8000 IU twice daily (=0,8 ml) Table 1.

Requiring medical intervention by a healthcare professional 2. Leading to hospitalization or increased level of care 3. Prompting a face to face (i.e., not just a telephone or electronic communication) evaluation Definition of major bleeding in clinica l investigations of antihemostatic medicinal products in non - surgical patients 25 As general principles, a definition of major bleeding needs to be based on objective criteria, and major bleeds are those that result in death, are life -threatening, cause chronic sequelae or consume major health -care resources. With this in mind, the Control of Anticoagulation Subcommittee recommends the following criteria for major bleeding in non -surgical patients: 1. Fatal bleeding, and/or 2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra -articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or 3. Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g L1 (1.24 mmol L1) or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells. Definition of major bleeding in clinical investigations of antihemostatic medicinal products in surgical patients 24 Taking into account historical criteria and additional consultations with European and North American surgeons with experience from clinical trials and event adjudication the Subcommittee on Cont rol of Anticoagulation has approved the following recommendation for definition of major bleeding in surgical studies. 1. Fatal bleeding, and/or 22 2. Bleeding that is symptomatic and occurs in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocula r, retroperitoneal, pericardial, in a non -operated joint, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, assessed in consultation with the surgeon, and/or 3. Extrasurgical site bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g L1 (1.24 mmol L1) or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells, with temporal association within 24 -48 h to the bleeding, and/or 4. Surgical site bleeding that requires a second intervention - open, arthroscopic, endovascular - or a hemarthrosis of su fficient size as to interfere with rehabilitation by delaying mobilization or delayed wound healing, resulting in prolonged hospitalization or a deep wound infection, and/or 5. Surgical site bleeding that is unexpected and prolonged and/or sufficiently large to cause hemodynamic instability, as assessed by the surgeon. There should be an associate fall in hemoglobin level of at least 20 g L1 (1.24 mmol L1), or transfusion, indicated by the bleeding, of at least two units of whole blood or red cells, with tem poral association within 24 h to the bleeding. 6. The period for collection of these data is from start of surgery until five half -lives after the last dose of the drug with the longest half -life and with the longest treatment period (in case of unequal activ e treatment durations). 7. The population is those who have received at least one dose of the study drug. "}
