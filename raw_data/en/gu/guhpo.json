These can be helpful as a temporary boost during a particularly stressful time to support hormonal balance, or as more long term support if necessary. Work with a qualified bio-identical hormone practitioner to diagnose and correct your hormone imbalances. If you do embark on bio-identical hormone therapy, take the smallest dose for the shortest possible time. Bio-identical hormone therapy (BHRT) is a healthier alternative to synthetic hormone replacement therapy. This is because it uses natural hormones which share the molecular structure of our own natural hormones, and therefore are less difficult for the body to process, and have been shown to be safer than synthetic hormones (such as progestins, which are synthetic Progesterones; and synthetic Estrogens), as the latter have many negative side-effects, such as disease, inflammation, gut issues, and nutrient depletion.

Pregnenolone Pregnenolone is known as the mother hormone, and is the building block for all other hormones. It is made from cholesterol.

Sex hormones Chris Kresser advises always starting with stress hormone imbalances and healing any HPA axis dysfunction before addressing sex hormone imbalances.
