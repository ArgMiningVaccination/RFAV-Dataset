Whatever you think of alternative medicine, he has been successful at building a following and a community. Recently, Dr. Weil created [The Weil Foundation](http://www.weilfoundation.org/) to fund educational programs at medical schools around the country, teaching integrative medicine. Dr. Weil explains the healthcare problems we face today, \"We are all suffering from a broken health care system and medicine that is too dependent on expensive technology and pharmaceutical drugs that often cause as much harm as benefit.\" As a solution to this broken healthcare system, Dr. Weil is funding education of alternatives. \"I am training physicians and allied health professionals in Integrative Medicine, which emphasizes prevention, self-care, reliance on the body's innate healing capacity, and low-tech, low-cost interventions along with judicious use of conventional medicine,\" he says. Dr. Weil seeks to create a new model for healthcare with an emphasis on health. \"It will result in a transformation of medical education and a new generation of health professionals knowledgeable about nutrition, [lifestyle](http://www.forbes.com/lifestyle/) influences on health, mind/body interactions, natural remedies, other systems of medicine (like Chinese medicine). These doctors of the future will create a functional system of health care for our population,\" Dr. Weil concludes.
