AbstractData from a national sample of children are used to investigate the effects of participation inHead Start on a range of child outcomes. In order to control for selection into the program,comparisons are drawn between siblings and also between the relative benefits associated withattending Head Start, on one hand, and other preschools, on the other. There are large and significantgains associated with attending Head Start, as measured by test scores. This is true, relative tochildren who attend no preschool and also relative to those who attend other preschools. There arealso important racial differences in these benefits. Both whites and AfricanAmericans experienceinitial gains in test scores as a result of participation in Head Start. But, among African-Americans,the gains are quickly lost whereas, for whites, the gains persist well into adulthood. As a result,perhaps, Head Start significantly reduces the probability that a white child will repeat a grade, buthas no effect on grade repetition among Africar -American children. In contrast, relative to childrenwho attend no preschool, botl, whites and African- Americans gain greater access to preventive healthservices, as measured by immunization rates 2.lthough children who attend other preschools enjoysimilar benefits. Head Start is a federal matching grant program that aims to improve the learning skills, socialskills, and health status of poor children so that they can begin schooling on an equal footing with theirmore advantaged peers.' Begun in 1964, as part of the \"War on Poverty\", Head Start has enjoyed greatpublic and bi-partisan support. Presidents Bush and Clinton both pledged to increase federal funding sothat all eligible children could be served. Today 622,000 children, roughly 28% of eligible 3 to 5 yearolds, are served at a cost of $2.2 billion per year, or approximately $3,500 per child (Stewart, 1992).Policy makers and the general public appear to believe that the benefits of Head Start are well-known and well-documented. However, a careful reading of the literature shows that the evidence insupport of lasting effects of Head Start is limited. While Head Start has been shown to have significantimmediate effects on IQ, many studies find that these gains appear to decline over, time becominginsignificant by the third grade. Head Start is also said to reduce grade repetition, high school dropoutrates, and teen pregnancies, and to improve children's medical care and health status (c.f. Children'sDefense Fund, 1992). Still, some critics have attacked the \"Head Start Scam\" (Hood, 1992), arguing thatHead Start has little, if any, long-run impact on children.In this study we use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and theNational Longitudinal Survey's Child-Mother file (NLSCM) to re-examine the impact of Head Start. Oneof our key findings is that there are significant racial differences in the effects of Head Start. Nationally,3% of Head Start enrollees are African-American and many previous studies have examined samples ofpredominantly African-American children. When white children have been included, they have usuallybeen too few in number to allow separate analyses. Lee et al. (1990) cite lack of attention to possibleracial effects as a serious shortcoming of the previous Head Start literature.Our study makes several additional contributions. This is the first study to look at a nationalsample of children who attended regular Head Start programs and to examine a broad range of outcomes.These include measures of the child's cognitive attainment, scholastic success, utilization of medical care, Federal guidelines require that 90% of the children served be from families with incomes below the federal povertyline; recently, more than 95% of children served have been below the poverty line (U.S. DHHS, 1993). aJ and nutritional status. Possible long-range effects of improvements in these measures are also considered.Finally, careful attention is paid to the effects of possible non-random selection into the program.This is dealt with in two ways. First, models that incorporate mother fixed effects are estimated in orderto control for unobserved household-level determinants of participation in Head Start. Second, wecompare fixed effects estimates of the impact of Head Start relative to \"no preschool\" with the impact ofparticipation in other preschools relative to \"no preschool\". These \"difference-in-difference\" estimates helpcontrol for possible biases in the mother fixed effects estimates due to child-specific determinants of participation in Head Start.When selection is controlled in this way, Head Start has positive and persistent effects on the testscores and schooling attainment of white children, relative to participation in either other preschools orno preschool.In contrast, while the test scores of African-American children also increase withparticipation in Head Start, these gains are quickly lost, and there appear to be no positive effects onschooling attainment.Participation in either Head Start or preschool is associated with improved utilization of preventivemedical care, as proxied by immunization rates, relative to no preschool. This is true for both white andAfrican-American children. In contrast, there is no evidence that Head Start has any effect on a longer-runindicator of health and nutritional status, child height-for-age.The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. The first section contains a brief overview of theprevious literature.In the second, the methods are discussed. The third section provides a descriptionof the data and our child outcome measures. The estimated effects of Head Start are presented in thefourth section. We conclude with a crude assessment of the possible long-term benefits of the programand weigh these against its cost. 2 1. A Brief Sketch of the LiteratureMost previous studies of Head Start have focused only on assessing gains to IQ, despite the broadgoals of the Head Start program. For example, although Head Start provides \"a comprehensive healthservices program which includes a broad range of medical services\" (Head Start Bureau, 1992), a recentreview of 210 studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Mc Key et al.,1985)2 cites only 34 studies that have examined effects on health. These studies provide useful qualitativeinformation about the health effects of the program, but very few of them attempt to quantify the effectsin any way. Mc Key et al. also note that very few studies ha-e examined the impact of Head Start onschooling attainment.'The most convincing studies of the IQ effects of Head Start utilize a treatment and control designwith random assignment.' However, Barnett (1992) notes that experimental evaluations of the longer-termeffects on IQ may be biased by attrition because children who move are likely to be lost from theexperiment (although the direction of any bias is not obvious). A second limitation is that existingexperimental evaluations have not been based on national samples of children in representative Head Startprograms.For example, as discussed above, many studies focus exclusively on African-Americanchildren.The most widely cited evidence in support of the longer-term benefits of Head Start actuallycomes from experimental studies of model preschool programs such as the Perry Preschool Project or the 2 There have been several other surveys of the Head Start literature. See Westinghouse Learning Corporation andOhio University (1969), Bronfenbrenner (1975),Datta (1979), Horowitz and Paden (1973),and White (1985-86).Vinovskis(1993) showsthat the debate about the efficacy of compensatory education in the U.S. dates back at leastto the 1840's when 40% of all three year olds in Massachusetts were attending infant schools.3 The handful that have include: McDonald and Monroe (undated), Goodstein, Cawley, and Burrows (1975).Consortium for Longitudinal Studies (1983), Copp le, Cline, and Smith (1987), Bee (1981), Ilebbeler (1985), andFuerst and Fuerst (1993).The studies by the Consortium for Longitudinal Studies and the Fuersts actually dealt withprograms that were funded at much higher levels than the typical Head Start program.' Other studies make use of a quasi-experimental design in which the comparison children are drawn from waitinglists for the Head Start program. Lee, Brooks-Gunn and Schnur (1988) reanalyzed data from two of these studiesand found that the Head Start children were less likely to have a father present, and had less educated mothers than\"controls\" who did not participate. Tennessee Early Training Project. These programs were funded at higher levels, involved more intensiveinterventions, and had better-trained staff than the typical Head Start program. For example, the PerryPreschool Project was funded at a rate of about $6,000 per child. Twenty years after the program.researchers found that the \"treatments\" were more likely to graduate nigh-school, had fewer pregnanciesper female child, and had lower crime rates. However, the study involves a very small sample of 58treatments and 65 .controls, and many differences (such as the rate of teen pregnancy and the rate ofviolent crime) are not statistically significant (Berrueta-Clement et al, 1984).5In summary, despite literally hundreds of studies, the jury is still out on the question of whetherparticipation in Head Start has any lasting beneficial effects. 2. MethodsThe key empirical problem facing us is that, as we will see below, children are not randomlyselected into the Head Start program. Given the rules governing the program, we expect that Head Startchildren will be poorer than other children, and that they may also be disadvantaged in other observableways. Estimates that do not take account of these differences are likely to under-estimate the beneficialeffects of the program. We will, therefore, examine the impact of Head Start on child well-beingconditional on an array of observable mother and child characteristics.However, the economic model of the family (Becker, 1981) suggests that families choose whetheror not to make the effort necessary to enroll their children in Head Start or other preschools on the basisof the expected returns from that investment. Families who find this investment worthwhile may makeother unobserved investments in the child's human capital. In this case, studies that do not take accountof unobserved differences between families may over-estimate the beneficial effects of Head Start.If there are fewer places than child applicants, selection will also reflect the choices made byprogram administrators.Haskins (1989) cites evidence that local staff tend to select the most An additional problem is that in samples of this size, the effects of unobserved heterogeneity can swamp smalltreatment effects, even when treatments and controls an randomly assigned.4 disadvantaged children to participate in Head Start, in which case estimates of the effects of Head Startthat do not take account of variables used by staff to select participants will also be biased downwards.In order to control for unobserved characteristics correlated with selection into the program weestimate models with fixed effects for each household. These models control for constant characteristicsof households including permanent income, maternal education, and other measures of (unobserved) familybackground and tastes. If it is primarily these constant factors that determine participation in Head Start,then fixed effects models will provide unbiased estimates of the true program effects.'However, there may also be child-specific factors that affect participation. If, for example, parentswished to maximize the sum of their offspring's lifetime utility, then they might choose to enroll moreable children in Head Start. On the other hand, if they seek to equalize outcomes, they might enroll theleast able child. In the first case, fixed effects estimates would provide an overestimate of the impact ofHead Start, while in the latter case, they would yield an underestimate.There are two other reasons that the inclusion of household fixed effects could bias estimatedprogram effects towards zero. First,itis well known that in the presence of measurement error,differencing can result in \"throwing the baby out with the bath water,\" since much of the true \"signal\" maybe discarded while it is largely \"noise\" that remains.Second, in the fixed effects models the effects of Head Start are identified using the subset ofhouseholds in which some children attended Head Start while others did not. If there are any spillovereffects of Head Start from one sibling to the other, then tt e difference between the two siblings will bean underestimate of the true program effect. Spillover effetts may be important because a child teaches 6 Another way to address the problem of the endogeneity of program participation is to use instrumental variables(IV) estimators. We have experimented with this approach, but have not been successful in identifying convincinginstruments, at least from an empirical point of view. We tried, for example, assuming that a mother's participationin Head Start affected her child's outcomes only through the child's own participation in Head Stan. Althoughmaternal participation in Head Start is a significant predictor of the child's participation (Mott and Quinlan, 1992),it does not explain much of the variation in participation and the second stage estimates of the impact of Head Startare very imprecise. Similar problems arose in experiments with the proportion of federal funds spent in a state, andstate-level Head Start enrollments were not good predictors. Nelson and Startz (1990) report that in thesecircumstances, IV estimates can be very misleading; see also Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1993) and Staiger and Stock(1993). In view of these results., we do not report IV estimates in this paper. 5 his or her sibling something learned in Head Start, because the parent gains access to a service that is ofbenefit to both children, or because the parent makes compensating investments in the non-Head Startchild.In order to gain an understanding of the importance of the potential biases in the fixed effectsestimates due to child-specific factors, and/or spillover effects, we compare fixed effects estimates of theeffects of participation in Head Start to fixed effects estimates of the effects of enrollment in otherpreschools. The decision to enroll a child in some other kind of preschool is also properly treated as achoice. As is the case for Head Start, fixed effects estimates of the impact of other preschools will beunbiased it there are no unobserved child-specific characteristics that also enter this choice, and nospillovers.If the child-specific factorsor spillovers bias the estimated coefficients on Head Start and onpreschool in the same way, then the difference between the estimated coefficients will be accuratelyestimated, even if the individual coefficients are not. For example, suppose that parents send favoredchildren either to Head Startor to preschool, depending on their means, and keep other children at home.In this case the fixed effects estimates of Head Start and other preschools will both be biased upwards.But the estimated difference between the effects of Head Start relativeto no preschool and the effects ofother preschools relative tono preschool will be subject to less bias.We show below that for several of our outcome measures, the fixed effects estimates of the effectsof Head Start exceed those of enrollment in other preschools. Still, there are two possible ways in whichthese results could be driven by the biases discussed above. First, it could be the case that children whoattend either kind of preschool are systematically more favored or more able than their siblings and thatthe gap in ability between Head Start children and their stay-at-home siblings is greater than the gapbetween other preschool children and their siblings.Second, spillover effects could be greater withinfamilies in which a subset of children attend other preschools than within families with a subset ofchildren attending Head Start.It is difficult to rule out the possibility that the degree of parental favoritism is greater in 610 households with some children who attend Head Start than in households in which some children attendpreschool. However, we do not find any evidence consistent with the view that Head Start children arefavored. For example, relative to their siblings, they are no more likely to he taken to the doctor in thefirst three months of life, and they score no higher on the \"recognition of body parts\" test, a test that wasadministered to sample children before they were age-eligible to attend Head Start.' Moreover, we willdiscuss evidence below that suggests preschool children may actually be more favored rete'ive to their siblings than Head Start children, in which case the difference between the estimated effects of Head Startand preschool in the fixed effects models provides a lower bound on the true difference. Finally, the potential for spillover effects may be greatest in the most disadvantaged households, and among childrenin programs like Head Start that make explicit attempts to improve parenting skills.In this case, HeadStart effects will be underestimated relative to the effects of other preschools in the fixed effects models. 3. Data DescriptionThe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) began in 1979 with 6,283 young women whohave been surveyed annually ever since. As of 1990, these women were 25 through 32 of age and hadgiven birth to over 8,500 children. In 1986, the NLS began a separate survey of the children of theNLSY, the National Longitudinal Survey's Child-Mother file or NLSCM. The second and third wavesof the NLSCM were undertaken in 1988 and 1990. In these two waves, mothers were asked whether theirchildren had ever participated in Head Start. For this study, data on children and their mothers from all three waves of the NLSCM have been combined with information about the mother drawn from each waveof the NLSY. Attention is restricted to children aged 3 and older, and since the fixed effects estimates are based on sibling comparisons, the sample includes only children who have at least one sibling over In principle, it may be useful to control for pre-Head Start test scores when examining the effect of the programon post-Head Start scores. However, because of the design of the NLSCM, most tests are age-dependent and thusonly taken once by any child. One test that we employ, the PPVT, has been administered to the same child morethan once but, again because of the design of the NLSCM, it is not possible to do a pre/post comparison of scores. 7 3 years old in the sample of nearly 5,000 children.'It is important to note that the original NLSY oversampled the poor and so a relatively largeproportion of the sample children -- about a fifth -- participated in Head Start. In addition, due to over-sampling there are large enough numbers of African-Americans to allow separate examination of thisgroup.'Child OutcomesWe focus on four measures of child outcomes. The first pair are indicators of academicperformance: the Picture Peabody Vocabulary Test (PPVT) score and whether the child has everrepeated a grade.\"The second pair of outcomes are related to child health: whether the child has beenimmunized for measles, and height standardized by age and gender using national norms (height-for-age).The following chart provides details about the coding of these variables. Each row shows the measure,the age group for whom the measure was recorded, and some additional comments.' 'Examining only mothers with at least two age-eligible children reduces the sample by 14%. The excluded childrentend to live in higher income households, their mothers are better educated and they arc better off in terms of thefour child outcomes discussed below.9 Hispanics have been examined separately in Currie and Thomas (1993). The effects of Head Start are notstatistically significantly different fro: .ihose of non-Hispanic whites for most outcomes. Hispanic and non-Hispanicwhites are thus treated as one group in order to place the spotlight on differences between them and African-Americans.I\u00b0 In earlier work, we also reported results using Peabody Individual Achievement Test scores for mathematics,reading recognition, and reading comprehension (Currie and Thomas, 1993). The results for reading recognition andcomprehension were similar to, though weaker than, the results reported below for PPVT scores. The onlystatistically significant result we found for PIAT math scores was that enrollment in other preschools was associatedwith higher scores among white children.\" If the child repeated a grade, mothers were also asked why the grade was repeated. The possible answers were:academic failure or lack of ability; immature, acts too young; frequently absent; truancy; health reason; moved toa more difficult school; and other. Mothers were allowed to check more than one answer and we found that virtuallyall mothers indicated that academic failure was a factor.12 Further information about these measures is available in Baker and Mott (1989). 810 Chart 1: Child Outcome MeasuresMeasureAge GroupCommentsPPVT Score4 years +Only measured once per child.

The relationship between test scores and future wages has received a great deal of attention fromeconomists. In his summary of this literature, Hanushek (1986) concludes that in most studies, \"years ofschooling and measures of cognitive ability exhibit independent effects on earnings.\" Unfortunately, themajority of these studies focus on the scores of high school students rather than on those of youngchildren. However, Muniane, Willett, and Levy (1993) find that a high school senior's mastery of skillstaught no 1r,ter than the 8th grade (as measured by achievement on standardized tests) is an importantdeterminant of future wages.While there is some evidence that test scores predict future schooling and labor market outcomes,the relationship is certainly not one-to-one. For example, developmental psychologists emphasize thata positive self-image and appropriate socialization may also,contribute to scholastic success. Thus, graderepetition is examined as a second, more direct measure of academic performance.Academic performance in early grades has been shown to be a significant predictor of eventualhigh school completion (Barrington and and Slusarcick, 1992). Therelationship between high school completion and wages is well-established -- most studies find that anadditional year of high school is associated with an 8% increase in lifetime wages (See Angrist, 1990 for 9 a recent estimate). High school graduates are also less likely to be unemployed (Markey, 1988). Andwhile economists tend to focus on labor market performance, educational attainment has also been shownto be associated with improvements in health (Grossman, 1973) and job satisfaction (Michael, 1982;Haveman and Wolfe, 1984). These results suggest that by improving performance in early grades, HeadStart participation could translate into a significant increase in the probability of graduating from highschool with attendant improvements in future wages and employment probabilities.As discussed above, in addition to early childhood education the Head Start program provides abroad range of health care servLes. Specifically, Head Start guidelines require that each child have aphysical exam; an assessment of immunization status; a growth assessment; vision, hearing, and speechtests; a hemoglobin or hematocrit test (for anemia); and a tuberculin skin test. Head Start Centers are alsorequired to screen for sickle cell anemia, lead poisoning, and parasitic infection, if these problems arecommon in the community. The NLSCM data only allow us to assess immunization status, and growth(as discussed below), but given the guidelines, it is not unreasonable to suppose that children who gainaccess to immunization services are also more likely to gain access to at .east some of the other requiredhealth services. In this case, immunization can be viewed as a marker for access to a bundle of importanthealth services.It may be objected that the provision of preventive services under the auspices of Head Startduplicates coverage available to many poor children under the Medicaid program, and that therefore theseadditional services have little value. However, only 39% of eligible children participate in the Early andPeriodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) component of the Medicaid program (U.S. DHHS,July 1990), and in the District of Columbia less than half of Medicaid-eligible children receive all theirimmunizations despite the fact that new mothers receive written reminders (The Washington Post, 1993).And in contrast to the results reported below, we found no evidence that Medicaid coverage increasedimmunization rates in the NLSCM. Hence, we suggest that the possibility that the Head Start programplays an important role in the provision of preventive services cannot be dismissed out of hand.Head Start program performance standards also state that \"every child in a part-day program will 10 receive a quantity of food in meals...and snacks which provides at least 1/3 of daily nutritional needs...\"(Head Start Bu :eau, 1992).Poor children are at much greater risk of nutritional deficiencies. Forexample, 21% of 1 to 2 year old children in low-income households suffer iron anemia compared to 7%of 1to 2 year olds from higher income households (Devaney, Haines, and Moffitt, 1989). Thesedeficiencies have been linked to short attention spans, lethargy, impaired immune status, and growth retardation.13With our second measure of child health, we place the spotlight on nutrition. Height-for-age isan indicator of both nutritional status and health and captures the effects of longer-term deprivation. Ithas been profitably used in the economic history and development literatures (see, for example, Fogel,1986; Martorell and Habicht, 1986; and the review in Strauss and Thomas, 1994). Many readers may besurprised to find that even in as rich a society as the contemporary United States, poor children are at riskof stunting, defined as low height-for-age. Data from the second National Health and Nutrition Survey(National Center for Health Statistics, 1981) indicates that 15% of poor female children 2 to 5 years oldare below the 5th percentile of height-for-age. The corresponding figure for males is 11%.Since child growth varies systematically with age and gender, height is standardized followingguidelines from the National Center for Health Statistics (1976). Each child in the sample is comparedwith the median child in a population of well nourished white children of the same age and gender in theUnited States, and the sample height-for-age is expressed as a percentage of this median.\" However,given evidence of systematic deviations from the standards in populations of poor children, we use themeasure of height taken closest to the child's fifth birthday in order to compare siblings of approximately 13 See Currie (1994) for a discussion.\" In the NLSCM, child height is either measured (by the enumerator or mother) or recalled by the mother. In the1986 survey, it is not possible to identify those children who were actually measured although reported height wasapparently based on recall for very few children (personal communication, Paula Baker, 1993). In the 1988 and 1990surveys, the heights of about 30% of children were reported by their mothers and the probability of being measuredrises with age. There is very little evidence of stacking in the recall data and the variances are similar for both recalland measured data and so, in this paper, we use all reported child heights. similar ages.'Evidence on the Importance of Selection Figure 1illustrates the fact that neither Head Start participants nor enrollees in other preschoolsare random samples of children. The figure shows the relationship between the type of preschool and thelogarithm of household permanent income measured as the average annual household income between1978 and 1990, in real 1990 dollars.I6Figure 1 suggests that the mechanism governing selection into Head Start is quite different fromthat underlying selection into other preschools, or even into no preschool. The probability of attendingHead Start declines with income whereas the probability of attending other preschools rises withpermanent income. The probability of attending no preschool is, relatively speaking, constant across theincome distribution.The figure also shows clear evidence of differences between the races. In this sample, 14% ofwhite children attended Head Start compared to 32% of African Americans. In part, this differencereflects the relative poverty of the latter. But that is only part of the story. As Figure 1 demonstrates,African-Americans are more likely to attend Head Start than whites at all income levels, and the gap is 15 Currie and Thomas (1993) show that relative to the NCHS norms, there is a dip in height-for-age soon after birthwhich is made up, on average, by the time the child reaches age 5.16 Permanent income is adopted in order to attenuate the influence of random measurement error and to break thelink between household income at a point in time and eligibility for the Head Start program. The estimates in FigureI are non-parametric and thus place no restrictions on the shape of the relationship between type of pre-school andpermanent income. They are estimated by the method of locally-weighted smoothed scatterplots (LOWESS, seeCleveland, 1979; Hardie 1990) which is a nearest neighborhood type estimator. Essentially, each observation isreplaced by its predicted value based on a weighted regression of the dependent variables on permanent income.The sample in each weighted regression includes only those children from households whose incomes are in the same\"neighborhood\" or band. The fraction of children included, the band-width, is arbitrary and we have experimentedwith a range of values. The estimates in Figure 1 include 20% of the sample and they seem to us to be sufficientlysmoothed. (Kernel estimators differ from nearest neighborhood estimators in the definition of this band. If it isconstant in width across the income distribution, then it is a kennel estimator; if, as in our case, the band maintainsa constant share of the sample, it is a nearest neighborhood estimator). The weights in each of the LOWESSregressions are given by win(1-cli3)3, where di is a measure of the difference in income of child j and the child ofinterest, i.In this case, cli=iyi-y,y(yj-yi) where (y.,-yi) is the maximum income gap between the child of interest andall other children in this particular band. The weight is positive for every observation within the band and theweighting function is similar to a Gaussian in shape. Since d0 for the child itself, the weight is equal to one; theweights decline as the income gap increases. Children outside the band are given a weight of zero and hence it isa local rather than global estimator. The x-axis of the figure is drawn to a logarithmic scale.1612 greatest among children living in higher income households.\" Conditional on income, whites andAfrican-Americans are roughly equally likely to attend other types of preschool, but whites are 10% morelikely to attend no preschool.Further evidence of differences between the races in the mechanisms determining selection intoHead Start is given in Figure 2 with reference to two of the four child outcome measures. The upperpanel shows non-parametric estimates of the relationship between PPVT scores and household permanentincome. The figure shows that whites have higher PPVT scores than African-Americans at all levels ofperrnan---1 income and that the gap actually increases with income. Figure 2 also shows that amongwhites, there is a gap between Head Start and other preschool children that tends to persist across theincome distribution.'In contrast, among African-Americans, there is little difference in PPVT scoresbetween Head Start children and those that attend other preschools, although there is some tendency forthose who attend any preschool to have higher scores that those who attend no preschool.These racial differences in the effects of Head Start suggest either that despite the low mean levelof scores, Head Start has a much more positive effect on African-American children than on whitechildren (by bringing them up to the same level as the preschool children), or that there are racialdifferences in the way children are selected into Head Start and other preschool programs. In any case,it is clear that racial differences in selection mechanisms and/or in child outcomes are not simply areflection of disparities in family income.The bottom half of Figure 2 shows non-parametric estimates of the relationship between height-for-age and permanent income. The figure illustrates that height-for-age tends to rise with income, 17Put another way, the negative effect of income on participation is much greater among whites. In a simpleregression of the probability of participating in Head Start on the logarithm of permanent income, the (absolute valueof the) coefficient on income is twice as large for whites (-0.19) than for African Americans (-0.10); the standarderrors are about 0.02 and so this difference is significant. After controlling for income, African-Americans are about5% more likely to attend Head Start than whites. For a more detailed discussion of correlates of Head Startparticipation in the NLSCM see Mott and Quinlan (1992).18 Conditional on permanent income, white Head Start children tend to score about 5 points below those who attendedother preschools (and the difference is significant with a t of 2.7). The difference between Head Start and those whonever attended preschool is small (1/2 a point) and insignificant. 131 especially among whites, and that in contrast with the results for PPVT scores, even poor African-American children are taller than the average white child. Second, Figure 2 shows that white children whoattended other peschools are about 1% of the US median taller than Head Start children at all levels of permanent income. In contrast, among African-Americans, Head Start children are taller than those thatattended other preschools at all but the lowest levels of income. However, African-American preschoolchildren are taller than no preschool children only at low levels of income.These results suggest that either Head Start has large positive effects on the height-for-age ofAfrican-Americans, but not of whites, or that once again, the mechanism underlying selection into HeadStart and preschool varies with race. That is, conditional on income, white Head Start children are shorter and have lower PPVT scores than white children who attended preschool, while African-American childrenwho attend Head Start are taller and have PPVT scores equal to those who attended other preschools.These observations provide a powerful motivation for attempting to control for characteristics associatedwith selection into the program, so that we can attempt to answer the question of whether the effects ofHead Start do, if fact, differ by race.Thus far, in our discussion of selection, we have focused on income differences between HeadStart, preschool, and no preschool children. Table 1 shows that in addition to lower average levels ofpermanent income, Head Start children are disadvantaged in most other observable respects. Relative tochildren who attended other preschools, children who attended Head Start have mothers and grandmotherswho are less educated, and who had lower scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), ameasure of human capital.\u00b0These differences between Head Start and other preschool children are all statistically significantfor both whites and African-Americans, although the gaps are substantially larger among whites. Forexample, the difference in maternal education between white children in Head Start and white children \"'Since the NLSY respondents were of different ages when the test was administered, the scores are standardizedusing the mean score for each year of age. Head Start participants are also less likely to have had a father figurepresent at age 3 and their mothers were less likely to be employed at that time. Including these potentiallyendogenous variables in our models did not change the results reported below. 141 3 in other preschools is 1.6 years, while the difference is only .8 years among African-Americans. Themajor exception to this generalization is that the mothers of African-America.' Head Start children are astall as the mothers of other African-American children, while white mothers of Head Start children areshorter than other white mothers. Head Start children also tend to be disadvantaged relative to childrenwho attended no preschool, though the gaps are smaller.Finally, Table 1 shows that relative to whites and controlling for preschool status, African-American mothers of Head Start children are actually better educated than comparable white mothers,although they tend to live in lower income households. However, the AFQT scores of African-Americanwomen are much lower than that of whites, a fact that is true throughout the income distribution andsuggests that AFQT measures more than native \"ability\".'Parental FavoritismEvidence from Within-Family Income Differences As discussed above, the fixed effects models estimated below are identified using the subset offamilies with at least one child who attended Head Start and at least one who did not. Similarly theeffects of preschool attendance are identified using the subset of children in which at least one childattended preschool and at least one did not. Table 2 focuses on the within-family income changes thatare associated with participation in Head Start and other preschools.Panel A of Table 2 reports, for children who attended Head Start, other preschools, or nopreschool (in the columns), the percentage with siblings who attended Head Start, other preschools, or nopreschool (in the rows). For example, the entry in the northwest corner of the table indicates that 41%of white children who attended Head Start had a sibling who also attended Head Start and, therefore, 59%had a sibling who did not.In the fixed effects models, only the latter group are used to identify theeffects of Head Start.Of these 59%, the vast majority (about three-quarters) did not attend any preschool. Thus, fixedeffects estimates of the impact of Head Start will be based largely on within-family comparisons of 20 A similar racial difference in the PPVT scores of children was noted above. 1513 children in Head Start with siblings who did not attend any preschool. The converse is also tnie: familieswith at least one child in preschool and at least one child not in preschool were unlikely ever to have hada child in Head Start. Estimates of the effects of Head Start and other preschools are therefore based onlargely non-overlapping samples of families. This result is important because it facilitates the comparisonof Head Start effects to the estimated effects of attending other preschools.Panel B of Table 2 presents the means and standard errors of two measures of income for eachtype of sibling pair. Permanent income (which is family specific) is reported in the first column, whileincome at the time the child was 3 years old is reported in the second. Income at age 3 is relevant sincethis is the time when most children would enter Head Start or some other preschool. Rows 1 to 3 confirmthat relative to children who attended other preschools, or no ri-:-'school, Head Start children aredisadvantaged both in terms of permanent income and income at a point in time.A second fact, which is apparent from row 4 of Table 2, that there is little within-familydifference in income at age 3 between Head Start children and no preschool children. In contrast, rows5 and 6 indicate that transitory income is associated with within-family movements between otherpreschool and no preschool, and also between Head Start and other preschool. The within-family gapbetween preschool and no preschool children is about $6,000 among whites and $8,000 among African-Americans. Similarly, the within-family gaps between other preschool and Head Start children are $5,000and $3,000 for whites and African-Americans, respectively.These results show that when family incomes rises, parents are more likely to send age-eligiblechildren to preschool.Asstming that parents want to do what is best for their children, but areconstrained by income, this finding suggests that a favored child would be more likely to be sent topreschool, other things being equal?' We do not find any similar pattern for Head Start. Hence, thereis some evidence consistent with the view that preschool children are actually more favored relative to 21 Theargument is made somewhat more complicated, but is not reversed, if we consider the effects of maternalemployment on preschool enrollment. If the mother's aim is to do what is best for her child, then she will work ifand only if the positive effects of gaining more income outweigh any negative effects of spending less time with thechild. In fact, there is little evidence that maternal employment harms children. See Currie (1994) for a discussionof this literature. 16ginU their stay-at-home siblings than Head Start children, which implies that the difference between theestimated effects of Head Start and of preschool in the fixed effects models discussed below may be anunderestimate of the true Head Start premium. 4. Estimation ResultsTables 3 and 4 present regression estimates of the effects of participation in Head Start and otherpreschools on the four child outcomes. In order to highlight the importance of controlling for observedand unobserved family-specific effects, three sets of estimates are presented in each case. \"Unadjusted\"OLS estimates (in columns 1 to 3) do not control for any observable covariates: this baseline shows thesample means. \"Adjusted\" OLS estimates (in columns 4 to 6) do control for mother and child-specificobservables. Fixed effects estimates (in columns 7 to 9) also control for all unobserved time invariantmother-specific effects in addition to child-specific observables.All the regressions are estimated separately for whites and African-Americans; to facilitatecomparisons between the two groups, differences between the estimated coefficients are reported in thethird column in each panel.In each regression, the excluded category is children who did not attendpreschool. The F-statistic for the test that the estimated \"difference-in-difference\" between Head Start andother preschool children is zero is reported just below each panel of estimates (along with the associated p-value).22The observables in the \"adjusted\" OLS regressions include child age, gender and whether the childwas the first born, (log) household permanent income, the mother's education, her AFQT score, her height,the number of siblings in the mother's household when she was age 14, and the education of the maternal 22 Lagrange Multiplier tests for homoskedasticity (Breusch and Pagan, 1979; White, 1980) are rejected for PPVT andheight for age; for these two outcomes, standard errors and test statistics are based on the infinitesimal jackknifewhich are heteroskedasticity robust estimators of the variance-covariance matrix (Jaeckel, 1972; White, 1980). TheOLS models have been estimated using logits and probits for the two discrete outcomes (grade repetition and measlesimmunization): inferences are identical in all cases. We have also estimated the effect of Head Start and preschoolon these two outcomes using Chamberlain conditional logits which allow for mother fixed effects (but randomlydropping one child from all families in which there is an odd number of children). Inferences drawn from theseestimates are the same as those reported in Tables 4 and 5. Since the OLS fixed effects coefficient estimates havea direct interpretation and do not require a balance sample, we prefer to report those estimates. 1744. grandmother. The fixed effects models include child age, gender, and whether the child is the first born,as well as household income at the time the child was age 3.\"Measures of Academic Performance The first three columns of Panel A in Table 3 indicate that the PPVT scores of white children are,on average, about twice those of African-American children. Within racial groups, white children whoattended other preschools or no preschool tend to score better, on average, than Head Start children. Forexample, white Head Start children score an average of 5 percentile points lower on the PPVT than whitechildren who did not attend preschool and 15 percentile points lower than whites who attended otherpreschools. Both of these differences are statistically significant. In contrast, there are no statisticallysignificant differences among African-Americans.Moving across the columns of Panel A in Table 4 shows the importance of controlling adequatelyfor all observed and unobserved family characteristics associated with selection into Head Start. Column4 suggests that, among whites, the difference between the PPVT scores of Head Start and other childrendisappears when observables are controlled.However, column 7 demonstrates that when unobserved differences between families arecontrolled, using mother fixed effects, participation in Head Start is actually associated with a significant6 percentile point increase in the PPVT score relative to no preschool, while participation in otherpreschools has no statistically significant effect on test scores. The gap between the effects of Head Startand other preschools is statistically significant. The difference between columns 4 and 7 indicates that,consistent with Haskins' (1989) observations, it is the most disadvantaged white children in terms ofunobservables that are selected into the Head Start program. On the other hand, controlling for 23It turns out that while these controls do affect the outcomes, their inclusion has only a small (depressing) impacton the estimated effects of Head Start and preschool. Inferences are not changed in any cases and so only thecontrolled fixed effects estimates are reported in the tables. We have also experimented with OLS models thatinclude such potentially endogenous variables as number of children age 18 in the household, mother's age at firstbirth, employment, and marital status (when the child was 3). The latter two covariates have also been included infixed effects models. In all cases, the results are qualitatively similar to those discussed below. All regressions alsoinclude controls to identify cases in which covariates are missing. Since not all children are eligible for all questions,and some were not tested, sample sizes vary across the outcomes. They are reported at the foot of each panel.18 ri unobservables has little effect on the estimated coefficient for other preschools, once observablecharacteristics are included in the model.The results for African-Americans indicate that selection may be less important for them: thereare no statistically significant effects of Head Start or preschool in any of the three specifications. Column9 shows that the difference between the Head Start effects for whites and African-Americans is large --nearly 6 points -- and statistically significant.We turn next to our second measure of academic performance: grade repetition. The first 3columns of Panel B in Table 3 show that about one third of white and nearly half of African-Americansample children age 10 or older are reported to have repeated a grade.24 Although white Head Startchildren are about 20% more likely to have repeated a grade than white children who attended otherpreschools, this difference is not statistically significant. Among African-Americans, the gaps betweenthe different groups of children are even smaller. The OLS estimates in columns 4 to 6 also indicate thatthere are no statistically significant effects of type of preschool on the probability of grade repetition.However, the fixed effects estimates, shown in columns 7 to 9, indicate that whites who attendedHead Start are 47% less likely to repeat a grade, relative to their siblings who did not attend preschool.Those who attended another type of preschool are no less likely to have repeated a grade than theirsiblings who stayed at home. The difference in differences, that is the gap between the effect of HeadStart and the effect of preschool, is also large (40%) and statistically significant (p-value 0.01).In contrast, attendance at either type of preschool has no statistically significant effect on theprobability of grade repetition among African-Americans (although the point estimate of the coefficienton other preschools is large). Once again, the racial difference in the impact of Head Start is statisticallysignificant.In sum, after controlling for mother-specific observables and unobservables we find that, forwhites, the academic performance of Head Start children is significantly better than that of siblings who 24 The rates of grade repetition reported in the NLSCM are in line with those cited in other sources. For example,Shepard and Smith (1990) report that 6 percent of all public school students are retained in grade annually. Hence,by 9th grade, approximately half of public school students have been retained in grade. 192 3 stayed at home. In addition, the estimated effects of Head Start are much greater than those of attendingother preschools once both observable and unobservable characteristics of families are controlled for.Among whites, this \"difference-in-difference\" estimate is statistically significant for both PPVT scores andgrade repetition. Among African-Americans, however, the tale is more dismal: neither Head Start norother preschools is associated with enhanced academic performance.Measures of Health StatusTable 4 presents the estimated effects of participation in Head Start and other preschools on twomeasures of health status: immunization probabilities and height-for-age. The first three columns of PanelA suggest that both whites and African-Americans are about 15 percent more likely to have had a measlesshot if they attended Head Start rather than another preschool. These gaps are statistically significant.There is little difference in these means between the other-preschool and no-preschool children, which issurprising in light of the differences in family background between these two groups. For both racialgroups, the \"difference-in-differences\" between Head Start and other preschool children is statisticallysignificant.Column 4 show that among whites, controlling for observables reduces the effects of Head Startto zero, while the effect of attending other preschools increases slightly and becomes statisticallysignificant. Among African-Americans, the inclusion of observables reduces the Head Start advantage byover half, but it remains significant.When fixed effects are included (in columns 7 and 8) we find that Head Start is associated withan 8% to 9% higher probability of being immunized among both white and African-American children.Attendance at other preschools is also associated with a higher probability of being immunized. Whilethe estimated coefficient on preschools is greater than the estimated effect of Head Start among whites,the difference is not statistically significant. 21mong African-Americans, the effect of other preschools isnot significantly different from zero, but it is also not significantly different from the coefficient on HeadStart either. Relative to other preschools then, there is no health care \"premium\" associated with HeadStart. 20 The relationship between type of preschool and child height for age is presented in Panel B of Table 4.The unadjusted OLS estimates (in columns 1 and 2) show that white children who attendpreschools are significantly taller than other white children, but that African-American children who attendHead Start are taller still.The coefficient on preschool in column 2 is not statistically significant.However, the hypothesis that Head Start and preschool have the same effect on the height-for-age ofAfrican-Americans cannot be rejected with any confidence.When observables are controlled in columns 4 and 5, the preschool effect among whites issomewhat weaker, but remains significant. A good part of the difference between columns 1 and 4 is accounted for by the influence of maternal height although other measures of maternal human capital (hereducation) are also statistically significant. This suggests that height is influenced both by genetic factorsand also by parental investments in the health and human capital of their children. The fixed effectsestimates for whites, in column 7, eliminate the influence of all shared genetic characteristics as well asall other fixed maternal characteristics; this results in a further weakening of the relationship betweenpreschool and child height although it remains positive and significant, albeit at a 7% level of confidence.Among African-Americans, the inclusion of observable maternal and child characteristics (incolumn 5) cuts the positive correlation between Head Start and child height by more than half.It also becomes statistically insignificant. Similarly, column 8 shows that we do not find any statisticallysignificant effect of either Head Start or preschool when fixed effects are included in the model.These results suggest that the positive correlation between Head Start and height-for-age amongAfrican-American noted in column 2 and in Figure 2, reflects the selection of taller African-Americanchildren into the program. This impression was confirmed by estimating regressions of birthweight onparticipation in the program. Birthweight is highly correlated with future child height-for-age, but could not possibly be influenced by future participation in Head Start. We found that African-American childrenwho attended Head Start were heavier at birth than those that did not. For whites, however, we did notfind any correlation between birthweight and enrollment in Head Start or preschool, so the positive effectof preschool on height-for-age appears to be a genuine program effect.4. 021 Thus, in spite of positive effects of attendance at Head Start or other preschools on the utilizationof preventive health care, the large nutritional component of the Head Start program, and the fact thatother preschools appear to have positive effects on the growth of some children, we find no evidence thatparticipation in Head Start has an effect on nutritional and health status as measured by height-for-age.Differences in the Effect of Head Start Among Whites and African-Americans The cognitive effects of Head Start appear to vary dramatically by race, even when selection intothe programs is taken into account: Head Start has a smaller effect on the test scores and schoolingattainment of African-Americans than on the test scores and academic achievement of whites. Why doesrace matter?One hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in the Head Start programs that serve children ofdifferent races. Given that there are over 1,300 Head Start programs (Hayes et al., 1990) all administeredat a local level, and that the program guidelines are not specific about how the goals of the program areto be attained, there is bound to be a great deal of heterogeneity in program content. A recent report onthe Head Start program notes that Head Start regional offices often differ in their interpretation andapplication of program policies. It also concludes that the quality of programming is uneven across thecountry. While most programs were in compliance with most standards, slightly over 11% of Headoperators monitored in 1993 were found to be out of compliance with 50 or more of 222 items reviewed,while another 18% needed improvement in 26 to 50 areas (U.S. DHHS, 1993). Itis possible that programs serving African-Americans place less emphasis on academicachievement than programs serving white children because it may be easier to monitor compliance withthe health care guidelines.Unfortunately, we cannot test these hypotheses as we have no informationabout individual program content.An alternative hypothesis is that the benefits of compensatory education depend both on theprogram itself and on the child's home background including, for example, the level of resources at home,as well as the type and quality of school attended after Head Start. To the extent that African-Americanchildren come disproportionately from more disadvantaged homes, located in poorer communities, and 222G attend troubled schools, one might expect Head Start to have either smaller initial effects or effects thatdissipate more quickly over time.We address these issues by estimating models that allow the effects of Head Start and otherpreschool attendance to vary with maternal AFQT and child age. These results are shown in Table 5.All of the models include fixed effec:s. We do not show results for height-for-age, since there were nosignificant effects of Head Start (or significant racial differences) to be explained.Maternal AFQT can be regarded as an index of maternal background or of human capital. It ishighly correlated with years of education as shown in Appendix Figure 1, but has the advantage of beinga continuous rather than discrete variable. If children from better backgrounds gain more from Head Startor preschool, then the interactions between AFQT and Head Start or preschool will be positive.The results in columns 1 and 2 of Panel A indicate that the positive effects of Head Start on PPVTincrease with AFQT among both whites and African-Americans. However, neither interaction isstatistically significant. The interactions between AFQT and preschool are also insignificant. However.turning to grade repetition, column 4 shows that among whites, there is a large and statistically significantinteraction between Head Start and AFQT: a 10 point increase in the normalized maternal AFQT scorereduces the probability of failure among Head Start children by 8%. We do not find any similar effectamong African-Americans (column 5). Moreover, the difference between whites and African-Americansin the AFQT-Head Start interaction is significant (at 8%, column 6). We do not find any significantinteractions between preschool attendance and AFQT for either race.Finally, the results shown in columns 7 through 9 indicate that in the regressions for immunizationprobabilities, interactions between Head Start and AFQT and between other preschools and AFQT are allpositive but not statistically significant. In sum, there is weak evidence that children from betterbackgrounds, as measured by maternal AFQT, gain more from Head Start but the interaction is onlystatistically significant in the regressions for grade repetition among whites.Interactions between the type of preschool and child age allow us to address the question ofwhether the effects of Head Start and other preschools persist as the child grows older. These estimates 234, are reported in Panel B of Table 5.25 Columns I and 2 contain one of our most interesting results. Notonly is the direct effect of Head Start la. ge, positive and significant for both whites andAfricanAmericans but the effect (of nearly 7 percentile points) is essentially identical for both racial groups.This finding stands in sharp contrast with the results discussed above. In Table 3 we found thatHead Start was associated with higher PPVT scores among whites but that African-American children didnot enjoy similar benefits. The difference lies in the age interactions. While the interactions are alwaysnegative, for whites they are small and statistically insignificant, while for African-Americans they arelarge and significant. Thus, for example, by age 10 African-American children have lost any benefits theygained from Head Start, while 10 year old white children retain a gain of 5 percentile points. There isno evidence of a similar interaction effects among children who attend preschool.Our results for African - Americans are thus consistent with those of earlier studies. We find noeffect of Head Start in a sample of children of various ages because the benefits die out very quickly.However, looking only at young African-American children, we find that there are clear benefits associatedwith Head Start attendance. White children also benefit from Head Start, but they tend to retain thesebenefits for a much longer period.It is also possible to ask whether the rate at which the benefits of Head Start dissipate amongAfrican-Americans depends on the environment at home. To do this, we have estimated models (notshown) that include \"triple interactions\" between age, Head Start, and maternal AFQT. If children frombetter backgrounds retain the gains from Head Start longer, then this triple interaction will be positive(offsetting the fact that the beneficial effect declines with age). We found no evidence for this hypothesis:the coefficient on the triple interaction was -0.04 with a t-statistic of 0.09. To the extent that the maternalAFQT score does capture home background, this result suggests that at least part of the racial differencein the benefits of Head Start reflects heterogeneity in program delivery or in the types of schools thatwhites and African-Americans attend once they leave the program. For the interactions, the age of the child is measured in years than five (which is when the child will havecompleted Head Start or preschool). The interactive effect can thus be interpreted as a measure of the depreciationof the benefit of preschool for each year since completion.24 Columns 4 to 6 of Table 6, Panel B indicate that there are no statistically significant interactionsbetween age and type of preschool in the regressions for grade repetition. In part, ,his reflects the factthat the question was only asked of children over 10 years old, so there is relatively little variation in the age ranges of the respondents.Finally, columns 7 to 9 of Table 6, Panel B show that older children who attended Head Start areless likely to have been immunized. This result could reflect recall error if parents of older Head Startchildren tend to forget that a child has been immunized. However, if the result reflects recall error, thenone might expect the same pattern among children who went to preschool and there is no evidence in support of this \"forgetting hypothesis\" among these children.26 Thus, it is likely that the result reflectsan increasing emphasis on the health care portion of the Head Start program in recent years. 6. Discussion and ConclusionsIn closing, we offer some observations about the likely importance of the effects we haveidentified. Participation in Head Start is associated with an increase in the FPVT scores of white childrenof 5.6 percentile points. Table 2 indicated that the gap in PPVT scores between Head Start children andthose who attended other preschools is 15 points. Hence, our results suggest that Head Start closes over one-third of the gap between children attending the program and their more advantaged peers. Moreover,contrary to many previous studies, we find that this beneficial effect persists into adolescence and adulthood among white children.We also find that white children over 9 years old who attended Head Start are 47% less likely tohave repeated a grade than other white children. Given that 35% of white children who did not attendpreschool repeated a grade, this translates into a reduction of 16% points in the probability of repeating 26 In addition, there is evidence that recall error tends to decline with education (see, for example, Smith, Thomasand Karo ly, 1991). If better educated mothers are less likely to forget their children were immunized and recall erroris the explanation, then we would expect the interaction between maternal AFQT, age and Head Start to be positive.For whites, it is positive but small and insignificant; for African-Americans, the triple interaction is negative, smalland also insignificant.25 a grade. A gain of this size more than closes the gap between white Head Start children and their peerswho attended other preschools.It is difficult to evaluate the long-run impacts of the gains in test scores. As discussed above,previous research indicates that children who perform poorly in early grades are more likely than otherchildren to eventually drop out of school altogether. But it is not clear to what extent this relationshipis causal.Nevertheless, we can take some representative estimates from the education literature andextrapolate using our data. Ensminger and Slusarcick (1992) find that childrer received C's and D'sin Grade 1 are twice as likely to drop out of school as children who received A's and B's. Assuming thatthe wage gain to an additional year of high school is 8%, that most children would drop out in grade 11,and that the increase in test scores we find would be enough to move a child from a C to a B average,enrolling a white child in Head Start could increase his or her expected future wage by 4%.We are on somewhat firmer ground t.-:31uating the likely effects of reductions in the probabilityof grade repetition. In a study of more than 140,000 students from three different school districts, Grissomand Shepard (1989) found that students who were retained in grade were 30% more likely to drop out ofschool, even when achievement on standardized tests, socio-economic status, gender, and ethnicity werecontrolled. They also found that grade repetition was disproportionately concentrated in early grades, andespecially grade one, which means that their findings should be relevant to our sample. Hence, the 16%decline in the probability of repeating a grade associated with Head Start could lead to a 5% decline inthe probability of high school drop out among white children.It is notable that enrollment in other preschools has no significant effects (positive or negative)on test scores or on the probability of grade repetition among white or African-American children. Andfor whites, the differences between the effects of Head Start and those of preschool are statisticallysignificant. Given that children in Head Start are disadvantaged relative to even their own siblings, thefact that Head Start has bigger effects than preschool strongly suggests that our estimates are capturinga genuine effect of program rather than selection bias.Turning to the effects on the utilization of health care, and on health status, we find that both 26 white and African-American children are 8% to 11% more likely to be immunized if they attended either Head Start or another preschool than if they attended no preschool.. These results are consistent with those surveyed in Mc Key et al. (1985) because they suggest that children in Head Start are gaining access topreventive health care. Once again, it is difficult to place a value on these services. An upper bound isprovided by the average cost of providing outpatient services to an AFDC (Aid for Families with Dependent Children) child covered by Medicaid, or $468 per year in 1990 (U.S. House of Representatives, 1992).Finally, we turn to the $2.2 billion question -- is the money spent on Head Start a worthwhileinvestment or are there less expensive ways of providing similar benefits? The results for African -American children suggest that the primary long term benefits of Head Start are in terms of access tohealth care. Hence, it is appropriate to compare Head Start's price tag of $3,500 per child to the $468estimate for health services cited above. This comparison suggests that when viewed strictly in terms of lasting benefits provided to children, Head Start programs serving African-American children are not costeffective?' Whether this result reflects inadequacies in these programs, or the limited opportunitiesavailable to African-American children after they leave the program, is sure to be a hotly debated question.In contrast, the results for white children suggest that the potential gains are much larger than thecosts since even a small decline in the high school dropout rate has the potential to pay for itself in terms of future wage gains. If the factors preventing African-American children from maintaining the gains theyachieve in Head Start could be removed, the program could probably be judged an incontrovertible success. 27 The Head Start program also provides benefits to other family members. For example, more than a third of theemployees are parents of current or former Head Start students (Washington and Oyemade, 1987) and expenditureson Head Start comprised 20% of all federal expenditures on child care in 1986 (Kahn and Kamerman, 1987). Acomplete cost/benefit analysis would have to take account of these factors. On the other hand, public support forthe program seems to based on the perception that it benefits children rather than on the desire to provide these otherbenefits.27 ReferencesAngrist, Joshua. \"Lifetime Earnings and the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery: Evidence from Social SecurityAdministration Records,\" American Economic Review, 80 3:313-336, June 1990.Baker, Paula, and Frank Mott.
