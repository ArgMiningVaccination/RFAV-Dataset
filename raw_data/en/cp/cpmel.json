Cancer is marked by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors including: genetic vulnerability, food choices, lifestyle, and estrogen exposures.1 Breast canc er occurs in one of eight women and is the most common cancer in women. It occurs in one percent of men.2,3 Seventy percent of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive, and genetic mutations such as BRCA 1 and 2 mutations increase breast cancer development with 60 -80% lifetim e risk.4-6 What Is an Integrative Approach to Breast Cancer C are? Integrative medicine encourages an empowered approach to care which emphasizes lifestyle choices which may help prevent breast cancer, slow its growth when it occurs, and prevent recurrence.1 It combines conventional and complementary and alternative (CAM) approaches to care that address physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of the person. Evidence based therapies are used when available. The healing intention of all therapies is emphasi zed. Cancer may serve as an opportunity for growth and greater health. CAM therapies, which interfere with conventional therapies, are avoided during that portion of treatment. Each person has a unique path to healing. CAM therapies may also reduce cancer treatment side effects. What Are the Risk Factors for Breast C ancer ? Risk factors are reviewed by Costanza and Chen in UpToDate.7 Risk factors that increase risk of breast cancer include: o Alcohol consumption of greater than 1 drink per day1,8,9 o Increased lifetime exposure to estrogen: exogenous and endogenous1 o Obesity1,10,11 o Increasing age1 o High fat, low fiber, processed food diet, low intake of fruits and vegetables1 o Exposure to radiation1 o Paternal or maternal family history of breast cancer12,13 o BRCA 1 or 2, or P53 mutations12,13 o Night shift work14-16 Breast Cancer Care and Prevention: Non-Pharmacological Interventions Breast with Disease Non-Pharmacological Breast Cancer Care & Prevention PEARLS FOR CLINICIAN S 2 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Factors that decrease risk: o Regular exercise 30 -60 minutes 3 -5 times per week.17 o Prolonged breastfeeding12-13 o Fresh foods including 5 -9 servings of fruits and vegetables daily10, 17 o Higher ratio of weak 2 -hydroxyestrones versus stronger 16 - hydroxyestrones metabolites in body. Can be measured with urine testing.18-20 Healthy Breast Non-Pharmacological Breast Cancer Care & Prevention PEARLS FOR CLINICIAN S 3 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative What are Some Integrative Non -pharmacological Therapies for the Prevention and Treatment of Breast Cancer ? Nutrition Diets high in fruits and vegetables, fish, fresh foods, low in animal fat, and high in olive oil (the Mediterranean diet) may reduce the risk of breast cancer and many other cancers, whereas, the western diet high in fats and low in fruits and vegetables may increase risk.21 The Mediterranean diet favors weak estrogenic metabolites, which stimulate vulnerable breast tissue less t han stronger estrogen metabolites, which may lead to breast cancer development.19,22,23 For an easy to follow food pyramid that defines key ingred ients of the Mediterranean diet, see the website at the University of Michigan Integrative Medicine Program at http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food -pyramid/about.htm . o Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Polyunsaturated fatty aci ds include omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. In large quantities and especially if hydrogenated for extended shelf life, oils such as sunflower, safflower, soy, sesame and corn oils can be pro -inflammatory in the body. Omega 3 fatty acids including EPA and DHA are anti -inflammatory, and include fish oil, flax seed oil and the oil in walnuts. Omega 3 fatty acids are present in fatty fish such as salmon, sardines and mackerel, walnuts, green leafy vegetables and flax seed meal. The VITamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) Study demonstrated that fish oil reduced the risk of ductal but not lobular breast cancers.24 In another study, fish omega 3 intake was found to reduce risk of breast cancer in pre and postmenopausal women with the greatest reduction in postmenopausal wome n.25 Dosing: High potency fish oil: about 1000 mg of combined DHA and EPA daily in less than 3 gms of total fish oil. Flax seed oil can be substituted on a vegan diet. Contraindications: If any bleeding occurs, stop fish oil immediately. Stop one week prior to surgery. Stop if platelets are less than 20,000K. Two important monographs on exercise and nutrition , one for cancer prevention and the other focused on the period during and after treatment, were created by the American Cancer Society (ACS). A panel of exp erts reviewed the scientific evidence and best practices guidelines. These guidelines were published in 2006 and updated in 2012 .10,17 Access condensed versions here. See links on page 10 for the complete Cancer Care & Prevention PEARLS FOR CLINICIAN S 4 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative o Monounsaturated Fatty Acids Oleic acid (omega 9 fatty acid) found in olive oil, as well as avocados, hazelnuts, and cashew nuts, may help suppress HER 2/Neu tumor cell growth. o Green Tea Green tea is a polyphenol and natural aromatase inhibitor. Green tea ingestion of 3 cups or more per day in two studies reduced the risk of breast cancer.26,27 Dosing: Three or more cups a day. o Soy Soy has been controversial in the past in estrogen positive tumors because it is a phytoestrogen with weak estrogen receptor binding properties. In rat models, isolated isoflavones stimulated estrogen positive tumors, but soy foods have opposite protectiv e effects.28 The large Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study showed that soy food intake was associated with increased survival and less recurrence of tumors in estrogen positive and negative women, and in users and nonusers of tamoxifen.29 In other studies, this finding has been replicated.30-32 One to three servings of soy foods are recommended daily unless sensitive to soy. o Flax Flax as flax seed meal or oil, is a rich source of phytoestrogens containing alpha - linoleic acid. As an omeg a 3 fatty acid containing food, it inhibits aromatase activity, binds weakly to estrogen receptors, and increases the weaker 2 -OHE's. It reduces the risk of breast cancer and decreases breast cancer cell growth.18,19,33 Use 1 -2 tablespoons a day added to food. o Antioxidants Diets high in antioxidants contained in fruits and vegetables may lower risk of breast cancer.21 Carotenoids in fruits and vegetables reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer in premenopausal women.34 Antioxidants in foods are safer than high dose supplement forms given synergistic effects and better absorption. Scant evidence exists for antioxidant supplements during cancer treatment, and there are potential risks of them interfering with treatment.35 Recommend 5 -9 servings of frui ts and vegetables daily. o Whey protein Whey protein powder is a by -product of cheese production. It is much less allergenic than casein protein. It is high in glutamine and helps prevent mouth sores (stomatitis) in patients receiving chemotherapy and may be useful in preventing the peripheral neuropathy of certain chemotherapy agents such as taxanes. 20 -30 gms of whey protein powder twice daily in smoothies will provide enough glutamine to help prevent these complications of chemotherapy. If there exist s sensitivity or allergy to whey, glutamine can be taken as a supplement, 3 -5 gms one to three times daily.36 Non-Pharmacological Breast Cancer Care & Prevention PEARLS FOR CLINICIAN S 5 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative o (Cruciferous) sprouts and cabbage. Indole -3-carbinol contained in these vegetables helps decrease cancer cell proliferation, increase apoptosis, and increases the ratio of weak to strong estrogens (2-OHE/16 -OHE) favorably. Breast cancer risk may be reduced by 20 -40% w ith 1-2 servings of cruciferous vegetables daily.23,37 -39 Indole -3-carbinol as a supplement can interfere with Tamoxifen and is safer to eat in vegetable form than in supplement form.1 1-2 servings per day. Exercise In the prevention of cancer, exercise may help control weight, improve immunity and mood control. In cancer treatment, it may benefit mood, energy levels, immunity, overall health, survival, prevention of recurrence, and quality of life. Exercise may also improve balance with decrease in falls and improves vasomotor instability in menopause.40,41 Exercising more than 3 hours a week lowered breast cancer mortality.42 It also improves fitness during conventional cancer therapies.43 Supplements One important resource for evaluating which supplements can improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy agents, and which interfere is The Definitive Guide to Cancer, 3rd Edition: An Integrative Approach to Prevention, Treatment and Alschuler , ND and Karolyn Gazella, 2010.1 o Vitamin D Vitamin D deficiency is common in latitudes farther from the equator and can result in osteoporosis, weakness, low back pain, and sterna l pain. Individuals at risk include those 65 years or older, little unprotected sun exposure, darker skin color, and medication use with glucocorticoids or anticonvulsants.44,45 Strong evidence exists that adequate vitamin D levels may reduce breast cance r risk especially in those with higher levels.46,47 Food sources except oily fish contain inadequate amounts of vitamin D, and their taking a daily supplement is advised unless adequate sun exposure is available. One study found that levels of vitamin D i n the 60 -80 ng/ml lowered the risk of premenopausal breast cancer.48 Recommend obtaining a 25 hydroxy -vitamin D level in winter for patients living at latitudes farther from the equator . Recommend vitamin D3: 1000 -2000 IU daily.49-51 During the summer months at latitudes greater than 35 -40 degrees north of the equator, or daily at latitudes closer to the equator, moderate exposure to sun, at least 20 minutes midday without sunscreen for patients who are not at risk for sunburn or skin cancer, will help maintain normal vitamin D levels.52 Latitude Map for U.S.A. Non-Pharmacological Breast Cancer Care & Prevention PEARLS FOR CLINICIAN S 6 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative o Melatonin Melatonin has antioxidant, immune enhancing, cytotoxic, and estrogen regulating properties. It can help in the treatment of insomnia. It is contraindicated in bipolar illness, and in some vulnerable individuals may worsen depression. Exercise caution with other sedative medication. Melatonin comes in two forms: an immediate release preparation for individuals having difficulty in falling asleep, and a sustained release preparation for those having difficulty staying asleep.53,54 Dosing ranges from 1 mg to 20 mg before bed, and a starting dos e is 3 mg before bed. Titrate to desired effect, without causing a hangover the next day. o Botanicals Botanicals may be helpful in the treatment of cancer but must be used carefully during chemotherapy, since many botanicals can interfere with the metabolism of the chemotherapy agent by increasing or decreasing its metabolism in the body. Certain botanicals interfere wi th the metabolism of taxanes, platinum based drugs, cyclophosphamide, doxyrubicin, etoposide, and irinotecan.1 Generally, botanicals do not interfere with radiotherapy. Botanicals such as St John's Wort can interact with other drugs the patient may be t aking via the cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway. Spiritual and Emotional Care Small group psychological interventions for breast cancer patients led by a psychologist and concentrating on stress management and strategies to optimize conventional treatment and improve mood helped decrease recurrence and mortality.55 Integrative Management of Side Effects from Breast Cancer Treatment Fatigue Fatigue is a common symptom of cancer and treatment. Daily gentle exercise and acupuncture may help.40,56 -58 Vasomotor Instability Exercise, acupuncture, and a number of pharmacological medications may help with vasomotor instability from menopause.59-63 Black cohosh is not estrogenic; in one study it decreased risk of breast cancer, but generally it is not helpful in controlling hot flashes.35,64,65 Black cohosh can cause liver toxicity and must be used cautiously. Breast cancer survivors tend to have 10% more sleep disturbances even long term than age matched women without cancer. These sleep disturbances in both groups are associated with hot flashes, depression, more distress, and worse physical conditioning.66 In one study, breast cancer survivors had less physical activity and more hot flashes than women without breast cancer.67 For specific information on botanical and supplement interactions with chemotherapy drugs, refer to the text The Definitive Guide to Cancer, 3rd Edition: An Integrative Approach to Prevention, Treatment a nd Healing by Lise Alschuler and Karolyn Gazella, Celestial Arts, 2010. Non-Pharmacological Breast Cancer Care & Prevention PEARLS FOR CLINICIAN S 7 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Nausea and Vomiting Acupuncture with and without moxibustion helped alleviate nausea and vomiting in cancer treatment.68-71 Nausea intensity decreased in one study wit h exercise.72 Ginger may also help alleviate nausea. Its mechanism for this is unknown. Take 500 to 1000 mg ginger root extract every 4 to 6 hours as needed, or eat 1 tsp or 5 gm crystallized ginger every 2 to 3 hours as needed. Too much ginger may cause heartburn.73 A systematic review to evaluate the use of cannabis as a therapeutic agent for treating chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients concluded that dronabinol was statistically and clinically more effective as an anti -emetic than neuroleptics. Caution is suggested related to the small sample size and number of studies.74 Anxiety/ Stress/ Depression Anxiety and depression may be improved with a number of studied interventions including acupuncture, an 8 -week Mindfulness -based S tress Reduction Program, art therapy, and exercise.57,75 -79 Massage therapy, yoga, and support groups have also proved beneficial to cancer patients.68,78 -86 Aromatherapy, dance, journaling, guided imagery, biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy, medi tation, relaxation, and hypnosis also were helpful during treatment.35,87 Insomnia and Other Sleep Disturbances Good sleep hygiene helps induce sleep at night when production of melatonin is optimal. Minimizing sleep during the day, exercising regularly, sleeping in a quiet dark room, and going to sleep at a similar time each night promotes sleep. Relaxation, meditation and yoga can increase melatonin and optimize sleep.88 Cognitive behavioral therapy also has positive effects on sleep.89 Regular exerc ise can help to reinforce normal circadian rhythm and endogenous melatonin production by increasing wakefulness during the day and sleep at night.40 Melatonin in supplemental form can be used. Pain and Peripheral Neuropathy Acupuncture may be helpful with pain relief. One study showed improved pain scores and psychological functioning with an 8 -week course of acupuncture.57 The Society for Integrative Oncology upon review of the literature strongly endorses acupuncture for this indication.68 Massa ge may also be very helpful in relieving pain.68 Exercise maintains fitness during treatment.43 Cannabinoids may also help neuropathic pain.90 Mind -body therapies may also be efficacious for pain.91 Lymphedema and Musculoskeletal Issues Lymphatic massage and exercise may prevent some degree of lymphedema and prevent or relieve shoulder dysfunction.68,92 One study showed that gentle weight lifting twice weekly did not worsen lymphedema, but improved it and increased strength.93 Acupunctur e increased shoulder range of motion and decreased lymphedema and its symptoms of heaviness and tightening in a small study by Alem and Gurgel.94 Dermatitis from Radiation Therapy Calendula cream applied multiple times daily to the skin being irradiated may reduce the severity of dermatitis from therapy.95 Non-Pharmacological Breast Cancer Care & Prevention PEARLS FOR CLINICIAN S 8 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Therapeutic Review: Treatment of Symptoms in Cancer Treatment SYMPTOM TREATMENT Fatigue Exercise Acupuncture Post menopausal hot flashes Medications such as SSRI's, SNRI's, and gabapentin Acupuncture Exercise Nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy Acupuncture Ginger Cannabis Anxiety, stress, depression Acupuncture Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Art Therapy Exercise Yoga Massage Support groups Insomnia Exercise Melatonin Relaxation techniques Sleep hygiene Pain and peripheral neuropathy Acupuncture Exercise Cannabinoids Massage Mind -body therapies Lymphedema Acupuncture Exercise Lymphatic massage Radiation dermatitis Calendula cream Patient Education Three patient handouts related to breast cancer care and prevention are also available.
