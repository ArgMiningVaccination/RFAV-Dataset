Here is Dean's description of the meditation: This is a great way to stay (or become!) calm, sane, and happy in these strange times. First, through guided practice of natural meditation, we settle within ourselves and connect with our inmost core of just being \u2014 the place of infinite OK-ness. Then, in the discussion, we address questions about meditation practice and integrating that inner OK-ness into everyday life. New participants are always welcome. No experience, skill, attitude, or belief is required. The sessions are free and open to everyone, anywhere in the world.
