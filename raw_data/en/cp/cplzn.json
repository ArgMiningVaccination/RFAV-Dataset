Sulman, MD, PhD", "date": "2023-05-31", "cleaned_text": "[ About Me ](#about-me-content) I'm the first doctor in my family and what I love most about my job is the personal interaction with my patients. As a child, I had a strong interest in the sciences and wanted a career that would give me an opportunity to help others. Becoming a doctor was a natural choice. Thanks to a mentor, I received an early introduction to radiation oncology soon after I graduated from college. Radiation oncology is a very rewarding field\u2014it is technical and data driven, but also involves a lot of patient interaction. As co-director of the [Brain and Spine Tumor Center](/locations/brain-spine-tumor-center) at NYU Langone's [Perlmutter Cancer Center](/locations/perlmutter-cancer-center), I treat patients who have brain and spinal cord tumors using radiation therapy, including Gamma Knife\u00ae radiosurgery and external beam radiation therapy. I am involved at the national and international level in current clinical trials and research in my field. My research focuses on finding new treatments, particularly those that improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy, and on identifying molecular predictors of treatment response. I serve as the translational science chair on many of the largest brain tumor trials around the country for biomarker development and validation. I am also a board member of the Society for Neuro-Oncology, which is the leading professional society for researchers and clinicians who treat patients with brain tumors. As a physician, I focus on offering the best patient care and improving the patient experience. I approach each patient uniquely and personalize my care. My treatment philosophy is guided by my patients' needs\u2014keeping in mind the challenges that they are facing\u2014and not according to a formula.
