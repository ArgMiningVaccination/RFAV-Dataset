Traditional medicine - watching this phenomenonand fearing the competition - is demanding that alternative medicine do more researchto get that respect. Amid the clamor of competing voices, these demands are turning out to be bene- ficial to both sides. They have improved the chances for integrating the two medicalstyles and, in more specific terms, they are working to broaden the already vast phar-maceutical research market with new funds. And while the private sector is puttingincreasing efforts into research, the public sector's growing interest in the industry isbringing both millions in funding and new validity for nutraceuticals in general. The clearest evidence of this comes from a series of recent new initiatives, ranging from selection of the first permanent head of the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine (NCCAM; see story, p. 3) to the establishment of new centersfor research into alternative therapies and new monies to study specific dietary prod-ucts. And all of the projects are being carried out by some of the most prestigious med-ical research organizations in the nation. Dietary Supplements Research Centers launched The launch of the first Dietary Supplements Research Centers devoted to studying botanicals has just been announced by the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Officeof Dietary Supplements (ODS) in collaboration with NCCAM. Initial awards of $1.5million per year, for five years, will go to the University of California at Los Angeles(UCLA) and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The ODS said in a statement that the new centers \"are expected to greatly advance the scientific base of knowledge about botanicals.\" To address these issues, Congressappropriated additional funds for the ODS in fiscal year 1999 to develop these botani-cal centers \"with major research institutions across the nation.\" The research is intended to be interdisciplinary, according to the ODS, and will be designed to identify \"potential health benefits and to develop a systematic evaluationof the safety and effectiveness of botanicals, particularly those available as dietary sup-plements.\" The UCLA Center for Dietary Supplements Research on Botanicals will conduct basic and clinical research to explore the potential mechanisms of action of yeast-fer-mented rice for cholesterol reduction with implications for heart disease prevention, andVol. 2, No. 10 October 1999 Now available online: Go to www.ahcpub.com/online.html for details \u00a9Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

Its activities will be directed by Dr. David Heber. The research center at UIC initially will focus on studying 10 herbal supplements described as having\"implications\" for benefit in women's health issues,including therapies for menopause. Besides conduct-ing basic and clinical research, the UIC group is tosupport research training in the study of natural prod-ucts, primarily plants - technically known as pharma-cognosy. The UIC group also will provide informationon botanicals to consumers and health professionals,with its educational activities to include an interactiveweb site. The UIC center will be headed by Dr. Nor-man Farnsworth. Establishment of the two centers is part of the mis- sion to carry out specific scientific goals outlined inNIH's strategic plan. Besides receiving funding fromODS and NCCAM, the Office of Research on Women'sHealth and the National Institute of General MedicalSciences are contributing funding to this project. Aging: a 21st century market driver Besides the need for validation, NIH's new emphasis on supplements research is being driven bya clear and very pressing demographic trends. Thesetrends are the graying of the world's populations andthe growing incidence of associated disorders - espe-cially those of a psychological nature. Looming overthe horizon of the new millennium is the pressingneed to find treatments with fewer side effects thantraditional pharmaceuticals. Thus, NCCAM and theNational Institute of Aging (another arm of the NIH)have just announced a multicenter study to test theuse of ginkgo biloba on older individuals who are at risk for dementia. A six-year, $15 million grant will goto The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine tocoordinate a multicenter study, to be headed bySteven Kosky, MD, professor of psychiatry, neurologyand neurobiology, and director of the Alzheimer'sDisease Research Center at the medical school. The clinical centers are a prestigious group: Johns Hopkins School of Medicine's department of radiology; the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Uni-versity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine; the Univer-sity of California, Davis; and the Wake Forest Univer-sity School of Medicine. The study will enroll a total of 2,000 participants randomly assigned to one of two groups. Primaryendpoint of the study will be the onset of any type of dementia, with the secondary endpoint being changesin cognitive function. One group of study participantswill be given 240 milligrams of ginkgo biloba and will be compared to a second group given a placebo.Study participants, numbering up to 1,500 will berecruited from current participants in a cardiovascularhealth study who made a clinic visit in 1998-99. In Asia, standardized extracts from ginkgo leaves have been routinely used to treat a wide range of symp-toms, including Alzheimer's disease, but there is \"noevidence,\" according to an NIH statement, to validateits use in either prevent or cure this disease. The studyalso may help identify and standardize the active ingre-dients of the plant and examine reported side effects. Arthritic knees, aching backs NCCAM also announced in mid-September that it would collaborate with another NIH component, theNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletaland Skin Diseases, to study the use of glucosamineand chondroitin sulfate to treat knee osteoarthritis(OA), another problem driven by the aging process.The University of Utah School of Medicine (Salt LakeCity) will receive a $6.6 million, four-year grant toconduct a nine-center study of this application in 1,000participants. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate arenatural supplements that are receiving increasing pub-licity for treatment of OA and, according to Harlan,\"Providing solid evidence on the benefits and safety ofthis treatment may help expand health care options forpatients challenged with this condition.\" Back pain, afflicting all age groups, is the focus of another study recently announced by the NIH'sNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletaland Skin Diseases (NIAMS). This study will comparesurgical against non-surgical treatment of three backdisorders in 1,450 patients at 11 medical centers. Theproject, according to NIH, may have \"a major impacton clinical practice and on the cost of medical ser-vices\" related to three back disorders: herniated lum-bar disc; spinal stenosis, or narrowing of the canalthrough which the spinal cord passes; and degenera-tive spondylolisthesis, where a vertebra in the spineslips forward out of place. Judi Forman, NIH project coordinator told NBR that the study will examine the use of supplements andother alternative medications, along with the full rangeof non-surgical treatments available to physicians. The five-year, $13.5 million study will be directed by James Weinstein, DO, professor in the departmentof community and family medicine, Center for theEvaluative Clinical Sciences, and professor of surgeryat Dartmouth Medical School. Participating centersinclude: Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland,Ohio), Dartmouth Medical School (Hanover, NewHampshire), Emory Spine Center (Decatur, Georgia), \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

Dr. Stephen Katz, director of the NIAMS, said, \"Based on this trial, we shall, for the firsttime, have scientific evidence regarding the rel-ative effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgi-cal treatment of these commonly diagnosedlumbar spine conditions.\" The NIH Office of Research on Women's Health and the National Institute for Occupa-tional Safety and Health of the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention are also contribut-ing funding for the study. New emphasis Perhaps the most far-reaching and innova- tive initiative launched by the NIH, however, isthe recent funding of five centers to study\"mind-body interactions and health.\" Whilethese centers will not be looking specifically atthe use of medications, the thrust of the studiesclearly will promote the importance of alterna-tive strategies in health and healing. The centers, according to an NIH state- ment, \"will focus on research that seeks tounderstand how beliefs, attitudes, values andstress affect physical and mental health . . .[and] how beliefs, attitudes, and values thataffect health are developed, maintained, andchanged.\" The initiative also appears to suggest broad underlying support for looking at alternativehealing since the effort is driven by a congres-sional m andate. The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) was directedto lead efforts at the NIH to develop a mind-body initiative, and 12 NIH institutes arecosponsoring the initiative. The five centers include the department of psychiatry and Carnegie Mellon Humanities andSocial Sciences department of psychology atthe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pitts-burgh, Pennsylvania); the department of epidemiolo-gy at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (Ann Arbor, Michigan); the department of psy- chology at the University of Wisconsin (Madison,Wisconsin); the department of psychology at the Uni-versity of Miami (Coral Gables, Florida); and thedepartment of microbiology and immunology at theCollege of medicine and Public Health at Ohio StateUniversity (Columbus, Ohio). \"These new research centers,\" according to Dr. Norman Anderson, Director of the OBSSR, \"repre-sent innovations in the integration of behavioral,social, and biomedical research. It is hoped that thefindings they produce will accelerate our under-standing of mind/body interactions, and lead tomore effective approaches for the treatment and pre-vention of disease.\" \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

In announc-ing the appointment, Health and Human Services Director DonnaShalala called Strauss a \"nationally and internationally recognizedexpert in clinical research and clinical trials.\" Since 1991 he hasserved as the chief for the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation atNIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID). \"Dr. Straus brings exceptional expertise and leadership to this position and will continue to ensure high-quality complementaryand alternative medicine treatments and modalities,\" Shalala said.\"I look forward to the light he and his colleagues will shed on var-ious alternative approaches to maintaining good health and treat-ing disease.\" \"The American public is increasingly interested in comple- mentary and alternative therapies, and it is critical that NIH putits scientific expertise to work to help determine which therapiesare safe and effective,\" said Harold Varmus, MD, director of NIH.\"The appointment of Dr. Straus, with his experience in alternativetherapies and his expertise in clinical evidence, will result in sig-nificant expansion of clinical research in this field. He brings tothis position a clear sense of leadership, strong management andorganizational expertise, and superb communications skills.\" Straus has broad basic and clinical research experience relat- ed to many diseases for which there are alternative remedies,including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), Lyme disease,AIDS/HIV , chronic hepatitis B virus and genital herpes infectionsand chronic post-herpetic pain. He is known for his wide-rangingstudies involving patients with CFS, which began in 1979, beforethe syndrome was named. These studies ranged from efforts toidentify viral etiologies in the syndrome to his more recentimmunologic, neuroendocrine and neuropsychologic studies ofthe disorder. He also has a strong background in investigations ofthe molecular biology, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention ofhuman viral infections. Straus received his medical degree from the Columbia Uni- versity College of Physicians and Surgeons. After his internship atBarnes Hospital in St. Louis, Mo., Straus' first NIH experiencebegan in 1973, when he accepted a research associate position inNIAID's Laboratory of the Biology of Viruses. Returning to Barnesfor his residency, he earned a fellowship in infectious diseases at St.Louis Washington University, which he completed before hereturned to NIAID as a senior investigator. William Harlan, MD, has been serving as acting director of NCCAM, and will return to his position as director of the NIHOffice of Disease Prevention.\u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

A producer of raw materials, seasoning mixtures, aroma chemicals and flavorings for the food, bever-age, cosmetics, detergents, specialty chemicals andpharmaceuticals industries, the company in late Sep-tember acquired full ownership of Baltimore SpiceIsrael Ltd. (Acre) for $3 million in cash and a pledgeto release Baltimore's former owners from guaranteesworth $2.5 million. Baltimore's annual sales are esti-mated at from $5 million to $6 million. Ori Yehudai, Frutarom's president and chief executive, said that \"Buying Baltimore, which hasbeen developing new products for some 21 years,will bolster the company's research and develop-ment infrastructure and bring a new range of tech-nological know-how, which will immediately benefitFrutarom's subsidiaries in Russia, Turkey andChina.\" Baltimore's products are expected to meld with Frutarom's compounds division, its most profitableactivity, anticipated to eventually contribute 60% ofthe company's gross profit. Frutarom plans to boostits raw materials division's profitability by launchingseveral new products for the fragrance, food, andpharma-cosmetics-sunscreen industries. Yehudai says Frutarom is considering further acquisitions of foreign companies \"to reach a criticalmass\" and to expand into markets such as Turkey andChina, where the company can enjoy a relativeadvantage compared with rival multinationals. The Botanicare activity of Frutarom's fully owned American subsidiary, Frutarom Incorporated Botani-care, a natural products manufacturer located in NewJersey, is another focus of increased activity. The American market for nutraceuticals - or for drugs based on natural herbal ingredients - is esti-mated at $3.5 billion to $4 billion a year. Botanicare istargeting a market estimated at $500 to $600 million ayear. Frutarom ended the second quarter of 1999 with a net profit of $963,000 on turnover of $18.1 million, a rel-ative decline from $1.2 million on turnover of $19.3million in 2Q98, in part due to Botanicare's loweredprofits due to an overstock of kava-kava, marketed asa natural tranquilizer. Janice Thompson, PhD, has been named president and CEO of Ancile Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, California), developer of botanical drugs forthe prescription and self-medication markets.Thompson, a natural products expert, has been vicepresident, scientific affairs at Ancile since its found-ing in February 1998. In her new posts, she suc-ceeds Kevin Kinsella, who had held those positionssince co-founding the company. He will remain asboard chairman. David Lumley has been named president and CEO of Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS; Golden, Colorado), a distributor of sportsnutritional supplements. Lumley replaces EASfounder Bill Phillips, who has been CEO since thecompany's inception. Phillips takes on the newposition of director of Value Creation and heremains a member of the EAS board of directors.Prior to joining EAS, Lumley was president ofBrunswick Bicycles. Susan Alpert, PhD, MD, has been appointed director of food safety at the Food and Drug Administration 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition , effective Oct. 25. Alpert has been with the FDA since 1987, and currently servesas director of the Office of Device Evaluation at theagency's Center for Devices and RadiologicalHealth. She previously held the position of super-visory medical officer in the FDA's Center for DrugEvaluation and Research. Robert Burgess has announced his retirement as president/chief operating officer of PharmaPrint (Irvine, California), a developer of pharmaceuticalsand dietary supplements from natural plantextracts. Elliott Friedman, PharmaPrint's chairmanand CEO, said that a search is under way for a suc-cessor to Burgess, and that the company hopes toannounce the successor within the coming weeks.PharmaPrint develops, manufactures and marketspharmaceuticals and dietary supplements derivedfrom natural plant extracts. Roger Williams, MD, has been named exec- utive vice president and chief executive officer-designate of the United States Pharmacopeia Convention (USP; Rockville, Maryland), effective Jan. 4, 2000. Williams will succeed Jerome Hal-perin, who has announced his intention to resign.Williams will officially assume all responsibilitiesof the position on April 16, 2000, at USP's quin-quennial meeting. Williams comes to USP afternine years with the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-tration's Center for Drug Evaluation andResearch. Personnel FileHerbal supplements nearing saturation? The consulting group ExperTeam (Irvine, Califor- nia) has issued a report indicating that saturation of themarket for herbal supplements is not too far away. Thatmarket \"has been growing at an annual rate of 25% to$4 billion,\" according to Herbert Loveless, a health careanalyst with the group, adding that this market sector\"is reaching its inflection point and will likely peak at $6to $8 billion in two to three years.\" He estimated the\"comparable market\" in Europe at about $6 billion. Henoted that herbals have reached perhaps greatest accep-tance in Germany which has a formal regulatoryprocess and where they have long been an acceptedpart of German medical practice. \"It's difficult to imag-ine the U.S. herbal market will markedly outperformsuch a mature market as Europe's,\" according to theExperTeam report. Loveless also predicted a plateau ingeneric drugs of the $80 billion U.S. retailpharmaceutical market.\" Loveless said that there hasbeen a trend for many supplement companies \"to gothe new drug application route in order to penetrate theprescription market. However, both Shaman and Phar-manex have abandoned this strategy. Funding,patentability and competition from dietary supple-ments have proven difficult problems to overcome.\" \"The supplement industry's only hope for contin- ued growth is new federal legislation that will estab-lish a separate track for herbal medications that willgive some type of exclusivity,\" Loveless said. \"Unfor-tunately, ephedra, a stimulant in many herbal prepa-rations, is an example of how serious problems arebetween the agency and the industry. . . . The neededlegislation will be extremely complex, and virtuallyimpossible to enact without some degree of agencycooperation. It's difficult to see how any scenario canbe worked out in the near to medium term.\" Dr. Atkins criticizes AHA drug focus In the wake of the recent Fall Conference and Sci- entific Sessions of the Council for High Blood Pressure,held in Orlando, Florida, Robert Atkins, MD, develop-er of the well-known Atkins Diet, criticized the gather-ing for \"ignoring the increasing success of diet andnutritional supplementation when treating high bloodpressure patients.\" Physicians continue to focus ondrug treatments for heart disease, but drugs, \"merelymask symptoms,\" according to Atkins, a trained cardi-ologist and founder of The Atkins Center for Comple-mentary Medicine. \"Most cardiovascular drugs not only fail to deal with heart problems like hardening ofthe arteries, but in some cases compound those prob-lems, exposing people to even greater perils.\" Atkins reports that his center has produced an 85% success rate in treating hypertension patients and wean-ing them from medications, using a combination of low-carbohydrate diet and a protocol emphasizing nutrition-al supplements. A combination of \"mainstream\" andalternative techniques \"helps personalize medical treat-ment and provide the most effective solution for eachpatient,\" according to a statement from the Atkins Cen-ter. \"The Atkins Diet is a key treatment component inreducing hypertension. A high-protein, low-carbohy-drate diet, paired with nutritional supplementation, canbe helpful in normalizing blood sugar, promoting weightloss and reducing other cardiovascular risk factors asso-ciated with this condition,\" says Patrick Fratellone, MD,head of cardiology at The Atkins Center. \"Nothing ismore consistently and rapidly observed on the AtkinsDiet than the normalization of blood pressure,\" The Atkins Center physicians also use chelation therapy, a non-surgical process for removing harmfulmetals from the body and helping to restore bloodflow. Chelation therapy intravenously administers amixture of vitamins and minerals, called ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, which helps improve calci-um and cholesterol metabolism. Another treatmentoption used at the center is personalized nutritionalsupplementation, which includes a broad base of vit-amins and supplements. Naturopathic licensing sought in California The California Association of Naturopathic Physi- cians (CANP; San Francisco) recently launched a cam-paign for licensing of naturopathic doctors in thatstate. \"California has long held the image of the bell-wether for the country. Yet the state is seriously lag-ging in providing qualified naturopathic health careto consumers,\" said CANP President David Field,ND, LAc. \"Licensing will allow consumers to selectfrom a broader range of responsible health care pro-fessionals,\" Field said. \"Patients deserve qualified,competent, safe choices for their personal health care.California has fallen behind the rest of the country inthis area, and the state's residents face a major dilem-ma when they seek natural health care.\" Naturopathic medicine emphasizes use of both time-tested and newer natural treatments, accordingto the CANP . These include clinical nutrition, botani-cal medicine, homeopathic medicine, physical medi-cine and lifestyle counseling. Naturopathic physiciansare graduates of four-year accredited naturopathicmedical schools recognized by the U.S. Department ofEducation. Like MDs, they study basic sciences for thefirst two years, but they then focus for the next twoyears on the use of natural therapeutics. \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

The requirements for licensure in thosestates include: Graduating from a four-year postgrad-uate naturopathic medical school; a compre-hensive state naturopathic board exam; maintaining arequisite number of Continuing Education credits;and adhering to codes of ethics and conduct. CANP's parent organization is the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Recently, twolicensed naturopathic physicians were appointed tothe Complementary Alternative Medicine ProgramAdvisory Council at the National Institute of Healthby the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services. Alternatives get heavy use for arthritis sufferers A new study indicates that many people with arthritis use alternative medicines to treat their problem,and that the number is larger than generally estimated.Additionally, the study suggests that more of these peo-ple are discussing with their doctors the alternativesthey are using, and they generally have little concernabout their physicians disapproving of the practice. Dr.Jaya Rao is lead author of the study, published in theSept. 21 Annals of Internal Medicine , which surveyed more than 200 arthritis patients in Indianapolis, Indiana.Rao reported that 56% of those surveyed were usingsome form of alternative medication, a finding he saidthat \"most surprised us.\" Another surprise: 24% wereusing more than one form of alternative treatment. Of those who did not tell their doctor about the alternative treatments, only 15% said they failed to doso because they feared the doctor would disapprove;55% said the doctor did not ask, and 49% said theymeant to tell the doctor but forgot. Among those whodid tell their doctor about using alternative medica-tion, 71% said their doctors told them it was accept-able to keep using the alternative treatments, while14% said their doctors told them to stop. Among one of the more interesting findings of the study was that college-educated patients were morelikely to use alternative treatments than those withoutdegrees. Rao's study examined 232 patients who saw rheumatologists at six different clinical settings thatwere varied in type. The study did not examine theattitudes of people who rely exclusively on alternativehealing and avoid physicians altogether. \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

Pharmanex produces Tegreen97 (pronounced \"tea green\"), an extract of green tea,which will be used in the study as a standardized, caf-feine-free source of catechins. The study is being ledby cancer researchers Dorothy Morre and D. JamesMorre. \"Bringing together the talents and resources ofPurdue and Pharmanex in this joint study is veryexciting,\" said Dr. Dorothy Morre, professor of foodsand nutrition in Purdue's School of Consumer andFamily Sciences. \"We have a vital interest in green tearesearch and this further exploration will hopefullybring us closer to validating a link.\" Bill McGlashan,Jr., president of Pharmanex, said, \"The Morres' earlierfindings on green tea have given us tantalizing clues.We are pleased that the standardized qualities of ourgreen tea extract may help provide additionalanswers in the areas of cancer prevention and treat-ment.\" Scientists from Pharmanex will be involved in the study on a consulting basis. The collaboration buildson earlier research reported last year at the 38th annu-al meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology inSan Francisco. That laboratory study revealed howbiologically relevant concentrations of epigallocate-chin gallate (EGCg), the key catechin found naturallyin green tea, effectively slowed the growth of tNOX,an overactive form of quinol oxidase (NOX). TheMorre's earlier research has suggested that NOX - anenzyme expressed on the surface of cancer cells -facilitates aggressive cell multiplication, linkingtNOX to tumor growth and development. The collab-orative study with Tegreen 97 will try to definewhether a consistent level of EGCg and related cate-chins delivered to cancer cells will achieve an anti-cancer effect. Another antioxidant source: Kiwifruit A new report from the California Kiwifruit Com- mission (Sacramento, California) is promoting thebenefits of kiwifruit, particular as an excellent sourceof antioxidants including lutein and vitamins E andC. Lutein is a phytochemical found in both greenFocus on Foodsfruits and leafy greens, and it has been credited as an antioxidant in reducing the risk of cancer and heartdisease, and in protecting against age-related maculardegeneration, the leading cause of legal blindness inpeople over age 65. A serving of kiwifruit containsabout twice as much vitamin C (250 milligrams) as anorange and more than twice the recommended vita-min C daily intake. As reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , male smokers aged 50 to 69 who consumed vitamin E achieved a 32% decrease inthe incidence of prostate cancer and a 41% decrease indeaths compared to men not taking vitamin E.Kiwifruit also contains copper, a critical mineral forbone growth and brain development in children. Maureen Ternus, MS, RD, said that kiwifruit may be one of the best food sources for good health at allstages of the life cycle. \"They should be front and cen-ter in consumers' minds as they choose winter fruits,\"Ternus said. California kiwifruit represents 95% of allkiwifruit grown in the U.S., with peak season for Cal-ifornia's kiwifruit crop from October through March. Ocean Spray pushing cranberries Ocean Spray (Lakeville-Middleboro, Massachu- setts) is perhaps the best-known brand in cranberries,but the company is pumping up its marketing effortseven further with an increasing focus on the berry'snutritional properties. \"There's more and more evi-dence that women and families are looking forhealthy products that give them great taste andrefreshment,\" said Don Hattoon, Ocean Spray's boardchairman. \"That's exactly what Ocean Spray andcranberry is known for. We're going after theuntapped potential in the market with a full slate ofpromotional programs and new advertising as part ofone of the most aggressive marketing campaignswe've ever executed.\" The company will reportedlyspend up to $100 million this year in its promotionalefforts, focusing much of that effort on various newproducts it recently has rolled out. The company recently rolled out its Cranberry Juice Cocktail PLUS, calling it a \"supercharged\" juicethat contains 130% of the recommended daily require-ment of vitamin C, plus vitamins A and E and calci-um. The company also in May renamed its line of100% juices as Ocean Spray premium 100% Juices toemphasize their healthful value. Additionally, itadded two flavors to the line: cranberry and concordgrape, and cranberry and Pacific raspberry. The com-pany's marketing efforts could be bolstered by twoyears of cranberry surplus and what is estimated to bea bumper crop in year 2000. Beta-carotene benefits downgraded New research by a team at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School(Boston) indicates that taking supplements of beta-carotene taken every other day does not reduce a man's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Beta-carotene is found frequently in orange and yellowfruits and vegetables and some green vegetables and,once consumed, converts to vitamin A. The study,headed by Dr. Simin Liu and conducted over 12years, would appear to contradict previous researchindicating that beta-carotene can fight off non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Researchers followedmore than 20,000 men who took either a 50 milligramsupplement of beta-carotene or a placebo pill over the12-year period. In the beta-carotene group 396 mendeveloped type 2 diabetes, compared to 402 in theplacebo group, a difference with no statistical signifi-cance. In an interview, Liu told Reuters that the studyshowed \"no effect, either beneficial or harmful.\"Despite this conclusion, Lieu did not rule out the abil-ity of other compounds in fruits and vegetables toprotect against diabetes. \"Vitamin E and other typesof carotenoids may play a role,\" he said. \"we stillneed to evaluate their efficacy.\" Sorbitol warning sought The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI; Washington) has petitioned the FDA to beef upthe existing warning label on processed foods thatcontain the sugar substitute sorbitol, a sweet-tastingsugar alcohol product. Sorbitol is used in manysugar-free or \"dietetic\" candies, cake mixes, syrups,and other foods, as well as in some medicines.Because it is poorly absorbed by the body, it providesfewer calories than regular sugars. However, CSPIsays that studies have proven that sorbitol can causegastrointestinal symptoms ranging from mild dis-comfort to severe diarrhea when adults consume 10grams to 50 grams of the additive. Children may beaffected by even smaller amounts, according to theCSPI. Currently, the FDA requires a laxative noticeonly on the few products that may lead to the con-sumption of 50 grams or more of sorbitol daily,though some companies voluntarily label additionalproducts. \"The FDA should require a better label notice on sorbitol-containing products,\" said Michael Jacobson,PhD, executive director of CSPI. \"The FDA hasknown for years that sorbitol can cause severe diar-rhea. It's high time that the agency required a stronglabel notice on all products that might cause prob-lems.\" The group said that the warning was especially important before Halloween because so many candiescontain sorbitol. CSPI recommends that the labelsstate: \"NOTICE: This sorbitol, whichmay cause diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain.Not suitable for consumption by children. To protectyourself, start by eating no more than one serving at atime.\" \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

These products range from folic acid, whichis essential for cell growth and reproduction - andwhich has until now been most publicized for its rolein preventing neural tube birth defects - to B6, whichaids in the formation of many amino acids and sever-al neurotransmitters, and which now has been shownto reduce nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. A study funded by the FDA's Office of Women's Health has found that increasing folate, or folic acid, lev-els in women prior to conception may reduce the inci-dence of Down's syndrome, a genetic disorder that com-bines mental retardation with physical abnormalities. Thestudy, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutri- tion, found that mothers of babies with Down's syndrome often have the same genetic abnormality in folate metab-olism as that associated with the neural tube birth defectspina bifida, according to a statement from the PublicInformation Committee for the American Society forNutritional Sciences and the American Society for ClinicalNutrition. Mothers with the abnormality were 2.6 timesmore likely to have a child with Down's syndrome thanmothers without the genetic defect, the study found. Researchers for the University of Maryland (Balti- more) measured levels of homocysteine in the bloodof 167 women aged 15 to 44 who had suffered astroke, and also in 328 stroke-free controls. After fac-tors known to affects stroke risk, such as cigarettesmoking and socieoeconomic status, had beenaccounted for, women with the highest blood levels ofhomocysteine were 60% more likely to suffer a strokethan those with the lowest levels, the study showed. The report may indicate important opportunities for nutritional intervention, since folic acid and other B vita-mins are believed to lower blood levels of homocysteine.The next step is to embark on a study to see if stroke canbe prevented with high doses of B vitamins, said Dr.Steven Kittner, the study's lead researcher and professorof neurology, epidemiology and preventive medicine atthe University of Maryland School of Medicine. Another study, presented recently at the 68th annual meeting of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeonsof Canada, found still more good news related to B fami-ly intake, this time specifically with B6. The research sug-gested that taking a multivitamin containing at least 10milligrams of the vitamin before and after conceptionmay help reduce the severity of nausea and vomiting dur- ing pregnancy. Dr. Svetlana Emelianova and colleaguesfrom the Motherisk Program at the Hospital for Sick Chil-dren (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) conducted the study. Nandrolone still IOC-banned The heads of 27 International Olympic Committee (IOC)-accredited \"doping\" laboratories said after theirannual meeting recently that they had reaffirmed that theanabolic steroid nandrolone will remain on the IOC's listof banned substances, and urged governments to ban thesale, manufacture and imports of nutritional supplementsthat could contain banned substances. Several British ath-letes, including former world and Olympic sprint cham-pion Linford Christie, have tested positive for nandrolonebut have been cleared by the UK Athletics governingbody of taking performance-enhancing drugs. Severalathletes have questioned the reliability of drug testing,particularly for nandrolone. The lab chiefs, however, arestanding behind the effectiveness of the methods used todetect nandrolone. \"The use of anabolic steroids and relat-ed substances is prohibited by the IOC. Nandrolone andthe related substances norandrostenedione and noran-drostenediol are specifically included in the list of prohib-ited substances,'' the laboratory heads said. The Britishsports body is reportedly on a collision course with theInternational Amateur Athletics Federation, the sport'sworld governing body, over the nandrolone issue. The lab chiefs also called on all governments to clamp down on nutritional supplements that someexperts say may contain substances that produce orpromote nandrolone \"whether labeled or not.\" Extracts improve cholesterol levels Results from recent studies in the U.S. and Australia show extracts from rice bran and red clover extract mayprove to be new ammunition in the battle to keep cho-lesterol LDL levels low and HDL levels high. A study atthe K. L. Jordan Heart Research Foundation (Montclair,New Jersey) demonstrated that tocotrienol-rich vitaminE extracted from rice bran oil has been found to improvesignificantly total cholesterol levels in patients withhigh cholesterol. The extract reduced total cholesterol14.1% and LDL, or \"bad,\" cholesterol by 20.6%. It alsoraised HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol and lowered triglyc-eride levels. The researchers additionally saw a sub-stantial reduction in TBARS, a test that measures oxida-tion. The findings were published in September in theJournal of Environmental and Nutritional Interactions . \"Dietary change has met with limited success, andmany pharmaceuticals, although effective in modulat-ing cholesterol levels, are fraught with negative sideeffects. The tocotrienol-rich extract from rice bran oilappears to offer a safe and effective way to improve thecholesterol profile and reduce the risk of coronary heartdisease,\" said cardiologist Marvin Bierenbaum, directorof the K. L. Jordan foundation. \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

(Battle Creek, Michigan), a producer of vitamin-fortified foods for more than 50 years, hascalled for harmonized European rules on fortifiedfoods, saying disparate national laws create an unfairbarrier to trade in Europe's single market. The com-pany said it wants to take \"a leading role\" in the effortto standardize laws in the 15-nation European Union(EU) to allow manufacturers to sell their productswithout facing varying restrictions from country tocountry. Because standards are so different within theEU, it has been forced to tailor its recipes to individualmarkets, according to Kellogg. The wide variationsare both complex and unnecessary, according toAnne-Laure Gassin, the company's nutrition affairsmanager for Europe. \"We're here to satisfy consumerneeds and we want the ability to be able to add nutri-ents to foods in our markets and let the consumerchoose,\" Gassin said in an interview with Reutersnews services. Reuters reported that the European Commission is due to decide later this month whether to take theDutch government to the European Court of Justiceafter Kellogg complained its ban on breakfast cerealsfortified with folic acid, vitamin D and zinc was anillegal trade barrier. Gissin said restrictions such asthis get in the way of innovation because it blocksmarketing of a \"common brand profile\" across theentire European area. \"Our underlying philosophy isthat we've been adding nutrients to foods fordecades now because we believe it adds nutritionalvalue to the products and that's been confirmed byscience.\" Gissin chairs a committee within the Confedera- tion of the Food and Drink Industry of the EU, thatcommittee lobbying for the unified vitamin standards.Currently those standards range from highly restric-tive - in the Nordic countries - to extremely liberal -in Britain and Ireland. Gissin noted that attempts toget approval for mutual recognition of standardsamong these countries has failed and so a single stan-dard is required. She said that in order to achieve thatsingle standard, the food industry would be willing toconsider \"maximum levels\" of nutrients to satisfythose EU member states with the most stringent stan-dards.Metabolife on the offensive Rather than waiting for what it expects to be nega- tive publicity, Metabolife launched a PR offensive thismonth, criticizing a television report on its productbefore the piece aired. Metabolife International (SanDiego) posted on the Internet a videotape of an ABCNews \"20/20\" interview with its chief executive,Michael Ellis, and says it will spend at least $1.5 millionin advertising to call attention to the web site. Ellis saidhe is worried that the story - on its Metabolife supple-ment product - will be negative. Additionally, he saidthat such a report is a reaction by ABC to a lawsuit thecompany recently filed against an ABC affiliate. Ellissaid \"20/20\" requested the interview 10 days afterMetaboLife filed suit against WCVB-TV in Boston afterit ran a story about the alleged harmful side effects of thecompany's products. The story - and a potential nega-tive slant - would be a matter of \"retaliation\" for thatlegal action, Ellis said. ABC officials have rejected Ellis'accusations, saying that the report will be both objectiveand fair. A date for the story hasn't yet been released. Metabolife reportedly has hired the same lawyers and public relations firm that worked for Food Lion, aNorth Carolina-based supermarket, which won itscase against ABC News for a report on that company.In 1992, ABC's \"PrimeTime Live\" aired videos impli-cating the supermarket in selling spoiled food, usingas the basis for the story video taken secretly. Whole Foods spins off e-grocery business Natural foods store chain Whole Foods (Austin, Texas) said late last month that it will sell off its Inter-net grocery business. Whole Foods said it has alreadysold a 13.5% share in the venture and within the yearwill sell shares to the public. The company - to becalled WholePeople.com - will be led by Whole Foodsfounder John Mackey. Whole Foods operates in 20states and Washington, D.C., and, with more than 90stores, is considered the country's largest natural foodchain. Brands include Whole Foods Market, Bread &Circus, Bread of Life, Fresh Fields, Merchant of Vineand Wellspring Grocery. The company also has productlines in coffee roasting and nutritional supplements.

Galaxy on Amex, awaits FDA word on soy Galaxy Foods (Orlando, Florida), a producer of nutraceutical soy-based dairy and dairy-related alterna-tives, began trading on the American Stock Exchange onOct. 6 under the symbol GXY. The company already hasbeen traded as GALX on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Thecompany recently said it is expect FDA approval of ahealth claim for soy that will boost consumer acceptanceof a variety of new products: FDA announcement willfurther advance Galaxy's already popular line of soy-based dairy alternatives by increasing consumer aware-ness of soy foods. The new products, all high in soy pro-tein, are Veggie Milk, The Ultimate Smoothie and VeggieSoy Protein Powder. The FDA announcement is expect-ed to state that 25 grams of soy protein per day, includ-ed in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, mayreduce the risk of coronary heart disease. In order for asoy food product to make the claim, each serving mustcontain at least 6.25 grams of soy protein, or one-fourthof the daily requirement of 25 grams of soy protein. Angelo Morini, Galaxy's president and CEO, said that as the company approaches the year 2000, it\"plans to introduce a variety of new soy productsincluding sport and diet smoothies, protein mixes andprotein bars that will make a positive contribution toconsumers' health.\" \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.

The European Com-mission announced Oct. 11 that its Scientific Commit-tee on Food had expressed a favorable opinion on thesafety of products derived from the tomato. Zeneca had sought approval under the EU Novel Food Regu-lation for this tomato variety intended solely for pro-cessing. When ripe, the tomato softens less quicklythan its conventional counterparts, thus conferringbetter processing properties. The fruit is reported tobe unpalatable and therefore is not intended to beconsumed raw. It is processed, using heat treatment,for products like diced canned tomatoes, juice, andpuree. This heat treatment biologically inactivates themodified genes and their protein products. The committee concluded that, from the con- sumer health point of view, processed foods derivedfrom these tomatoes are as safe as products from con-ventional fruit. However, it also acknowledged that\"the question whether genetic modification results inmodification of the existing proteins cannot be totallyanswered. This question would apply equally to otherGM foods as well as to new strains developed by tra-ditional crosses not involving GM technology.\" TheEuropean Commission will take the opinion intoaccount in deciding on the conditions for the prod-uct's authorization, and on the labeling requirementsfor it. The product already is authorized in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the U.K., and it has alreadyreceived clearance from the EU's Scientific Committeeon Plants. But some EU member states have raisedobjections about marker genes it carries, and haveurged that the product should also be cleared throughthe EU's 1990 general rules on release of biotechnolo-gy products. Elsewhere in the product pipeline:Aquasearch (Kailua-Kona, Hawaii), a marine biotechnology company that develops and commer-cializes products from microalgae, has begun a safetyclinical trial of its astaxanthin-rich dietary supple-ment. Thirty volunteers will receive either the antici-pated recommended dose of the nutraceutical or adose that is five times higher, for a period of 28 days.The participants then will receive a series of physicalsProduct Briefsand clinical analyses to confirm that the product is safe. Astaxanthin's potential utility is as an antioxi-dant. It has demonstrated 100 times the antioxidantactivity of vitamin E and 10 times the activity of betacarotene in experimental models, Aquasearch said.The company expects to submit an application to theFDA for marketing allowance during the fourth quar-ter of this year. Prostatonin, a supplement distributed national- ly by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals ' (Ridgefield, Connecticut) Pharmaton Natural Health Products division, has proven in clinical trials to be safe and effective in helping men manage frequenturination, promoting normal urinary patterns andsupporting prostate health. The supplement containsproprietary, standardized cally shown to independently reduce urinary fre-quency during the day and night, reduce urgency andimprove urine flow, the company said. The extracts,approved for use in a number of European countriessince as early as 1988, inhibit the enzymes 5 alpha-reductase and aromatase, which affect testosteronemetabolism and prostate health. Bristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, New Jersey) has added Theragran Heart Right to its line of Thera-gran multivitamins. In addition to essential vitaminsand minerals, the new product has a combination ofmicronutrients that medical research suggests mayhave cardiovascular benefits: vitamins selenium and magnesium. CV Technologies (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) said the FDA has cleared its investigational new drugapplication for a formal Phase II study of its leadherbal extract product, CVT-E002, a multicomponentphytopharmaceutical extracted from North Americanginseng. The product is intended for use as a prophy-lactic against acute respiratory infection in the coldand flu market. The clinical project is expected tobegin in October and will be conducted through theEastern Virginia Medical School. The investigationalnew drug application is the company's first, CV said. The Daily Wellness Company (Mountain View, California) has released results of a double-blind,placebo-controlled clinical study of ArginMax forMale Sexual Fitness, a nutritional supplement forenhancement of sexual performance. The data werescheduled to be presented Sept. 28 at a meeting of theAmerican Urological Association in Carmel, Califor-nia. The study used the International Index of ErectileFunction and was performed in collaboration withphysicians affiliated with the University of Hawaii School of Medicine (Honolulu, Hawaii) and Albany Medical College (Albany, New York). Following a four-week daily regimen of ArginMax, the Daily Well-ness Company said, 87.5% of the men demonstratedimproved ability to maintain an erection during sexu- al intercourse, while 75% of the men reportedimproved satisfaction with their overall sex life. Therewere no reported side effects. ArginMax is based onthe observation that certain botanical extracts mayfacilitate the conversion of the amino acid L-arginineinto nitric oxide, a molecule involved in circulation,erection and arousal. The supplement contains L-argi-nine, ginseng, ginkgo, antioxidants and a multivita-min. The Daily Wellness Company also makes a for-mulation designed to improve sexual performance inwomen. A study at the K. L. Jordan Heart Research Foundation (Montclair, New Jersey) demonstratedthat tocotrienol-rich vitamin E extracted from ricebran oil has been found to improve significantly totalcholesterol levels in patients with high cholesterol.The extract reduced total cholesterol 14.1% and LDL,or \"bad,\" cholesterol by 20.6%. It also raised HDL, or\"good,\" cholesterol and lowered triglyceride levels.The researchers additionally saw a substantial reduc-tion in TBARS, a test that measures oxidation. Thefindings were published in September in the Journal of Environmental and Nutritional Interactions . The five- year, placebo-controlled clinical trial, expected to becompleted by the end of 1999, involved 50 blindedsubjects diagnosed with stenosis of the carotid artery.Eastman Chemical Company (Kingsport, Tennessee), maker of NuTriene tocotrienols derived from ricebran oil, has been donating supplements to the heartresearch facility for the past two years. Pharma Green has launched a $1 million adver- tising campaign to promote Gum Tech Internation- al's (Phoenix, Arizona) Double Gum line of eight functional chewing gums in Israel. One of the high-lights of the campaign, according to Pharma GreenGeneral Manager Motti Cohen, will be the launch ofGum Tech's Children's Dental Gum in cooperationwith McDonald's, which will include pieces of thegum in its kid's meals. Pharma Green, the functionalfood division of the Pharm Up Group, a conglomerateof pharmaceutical and health product distributors inIsrael and abroad, has been distributing functionalgums that have been exclusively developed and man-ufactured for it by Gum Tech since September 1998. Pycnogenol, a nutritional supplement extract- ed from the bark of the French maritime pine tree(Pinus maritimus ) and distributed exclusively in North America by Henkel Nutrition and Health Group , has been shown in a study to significantly reduce platelet aggregation, which can lead to heartattack and stroke. The study compared the product toaspirin, long-term use of which may lead to sideeffects such as stomach problems and increasedbleeding time. Thirty-eight smokers at the Universi- ty of Munster (Munster, Germany) and the Universi- ty of Arizona (Tucson, Arizona) were given either a \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae. Unauthorized photocopying or distribution is strictly prohibited by law.OCTOBER 1999 Nutraceutical Business ReportPage 11single dose of 100 milligrams to 120 milligrams of Pycnogenol or 500 milligrams of aspirin, then wereinstructed to smoke so as to increase platelet aggre-gation. Within two hours after smoking, the effects ofthe two products in reducing platelet clumping werethen measured. A single dose of Pycnogenol provedas effective as the aspirin dose five times its size, andPycnogenol did not increase bleeding time. \"Ourresearch shows that Pycnogenol is a safe and naturaloption, especially for those who cannot tolerate theadverse effects of aspirin,\" said Ronald Watson, PhD,a professor of public health research at the Universi- ty of Arizona School of Medicine (Tucson) and one of the study's lead authors. The product, a water-sol-uble flavonoid complex, also has demonstratedantioxidant properties. The study was published in arecent issue of Thrombosis Research . Novogen (Sydney, Australia) said its Rimostil dietary supplement increased bone density and HDLcholesterol levels in a nine-month clinical study of 50postmenopausal women. Rimostil, derived fromisoflavins (plant estrogens), increased cortical bonemass an average 4% after six months. It also raisedHDL levels an average 28%, restoring women to pre-menopausal levels, Novogen said. The productshowed none of the side effects often associated withhormone replacement therapy, such as bleeding andhot flashes, according to Graham Kelly, chairman andfounder of Novogen. The study results were present-ed in New York at the annual conference of the NorthAmerican Menopause Society. Kelly said he expectsthe company to launch the dietary supplement world-wide in 2000. Nutrition for Life International (Houston, Texas) has launched Kholesterol Blocker, a chewable,soybean-derived phytosterol dietary supplement tar-geted at heart health-conscious consumers. Phytos-terols, or plant sterols, are almost identical to choles-terol in molecular structure, according to DavidBertrand, Nutrition for Life's president, and have become popular since several research studies havedocumented their ability to maintain healthy choles-terol levels. \"The body can't tell the difference[between cholesterol and phytosterol],\" Bertrand said.\"Thus, the phytosterols compete for and attach toabsorption sites, resulting in regulated cholesterol lev-els in the blood.\" Phytosterols up to now have mostoften been added to margarines, or sold as tablets thatmust be taken 30 minutes prior to mealtime. Kholes-terol Blocker, however, is taken at the beginning ofeach meal, three times daily. Each tropical-flavoredtablet contains400 milligrams of phytosterols. PharmaPrint (Irvine, California), a developer of dietary supplements, functional foods and pharma-ceuticals from natural plant extracts, andHealthQuick.com , an Internet health care site, have signed an agreement under which the latter will dis-tribute PharmaPrint's new line of combination vita-min/herbal products containing biloba, ginseng, saw palmetto and John'swort. HealthQuick.com also will carry product infor-mation on PharmaPrint's other proprietary products. The Quigley Corporation (Doylestown, Penn- sylvania), a natural health and homeopathic drugcompany, has increased the national distribution net-work for its BodyMate nutrition and weight man-agement program. The company plans to launch aradio advertising campaign in early January to fur-ther support expanded distribution. BodyMatelozenges are all-natural and nutritional and containgarcinia cambogia and chromium polynicotinate forweight management. The program also includesweight maintenance suggestions, food recommenda-tions and exercise guidelines. Quigley said that 90%of the 74 retailers at the Vitamin, Diet and NutritionConference, held in late August in West Palm Beach,Florida, agreed to carry BodyMate throughout theupcoming year. \u00a9 Copyright 1999 by American Health Consultants\u00ae.
