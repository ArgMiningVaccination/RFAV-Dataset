On the morning of March 12, 2020 Beijing time, WHO ocially identied it as a pandemic1. Up to June 15, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept over 200 countries and territor ies, resulting in more than 7.6 million conrmed cases and over 0.42 million coronavirus-caused pneumoniahasapowerfulinfectiousforceforsomepopulationgro ups,anduptonownospecic drugscouldcureit( 5,6). Since the novel pneumonia outbreak, China National Health Co mmittee issued seven editions of diagnosis and medical treatment plan3. More than 40,000 medical stas including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors from all over the country were called up to Wuhan, and other citiesinHubeiprovincestotreatpatients4.Theepidemicsituationdisplaysagoodtrendaftersevere preventionandcontrolinChina5. In the 7th edition of diagnosis and medical treatment plan iss ued by National Health Commission (NHC) of China, many TCM remedies are recommende d for COVID-19 patients in medical observation period. Huo Xiang Zheng Qi capsule is rec ommended for patients when thereisclinicalmanifestationof\"fatigueaccompaniedbyg astrointestinaldiscomfort\";andJinHua Qing Gan granule, Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule, and Shu Feng Jie Du ca psule are recommended for patients when fatigue with fever occur. According to a new s release from the National Administration of TCM, the integration of traditional Chine se and Western medical treatment canachievesatisfactoryresultsforresolutionofsymptoms ofCOVID-196. In the medicine eld of China, there is always a dispute between the modern medicine and the traditional medicine for a long time. The pros and cons of d ebate have its own perspective and opinion. We are pleased to see that in the face of severe epide mic situation, there are mixed teams of modern medicine doctors and TCM doctors. The majori ty of COVID-19 patients in China have been treated with integrated Chinese and modern m edicine. Hundreds of herbal remedies have been used throughout the country ( 7). The Chinese government and academic experts in herbal medicine have recommended incorporating TC M into conventional treatment methodssoastogeneratesynergisticeectbythecombinatio Medicine Treatment on COVID-19 Unfortunately, the experience of TCM in the treatment of epidemic situation has not been widely recognized and used for reference in the western Occident developed countries. The lack of high-quality scientic evidence may be one of important reason that would lead to reject. Another fundamental reason is that the whole theory system of TCM is not acknowledged by western-trained audience. It might be due to dierent culture, more specically, dierent treatment philosophy. TCM has its strong material base from single monomeric compounds to Chinese herb extracts in COVID-19 treatment. Psychosocial pharmacologi cal eect probably plays an important role in the traditional medicine( 8). SowhatistheexactlytreatmentphilosophyinTCMcultureto thenovelcoronavirusdisease? Chinese public in general are always long taught that TCM is a national quintessence with an ancient historical origi n. In additiontoTCM,PekingOpera,martialarts,andcalligraphyar e well-knownasthe\"fourquintessenceofChina\"bothathomea nd abroad. National quintessence itself is more related with c ulture and social custom than with natural science. TCM has been played an indispensable role in the prevention and treatment of epidemicdiseasesinhistory.DuringtheSARSepidemicin2003, the intervention of TCM has also achieved therapeutic eect ( 9, 10). In the broad and profound TCM theory system, the present COVID-19isjustoneofcommonepidemics.EvenCOVID-19is brand new emerging severe infectious disease caused by a bra nd new coronavirus and no specic drug is used to cure in modern medicine,TCMstillhascondencetoghttheepidemic. InTCMcultureperspective,COVID-19isanepidemicdisease caused by an epidemic evil with dampness and heat, which is called Li-Qi in Chinese ( 11). After Li-Qi invades the human body, it enters the lung rst to make the Lung-Qi (vital essen ce of lung, which is in charge of breath function) stagnate, the n leadabnormalbreathmovement,phlegm-heataccumulationan d block,andnallybringoutthedeadYinandthedeadYang( 12). According to TCM treatment philosophy, dampness should be eliminated rst, and then heat be cleared away. After heat an d phlegmareclearedaway,thebodyisrestoredtonormalfuncti on atlast(13). There seems to be something in common between virus and Li-Qi. Both think that there is an external cause of disease. Modern medicine refer it virus, they usually hope to nd specic drug to cure the disease. However, TCM does not know microbiology and could not capture the virus entity, they could only focus on Li-Qi-induced symptom with herbal remedies. The aim of TCM treatment is simple, so long as TCMremedies provide eective way to regulate functional disorder s of the human body. Therefore, TCM remedies are used to detoxify poisonous dampness and heat, to strengthen body to resist pathogenic factor, to adjust the harmony of the interna l relationship of the human body. That is to say, when TCM doctors treat this kind of disease, they do not have to make the causecleartostart.Itisofimportancetosolvethesymptomsf or mostpatients. A small, non-randomized, single center retrospective observational study reported a shorter average duration of viral shedding and faster resolution of radiological pneumo nia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients prescribed Jin Hua Qing Gan granules for more than 2 days as compared with those receiving conventional care ( 14). The potential ecacy of this herbal medicine for COVID-19 treatment should be further investigatedinadequatelypoweredrandomizedcontrolledt rials. The understanding and description of TCM is based on the ancientmacrounderstandingofnatureandtheuseofspeculati ve philosophy such as Yin-Yang.
