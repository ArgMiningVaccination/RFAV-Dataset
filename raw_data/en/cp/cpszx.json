The Community Partnership in AIDS, in cooperation with the Harvey Milk U s- bian/Gay Democratic Club, has called for an economic boycott of KQED television, San Francisco's public television station, for what the groups say is a misuse of the public funds used to produce public programming.

Religious op\u00ad ponents to the b ill were reported to be con\u00ad templating challenges in the courts and at the polls. P rior to last week's March 20 successful vote, opponents of the gay rights bill had managed to prevent it emerging from a city council committee for 12 years. The bill bans discrimination because of sexual orientation in housing, employment and public accom\u00ad modations. The threat of a city-wide referendum on gay rights appears remote, according to Allen Roskofs, a long time New York Gay Democratic Club activist. \" It 's my understanding that there can't be a referen\u00ad dum ,\" said Roskofs, who noted that referen\u00ad dums are only permitted in New York regar\u00ad ding amendments to the C ity's charter. \" You can't have a referendum on a change in law of the administrative code.\" Roskofs added that he doubted that a successful challenge to the law could be pursued in the courts, since the council bill appears to supplement and not contradict existing New York State law in regard to anti-discrimination protection. \" It 's about time that we had something to be happy about,\" remarked veteran gay ac\u00ad tivist David Thorstad. \" The New York gay b ill was the first one ever submitted in the en\u00ad tire country. . . .

The most outspoken opponents of this legislation have been religious leaders, p rim a rily C a rd in a l Terence C ooke and his successor. C ard in al John O 'C onnor. They represent Rom an Catholicism at its vilest: hierarchical, compassionless, rigid and h yp ocritical. The centuries old b attle to separate C hurch and state con\u00ad tinues into the 80's, w ith preachers and cardinals m eddling and m oraliz\u00ad ing in the p olitical arena. P a rtic u la rly grating to gay people is the b latant hypocricy of these righteous clerics. As a recent/4</voci7/f' article stated, \"H o w dare the C hurch condemn hom osexuality and obstruct gay/lesbian c ivil rights struggles w hile to lerating the sexual shenanigans o f its male clergy?\" Last June, reporters A rth u r Jones and Jason B e rry published a scathing report in the National Catholic Reporter on the increasing num ber o f priests charged w ith sexual offenses in vo lvin g underage boys. T h e ir findings chronicle a massive cover-up and huge fin an c ial payments by church officials. H ighlights o f the report include; A m onsignor in San Diego who personally paid an a lta r boy and his fa m ily $75,000 to preclude fu rth e r court costs after the priest was charged w ith taking sexual lib erties w ith the boy. A sem inarian who was paid $15,000 by the diocese when he claimed th at he was forced to leave the sem inary after m aking com plaints about hom osexual activity between priests and the students. \u00ab A priest whose m eandering w hile chaplain to a Boy Scout troupe cost the C hurch and its insurers $4.2 m illio n in out-of-court settlements to six o f his victim s and fam ilies. Suits s till pending seek damages in excess o f $100 m illio n . A boy who died in 1979 follow ing a suicide attem pt w hich occured after he had been allegedly abused by a member o f the Franciscan Brothers o f the Poor. The New Y o rk Supreme C ourt ruled that the parents of the boy could not press a $10.5 m illio n suit against the O rd er. John Cooney's biography o f Francis C ard inal Spellm an was edited to exclude details o f the prelate's \" rich and eclectic gay sex life \" due to pressure from C atho lic hierarchs and prom inent laym en. W ith an estim ated 30 to 40 percent of the clergy gay. and m any o f these men sex\u00ad u a lly active, one cannot but wonder how the Roman C hurch continues to glue together its perverse theology and ignore a re a lity older than Jesus. Thousands of closeted clerics lead double lives w hile publicly perpetuating the straight celibate m yth. M oney fro n Sunday's collection goes toward mem bership in the C lub Baths. Priests who attem pt to be honest are squelched. G ay Jesuit theologian John M cN eil authored The Church and the Homosexual in 1975. He criticised Church teaching, was silenced by order fro m the Vatican and m ay not speak to the media. In San Francisco, Archbishop John Q uinn refused to accept a frank report by the Task Force on Gay/Lesbian Issues in 1982 and disbanded the group. The G ay M en 's Chorus was not allowed to perform at St. Ig \u00ad natius C hurch, where gay clergy celebrate Mass d a ily. The archdiocese broke another contract w ith the Chorus at St. Boniface Church. C ould not Church funds be better spent feeding the poor than buying out con\u00ad tracts and barring songs? Perhaps the real m iracle is that slow ly, b it by b it, gay people continue to win pitched battles. New Y o rk jo ins 50 other cities that have enacted gay rights legislation. Despite John Q uinn, domestic partnership legisla\u00ad tio n w ill one day be a reality in San Francisco. Fo r those who choose to believe, victories outshine hypocrisy.

Stringent eligibility requirements for welfare and food stamps, discrimina\u00ad tion by private welfare agencies, and the fact that Glide Church and other on-site feeding programs close weekend evenings have resulted in hundreds going hungry on weekend evenings. We feed mostly indigent men who are at high risk of a lethal disease where malnutrition is a critical co\u00ad factor. Despite fears of disease and ar\u00ad rest, many are driven to prostitution. Because most of their clients have been driven away by fear of AIDS, these men don't get much income, but pres\u00ad ent hunger is a stronger motivation than fear of future disease or arrest, so they still hang out on Polk Street. Our soup line has been in operation for several weeks. You are invited to drop by and see what we are doing andEditorial Do we need priests looking over our shoulders?

This process will be open to the public during the week of April 7 through April It from 4-6 pm. The interviews will be held in the Board of Education Office, Room 209, of the San Fran\u00ad cisco Unified School District Building, at 1 .15 Van Ness Avenue. Anyone interested in these interviews should call Mary Martin, administrativewhv. Rev. Donald Jackson assistant in public information and school operations, at 565-9411 or 565-9412. The public will not be allowed make any statements or ask questions of the candidates. It is crucial, however, that the gay and lesbian community be re\u00ad presented at these interviews to demonstrate our concern and to moni\u00ad tor how candidates respond to ques\u00ad tions. The Superintendent will be a major force in charting the course for the San Francisco Public Schools for years to come. If we hope to further the rights of sexual minority youth and create a supportive school en\u00ad vironment for sexual m inority students and teachers alike, we should not miss this opportunity. The new Superintendent should be an individ\u00ad ual who demonstrates an awareness of and commitment to address sexual minority issues.

The young black man sitting on the edge of the bed in a Cleveland hotel room is articulate, even eloquent, about his predicament. Fabian Bridges, a notorious figure in the m edia's m anip ulatio n o f the A ID S crisis \u2014 and the sub\u00ad ject o f public television's F ro n tlin e docum entary Tuesday night, is describing his treatm ent in a C leveland ja il. Arrested on a m isdem eanor charge, B ridges made a p o in t o f info rm ing the deputy in charge th a t he had recently been diagnosed w ith A ID S . Bridges wasn't mistreated in ja il; he wasn't throw n in to the tank w ith other inmates who, if th e y'd learned about his illness \u2014 and the deputy stro ngly im plied they m ight \u2014 w ould have probably k ille d him . H e was, however, held in iso latio n, the same way he was isolated fro m the society th at plac\u00ad ed him under sentence o f death. \" It was beyond slavery,\" Bridges says q u ie tly o f his experience. F o r m any viewers, like Dave Ford (see below), Bridges comes across as a \" demented\" sexual c rim in a l, g u ilty o f spreading a fa tal contagion to his unsuspecting clients (Bridges turned to hustling to m ake a livin g when he was broke). B ut le t's exam ine his op\u00ad tions. Bridges wasn't as lucky as some people who are diagnosed w ith A ID S , people who have the in fo r\u00ad m ation, the support, o r ju st the in \u00ad tu itio n to take th eir m edical p ro \u00ad blems in to th e ir own hands. Bridges bought into w hat his doc\u00ad tors to ld him , w hat his fa m ily thought they knew fo r a fact, w hatthe m edia m indlessly reinforced \u2014 that because o f his diagnosis, he would probably be dead in a m at\u00ad ter o f months. It was a self- fu lfillin g prophecy, and the real \" tragedy\" of the story is th at it didn't have to happen to Fabian Bridges, any more than it had to happen to the thousands o f suf\u00ad ferers w ho have already been con\u00ad demned to an early death. Jason Serinus' rep o rt on the altern a tive A ID S treatm ent panels, on page 7 o f this issue, tells the other side o f the story. M en like Jay B ald w in and Bobby Reynolds have dem onstrated th a t ju st because a disease is life-threatening doesn't mean it can't be overcome. This is an unwelcome message to m any people, and not ju st members of the F a r R ight. F a r too many o f us have a vested interest, fin an c ially, p o litic a lly , o r just em o tio n ally, in believing what we're to ld about A ID S by the \" ex\u00ad perts.\" A nd more o f us than our o ffic ia l spokesmen w ould lik e to adm it are victim s of the same pat\u00ad tern o f th in kin g as Fabian Bridges \u2014 sexual kam ikazes, these men have received a \" fa ta l\" diagnosis, and have decided to take as many down w ith them as they can. If they can do it by sexual contact is there any scientific evidence th a t's the case \u2014 they w ill. B ut in B ridges' case, as in so many others, we should ask ourselves: W ho are the real crim inals, pro\u00ad miscuous men at risk o r the au th o rities who haven't given them any w ay out? Coinmentary D ave Ford The Burnt Out Case of Fabian Bridges An untitled 35-minute documentary about a black, gay, 29-year-old A ID S sufferer who was rejected by his fam ily and who refused safe-sex advice from Houston city officials and doctors has proven to be the stick that stirred the snake pit of gay community concern. As of press time (Tuesday morning), a host of San Francisco politicians and health officials \u2014 and one person diagnosed with A ID S \u2014 had pulled out of a scheduled two-hour KQ ED \" Frontline\" satellite-hookup four-city phone-in program, during which the conroversial film was be shown. K Q E D officials were scampering to polish th e ir tarnished and fast\u00ad fading image, and the gay com\u00ad m unity pulled together in a show of so lid a rity one observer recently said he has not seen-\" since the Briggs In itia tiv e \" in 1977. Since its onset, the A ID S epidemic has had a stone-in-the- pool effect. From the first-splashsuspicion and paranoia a ll aimed at the so-called \" high ris k \" groups: gay men and intravenous drug users. A n d now, into this potentially explosive heap of conflicting issues comes the Fabian Bridges story. A Boston-based camera crew follows Bridges from his diagnosis in Houston to rejection at the hands o f his fam ily in Indianapolis, to Cleveland and back to Houston, where Bridges freely admits engag\u00ad ing in \" unsafe\" sex \u2014 and hustling fo r money \u2014 despite his A ID S diagnosis. The docum entary, which attem pts to chronicle the p olitical, legal, and m oral dilemmas faced by city, health and law officials, con\u00ad fronted by a man w ho is a public nuisance at best, a k ille r at worst,about\" betrays the film m akers' distorted perspective and lack of jo urnalistic equilibrium . This im \u00ad balance, in fact, is at the core o f protests sw irling around the film . By strict definition, this is a jo u r\u00ad nalistic piece about one man's story \u2014 and that man happens to be an am oral, self-serving crim inal who has A ID S and is happy to spread it (just as he's happy to spread the m anure o f his false emotions whenever the camera is clicked on). A n d arg u ab ly, docum entarists report on situations and are not o b lig a te d to p re p a re an d disseminate propaganda. But this piece is so slanted that, fo r the unaware and unsophisticated, an \" A ID S sufferer\" is suddenly a thoughtless sub-human capable o f The documentary winds up being racist^ homophobic, and a textbook example of shoddy, self serving and biased journalism. trageUy of personal loss and death, to the widening ripples o f communi\u00ad ty factionalison, p olitical band\u00ad wagon jum ping, threats o f mand- to ry A ID S testing and possible quarantine, mass hysteria and m edia m anipulation, the disease has opened a Pandora's Box o f public policy confusion, right-wing finger-pointing, and befuddlement.instead winds up being racist, homophobic, and a textbook exam\u00ad ple o f shoddy, self-serving and bias\u00ad ed journalism . T o begin w ith, Bridges is a sad example. True, he suffers from a most frightening disease and, true, he suffers at the hands of the police departm ent and fa m ily ignorance. Arrested fo r stealing a bicycle, Bridges is locked up in an isolation cell, but later says th a t as a result of the hum iliatio n o f his ordeal, \" I f I had the power to transm it the disease |to my captors) 1 would have done it, then sat back and laughed.\" This is a responsible sympathetic man? A n d although his brother-in-law claim s he d idn't w ant Bridges at home \" w ith this lit \u00ad tle brat running around\" (referring' to a little g jrl sitting in his lap), and although Bridges' m other holds his $1,800 disability check because she wants money fo r his funeral (\" I d id n 't know if he was going to die o r w hat\" ), nonetheless Bridges and his kin ham shamelessly for the cameras, enacting a sort of inner- c ity Loud fam ily. T h is is less an em- pathetic p o rtrayal o f blood relatives ripped apart by disease than it is a peek into an already fractured fam i\u00ad ly ; and since we get little insight in to the fa m ily dynamics per se, we never know w hether Bridges' rejec\u00ad tio n is a result o f A ID S , o r if it 's ju s t another in a long line of fa m ily spats centering around what one begins to perceive as the fam ily con man. Fo r the documentary to im p ly that this is \" w hat A ID S is allmangling life and lim b, o f wreaking medical and m oral havoc in Your- town, U S A . This, o f course, is lunacy; the film m akers could have included disclaimers at the beginning and end o f the film , o r could have p ur\u00ad sued a more general story showing the rage o f A ID S sufferers, from theFabian Bridgeses to people w ith A ID S livin g forceful, positive lives. But they d id n 't, and instead allo w \u00ad ed this bucket of blood to seep into homes nationwide. It m ight have been different if the film m akers retained a speck o f jo u r\u00ad nalistic c red ib ility \u2014 but they didnot. jo u rn alistic ob\u00ad jec tivity fly out the window when the camera crew buys Bridges food, laundry help \u2014 and a radio, to which we see Bridges listening as he bops up and down the Houston streets. La ter, they offer Bridges $15 a night on the condition \" that he not use the money to go to the baths, and th at he find a hotel room .\" Thus, medium becomes m oralist; reporter becomes p ro \u00ad vid er. T h is incestuous p alm \u00ad greasing renders Bridges' pouty and self-pitying hotel room monologues less than m oving or believable, and leaves the film m akers wide open to charges o f buying a story. Granted, the film m akers faced a tough m oral dilemma: having learned that the already-diagnosed Bridges is s till engaging in unsafe sex w hile hustling, they feel obligated to report him to city o f\u00ad ficials. Fine \u2014 but at that point they should have dropped the story, closed down the project, and called it a day. Or they should have said nothing and continued to report the story. B ut to leap in to the fray, cameras w hirling, and have a distinct effect on the outcome, and to continue \" reporting\" the story betrays an appalling lack o f distance and objectivity which are the hallm arks o f decent jo urnalism . The film also suffers from glaring lack o f context. Who is Fabian Bridges? How long has he been gay? How did he come out? H ow did his fam ily handle it? H ow did he live his life up to this point?

Wednesday, gay San Francisco Supervisor H a rry B ritt came out in favo r of a boycott, which local ac\u00ad tivists say they would like to expand to other cities across the country. Debate centered on the nation\u00ad wide broadcast Tuesday o f a Frontline series documentary e n titl\u00ad ed \" A ID S : A N ational In q u iry .\" The documentary chronicles the story of a gay man who refused to cooperate w ith health authorities in th e ir attempts to protect the health of hi.s potential sexual contacts. Fabian Bridges, a black man, diagnosed w ith A ID S , died last fall. D uring his ordeal, a M inneapolis, M in n , news team followed him from Cleveland to Houston where they supported him financially and produced news stories o f his refusal to h alt unsafe sexual practices. Follow ing the 35 m inute film , Frontline sponsored a panel discus\u00ad sion between public health experts, gay com m unity representatives, politicians and two men diagnosed w ith A ID S , in a national satellite link-up carried on public television stations. Locally, representatives of the gay com m unity refused to sit on the panel and condemned the station fo r broadcasting the documentary C ritics charge that the case presen\u00ad ta tio n o f B rid g e s ' s to ry m isrepresents im p o rtan t public health policy questions and panders to public homophobia. A s a result, the gay com m unity has rallied to call K Q E D and the n a tio n a l p u b lic b ro ad casting system, to account fo r what groups call a misuse o f the power of the press. O rganizing began a fu ll week before the broadcast and continued even yesterday, the day follow ing the presentation. \" The film was even worse than I thought,\" said Laurie M cBride, coordinator o f the C om m unity Partnership and form er board president of the Golden Gate Business Association follow ing a pre-screening. \" The public media should be especially responsive,\" she maintained. \" Since the com m unity heard about this presentation there has been activity. There is u n ity in the gay and lesbian com m unity about this kind o f tragedy; we w ill not ac\u00ad cept this kind o f dehum anization o r victim izatio n.\"Supervisor H a rry B ritt condemn\u00ad ed the broadcast, branding K Q E D as \" irresponsible\" fo r airing a pro\u00ad gram he said did not include input from the gay com m unity o r other communities affected by A ID S . The indictm ent was o f us,\" B ritt said. \" Am erica does not need to be debating quarantine; quaran\u00ad tine is im m oral and should not be debated.\" Reggie W illiam s, A ID S Educa\u00ad tion C oo rd inator fo r the local chapter o f Black and W hite M en Together, and a scheduled panelist, walked o ff K Q E D 's set for the local organization o f the post-film discus\u00ad sion, which included panels in three other cities. Incensed, W illiam s said, \" I th in k that they did more harm to public health than anything.\" He had been asked to participate as the o nly black panelist. Producers o f Frontline say the film was chosen fo r airing as a catalyst fo r discussing im p o rtant issues raised by A ID S , and p ar\u00ad ticularly the issues of ind ivid ual rights and social responsibility. Frontline Executive E d ito r Lou W iley explained to the Sentinel that the film was the story of a man re\u00ad jected by society who \" fends fo r him selT' and continues to have sex despite his A ID S diagnosis. \" I thought even w ithin a group of people th at don't have a p ar\u00ad ticular p o litic al concern that the gay com m unity looks pertty good in this film even if this particular in \u00ad dividual doesn't,\" W iley said. \" It 's a very strong story and it tells us a lo t about ourselves as a society,\" he added. W iley said Frontline has never held a panel discussion before. \" You can argue that we shouldn't have had a film in this case, o r that we should have a very tame and careful film , but I 'm not so sure that this is a subject that doesn't w arrant a powerful story to bring home to people how serious it is.\" Controversy also stemmed from the fact th at television reports of Fabian Bridges had been condemn\u00ad ed by media reviewers, and critics questioned whether the subject should have been revisited by the makers o f the documentary at all. In p articular, B W M T 's W illia m s said he feared the presentation might give whites a negative im pres\u00ad sion of blacks. Presentation of the film also frustrated activists w orking on the state legislative level, who have said that a biased presentation could in \u00ad fluence votes on controversial measures. According to legislative assistant C hris Bowman, there are\" panic\" b ills still pending in Sacramento. \" Some o f these b ills are one vote shy o f passing,\" Bowman said. Bowman's gay con\u00ad s e rv a tiv e c lu b .

Damage was done tonight,\" he said follow ing a pre\u00ad screening picked up three hours earlier fro m a satellite broadcast at a P olk Street bar. Bowman compared the film w ith crying \" fire \" in a crowded theater, insisting th at the boycott was not an attack on free speech. In a b rief press conference members o f C om m unity P artner\u00ad ship gave b rief statements fo rm a lly announcing th eir support fo r a boycott and vowing to gain more access to program m ing at K Q E D . \" I don't th in k any com m unity should take over public broad\u00ad casting,\" emphasized H arvey M ilk Democratic C lub President Rick Pacurer, who was not at the press conference, \" I think public broad\u00ad casting should be sensitive to our needs. It can be safely said that that program last night is going to result in some deaths.\" P acurer's group d istrib uted leaflets in gay areas o f the city and said response to the call fo r a boycott had been good. But K Q E D and Frontline pro\u00ad ducers th in k the call fo r a boycott was inappropriate. H ours before airing the show, K Q E D president Tony Tiano held a press con\u00ad ference, announcing, \"Frontline believes \" Fabian's S to ry\" w ill lead to a vigorous debate over the balan- P ic k e te rs o u ts id e K Q E D o ffices stud io s th e a fte rn o o n o f th e F ro n tlin e a irin gcing of individual c ivil rights against society's need to be protected.\" Tiano announced that K Q E D had made the decision to a ir gay\u00ad positive programming to balance the presentation and w ould open a slot on KQ ED-FM fo r further discussion of the program . B ritt had harsh words fo r the presentation: \" It was a catalyst for discussing whether gay people should be punished fo r spreading A ID S . It was not about w hat to do about A ID S . \" Public broadcasting brings us c ultu ral programming that we enjoy and th at's fine. B ut in the city of San Francico, public T V should do more. \" Right now lesbians and gay men are in the process o f teaching the w orld how to deal w ith us. Public television has been a very elite seg\u00ad ment of our society. It is not responsive to who we are and it has not been responsive to o ur lives.\" I t 's not clear w hether a boycott would be either effective in meeting goals o f the gay com m unity, or damaging to K Q E D . Sources w ithin the gay com m unity have said that K Q E D reacts strongly to questions about its funding base. Gay representatives also feel that there is a large K Q E D viewership and subscriber base in the gay com\u00ad m unity. Prom oters o f the boycott have specifically asked the public not to pledge K ()E D subscriptions, an im \u00ad portant source o f funds fo r the broadcaster; K Q E D President Tiano said he knows o f no precident fo r a subscription boycott. Questions remain though, as to whether the gay leadership, which is perceived as having been preoc\u00ad cupied w ith the A ID S crisis, w ill be able to mount an effective boycott campaign. Reports indicate that the critical view of the broadcast is not necessarily universal among gays and lesbians. A significant element in the boycott package seems to be the ap\u00ad parent consensus between gay organizations, including support from the three San Francisco gay D em o c ra tic c lub s, th e gay Republican club.

T o purp o rt to paint a p o rtrait o f a man, to report \" one man's story,\" and to do it w ithout answering \u2014 much less asking \u2014 these back\u00ad ground questions b etrays a shallowness which ultim ately sinks the project. The film winds up noting th at Bridges died o f a coma and was buried in a pauper's grave in Houston. The silent shot of the muddy p lot is m oving in its way, but the gesture is too little , too late: where, w ith fa ir and subtle repor\u00ad ting, the image m ight suggest a life broken by rejection, prejudice, bigotry, hom ophobia, and general social fears and th e ir sanctions, in this case it sim ply elicits a disgusted \" good rid d a n c e \" fro m the nauseated viewer. In a closing monologue recorded in his Cleveland hotel room . Bridges says, \" Let me go down in history as 'I am somebody. So\u00ad meone w ho's respected. Someone who's appreciated. Someone who can be related to .' \" Though his desires touch us. Bridges, request assaults a viewer weary from abusive jo urnalism and am oral on\u00ad screen behavior, and reminds him of two others who im p lic itly had the same request: M a rk David Chap\u00ad man and John H inkley.

The first panel, held at the W om en's B uild ing on Tuesday of last week, featured Shirley B . Scott, M .D ., a practitioner o f general medicine and integrated holistic health fo r over 18 years, based at M arshall H a ll M em orial H ospital; M isha Cohen, C .A ., acupuncturist, Chinese herbalist, a senior pro\u00ad fessor of acupuncture and oriental medicine. D irecto r of Q uan Y in Acupuncture and Herb Center, and a m otivating force behind the SF A ID S A lte rn ative H ealing Project; and this w rite r. The first panel began w ith a pro\u00ad posal that we, as hum an beings composed o f mind, body, and sp irit, must examine A ID S on a ll three levels in order to fu lly unders\u00ad tand its nature. As every speaker noted, a ll illness represents an im \u00ad balance o f energy which exists on more than the physical level. Con\u00ad tra ry to the \" new\" theories of allopathic medicine, which perceive disease as m ainly a physical p h en o m en o n m a n ife s tin g as \" symptoms,\" holistic practitioners lo ok fo r the roots of disease, not o nly in the physical body, b u t in the mental and sp iritu al disharm ony of the in d ivid u al. It is in an in d ivid u al's psychospiritual dishar\u00ad m ony \u2014 in w hat some sources refer to as \" dysfunctions o f con\u00ad sciousness\" \u2014 that the roots o f so- called \" physical disease\" may be found. D raw ing upon the teachings of Louise H ay, Ram Dass, trance channels K evin Ryerson and Jane Roberts, and a host of others, it was suggested th at \"w e create o ur own re a lity.\" Know ing th at we are energetically connected through love and intention w ith every other being on the planet \u2014 and w ith the planet herself \u2014 this speaker cited a channeling w ith Richard W o linsky in which the sp irit entity M artenard had asked h im what he had done to \" create A ID S .\" In itia lly shocked and slightly outraged by such an assertion, the speaker \" got over it,\" and chose to look inw ard to see what he had in common w ith his brothers and sisters w ho had been diagnosed w ith the disease. A ltho ugh unable to offer any definitive conclusions, this speaker suggested th at, fo r him , the p o larity of \" us\" against \" them \" which had characterized much o f his activist history m ight be a reflection of a deeper division of self against self. W hile h ard ly suggesting that a stance o f nice-guy passivity was an appropriate response to oppression and potential world-destruction, he offered as an alternative approach fo r him self the understanding that the roots o f a ll healing lay in mov ing outw ard from a place, not of antagonistic polarities, but o f self acceptance and inner peace.A n Unorthodox Practice S hirley Scott, M .D ., a long-time Castro neighborhood resident, ex\u00ad plained th at she grew up in a holistic atmosphere o f colonics, bodyrubs, and herbal preparations. Heeding her inner voice's dram atic exclam ation that \" If you do any more allopathic medicine, you w ill die,\" she has enriched her basic M .D . tra in in g w ith studies o f her\u00ad balism , acupuncture, bodyw ork, metaphysics etc. H aving worked for some tim e w ith the late D r. JohnG illm o re, whose downtown practice was \" m ainly gay,\" she now works m ainly w ith women who are healing Candida, parasites, and a host of other environmentally-related il\u00ad lnesses. D r. Scott proposed that, given the w orld wide contam ination by pesticides, heavy metals, lead, radiation, poisonous chemicals, a ir and water pollution, etc., the whole country and \" maybe the whole w o rld \" has im m une deficiencies, \" there is a lo t of im balance,\" she explained, which can even be foundin modem day disease o f animals The solution she offered is to live life in a \" healing balance.\" In her own work D r. Scott has in\u00ad corporated this sort of approach through w ork w ith auric fields, crystals, flower essences, and par\u00ad ticipation in several healing groups. H er diet reflects three basic p rin \u00ad ciples: food com bining, yeast elim ination, and food rotation. H er use o f supplements is based upon her belief that \" m any people\" are low in magnesium, zinc, vitam in B6, and other essential nutrients. Colonics, cleaning baths, medita\u00ad tio n, and other techniques are employed to both detoxify the body and establish inerharm ony. \" W e a ll deserve to say that 'our w ork is a blessing.' If you cannot say that, get another jo b . I spend most o f my day livin g in 'positive affirm a tio n .' The A ncient Masters on through Louise H ay and Sondra Ray have taught us to put out positive energy as a way of creating what we want and deserve in life .\" A Chinese Perspective M isha Cohen, the next panelist, ex\u00ad plained that her \" eclectic approach includes w ork w ith m ind, bo.iy, and sp irit. The ancient Chinese medical approach is to \" strengthen and balance so that the body can healitself.\" Asserting th at a ll dispse begins on an energetic l/vel, Chinese practitioners eschew ^such allopathic techniques as blood tests in favor o f case histories, pulse diagnosis, observation, tongue analysis, and other techniques which allow them to determine the u n d e rlyin g energetic balances w ithin an ind ivid ual. \" Illness comes up over a long period o f tim e and we need to allow a long tim e to b uild ourselves back up,\" Cohen added. Accordingly, Chinese medical practitioners do not separate A ID S from other d is e a s e s . \" T h e y a re a ll imbalances.\" \" A ll A ID S symp\u00ad toms have been documented in Chinese medicine fo r thousands o f years. W e have developed herbal, sp iritual, dietary, and acupuncture techniques to correct such im \u00ad balances.\" M isha rejected o utrig h t the often- heard line that \" before he got A ID S he was perfectly health y.\" Perhaps such an ind ivid ual appeared healthy from Western medical standards, but not from the vantage point o f Chinese medicine. \" The energetic imbalances we see in a person diagnosed w ith A ID S indicate that they have prem aturely aged \u2014 that they have 'lost th e ir essence.'

Spring Mobilization The Mobilization for Peace, Jobs and Justice, a coalition of major communi\u00ad ty, labor, student, and religious groups throughout the Bay Area, has announced plans for a large march and rally in San Francisco on Satur\u00ad day, April 19, 1986. Participants will rally and march around the issues of jobs and justice, no U.S. support to South African apartheid, no U.S. intervention in Central America and the Caribbean, and freeze and reverse the nuclear arms race. Leaders of the Mobilization explain that the slogans, the same as last year's march and rally, were retained be\u00ad cause none of those four issues has been satisfactorily resolved in the last year. Organizers expect that wide\u00ad spread support of the coalition's stand on those issues, as well as broad-based opposition to the upcoming cuts in non-military federal programs, will again bring tens of thousands out to march and rally. Efforts to organize and build the march and rally are underway in all Bay Area counties and as far away as Monterey and Sacramento. Already some 50,000 leaflets, posters, buttons, and T-shirts have been distributed. Each Saturday morning, activists meet to distribute leaflets or to serve on committees charged with media, com\u00ad munity outreach, fundraising, or logistics.

Jay's message to people diagnos\u00ad ed w ith A ID S and A R C is a sim ple one. \" Everyone is a potential w in \u00ad n e r.\" T o the rest o f the com m unityhe said, \" Love them and help them. It a ll comes back to yo u.\" A Homeopathic Approach D a n a U llm a n , M .P .H ., a homopath (and Sentinel con\u00ad trib u to r) who trium phed in a pioneer legal action against govern\u00ad ment attempts to stop him from helping people regain th eir health, then took the microphone. T o a round of applause, he beamingly announced th a t h is b o o k. Everybody' s Guide to Homepathic Medicine, (Tarcher) was selling faster than A ID S was spreading, and had ju s t won the \" Book o f the Y ear\" A w ard from Self H elp Magazine. U llm an explained the basic theory o f hom eopathic medicine, which uses disease organisms inmicro-dose to prom ote im m unity and healing. He, lik e Rick Shames, is a proponent o f com plem entary medicine. H is b rief history lesson, which documented the legal sup\u00ad pression o f hom opathy by the allopathic physicians who later formed the Am erican M edical Association, helped the audience to understand that so-called a lte r\u00ad native medicine is actually far more trad itio n al than many physicians would have us believe. U llm an reiterated his hypothesis that antibiotics and penicillin may be co-factors in the rise of A ID S . When asked about alternatives fo r tre a tin g s e xu a lly tra n s m itte d diseases, he responded th a t homeopaths cannot legally treat people w ith V D ; they must ad\u00ad m inister p enicillin. D r. Shames then endorsed p enicillin fo r fighting V D , while noting that other methods were \" w orth a try .\" Am ong the methods suggested as, if nothing else, an adjunct to penicillin therapy, are miso soup, yogurt and acidophilis to rebuild intestinal flo ra kille d by antibiotics; V ita m in C ; visualization and hom opathic follow-up to detoxify the body. Ascorbate Therapy Los Altos-based D r. Robert C athcart, a tireless propo\u00ad nent o f the use o f ascorbate (V ita m in C) in large quantities fo r the healing o f A ID S , began his presentation by noting that he does do other things w ith his patinets besides give them V ita m in C. \" There is no question that the im \u00ad mune system is suppressed by negative thin kin g and enhanced by positive th in kin g .\" Ascorbate, asserted C athcart, has been especially beneficial inhealing pneum the A ID S \"o p \u00ad portunistic infection\" that k ills 50 percent o f a ll people diagnosed w ith the disease. C athcart has had 15 cures \" so fa r\" combining the Sep\u00ad tra sulfur drug usually given to peo\u00ad ple w ith Pneumocystis w ith massive \"bow el level tolerance\" doses o f ascorbate. W h ile he asserted that many ind ivid uals are in fact allergic to the sulfu r drugs used fo r Pneumocystis, o r experience G I tract difficulties w ith a substitute drug, Pentam idine, vitam in C can help m itigate allergic reactions to such drugs. Am ong C athcart's tips were his b e lie f th a t \" b o dy b u ild in g exercises\" help drive V ita m in C in \u00ad to the places in the body where it 's most necessary. Rinsing the m outh or using a straw when using ascor\u00ad bate powder to protect tooth enamel was strongly suggested. Fo r people in good health, not fighing a specific disease, large doses o f V ita m in C were not recom\u00ad mended. \" D o n 't get dependent on V ita m in C. If you do, yo u'll find that you need it a ll the tim e .\" In doing so, Cathcart validated the body's n atu ral abilities to right itself w itho u t the use o f massive supplem entation on a d aily basis. C athcart also briefly addressed the grow ing problem o f Candida among the Am erican population. \" C andida is a very big problem w ith A ID S ,\" he asserted. Am ong his recommendations were dietary changes, the eating of ro o t foods, potato skins, and garlic, as w ell as the use o f several h e a lin g substances. \" 1 shy away from nystatin,\" he explained, \" because 1 th in k its use may be contributing to the Candida fungus getting more vicious every year.\" He suggestedusing this drug as a last reson.

The whole week will be crammed with coincidences which are completely beyond your control even though you are at the center of the vortex. Freedom is achiev\u00ad ed when you learn how to balance yourself perfectly on center \u2014 not wobbling, not waver\u00ad ing. not coming up with any more phony excuses. You have the powers of love and truth at your command; use them to the benefit of your entire community. (icmini. The W olf (May 21-Jun 20): Liberation sounds like a pipe-dream to you this week. You have all the right attitude, but the schedules are tight and hum\u00ad drum continues to demand more out of you than you care to give. Celebrate the Easter holiday b y - inviting your best friends over for a potiuck feast; partying should distract you from the routine at least for a little while. Pay attention to offers which would radically change your lifestyle. Cancer. The Crah (Jun 21-Jul 22): Liberation is always such a trau\u00ad matic experience for you. After days and days of building up the pressure, the excite\u00ad ment. and the fear, you suddenly explode with overwhelming sincerity. Sure you're right and everybody already knows that you're being perfectly honest; but if you really want to gel all your feelings across, you'll have to do it calmly.Look at it this way; screaming and hollering will liberate you. but only cool organization will make it last! The Snake (Jul 23-Aug 22): Liberation is brought to you by your lover this Easter. Formal arrange\u00ad ments have already been made, and you should enjoy the magic of this traditional, holiday with very little turmoil. But \u2014 there are signs that a crazy family member could show up with kids and confusions galore. She won't stay long, so you can afford lo share love and the security of your home without disengaging your original plans. You should all get along great together. ^ Virgo, The Pig (Aug 23-Sep 22): Liberation is yours in the arms of your lover, and no where else. You can search through books and scriptures; you can try to find freedom in your work; you can even fool yourself into believing that the government guarantees your freedom. But. get serious! You would be a prisoner stuck away in the solitary confinement of your own paranoia if it weren't for your companion. Show how thankful you are by devoting your entire holiday lo your lover. Behold your savior! ^ Libra, The Leopard (Sep 23-Oct 22): ~ Liberation is what you see happening ^ in your relationship, even though you might call it something else. Hanging on to each other for dear life is taking up too much energy at this point, so it's lime to look at your long-term contracts from a much different perspective. You must find more room to move around each other; otherwise, the same old collisions will recur again and again. Experiment with walking in the same direction independently. Stxirpio, The Scorpion (Oc(23-Nov 21): Liberation is relative to confinement; when you feel absolutely no confine\u00ad ment in your life, then you are liberated. Easter '86 is an adventure in exploring long-held at\u00ad titudes about confinement. Basically, you begin lo understand how afraid you are of being totally free and living without any confinement fromyour job or relationship. Remember, your strug\u00ad gle for liberation is not your own; we all share the same ideals at this time of the year. . Si^ltarius. The Horse (Nov 22-l)ec 21): Liberation comes easy for a good * * looking and healthy individual such yourself. The free life gives you the chance to plav games, to relish adventure, to pig-out on romance. While everyone else longs for freedom, you boldly push your way through any resis lance. Your only concern should be the example which you leave with younger folks. Your imprc'.- sion on the kids is strong but indirect. especialK when you affect mom or dad the way you do. Capricorn, The Whale (Dec 22-Jan 19): Liberation from housing problems is a ' special gift that the Easter Bunny puts in your basket this year. Either a new landlord or a new residence or both is in your immediate future. A ll those struggles with outrageous rents and hidden deposits is ultimately resolved almost magically. But who is this wonderful Easter Bun\u00ad ny, and what's he doing in your basket? You'll have to find out for yourself! a Aquarius, The F.agle (Jan 20-Feb 18): Liberation movememts in the world a - round you are the result of your hard work in the past. For years you've been suppor\u00ad ting your relationships with a vision of freedom and prosperity; you. indeed, are the major con\u00ad tributor to their revolutionary spirit. Now as you see your followers becoming their own leaders, resist the temptation to use old authority trips as a way of staying clo,se. When you let them go. they will follow you on their own. Pisces, The Shark (Feb 19-Mar 20): Liberation is an economic decision for you. and the celebration of Easter is honestly a great time for you lo make a little extra money. Put an advertisement for discounts on your services, and gel ready for a significant response. If you are willing to work, there will be plenty for you to do. P.S.

A gawky, sexy young Pakistani male gets out of a car whose path is blocked by a gang of com\u00ad prehensive school drop outs. It looks like he's about to get an unsolicited lesson in \" Paki-bashing 101.\" The camera starts to track the young man as he strides blithely past the thugs and over to a wall where their unofficial leader sits \u2014 a punk coiffiiren de rigueur. Exit gang. Paki and punk kiss. British director Stephen Frears (Gum\u00ad shoe, The Hit) remembers when he read the portion of Hanif Kureishi's screenplay for My Beautiful Laundretle where the characters, Omar and Johnny first kiss. \" I think that was what made it clear that 1 wanted to do it, that it was just wonderful. W e wanted it to be very very romantic, and, of course, we didn't want to treat it as some knid of problem or anything ridiculous like that. . . you just take it for granted, but that really is startling, isn't it? \" C ut to the scene of a middle age Pakistani gentleman dancing, with his very proper English mistress, across the floor of a newly gentrified laundrom at, while his enterprising nephew, O m ar (Gordon Warnecke), drums up a little business with an old school mate Johnny (Daniel D ay Lewis), in the back room . Uncle Nasser (Saeed Jafferey), unaware of the carnal nature of the boys' at\u00ad tachment. calls in mild vexation, \" W here are those buggers!\" Johnny has a which-side-are-you-on tightrope to straddle throughout the film between O m ar's culturally conservative but upwardly mobile M uslim fam ily and his own crypto-fascist unemployed mates. On the first day of shooting, in a racially polarized South End neighborhood, Frears directed actor Lewis as Johnny, to nuzzle O m ar's neck, on camera, but out of view of the ac\u00ad tors who play the young white punks \u2014 Johnny's former gang \u2014 who are now menacing O m ar's refurbished laundrette. \" W hen Johnny licks the back of O m ar's neck, we had to conceal it, but. . . 1 just said to Dan, 'Go on, kiss his neck.' It was a very th rillin g moment.\" Screenwriter Kureishi, who went to school w ith white \" mates\" in a violent South End neighborhood, told The New York Times that the Anglo-Pakistani comm unity is very much divided in their reaction to My Beautiful Laundrette. \" C onservative Pakistanis hate the movie because they don't like the idea of boys kissing each other. Liberal Pakistanis like it because it shows Pakistanis making it in England \u2014 and not as poor victims.\" Director Frears notes that the film is really about \" a sort of inversion class\" in today's Britain. \" The real victims in the film , the really tragic group of people are the white kids, who are completely disen-uncle explains that the secret to success in today's B ritain is to ''squeeze the tits of the system.\" Uncle Nasser boasts. ''There's no such thing as race in the New Enterprise culture.\" meaning that, like Am erica, if you're rich yo u're going to be all right. To this aspiring class of Pakistani en\u00ad trepreneurs. even the ugly spectre of British racism is merely the price you pay to do business, a cloud on the horizon, compared lo the fate of Pakistanis who want to return to a homeland \" sodomized by religion.\" Frears believes that in some ways, the new immigrants are merely adapting themselves to the classic British knack for mucking through hard times, \" English people are very good at sort of small crime, little petty 'fiddles.' For example \u2014 some one like me \u2014 1 know how to work the system in England to get to make films. . . . I've sur\u00ad vived by being able to work the system. People in Am erica are very startled that a television company would make this film. It seems inconceivable, but in B ritain it's ab\u00ad solutely consistent. . . . There's nothing to fight for; they just sat. 'Yes.' It was as sim\u00ad ple as that.\" O m ar's tastefully neon-lit laundrette is financed through a \" fiddle\" he and Johnny themselves pull, stealing some drugs smug\u00ad gled into the country in the shells of blank video cassettes by his cousin Salim (Derrick Branche). The script contains double and triple entendres that nicely peg what the boys are up to. O m ar's nickname is \" O m o\" as in homo \u2014 the m oniker's also the name of a popular British laundry detergent. The laundrette is dubbed \" Powders\" as in soap powder, or heroin. O m ar's character undergoes a somewhat brutal but predictable transform ation from the beginning of the film when he, somewhat naive and innocent, is tending to hisworldly education. Frears likes that Omar \" can't wait to get away from his dad.\" Johnny, although he won't quite admit to himself, is also desperate to clim b out of punk poverty. Nasser gives him his head, making him manager of a run-down building, where his first task is to give the boot to a down-at-the-heels Rastafarian poet. Johnny is crossing the line. The inhabitants of My Beautiful Laund\u00ad retle are as sexually bold as they are economically \" dodgey.\" Frears explains how Kureishi came upon the idea for one of the most sexually explicit heterosexual scenes in the movie \u2014 a shot that shocks some Asian audiences even more than the gay love scenes. \" H anif used to describe go\u00ad ing to dinner with these [Pakistani! girls \u2014 and they'd start passing him notes that were very disgusting.\" In the scene, Nasser's at\u00ad tractive young daughter Tania (R ita W olf) flirts with O m ar, baring her big breasts against the outside window of her father's study while the older men are talking money. \" The single most controversial thing in the film is when [Rita Wolf] shows her breasts, and she appeared on ethnic programs to dis\u00ad cuss this.\" Frears adds that no one pushed W o lf into above-lhe-waist nudity. \" You couldn't stop her. . . she was longing to do it. . . . People used to tell me, 'W ell, an Asian girl w ouldn't do that!' I said, 'Well, an Asian girl did it. W hat are you trying to tell me?\" There are moments when a menage-a- trois, \" a laundrette\" seems possible between Om ar, Johnny and Tania, and, in fact, Frears remembers contemplating a three- way before the script went another way with Johnny and O m ar, bloodied but still together at the end. \" It was quite difficult, the end, because their success is founded on drugs. It was quite hard to have them walk- ' People in America are very startled that a television company would make this film. It seems inconceivable, but in Britain it's absolutely consistent. ...\" franchised \u2014 all that football hooliganisam; they're unemployed and nobody gives a damn about them .\" Kureishi's screenplay sparkles with lines that cut far below the surface of life in British Prim e M inister Margaret Thatcher's New Enterprise economy. O m ar's Pakistanialcoholic father, a successful journalist back in Pakistan who's rotting on the dole in England. His father pleads with O m ar's uncle Nasser to give him a job to tide him over u n til he can start university in the fall. Instead, Nasser takes O m ar into the family businesses, providing him with a far moreing off into the sunset. . . . I just like the idea of them being together, splashing water on each other. It seems to me the most one can expect from life.\" Frears hopes to complete another gay themed film \u2014 Prick Up Yor Ears \u2014 based on the biography of the same name of the short-lived times of British playwright Joe Orton.

Just between Friends A t the M etro Someone should have sat M ary Tyler Moore down, just bet\u00ad ween friends, you understand, and had a little heart-to-heart with her about her decision to undertake this project; presumably, no one had the nerve. Moore can afford to buy herself a film {friends is a M TM production) and that's what she's done, bringing in M T M Show vete\u00ad ran Allan Burns to direct his first feature film from his own story. They're both too close to it for comfort. The film's a weeper about suburban infidelity, and, bad as it is, it's made more annoying because Moore's also been able to afford herself a pretty top-notch cast. Watching talented performers like Christine Lahti and Sam Waterston wade through this material is especially distressing: you get the feeling the y can't wait to step out on the patio to dish the hostess.Moore plays a model housewife, married to Ted Danson (Cheers), a pretty shallow actor in my books, as an oversexed seismologist who's get\u00ad ting it on the side. One evening when Moore steps into an aerobics session to help out her instructor, she hits it off with a young woman (Lahti) in the class. Maybe it's romance? No such luck; in a preposterous plot development, Lahti turns out to be the object of hubby Danson's extramarital af\u00ad fections. And it takes Moore forever to find out. Tepid sit-com turns to teaijerker when hubby's abruptly snuffed in an auto accident. Moore takes over the ailing aerobics salon, sprucing it up with natural brick and nifty space waitress outfits for the instructors: we're talking franchise potential. \" Now that he's dead,\" .she confides, \" I 've gotten to be more interesting to him than when he was alive.\" You wonder. Lahti has shone in other roles (opposite Goldie Hawn in Swing Shift, notably) and she's sen.sa- tional here \u2014 worth catching sometime on VHS. Playing a super-competent TV reporter with a junk food habit and a tendency to chain-smoke, she's frequently hilarious, not, heaven knows, because there's anything terribly funny about her lines, but rather, because she's so gifted. Sam Waterson (The Kitting Fields), a fine actor, isn't as lucky. As Danson's klutzy, faithful boyfriend who's on to Danson's game, he's accepted some very bad direction and actually detracts from the production. But this is Moore's film after all, and that's the problem. Anyone who remembers her from theTV show with which she's invariably connected will be unnerved by her present-day appearance; she's still got the little-girl face and the strangely frozen expression (did I hear the word facelift?) but she's got the body of an old woman. \"1 look like I know how to do a lot of things I don't know how to do,\" she explains. Right, like act. Un\u00ad naturally thin, beside l.ahti, who's rather large, she looks like nothing so much as a wizened child. That may sound cruel, but it's the sort of speculation you give way to when a story and its characters leave you with so little to do \u2014 I mean, Mary, isn't the housewife versus career woman argument a little, well, passe? As for the business with the husband \u2014 and there's a lot of breast\u00ad beating on the subject \u2014 if her girlfriend's so hip, what's she doing running around with a married man? He wouldn't Iasi five minutes with Dear Abby. Past Histories Angry Harvest '/i .A t the Cannery Nominated for Best Foreign Film , Agnieska Holland's wrenching drama of passion and betrayal lost out at Monday's Academy Awards to an Argenti\u00ad nian entry, 77f\u00a3> 5/0/7. It 's not hard to understand why. W hile Angry Harvest is the better film, it 's far too bleak and despairing to make the list of many moviegoer's favorites. Viewer s may also CrndHarvesI bewildering at first. Set in Poland in the last months of the Second World War, the film 's in German (direc\u00ad tor Holland is Polish, but she's been forced out of making films in her own country). The com\u00ad plexities of the production of Holland's fourth feature go far beyond the fact that she is direct\u00ad ing, for the first time, in a foreign language she doesn't even speak. Out in the woods one day, a Polish farmer catches a starving, exhausted woman trying to steal his lunch. It's made clear to us that she's escaped from a train headed for the Nazi death camps. The farmer's first instincts are to shelter her and nurse her back to health, but the ar\u00ad rangement turns into a game of manipulation with undercurrents of submission and domina\u00ad tion. Leon, the farmer (played by East German ac\u00ad tor Armin Mueller-Stahl) seems like a goodenough man; relatively prosperous, he wants no part of the looting ot Jewish propertv his neighbors go in for in the wake of the confisca\u00ad tion of the as.scts of local landowners. He hides Rosa, the fugitive (Austrian actress Elisabeth Trissenaar) in the cellar of his farmhouse while she regains her strength; it's a courageous gesture in an atmosphere of everpresent danger. \" They burn down houses when they find Jews,\" he warns her and, in fact, he's risking his life when he lakes her in. Rosa's grateful: it's a gratitude that's put to the lest when he falls in love with her and makes the inev itable demands. Revolted at first by his attentions \u2014 she's still hoping to find her husband and their children in the forest \u2014 Rosa gradually gives in \u2014 partly, you .sense, out of relief that she can find any af\u00ad fection or intimacy in a world that has turned into an unrelieved horror. .Mueller-Stahl, whose differences with East German authorities forced him to emigrate to the West in recent years,' Is an actor of such astonishing range that he can tackle what seems like several different characters in the same role. Leon is almost childlike as he bumbles his way through a meeting with the mother and daughter who are upper-class old family friends. \" I'm afraid of women,\" he confesses to the parish priest. \" I can't talk to them or get along with them.\" But when Rosa's safety is threatened, he coolly takes control of the situation. In the hands of a lesser director, Leon's awareness of the danger would be telegraphed in his reactions to his neighbor s suspicions, but Holland's instincts for dramatic believability are too sharply honed for such treatment. Leon grows even bolder as his romance with Rosa giv'es him a new con\u00ad fidence in himself and his sexuality \u2014 to the point where, in an infuriating breach of trust, he abandons her. Rosa, in a final act of despair, takes the only way out that's left. Trissenaar's a classically trained actress as well as the focus of a number of Fassbinder's later films. Her performance as Rosa pulls out all the stops, and her last moments with Mueller- Stahl are as harrowing as any in film. Finally, though Angry Harvest is Holland's achievement. A rebellious director, who's ex\u00ad perienced her share of intimidation and disap\u00ad proval, Holland brings a seething fury to the in\u00ad justice she sees in the tangled political realities of eastern Europe \u2014 coupled with a feminist's rage at the inequalities of male/female relationships. The overwhelming significance of her themes would seem to leave little hope for any satisfac\u00ad tory resolution, but the ending feels right \u2014 even as it implicates every' one of us in the \" solution\" of the plot. F U m C l i p s V M ichael Lasky Very Ugly American Salvador Salvador is one of the those well- intentioned political films which pur\u00ad ports to open American's eyes to the horrors occuring in Latin and Central America with the blessing and support of the U.S. government. Writer- Director Oliver (Midnight Express) Stone's history le.sson of 1980 El Salvador is ostensibly based on the true story of journalist Richard Boyle's experiences covering the military action and death squads in the revolution-racked Central American country. You might remember the headlines about the nuns who were viciously raped and murdered and the spate of stories about leftist government vs. freedom fighting guerillas. Well, that's what Stone attempts to recreate but the result is a confused blur. Stone's main mistake was casting unctuous actor' James Wood as the journalist, through whose eyes we must witness events. So completely irritating and obnoxious, so loathesome is his slimy character that the audience never really can iden\u00ad tify or root for him. He is a grubbv weasal, a smartass braggart and a con man. who goes to Salvador partly forActors Warnecke (lefl) and Lewis in My Beautiful Laundrette the thrill of front lines journalism and partly to avoid legal hassles back home. Along for the ride is James Belushi (John's piggy lookalike and actualike brother), an assumed at\u00ad tempt at out of placezlmmo/ House- style comedic relief. Stone is unflinchingly graphic in his gory depiction of Gestapo-like death squads who leaves thousands of bodies in a burning garbage heap and who kill children who look at them the wrong way. He's merciless in his attack on \" tourist reporters\" \u2014 from T V main\u00ad ly \u2014 who come into a politically unstable country, get some uninform\u00ad ed superficial interviews at a posh hotel oasis, and leave. W ith an ending that is cruel and depressing \u2014 amid unproven claims that the U..S. was responsible for the raping and killing of the American nuns (we get to see that in detail, too) \u2014 Salvador offers no answers, just reasons to be cynical. Its timeliness inlight of the Nicaruguan aid battle in Washington is about all there is to recommend for it. Alas, headlines do not a good movie make. (4 Star) Assembly Line Comedy Gang Ho None of director Ron Howard's light touch in Splash and Cocoon is vi,sible in Gang Ho. In fact, the humor in this comedy about the Japanese re.scuing a small Pennsylvania auto plant, its town and jobs, alternates between poorly timed slapstick and crotch-level racism. It is like the proverbial car built on a Monday or Friday \u2014 it looks good but is full of the defects of uncaring craftsmanship. The main problem with6'i/,i^ Ho \u2014 which by the way is a Chinese, not Japanese expression \u2014 is its star, Michael Keaton, a comedian of uneven quality and taste. If you don't like him. the picture is an instantwashout. He mugs for the camera, he preens, he slithers and slides and does everything short of mooning to get a laugh, even a cheap one. Some people find this exaggerated style hy.sterical, others consider it as obnoxious as Jerry Lewis. Gedde Watanabe as the driven Japanese businessman, for whom the success of the American plant is a life or death deal, is funnier, but then again anything \u2014 even herpes \u2014 would be. Watanabe is the Oriental Stepin Fetchit \u2014 we laugh at him, not with him. The expected clash between the cultures is what Gung Ho wants to tell us about, as beer-bellied American workers refuse to follow Japanese perfectionism techniques, even if it means unemployment. It's this sad- but-true comment on American blue collar workers that destroys any chance this film has to be entertaining. Gung Ho diddles with truths without charm, disarming humor respect. Instead, it awkwardly manages to insult both Americans and Japanese, be it their race or their in\u00ad te llig e n c e . (Regency II) Soap Opera My Beautiful Laundrette A torrid homosexual romance is just one facet of Stephen Frears' deeply textured, onion-layered study of alien cultures trying to a.ssimilate into' soci\u00ad ety. Actually, it has little to do with the main theme of the film. It is to director Frears and screenwriter Hanif Kure- ishi's credit that the affair feels matter of fact and almost ordinary, some\u00ad thing gays have been asking film\u00ad makers to do for years. Leave it to ac-but ortors Daniel Day Lewis as the two- toned haired punk and Daniel Warn\u00ad ecke as his Pakistan lover to make their relationship sizzle without having it upstage the film. For Pakistan refugees of money and education, England is a haven as well as a hell. They have escaped the squalid conditions of their homeland, only to face the cruel prejudice of a country that has enough economic hardships without having to share the dole with \" outsiders.\" Warnecke's wicked but loveable, wealthy uncle (Saeed Jaffrey), an educated thief, gives him a rundown slum neighbor\u00ad hood laundrette to manage. Seeing money as his key to gaining respect, Warnecke talks his former childhood friend Lewis, who has become a street ruffian/revolutionary via neighbor\u00ad hood peer pressure, into helping him turn the place into a profit center. They pouf it up and call it \" Powders\" with cash Warnecke has embezzled from his smug, thug, drug-dealing cousin. While his relatives try to con\u00ad vince him to marry, he carries on with Lewis, sometimes right around the corner from Lewis's redneck friends. (The sense of danger makes it more ex\u00ad citing.) Of course, the punks do what you would expect them to do to the laundrette but along the way, there are wise and witty lessons to be learned about how individuals \" fit in\" to society. The direction and pacing crackles as we gradually are exposed to the reasons why and how cultures clash.

It 's a play about loss and grief, but its never heavy or morose; instead, it deals with conflict that leads to acceptance, struggle that leads to trium ph. Joe (James Campbell), the young playwright/- journalist, is obsessed with death. Death seems to be the subject of every news story he pegs a headline to, and his plays are all about death too. He s 29, and all he sees is \" doom in everyone's face.\" Plus, he's still grieving over his ex-lover, Paul, who is not dead but might as well be for Joe. Arriving home at 2 am from a friend's party, Joe is greeted by a growing menagerie of family and friends, besides good old Mom and Pop, who all seem to have arrived unexpectedly while Joe was at the party: Joe's Christian Marxist sister Jean (Susan Allen) and her snotty, wiseacre son (Timothy Cavanaugh); his New York lover, Ira (Chuck Kubick); an old lady (Jane McFaganj whom we later learn is Joe's father's old .schoolteacher and is pushing 140; and a silkrob- ed figure (Lorenzo Glover) who turns out to be \u2014 Orville Wright? It so happens, to our modest surprise, that these are all spirits \u2014 of the living as well as the dead \u2014 who have convened unbidden to help Joe overcome, or at least deal with, his generally gloomy disposition. It's a lively get-together for 2 am, with people passing around mugs of warm milk and bowls of popcorn, not to mention Joe's six-pack. The cast really seems to feel the spirit of the play, and that comes out in bouyant performances all around, especially of Joe's parents (Edward Ivory, Helen Petit).The play contains a lot of philosophizing soliloquies, all delivered with heartfelt sincerity, but not a great deal of drama.

In some scenes \u2014 particular\u00ad ly a key one with Joe, Jean and Ira - everyone is so intent on being supportive with their own tales of woe that no one listens to the others, and crucial questions get washed aside unanswered. There is an arguably fine line between ambigui\u00ad ty and confusion, but I got confused at times. Were Joe s parents dead (some lines seem to say so)? Who are all these people? Why is Joe's New York lover here too? Everything gets cleared up eventually though. The questions get answered, Joe feels better the audience feels elated. The weakness in the script are not enough to hold back the enthusiastic cast from delivering a message that is both inspiring and relevant.

The second piece. Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen, is, like its title, more of a dramatic poem than a play. Nothing disturbs the somber, rainy night mood as lovers Charlie Huf- ford and Carlton Powers try to patch up a sundered relationship. Quietly moving. The final piece, Hello From Bertha, generates most of the evening's laughs, though I'm not sure if it's for the right reason. The script is sort of a black comedy about three prostitutes, one of whom, Bertha (Silvana Nova), is sick and aging and must leave her bed, literally and figuratively, to make room for a younger girl, Lena (Tippi). Instead, director Cappetta has chosen to ham the play up in drag, so that we end up laughing at Bertha's bedridden histrionics and miss most of what the play is about. The staging works, but dubiously. The performances are all suitably broad (pardon the pun) and energetic. Miss X plays the house madame with a mock seriousness that is both comic and a little macabre. \"A S H A R P , S O P H IS T IC A T E D , F U N N Y , S E )(Y , C O M P A S S IO N A T E P IQ U R E r -Jack Kroll, NEW SW EEK \"A N E W K IN D O F M O V IE : F A S T , B O L D , H A R S H A N D P R IM IT IV E ; -Richard C o rliss , TIM E Stcynng n., by Kureish.

Featuring a brilliant group of ensemble players who could teach the current cast of Saturday Night Live a number of things about conveying both humor and emotion onstage, the show is a delight. It is. quite simply, a series of songs, monologues, and comic sketches meant to celebrate the 1980s woman. The behind-the- scenes talent that went into producing this show is quite impressive. Co-conceived (along with Julianne Boyd) by reknowned filmmaker Joan Micklin Silver tHester Street, Chilly Scenes o f Winter) and with songs by Amanda McBroom (The Rose) and Carol Hall {Best Little Whorehouse in Texas), the show moves at a breakneck speed. Its humor is brilliantly funny, and the laughs are enhanced by the fact that the characters are all so real. I laughed at Janet Williams Adderley's com\u00ad ical monologue \" Demigod\" , a piece about her lost lover, but at the same time I felt a twinge of sadness for her. as she tried to make light of her pain. Finally, I applauded when she threw her arms upward and let her anger come forth. I was moved nearly to tears over Roo Brown's touching ballad \"Sisters,\" a song about two ag\u00ad ing sisters, one a widow, the other a divorcee, fin\u00ad ding companionship and solace by shariang the end of their lives with each other. I laughed uncontrollably at the show's funniest comic sketch, \" Pretty Young M en,\" in which Roo Brown, Chesley Ann Santoro and Karla Burns played three homy ladies at a male strip show. Ms. Burns was especially funny in this .scene as she watched the (unseen to the audience) jockstrap clad dancer first with binoculars, then a telescope, finally offering the dancer the keys to her home. Karla Bums stole not only this scene, but every other scene she was in. She was the evening's brightest star, and I hope to see more of this delightful singer/actress in the future. A , My Name is A lice... ended all too quickly for me, I left the theatre wanting more, and I do hope you'll all take the opportunity to see it. It will be at the Theatre on the Square, 450 Post Street in San Francisco for a brief engagement. Call 433-9500 for ticket and showtime infor\u00ad mation. Bessie's Bhies When I first heard the title of this show, I was rather odd\u00ad ly reminded of the titles of some of my favorite grade B horror films like House o f Usher or House on Haunted Hill, even House o f D ark Shadows. As the evening progress\u00ad ed, I saw that this was no mere coincidence. In The House o f Blues is based on a charming idea; it's a blues/revue done as a kind of ghost story. It almost makes it. As the show begins, a young black couple. Melody and M.C. (Velina Brown and Wayne Wilson) are inspecting an old run-down blues club in the Deep South that the lady inherited from her aunt. Their main concern is to get rid of the place and return to Chicago. But suddenly, a man named Mr. Blues (wonderfully played by Jessie Moore) appears out of nowhere and proceeds to tell them the history of the blues. For the next three hours the ghosts of various famed blues singers of the past wander in and out of the shadows to talk about their lives and sing classic standards by such songwriters as Fats Waller, Eubie Blake, Hoagy Carmichael, and many others. Occasionally Melody and M.C. join in the singing as they learn about the blues. The music is, of course, familiar to many, and it's always a pleasure to hear these songs. The singers are wonderful. Jessie Moore's rendition of \" C.C. Ryder\" is exciting, and Margarette Robinson as Ma Rainey is hot and sassy, campy and erotic, all at once. This lady knows how to make an entrance. The real star of the evening, though, is cabaret singer Denise Perrier, as the legendary BessieSmith. Miss Perrier is a beautiful woman with a powerful voice, and she captures the essence of Bessie Smith to an almost eerie degree. There wasn't a dry eye in the house when she sang the gospel classic \" I 'm Going Home to M y God\" , as another character read the real Bessie'sobituary, telling how she might have survived her auto accident had she not been taken to a hospital that refused to treat blacks. Unfortunately, the show is bogged down by too many poorly executed dram.xtic interludes between Melody and M.C., who can't decide whether to sell or re-open the club. These scenes go on way too long, and are not helped by the Miss Perrier is a beautiful woman with a poweijiil voice, and she captures the essence o f Bessie Smith to an almost eerie degree. fact that neither Velina Brown nor Jonathan Wayne Wilson possesses any stage presence. At one point my companion turned to me and said, \" Why don't they just shut up and sing?\" I Dance Eric H eilm an Small Spaces, Little Deaths This past weekend confirmed that talent in dance art (please, don't even mention the possibility of \" genius\" ) is an elusive and, more often than not, unobtainable rare bird. Two series of performances (\" Company in Flight\" at Project Artaud's Centerspace, 3/20-21, and Dance Action\" at Vorpal G allery, 3/22-23) presented the work of nine local choreographers using nearly two dozen local dancers. The problem for all of the choreographers and performers involved was not a lack of money (despite obvious funding constraints). Lavish sets, elaborate costuming, and large performance spaces do not make great performances; but mature, non-gimmicky movement and well- rehearsed, physically adept dancers do. The per\u00ad formances at Centerspace and Vorpal were filled with movement and narrative cliches, danced \u2014 mostly \u2014 by awkward, unsure, and frequently out-of-shape dancers. It's hard to know where to begin what must \u2014 depressingly \u2014 be viewed as a \" hit list\" of atrocities. Generally, the works performed fall into two categories: First, those with no redeem\u00ad ing promise whatsoever (these pieces \u2014 and, possibly, their choreographers \u2014 should be retired permanently), and second, those dances that offered a glimmer of hope. In the first category, Sheri Gaia's \" The W ork\u00ad ing Hour\" and \" Street Life\" \u2014 both excerpted from a longer work. Captured by Dance \u2014 con\u00ad firm an embarrassing and total lack of talent. \" Working Hour\" consists of three women and one chubby man dressed in dance warmup clothes, apparently preparing to take class at a local studio. When the music hits the turntable (\" Tears for Fears\" ) this quartet launches into a bad, inept version of a \" Fame\" -style jazz routine. A ll the exhuberance and high-energy precision of television's hit show is absent in this unintentionally comic free-for-all. Complimenting Gaia's disaster was Bymar Mehl's interminably long, vaguely ritualistic \" Tears of Iron.\" The piece is set on nine dancers (eight women and one bearded young man). The music, a commissioned score by James Swyers, is an interesting space-wail, combining aspects of composers Brian Eno and Vangelis. The dancing is extremely monotonous and frequently static (lots of circle-making; laying on the floor with ex- tended arms and legs and frozen poses). Am id all The peiformances at Centerspace and Vorpal were filled with movement and narrative cliches, danced \u2014 mostly \u2014 by awkward, unsure, and frequently out-of-shape dancers.couldn't agree more. Ms. Brown's voice when she did sing was pretty. Fortunately, there is enough singing in the show to make it worth seeing, and the single set and numerous costumes are quite lovely. I 've been told that since opening night the show was trimmed by 40 minutes, with more em\u00ad phasis on the music. Good idea. In The House of Blues is an ambitious pro\u00ad duction that has its faults, but it has more than enough going for it to make for an overall en\u00ad joyable evening \u2014 and I defy you to resist giving Miss Denise Perrier a standing ovation at curtain call. Miss Perrier is, by the way, a fixture on the cabaret scene in San Francisco, as well as in numerous other cities, so keep your eyes on the pink pages for her future Bay Area appearances. In The House o f Blues will play through A pril 27 at the Lorraine Hansberry Theatre in the Zephyr Theatre Complex, 25 Van Ness, off Market.

But it was good to see someone who seemed to be feeling something while dancing. Despite much overall nonsense, there were two possibilities for future success among the choreographers represented at these recent con\u00ad certs. Tance Johnson and Lucas Hoving are both mature veterans in the dance world and both do have some ideas that seem interesting. Johnson chose a difficult but appealing piece of music by Philip Glass for her dance, \" Far\u00ad rago.\" This ballet-based, but modern articula\u00ad tion of space demanded a larger performance area than either the Vorpal or Centerspace stages; I continually sensed the constraints on the dancers \u2014 and the realization of Johnson's spatial patterns \u2014 due to the limited area. Also, Johnson desperately needs to use better, more technically agile dancers. In particular, the L iz F u e n te s R o s n e r's dancers The last choreographer whose name belongs on the \" should never be seen again\" list is Liz Fuentes Rosner. Her work, included in both the Centerspace and Vorpal performances, featured three pieces, \" Cintigo\" (an embarrassing love- hate duet preceded by a cloying, cliche-ridden poem read by Rosner), \" To a Cat\" (a cute tribute to the choreographer's love for felines that this non-activity, individual dancers are given the opportunity (according to program note.s) to create their own \" .solos.\" This idea, although democratic in spirit, denies the autocratic nature of artistic vision, and results in a number of in\u00ad dividuals wandering rather aimlessly among the crowd of performers. The piece ends when everyone rolls to the edge of the performance area, apparently either dead or simply exhausted from collective despair.would have been ideal for a kindergarden aud\u00ad ience), and \"Prayer for Peace\" (an attempt at a major opus that applies Christian love to the problems of the Middle East and ends with the as,sassination of the four dancers/participants). It should be noted, however, that dancer Peggy Davis-Nixon brought a welcome and compelling degree of dramatic interpretation to her role in \" Prayer for Peace.\" It was difficult, never\u00ad theless, to understand the narrative or emotionalcasting of elderly Bruce Bain as the principal male for the duet in \" Farrago\" was inap\u00ad propriate. And, although there seemed to be new choreographic ideas in the making, Johnson should refrain from all attempts at costuming; her unitards with sewn-on diamond-shaped pat\u00ad ches were not successful. Hoving's piece, \" And the A ir Was S till.. . \" was a short little ditty (listed as part of a larger work, Reguiem Suite). I liked the abstract, but not non-melodic music (mostly guitar) by John Toenjes and the kimono-style grey-and-beige silk gowns (designed by Lavinia Hovinga) worn by the three female dancers. The work's title was pretty much as ambiguous as the dance itself. The three women (possibly sisters?) are alone; each dances and gestures in her private, isolated space. Then they come together and, suddenly, one girl dies and the piece ends. There really wasn't much to it, but there seemed to be possibilities for both charm and mystery. The Vorpal Gallery's harsh, non-adjustable spotlights did not add to the crea\u00ad tion of mood. To sum up: I'm disappointed to report the local, small-theatre dance scene appears to be so lacking in artistic resources \u2014 and I 've left out a number of names of other performers and dance makers from these two recent concerts only to save space and spare the theatrically incompe\u00ad tent.

The M ost Unusual Supergroup o f the '80s b y Adam Block \" Michael Stipe is singing 'Omaha,' '' my normally unflappable friend Dan cooed, in the unmistakable cadences of a stone groupie. I could em\u00ad pathize. On the radio Stipe's keening growl rustled like autum leaves. That was my introduction to a group I 'd never heard of before \u2014 a group that I never dreamed I 'd see live. Let's sort this out. This winter Celluloid Records scored a coup. The small, independent New York label suddenly had a veritable supergroup on its roster. Vocalists included Jack Bruce, of the 60s seminal power- trio Cream; John Lydon aka Johnny Rotten, from the 70s most notorious band, The Sex Pistols; and Michael Stipe, lead singer with the 80s premier cult band, R.E.M.. Several sidemen were no less stellar; Celtic guitar legend Richard Thompson, jazz iconoclast Carla Bley, and Funkadelic/Talking Heads players Bernie Wor\u00ad rell and Michael Hampton. The Group was the Golden Palominos, and their Ip, Visions o f Excess, was no arty conceit or slap-dash jam session. It earned rave reviews in The New York Times and in the Village Voice. The LA Times called it \" some of the most melodic, hardest rock this side of heavy metal.\" The disc rolled to Ihe top of the College Radio Charts in the Gavin, Rockpool, and W ARD Reports. The Golden Palominos are the brainchild of New York drummer Anton Pier, who co-wrote and arranged every original track, making his supple thunder the band's signature. Earlier, Fier had played with the underground bands Pere Ubu and The Lounge Lizards, becoming a fixture in New Y ork's downtown experimental music scene. W ith producer/bassist Bill Laswell, he turned his chops to more mainstream projects: Herbie Hancock's smash, \" Rockit,\" and also Ips by Mick Jagger, and Yoko Ono. It made for an impressive track record but little public visibility. Fier, speaking before his appearance here last Monday was bemused by talk of \"all-stars'' and a \" supergroup.\" \" I don't think it is really,\" he chuckled. \" Everyone has a kind of cult follow\u00ad ing, but it's not like we're dealing with McCart\u00ad ney or Springsteen.\" Everyone, here, includes stars of the independent scene who play on the record, easily matching their better-known cohorts; they include ex-Raybeat guitarist Jody Harris, Lindsay, ex-db Chris Sumey, and singer Syd Straw \u2014 known to a few for her haunting song \" Listening To Elvis,'' which turned up on the Coyote sampler Luxury Condos. \" I didn't choose any of these people because they were names,'' Fier insisted. \" Names mean nothing. To me, Syd, who is the least known, is just as important as anyone else on this record. Everyone on the record I've either worked with before, or they're friends of mine. When it finally came time to make my own record I called up the people who meant most to me. I was just very lucky that everyone I called was available.\" \" There wasn't really a lot of planning,\" Fier admits. \" I worked on the music, one or two tracks at a time \u2014 with each track written specifically for the people who played on them. But there were surprises. John Lydon was in New York to cut \" Time Zone,\" with Africa Baam- baattaa, and we'd gone out drinking. He came into the studio when I was laying down the tracks for a cover of The Numbers Band's \" The Animal Speaks.\" He liked them, and I showed them the lyrics. That song was intended for Jack Bruce, but I said, \" W hy don't you try it?\" and he did. It's completely different from the way Jack did it. I have a version with Jack singing it which is go\u00ad ing to come out. I respond to people with a strong individual style, like Jack. John, Michael and Syd; and from there I pretty much followed my instincts. From Athens, Ga., where he was working on songs for the next R.F.M. Ip, Michael Stipe talk\u00ad ed about his involvement. \" I'd enjoyed doing \"Om aha,\" and Anton called to ask if I 'd like to do more, and then sent down a tape. I hadn't slept for days. I was riding around in a helicopter, feeling like an ice cream scoop had just taken off the top of my head, working on the video for \" Driver Eight'\" while listening to these tapes and putting down words. I thought the tracks were kind of rough, but Anton probably felt the same about my lyrics.\"Stipe gets chided regularly for his cryptic lyrics. Of the hermetic, homoerotic wonder, \" Boy (Go).\" he volunteers that he knows exactly what his songs are about. \" Clustering Trains came from a dream,\" he explained. \" I was walk\u00ad ing through the Virginia mountains, which only came up to my ankles, and Anton appeared as a giant snake, crawling on his belly, and said to me, 'Write a song.' And I said, 'Not yet.' That's what this is about.\" Both Stipe and Fier name the Ip's single as their favorite cut. \" I had no idea how good that would turn out when we were do\u00ad ing it,\" Fier admits. \" 1 know the words to it, but I can't say I 'm sure I know what Michael is sing\u00ad ing about.\" Stipe came to New York to record his vocal tracks, which he described as \" a real learning ex\u00ad perience. Anton conducted me. I 've always had free rein before, but this was his project. I felt like \u2014 what is the opposite of a dominatrix? No!\" he laughed, \" I felt like the eighth leg of an octopus; if I could reach out and grab a fish for dinner, that'd be fine. Anton is hungry!\" Fier responded, \" Well, I didn't want to change anyone, but I was honest with them. I hope I was able to bring something to their talent or personality out that they might not have seen before.\" Even after the album was out, the Golden Palominos were regularly referred to as a \" fake band.\" Few imagined that they'd ever play live. \" I had my doubts,\" Fier conceeds. \" When I made the record, there was no band, but I had such a good time making it, I wanted it to con\u00ad tinue, to be more permanent. I was worried about disappointing the record's fans \u2014 if some\u00ad one couldn't come, if someone else was filling in; but so far I think we've been doing it justice.\" Fier described touring with the group as \" Ex\u00ad hausting, expensive, and the realization of a ter\u00ad rific fantasy. I get chills every time Jack Bruce opens his mouth. I actually began crying when we were rehearsing his song, 'Consul At Sunset.' I couldn't believe I was actually doing this. I 'm trying to make the concerts as powerful as the ones that changed my life when I was younger: seeing Miles Davis, or the Rolling Stones, because 90 percent of the concerts I see these days leave me disappointed.\" The Visions o f Excess Ip is dedicated to Led Zeppelin Drummer John Bonham, and lo Layla drummer Jim Gordon. Bonham died of sub\u00ad stance abuse. Gordon went round the bend hear\u00ad ing \" voices\" that told him to kill his mother, which he did. \" As a drummer, those are people close to my heart,\" Fier explained, \" and they both met tragic ends. They inspired me and I wanted to show a little gratitude.\" For an encore we've been doing Led Zeppelin's \" Misty Moun\u00ad tain Hop,\" he laughed. \" I think the concept u pretty hilarious. I don't know if it's cool to like Led Zeppelin, I mean for the crowd this band at\u00ad tracts, but I don't care.\" Fier, however, is no terminal case; he is not about due to drown behind his drum kit. He is ambitious, directed, and consumed with projects. After the tour, he hopes to return to Japan where he has been working with ex-Yellow Magic O r\u00ad chestra player Haruomi Hosono's group. He wants to record another Golden Palominos Ip, possibly a double, featuring the same personnel as the last along with Hosono, and Riyuichi Sakamoto (who appears on Pil's current hit, \"Rise\" ). After that: a tour of Europe and Japan. \" I just signed a management agreement with the Bill Graham organization,\" Fier revealed, \" and I m hoping they'll have the clout to get us in rotation on M TV, and on commercial radio. The record has sold 50,000 copies, which makes it Celluloid's best-seller to date, but it has to sell 100,000 copies to cover my costs. I can't lose money forever. This project has to at least break even, or it will die.\" Fier doesn't sound like a man shopping for a burial plot; more like an ar\u00ad tist drumming up business.R o c k Dave F ord Lacklustre Gig for Palominos I ' P ^ ' e r o ' i p \" time atthe I-Beam: a packed house wailed, breath 1 batted or sparks generated by New York session drummer Anton Pier's Golden Palo|mnos a throw-together aggregate of avant-pop superstars What they got, this high-hopes crowd, was a decent rock and roll band, a few nifty p ita r solos, a couple of hard-rocking grooves and, finally, a show way short of expectations \u2014 especially those fostered by hopes of \" surprise\" (the latter of the Funkadelics and Talking Heads), and vocalist Syd Straw. ^ Even the band recognized its limitations. This IS an exercise in terror,\" joked Straw, a librarian-like woman of vein-like thinness. You're looking at a band of very guilty ^ople. Pier joked that one song was \" sloppy, but fun.'* Straw managed a moving duet with Herman on \" Buenos Aires,\" and effectively handled both the missing Jack Bruce's \" Counsel At Sunset\" (Bruce had a \" better offer\" in Budapest, Straw said) and a final ripping encore of Led Zeppelin's \" Misty Mountain Hop.\" The band's ordinariness and lack of coale-Those guest showed, to be sure, but not until after core Palominos ripped and glided through a disconnected series of mid-tempo rockers alter\u00ad nating with slow ballads. Individually, each of the musicians proved gifted, but collectively the group never quite reached the sum-of-its-part cohesiveness which distinguishes a really good, tight rock band. Chris Stamey, in particular! provided unfailingly inventive bass, locking with Fier's sledgehammer drumming and goading guitarists Jody Harris (of the Raybeats) and Peter VIegbat (formerly of Henry Cow), keyboardists Lisa Herman and Bernie Worrellscence was thrown into especially frustrating relief when \\tdid connect. REM vocalist Michael Stipe, a tiny whiz-kid Frankenstein in crinkled suit and red T-shirt, lifted \" Boy(Go)\" and \" Clustering Train\" (from Visions o f Excess LP (Celluloid) into a head-shaking stratosphere, and Oakland guitar mangier Henry Kaiser con\u00ad tributed some admirable chord work (but annoy\u00ad ing solos) to the closing \" Omaha.\" Still, in 15 songs over an hour and a half. The Golden Palominos proved a rocking but under\u00ad rehearsed club band \u2014 no more. The release of the Rolling Slones' 153rd album m as many yean suggests that those to whom we looked in the \" old days'' (which are new days again; paisley! Day-glo! Wah-wahs!) are merely treading water, tired and bored. The trendy, colorful, artfully posed cover of Dirty Work bare\u00ad ly masks a band fractured with internal strife and testy with the imprisonment of fame: note Keith Richards' knee to Jagger's crotch. At this point Jagger sounds utterly terrified and anxiety-ridden at the prospect of being stuck as a Roiling Stone. Last year he released a long- awaited but muzakish solo album, and apparently tounced in and out of i)\\e Dirty Work sessions, barely deigning to interrupt his continual globe\u00ad hopping to layrfown vocals. The album is a lyrical nightmare cesspool of violence, incest, suicide, hate, obsession, lost love and, finally death; all this nastiness reels under the prototypically smashing drums and regurgitated big exhaust power cords. Here's a blow-by-spurt: The disc-opening hissing hi-hat and acousticguiur are bulldozed by a throat-clearing rhythm guitar on \" One Hit (To The Body),\" and pro\u00ad tagonist Jagger is assaulted by tagonist redolent of leather and late nights; \" Your love is a sweet addiction/1 can't clean you out of my veins.\" The seamy imagery continues in the blustery, bloody \" Fight\" : \" Gonna pulp you to a mass of bruises/Cause that's what you're looking for/There's a hole where your nose used to be.\" The singer, who wants to \" Splatter matter on the bloody ceiling,\" is ambivalent about his needs and goals: \" What I want is power, mor power/What I want is an innocent life ... I 'm the truck/I'm the suicide.\" The benign eroticism of \" Harlem Shuffle\" pro\u00ad vides a blast of relative innocence leading to the cautions of \" Hold Back\" : \" If you act like a coward/You'll end up yelling out loud.\" That caution shores up hope \u2014 of sort: \" I've been climbing this tree of promises for over forty years/The visions get broken and bust on the ground/So watch me, watch me rebound.\" The dub-wise reggae splash, \" Too Rude,\" closes the first side, with Keith Richards singing over ricocheting drums and bass. Side Two opens with \" Winning Ugly,\" a loping shuffle masking a disgusted life: \" I wanna be on top/Forever on the up and damn the competition/ I never play it fair/I never turn a hair/Just like the politicians.\" The singer catalogs a laundry list of (liseased values, then over a musically redemptive line, wonders, \" How can I live my life this way?\" \" Back To Zero\" is a dry-funic chronicle of a Continued on page 23 W HAT TH E CHITICS S A ID ...

The singer would be wiser, Moore observed, if he or she began w ith the smaller art, crafted his command of the intimacies of lieder, and only then moved on to the overblown emotions of opera. Trying to go in the reverse direction, singing lieder at the end of a lifetime amid the ex\u00ad travagant gestures of the opera house, can lead the singer to rough-house his way through a song recital rather like a football player in a croquet match. Jon Vickers, the Canadian tenor who replaced Peter Schreier in San Francisco Performances' scheduled recital of Schubert's Winterreise, was the greatest Tristan of his time. His searing inter\u00ad pretation of Wagner's most complex role will live in the memory of everyone who saw and heard him in it. But Tristan is not the only bit of heroism Vickers has mastered. Indeed all of this great tenor's principal roles have been at the im\u00ad passioned end of the dramatic spectrum. During his long career Vickers has been the world's pro- foundest Otello in Verdi's opera, the most poetic Siegmund \\nDie Valkure, the worthy successor to Peter Pears in Britten's Peter Grimes, the definitive Aeneas in Berlioz's Les Troyens, a towering Samson in Saint-Seans' opera, a com\u00ad pelling in Aida, and the finest Florestan in Beethoven's f/rff'/zo. The list inspires awe, though it hardly leads one naturally to think of Vickers in the refined world of Lieder. His peers in the realm of song, Dietrich Fisher-Diskau, Elizabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, Peter Schreier, have dedicated themselves to the concert stage. Indeed over the years they have seemed almost more fully themselves amid the in\u00ad timacy of a recital than on the grand stage of the opera house. Yet now at the end of his distinguished career, Vickers has taken up Schubert's \" Winter Journey\" and lavished his penetrating musical intellect on ferreting out its beauties. It is true that Vickers did sometime push and pull at Schubert's songs as though he wanted something more in them than was there. His tempi, for ex\u00ad ample, tended to be very slow in the slow songs and veiy fast in the fast ones. He did, it must be noted, often break up the musicial phrases into their discrete parts, as I have done, in this sentence. But what a glow he cast over the whole of Schubert's masterpiece. And how attentive he was to its stunning string of melodies, which together with its heartfelt emotion are the deep ^o ry oi Winterreise. Each and every one of these inspirations was clearly delineated and lovingly articulated. And not only the melodies but the words as well came through clearly and distinct\u00ad ly. Indeed the slow speeds at which Vickers took so many of the songs helped him enunciate the words expertly. A lifetime singing Tristan, Otello, Aeneas, Gnmes and Florestan ought, by rights, to have robbed Vickers of all of his voice. I had expected, amid the glorious dramatic insights, only the rags and tatters of a once great instrument. Yet what the audience at Herbst Theatre heard last week was some of the finest singing San Francisco has been treated to in years. It is true that for at least fifteen years now Vickers has customarily pro\u00ad duced his upper register by singing falsetto. He still does. For most of the evening, at the top of the staff, usually between E and F, he would leap suddenly into crooning, with no apologies made for the register break. However, all the notes were there, and thus all the melodies came through, without any gaping holes due to erring pitches. We had all come for the dramatic subtleties, and there they were \u2014 laid out with the profusion of a banquet. The evening was literally strewn with brilliant emotional colorations in the songs. For the vision of the crow, Vickers' voice turned gray and blank, like dirty snow. His sweet mo\u00ad ment by the linden tree was edged with an almo.st palpable pain. The bitterness of the rich match made by his beloved cut through to the bone. The frozen tears, whose musical setting plays so hauntingly with the umlaut on \" Tranen,\" spoke of a sadness beyond repair. Vickers swept through the lines \" You may well laugh at the dreamer / who saw flowers in the snow\" with haughty self-hatred. For a moment when Vickerspaused in his evocation of the grey head, whose aged characteristics are but the ice and snow of a winter traveller, I saw vividly before me too many prematurely aged heads of sick friends. Great as all these moments were, Vickers saved his best for last. The vision of the three suns that stand in the sky was hallucinatory, capturing the audience in the composer's, and the singer's, penetrating horror. The final song is Schubert's image of the organ grinder, who, with his hands numbed by the cold, plays as best he can. Here Vickers showed us both how he could sing all the way through a phrase and also how he could make a bridge over the register break into falset\u00ad to. Behind these technical accomplishments, however, was the real magic; there was the voice of despair paying tribute to music itself. It is a heartbreaking moment during the best of times but after the winter journey conducted by Jon Vickers, it seemed as if we had truly reached the still point of a cruelly turning world. The Symphony on Tour Our daily newspapers were generous in their ac\u00ad counts of the San Francisco Symphony on its re\u00ad cent tour. Their reports watered the reader's mouth for a taste of the musical enjoyment cast before Chicago, New York, even Florida. The Symphony's current strategy is to play the tour repertory here in San Francisco before embark\u00ad ing for far away places. I do not in the slightest mind that the home audience is treated to what amounts to the dress rehearsal of the tour. But the tours ought always to end at home. After these outings, during which the orchestra has practiced the music in the best of all cir\u00ad cumstances, in performance it.self, the Symphony should schedule a welcome home concert, where conductor Blomstedt and the orchestra play an evening of the most successful pieces from the tour. Blomstedt said in a recent lecture on the Garl Nielsen Fourth Symphony that he had conducted the piece only ten times in the last 25 years. Good as It was in the subscription concerts before the tour, the Nielsen Symphony had nowhere near ^e refinement of feeling and structure that Blomstedt managed in the Prelude to Wagner's Lohengrin. Blomstedt must have almost doubled ms experience of the Nielsen on the tour alone The Nielsen is but an example of the rare oppor\u00ad tunity a mur offers conductor and orchestra for practice and refinement of their interpretation of a piece of music. The Symphony owes its home audience a non-subscription concert of the best of the tour repertory, after, as well as before they take the show on the road Cabaret from page 19 hand to accepi the 'i ocal G irl Makes Good\" .irturd. All nominees performed, and newer faces in (he running included Cindy Herron (already a 1 riiics' Circle winner and now Miss San Fran- I'.co), comedian Danny Williams and the com- edv troupe Faullline, an off-the-wall vocal group ..illcdThe Flips, and hoi blues singer Leola Jiles (who took the popular vole with the audience as l iiKTiaincr of the Year). .McNight and Bergren, while still technically eligible for awards in some categories, have pret\u00ad ty well swept the table of honors in the past; they were on hand this year as presenters. Each for the third time, Jae Ross and Weslia W hitfield were chosen as the year's Outstanding Vocalists; \u00a1hoy'll be \"retireef\" with Golden Laurel Awards next year. Other winners were piano entertainers Peter Mintun, Bub Bauer and Michael Feins- tein; comedy acts W ill Durst, Marga Gomez and Faullline, and 1177 Club's Tune The Grand Up as show of the year. Council members chose 1177 Club in San Francisco and Big Mama's in Hayward as their favorite cabarets, with other awards going to Milestones for jazz, the Other Cafe for comedy, and Great American Music Hall as best night\u00ad club. Newer faces on the ballot we'll probably see nominated next year (they .scored high but didn't make the final ballot) are Julie Wilder, John Nockles and landa H ill. .. this will also be a year of well-earned prominence for Robert Frickson, Katibelle Collins. Joseph Taro and Leslie Ann Sorci. There's one more major awards ceremony coming up in San Francisco \u2014 the Bay Area Theatre Critics' Circle, April 7 at Marines Memorial Theatre. (Shall we call (hem BATS? They don't have a \" pet name\" yet!) Danny Glover and M arian Walters will be given special awards, and Superintendam John Molinari will be on hand to present one from the city. Musical numbers by the original casts will be performed from Tokens. A ir Guitar, Tooth of Crime and Tune The Grand Up, and cabaret favorite Pamela Erickson will open the evening with Lauren Bacall's Broadway showstopper \"W e l\u00ad come to the Theatre.\" Tickets for all this merriment are just $10 through BASS or Gramophone, and it's coming up a week from Monday, April 7. Rock /row page 21 barren life; \" I can feel my spine begin to crack/ I m looking for the future/I keep glancing back/ I prefer to rot/I don t want to pop.\" Jagger sounds like a man trapped; \"M y whole life is hanging on a thread/I'm the fly inside the spider's web. \" This is a far cry from the youthful cockiness of, say, \" Spider and the Fly.\" The title track is a chortling squint at the un\u00ad touched life, and \" Had It With You\" is a drowning-man rocker; Jagger, mixed midst echoes and a relentless \" chugging guitar,\" rises from the swamp; \" I love you dirty fucker/Sister and a brother/Moanin' in the mtxmlight.\" Passion and incest give way to a stumbling blues break where Jagger moans, \" It is such a sad thingA'o watch a lover die.\" Then the song resumes its lunatic bad- dream pace, lurching to a disintegrating close. The dulcet and suggestive tones of \" Sleep Tonight\" finish the nightmare; what sounds at first like a peaceful ballad becomes a fitful pack of off-beat syncopations and death imagery glued by Keith Richards croon; \" You better get some sleep tonight/You always watch the sun go down/The same old shadows crawl over town. . . '' The song ends with an admission of confusion and lost direction; \" It ain't revenge, you understand/I just want to know who dealt this hand. . .\" And thus we close our eyes. . . Except that redemption of an odd sort is at hand. The LP ends with a half-minute snatch of boogie-woogie piano, both a note of hope and a tribute to the player, \" Sixth Stone\" Ian Stewart, who died recently at 47 of heart failure and to whom the album is dedicated. Thus, a real Dirty Work, a picture of a band fissured and a man fractured. Rumors hold that Jagger is refusing a follow-up tour, so this may sound the death knell for the band. Happy days are queered again. Ann JilUan accepts her \" Local Girt Makes Good\" awardCheap and availab le. It's easy to advertise in the Sentinel, and not as expensive as you might think.

Substance abuse is an issue we can no longer afford to ignore. Drugs and alcohol don' t cause AIDS. AIDS is caused by a virus. But there are at least three ways in which alcohol and drugs can increase your chances of getting AIDS. F irst, alcoh ol a n d d ru g s d e p re ss th e im m une sy ste m a n d m ake you m ore s u s c e p \u00ad tib le to d isea se. Alcohol, marijuana, speed, cocaine, poppers, and other recreational chemicals lower your resistance to disease. In some research studies, pop\u00ad pers have been implicated in increasing the risk of KS. Drugs and alcohol weaken your health. They increase stress rather than relieve it and help the AIDS virus over\u00ad come your body' s defenses.

A huge majority of gay men in San Francisco have given up Unsafe Sex. For the relatively few who haven' t yet, studies demonstratea strong correlation between alcohol and drug use and Unsafe Sex.

If you do take the risk of using IV drugs, don' t share needles! It' s a direct route for the transmission of AIDS. There are thousands of IV drug users in America with AIDS, and probably other thousands who are still incubating the virus and who are contagious. Don' t share needles! According to experts who treat substance abuse among gay men, we have had a major epidemic of substance abuse in our community for years\u2014 so much so that most of us have accepted substance abuse as a routine part of gay life. What was once routine, however, is now deadly. If you want confidential and gay-sensitive information about substance abuse for yourself or for a friend, help is available.

Remember: Sharing needles is dangerous. Don' t share needles. Alcohol and drugs depress the immune system. Protect your health.
