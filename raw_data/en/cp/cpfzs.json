Liver and Kidney function and drainage Why do we often start treatment with liver and kidney drainage? What does drainage mean? The liver and kidneys are two very important waste removal systems of the body. When they become overwhelmed and over burdened, many symptoms can develop. Drainage means facilitating the organs' functions so that they \"drain\" toxins better. Like opening a clogged sewer. All cells in the body require a specific environment with particular nutrients, an exact pH, and proper elimination of wastes to survive and function properly. Without cleansing, the accumulated wastes within a cell would cause it to function inefficiently. A 150 lb person has about 30 trillion cells that receives nutrients from the blood and then eliminates their metabolic waste products into the venous and lymphatic systems. It is important to drain that waste to the outside so the inside remains clean. This normal physiological system, one of the pillars of maintaining health, is often neglected but it is through this system that toxins are drained from their origin within the cell to their eventual route of elimination. Causes of toxicity: - Environmental pollution - Antibiotics, hormones and pesticides in our meat, and vegetables - Lack of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants in our food - Stress can affect detox pathways - Processed food - Medications, oral contraceptives, pharmaceuticals, anaesthetics, chemotherapy, radiation, heavy metals The elimination of wastes depends on whether they are completely or incompletely catabolised. If the toxins circulate in the blood for a long time, they could seep back into the tissues and intoxicate them. The liver is the master of defense and detoxification of the blood, filtering 600L a day. Only after the liver has broken down toxins, can the elimination of those toxins begin.
