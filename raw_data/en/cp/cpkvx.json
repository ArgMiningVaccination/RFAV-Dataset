The Donaldson report, tabled in June 2000, on which the newly passed law is based, took what the Lords nowacknowledge to be an overly pessimistic view of theproperties of adult stem cells. Two years is a long time inscience, and subsequent research has confirmed their amazing ve rsatility in treating a wide variety of conditions in both humans and other mammals ( www.stemcellresearch.org ) The very latest research from the University of Minnesota (repo rted in the New Scientist , 23 January) reports discovery of a new variety of adult stem ce ll (dubbed the multipotent adult progenitor cell or MAPC) which is easy to isolate and cul ture, and has been shown, given the right conditions, to have the same versatility as the embryo stem cell, but without the risks of immune rejection, uncontrolled growth or cancer. Given the considerable technical and ethical problems of clonin g human embryos, growing international opposition to the practice and the danger that reproductive cloning will follow, it is outrageous that the Lords' committee have no t only authorised it, but have misled the British public, and especially vulnerable patient gr oups, into believing that their best hope lies in this direction. Goldenhar Syndrome A tragic breakdown in communication A high profile disagreement between doctors and the parents of a baby with a rare facial disorder was finally resolved after a seven hour High Court hea ring in Leeds, when the parents agreed to an urgent tracheotomy ( BBC News , 7 March). Twelve week old Maria Aziz Al-Rafi, the only survivor of triple ts born in Saudi Arabia, has oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia (Goldenhar syndrome), a rare c ondition affecting only one in 500,000 babies, and has no right eye or ear, and only half a no se and jaw. She will require 18 years of surgery to correct abnormalities, and doctors at Ro yal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle-upon-Tyne had wanted to perform a preliminary tracheo tomy to secure her airway and assess the anatomy. But the parents, who had already started a public appeal to rai se \u00a3500,000 for private reconstructive surgery in the US, threatened to withdraw their child from the intensive care ward after the mother clashed with a consultant over proposed t reatment. They were worried about losing their daughter during surgery, and also ab out 'medical staff experimenting and trying different procedures'. Lord Fenwick, of the Newcastle Hospitals Trust, in taking the c ase to court said, 'The hospital was obligated to act in the best interest of the child '. Legally, the balance of power over a child is weighted in the p arents' favour, on the assumption that parents will look after a child better than the State. But these rights do not extend to letting a child die or suffer by refusing necessary m edical treatment. But it is tragic that what began as a breakdown of communicatio n between doctors and parents should escalate into a full-blown media circus and cour t proceeding. It is a reminder that good medicine involves far more than technical expertise. It is as much about understanding anxieties, addressing fears, patiently answering questions and giving information, and communicating empathy in a way that gains trus t. The doctor/patient relationship, is a relationship, not a contract.HFEA Decision on Designer babies An unethical and dangerous precedent A Leeds couple, Shahana and Raj Hashmi, have been given permissionto create a baby to act as a bonemarrow donor for their son Zain, whosuffers from thalassemia. Nocompatible donor has been found.The couple will undergo IVFtreatment with the resulting embryosbeing screened for both thalassemia and tissue compatibility. Any resulting baby will donateumbilical stem cells after birth. In defending the judgement, Michael Nazir Ali, Bishop of Rochester, who chairs the Human Fertilisationand Embryology Authority's ethics committee said, 'Weare minimising harm and maximising good...this is nota liberty hall for the child to be created as some sort ofspare parts factory'. The use of umbilical cord stem cells in bone marrow transplants is an exciting scientific advance, which ifsuccessful, offers the chance of a cure for otherwise fatalinherited blood disorders, with minimal risk to the donor. But in allowing preimplantation diagnosis and embryo selection in order to ensure the birth of tissue-matcheddonor babies, the HFEA have set an unethical anddangerous precedent. It is unethical because the approved procedure involves destroying embryos that fail to fulfil the selection criteria.Whilst it is true that in very rare circumstances, the onlyway of ensuring that a tissue-matched donor is born, is touse this kind of 'search and destroy' technology, the endof saving a human life never justifies such means. Thisruling moves the goalposts even further than before asembryos, which are of the wrong tissue type, butotherwise normal, are to be discarded in order to treat acondition which is not necessarily fatal. The precedent is also dangerous because, despite the HFEA's assurance that the procedure will be used only in'very rare circumstances and under strict controls', theruling is likely to lead to a slippery slope whereby designerembryos and fetuses can be created and destroyed formore and more trivial reasons. It also cannot be in the bestinterests of any donor child, however much they aresubsequently loved, to be created for the primary purposeof providing transplant material for somebody else. And ifthe umbilical cord transplant fails to work, for whateverreason, then pressure may well be on the resulting child toprovide stem cells via more invasive harvesting procedures.

What the headline boils downto is that the Board for Social Responsibility (BSR) of the Church of England threw its weight behind therecommendations of the House of Lords' Select Committee onStem Cells. The BSR is mandated to advise the Church onmatters of public policy. But there are thousands of Anglicanchurchgoers who have never even heard of the BSR and wouldnot feel themselves bound one way or the other by its views. Bu t this is just one small part of what looks very much like a 'sti tch- up'. The Select Committee, chaired by the Bishop of Oxford, theRt Rev Richard Harries, silenced voices that believed that stemcell research on human embryos was unethical and dismissedwithout giving a hearing voices wishing to put the case for analternative - adult stem cell research. The Committee's remit was to 'examine the ethical, legal, scientific, medical and commercial issues surrounding theRegulations as they stand'. There was a mountain of writtenevidence. The Committee heard addresses from over 43 personswith oral evidence from ethical, scientific and medicalperspectives and the BioIndustry Association, but according toPro-Life activists scientists who hold that adult stem cell res earch is superior to research on embryos were excluded and did not ge t a hearing. Pro-Life agencies also criticised what they see asfailure to take into account legal issues raised by the recentJudicial Review sponsored by the Pro-Life Alliance. The critics also pointed out an imbalance of representation of religious communities in the oral evidence. Only Church of Engl and voices were heard from the Christian community. They claim thatMuslim input was 'minimal' while no witnesses were called onbehalf of the Sikhs and Hindus. Lord Alton of Liverpool described the Committee's findings as 'disappointingly predictable, bereft of any new insights, ethic ally compromised, and already eclipsed by exciting new scientificdevelopments in adult stem cells research'. 2 He said the inquiry had been 'one-sided'. The appointment of a senior cleric (the Bishop of Oxford) to chair the enquiry hadadded to 'the general sense of cynicism' and was designed 'togive a cloak of respectability to a process that diminisheshumanity and wantonly destroys life'. He was critical, too, of the way scientific evidence was marsha lled. 'The further appointment of an \"impartial\" scientific adviser t o the Committee, who is himself a leading protagonist and practitione r, adds general contempt and cynicism about this risible process.' The Committee, he said, had not only failed to give properconsideration to the case for adult stem cell research. It had 'failed to investigate the significant commercial interests dri ving the cloning agenda'. Lord Alton said that Britain would now 'need to look to Europe and the USA to uphold the sanctity of human life and todemonstrate that the pursuit of scientific excellence does nothave to involved the destruction of early human life'. If Pro-Life campaigners are right and the selection of who would supply oral evidence to the Committee was relentlesslyweighted towards those who argue for the benefits of cell nucle ar replacement and embryonic stem cell replacement (CNR), stemcell research has a serious credibility problem. Such a stitch- up does no good for Parliament in a climate where more and morepeople are cynical about its relevance. There are reputable scientific journals who at least voice disquiet about CNR. Meanwhile advances are taking place allthe time in adult stem cell research. We have to hope and praythat truth will out. Christian divisions This turn of events makes absolutely clear what has been known for some time. There is a gulf between the Pro Life Movement an d the Church of England (at least the Board for Social Responsibi lity at Church House and the Bishops in the House of Lords for whomit acts as a Civil Service). There is fault on both sides and t he situation has not been helped by divisions among Pro-Lifers and the extreme tactics used by some of their allies in the USA. More importantly it indicates a serious division between Anglicans and the Catholic Church over what is a defining issue in moral theology. As reported in the last issue of Triple Helix 3a heavyweight brigade of theologians and ethicists, many of themCatholics, reject the arguments marshalled by the Bishop of Oxf ord in support of the use of embryos in stem cell research. Indeed but for the interventions of the Catholic Church, in particular by Pope John-Paul II, few members of the general pub lic would even have been aware of adult stem cell research as anoption. So what price ecumenical advance now?

Triple Helix 2002; Winter:5,6Stem Cell Stitch Up Pro-Life voices claim they were silencedPhoto: Wellcome Photo Libraryreview A report to the Chief Medical Officer by an independent working party has considered best practice in managingChronic Fatigue. 1But the working party's conclusions caused six resignations from its committee. The four medical specialists who resigned constituted the majority of th e expert medical members. The working party had used a 'trident' approac h to evaluating the medical evidence: trying to find consensus from research findings, considered clinical opinion and patients' anecdotal s tories. What is in a name? The report adopts the name CFS/ME as an interim title for the condition, while an international USA-based group is currently looking for a more acceptable title. The term 'fatigue', according to t he report, provokes 'strong loathing' from sufferers, who do not consider it to be their main problem. Many consider it demeaning yet it is the sine qua nonof the illness. 'Myalgic' is inappropriate, as muscle pain is n ot a significant feature for many patients. 'Encephalomyelitis', imp lying inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, is plainly incorrect . There is no evidence for it. An acceptable title would remove unnecessar y conflict that is present at the beginning of the important doct or/patient relationship. Approaches to management The working party identified three successful approaches to modifying the condition that are offered on equal terms. These are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Graded Exercise Programmesand Pacing. There is now good documented trial evidence for the first two but none at all for the third. 2,3A number of clinicians advocate pacing as part of a 'common sense' approach to fatigue. Patient s and patient self-help groups also advocate it strongly. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Evidence is accumulating that CBT helps most patients. The core components of this approach to CFS/ME include energy/activitymanagement, establishing a sleep routine, goal setting andpsychological support. Three out of four randomised, controlled trials found positive benefits. Few patients felt worse though only a few reported complete recovery. However, some patients refuse what they see to be a psychological treatment for what they perceive to b e a physical illness. They need to be encouraged to take a holistic view of their illness, open to both physical and psychological interven tions. The lack of general availability of CBT is a cause for concern. Graded Exercise Based on the belief that CFS/ME is maintained, though not cause d, by inactivity, graded exercise seeks to offer a structured and supervised programme of gradual and increasing aerobic activities such asswimming or walking. This is initially based on the patient's c urrent physical capacity. All three randomised controlled trials publi shed so far have found varying degrees of improvement. Very few participant s reported feeling worse, though patient surveys revealed more ne gative feedback for this than any other form of treatment, including d rug treatments. Pacing The principles and practice of pacing are described in the 1994 task force report.4While some clinicians advocate pacing within a framework of graded exercise, there lies within this approach a ninternal contradiction. The theory behind pacing holds that the sufferer only has a certain amount of available energy (physical, mental and emotional) that is limited and finite. There is held to be a 'g lass ceiling' that the patient cannot go beyond. Therefore, energy expenditur e must be kept within budget throughout the day, maintaining a carefulbalance between expenditure and rest. Critics maintain that if the patient is encouraged to believe t hat there is only so much energy available, there is no scope for increas ing the amount of exercise. Bound by the conviction that their illness is essentially a physical condition, patients with strongly held b eliefs about pacing are trapped into a lifestyle of persisting inactiv ity; this itself perpetuates the fatigue. Inactivity is held by many clinicians to be a root cause of con tinued symptoms. Physical deconditioning has physiological consequence s: muscle wasting, sleep disturbance, balance problems, autonomicdysfunction and loss of confidence may all result from it. The Expert Patient? Underlying the philosophy of the report is the view that patien ts should be encouraged to be experts in their own right and shoul d become key decision makers in their own care.5Patients' fixed beliefs, not open to evidence or discussion, are not addressed in the re port. However worthy it is, the approach of regarding the patient as an expert clearly would have limited usefulness in various otherconditions. Patients are not always in the best position to eva luate treatments objectively. The report advocates the various ME self-help groups without drawing attention to the dangers of prejudice and fixed beliefspropagated by some of these organisations; not least in denyingpsychological factors, denigrating psychotropic medications andpromoting a rigid view of pacing. 6 Christians will welcome the working party's approach of getting alongside and listening to a group of patients who often feel a lienated from orthodox medical care and is vulnerable to alternative the rapists' claims. They will be less welcoming of recommendations that are not soundly based in objective evidence, are undergirded by a new'political correctness' and may leave patients trapped in their illness by their own false perceptions.

Op cit : section 4.3.2Peter May reports on clashes between consumers and scientists Chronic Fatigue SyndromeChristian GPs are aware that health includes a spiritual component. Butto what extent should we take someresponsibility for our patients' spiritual welfare? In particular, is it 'OK' to talk toour patients in surgery about Jesus? The Bible isquite clear about evangelism. We are told aboutthe lost sheep, how the harvest is plentiful but theworkers are few 1and Jesus' great commission to go and make disciples of all nations.2Paul takes up the theme: 'how can they believe in the one ofwhom they have not heard? And how can they hearwithout someone preaching to them?' 3If the exhortations to preach the Gospel are clear inScripture, what reasons might there be forreluctance to do so in the surgery? Not my job Firstly, the surgery is not a church. Evangelism is primarily the job of the minister and a few othersto whom special gifts have been given. The Biblefuels this view: 'It was he who gave some to beapostles, some to be prophets, some to beevangelists'. 4Clearly, some Christians (eg. Apostle Paul and Billy Graham) have been given specialgifts (and the time!) to be 'professional'evangelists. Does this let the rest of us off thehook? If we look at other Scriptures, it is prettyclear that it doesn't. Paul said, 'Since, then, weknow what it is to fear the Lord, we try topersuade men'. 5There is a hint of urgency here, which he further emphasised by saying 'for I amcompelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preachthe gospel'. 6Whilst he is clearly talking about himself here, the lesson for us is clear - and reflectswhat Jesus said himself: 'If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinfulgeneration, the Son of Man will be ashamed of himwhen he comes in his Father's glory'. 7 Peter goes further and makes a general comment: 'Always be prepared to give an answerto everyone who asks you to give the reason for thehope that you have'. 8 His words teach that evangelism is a job for all Christians, at all times and in all places, includingthe surgery. An abuse of trust A second common objection is that we are abusing our position of trust as doctors by forcingour views on patients. Evangelism is thereforerather naughty, underhand, best kept secret and allright only as long as nothing goes 'wrong'. Wouldn'tit simply be easier and less risky to preach thegospel elsewhere and leave our patients alone? But to whom or what do we owe our allegiance? Is it to politically correct behaviour, our colleaguesattitudes or to Jesus himself? Jesus memorablysaid, 'Give to Caesar is Caesar's, and to Godwhat is God's'. 9Evangelism doesn't alter our service commitment and thus Caesar should haveno cause for complaint. But Jesus also said: 'Allauthority in heaven and on earth has been given tome'. 10We preach under his authority, at his command and with the very best interests of ourpatients as our goal. Rather than being underhandor somehow ashamed of evangelism, let us be boldfor Christ in surgery, remembering that Peterteaches us to do so with gentleness and respect. 11 This is essential. 6 TRIPLE HELIX ISPRING 02evangelism Evangelism is too important to leave to others, argues Richard Scott Good news in the Surgery We have greater access to non-Christians in a congenial environment than most fulltime ministers.Good news in the Surgeryevangelism No time A third objection to evangelism in the surgery is lack of time. Preaching the gospel, even to a coupleof patients per surgery would surely lengthen theworking day. I'd like to answer this point from twoangles - firstly by looking at how we work andsecondly by considering job satisfaction. Certainly, if evangelism is merely added onto existing work patterns, it will increase consultationtimes. My own practice is to deal with simplecomplaints (eg. tonsillitis) relatively quickly, thusallowing myself more time for situations in whichthe gospel might reasonably be introduced (eg.depression). You may also wish to give somepatients more time by altering your workingpractices. This limits the risk of burnout and allowsus to give to God what is due him. How doesevangelism in clinic affect the evangelist? Just as'faith comes from hearing the message', 12so our own faith increases as we speak the Word of God.Paul encouraged Philemon to share his faith, so thathe would have a fuller understanding of Christ. 13 And it's fun! God's will is good and perfect but alsopleasing 14- evangelism isn't a chore, it's tremendously exciting and uplifting. Getting practical Does evangelism in the surgery work? Isaiah was clear that the words of God's mouth would notreturn to him empty 15and we can be confident that fruit will develop. In 1996, Palmer reportedsadly that only 5/30 Christian doctors in oneseminar felt that it was right to use their position asdoctors to evangelise. Unsurprisingly, when askedlater how many of them had led others to Christ itwas this same cohort of five. 16We can expect God to reward our efforts similarly. How, practically, can we introduce God into consultations? In my experience, having prayed fordiscernment and his words at the beginning ofclinic, God speaks to us quietly about whom topresent the gospel. My own particular focus is ondepressed patients and anyone wearing a cross.The latter are often lapsed Christians who carrymuch guilt and welcome the chance to discusstheir faith - truly fertile ground. The Christiannotice board in the waiting room and glossy postersin my room act as talking points. Only last week asix-year boy read the words from John 8:32 on aposter and professed his belief in Christ. I was ableto give him a Bible the next day. Practically, having spoken to a patient about Jesus and gained his/her interest, what do we donext? Clearly, we can pray there and then if itseems right, give out a 'Knowing God Personally'or a gospel, but what then? This is where theChurch comes in - I refer everyone to the localAlpha course and there is a fair take-up. I'minvolved in the course and it's tremendouslygratifying to see my patients attending and makingcommitments to Christ. Here are brief testimonies from two of my patients who attended the lastAlpha course:JC - a recovering alcoholic - 'I thank God for now I know he walks with me, hand in hand'. JN - an elderly lady with cancer who died soon after the Alpha course - 'I have a greaterunderstanding of my beliefs (and) havegained peace'. We must ask ourselves, the question - why has God placed us with access to thousands of lostsheep? The parable of the prodigal son shows notonly how pleased God is when people return tohim but how desperate their plight is if they don't.People are dying for the lack of the gospelmessage; eternal separation from God in Hell istheir future. It has been said that bringingsomeone to Christ is the greatest service that oneman can render another. It is as if we are sitting ina lifeboat with the lifebelt in our hands. Ourpatients are floundering in the water and ourlifebelt maybe their only chance for survival. We are in a position second to none to reach the lost in our local area. We certainly have a greateraccess to non-Christians in a congenialenvironment than most fulltime ministers. LizCroton, in a previous issue, talked about hospitalsas funny, unique mission fields. 17Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, 'Oh, that you would bless meand enlarge my territory'. 18Our territory, our peculiar mission field, is our patients. If we askGod for the opportunity, he'll answer our prayer ashe did Jabez. Evangelism is far too important a jobto leave to others. Richard Scott is a part-time GP in Cliftonville, Kent and formerly a medical missionary in Tanzania SPRING 02 nTRIPLE HELIX 7 Evangelism is a job for all Christians, at all times and in all places,and Christian GPs are in aunique position to reachthe lost in their local area.Sharing the gospel withpatients is not an abuse oftrust because God himselfgives us the authority andsalvation is their greatestneed. We need to allowtime for consultations inwhich the gospel mightreasonably be introduced;but with prayer,discernment, selection anda sensible approach withgood upevangelism ceases to be achore and becomestremendously exciting anduplifting.

Sharing Christ with Patients. Triple Helix 2001; Summer:16-17 18. 1 Chronicles 4:10Adoption is not a modern idea. Roman Civil law legislated adoption in orderto provide a male heir for the estate.This sentiment is reflected in the adoption laws of various European and LatinAmerican countries. 1In contrast, British law is based on Judeo-Christian beliefs. Here adoptionhas always been used primarily to safeguard andpromote the child's welfare. 2 Concern for the welfare of the child is also the main impetus for the Government's current proposalson adoption fuelled by the increase in child abuse inchildren's homes. For currently there are about55,300 children in care who are eligible for adoption. 3 In 1970 the number of adoptions nationwide wasaround 20,000 per year, but by 1999 it had fallen to4,100. (This fall also reflects the growing incidence ofabortion and the removal of stigma against having achild outside marriage.) Under current adoption law children may only be adopted by married couples or a single person.Ninety-five per cent of adoptions are by marriedcouples. 4There are fears that an amendment to the Adoption and Children Bill may extend theright to adopt to unmarried couples: bothhomosexual and heterosexual. 5 Homosexual parents per se are not a new phenomenon. Many children raised by homosexualsare born within marriage 6but after their birth their father or mother declares same-sex preferences. Theoffspring of lesbians whose mothers have opted forself-insemination using donor sperm from either asympathetic male 7or a sperm bank8are fewer in number. Yet it is the emergence of this new type offamily that has evoked support from socialscientists. There have been many attempts todismiss the adverse effects of this kind ofrelationship while claiming they provide all thebenefits (and more) of two married parents. This propaganda has had a dangerously misleading effect, and public policy has beeninfluenced to the extent that homosexual adoption is seen as a viable option for children. Theassumption that homosexual parents will make goodadoptive parents has arisen despite a complete lackof data on the comparative effects of homosexualfoster care or adoption, and the questionableinterpretation of the available information about theeffects of homosexual parenting. Families with homosexual parent(s) are relatively uncommon and therefore recruitment is difficult.Consequently sample sizes are small, for exampleone often-quoted study that looked at gay fathers andtheir children interviewed only 40 men. 9Similarly one of the most eminent studies, which followed upthe children of single mothers, both lesbian andheterosexual, over 15 years, had 27 mothers and 39children in each group at the beginning. However bythe end of the study although 51 mothers weretraced, only 25 children from the lesbian families and21 children from the heterosexual families werewilling to participate. 10In many homosexual parenting studies, anecdotal evidence or personalopinion is repeatedly presented as fact. For example,one study, which created headline news reportingthat gay dads make better fathers, was based on theopinion of about 100 men, some of whom were noteven fathers but hoped to be in the future. 11 Despite their flaws, these studies still show that between eight per cent12and 33 per cent13of children with homosexual parents subsequently adopt ahomosexual lifestyle as adults. This consequence isexplained by describing 'same-gender sexualattraction' as a positive trait derived from open-mindedness and acceptance of homosexuality. 14Yet many adolescents are often afraid or too embarrassedto tell their peers about their home circumstances 15 and young children suffer from gender confusion.Thus 40 per cent of the sons of lesbian mothersdisplayed mainly feminine qualities whilst 50 percent of their daughters showed mainly masculinequalities. By contrast, among the children of 8 TRIPLE HELIX nSPRING 02public policy British adoption law is based on Judeo- Christian ethics, which makethe welfare of the childparamount. But newgovernment proposals, in aneffort to increase adoptions,may extend the right toadopt to unmarried couples:both homosexual andheterosexual. The assumptionthat homosexuals will adoptive parents itsroots contemporarypostmodern ideology ratherthan evidence-basedresearch. By contrast, anoverwhelming weight ofevidence shows that childrenwith married parents farebest in life, having fewerbehaviour and psychiatricproblems and less anti-socialbehaviour. Whilst adoption isa Christian concept which isechoed in God's adoption ofus into his family throughChrist's death on the cross,homosexual adoption runscounter to Christian conceptsof sexuality, family and childdevelopment. KEY POINTSSeyi Hotonu takes issue with new government proposals Gay adoptionpublic policy heterosexual mothers, none of the boys had predominantly feminine characteristics or the girlspredominantly masculine characteristics. 16As the fifth commandment implies, children need a mother anda father as a role model with each parent providing acomplementary but different perspective. Even lone-and lesbian-parenting manuals acknowledge this andoften encourage the creation of an 'extended' familyconsisting of friends and past partners. 17 The further away you move from the traditional family structure, the poorer the outcomes for children(see box). The largest study to compare children ofmarried, cohabiting and homosexual parents, 30even though it was carried out by someone with gay rightssympathies, showed that children of gay couplesperformed the worst in school followed by thechildren of cohabiting couples whilst the children ofmarried couples performed the best. Homosexual adoption is radically opposed to the Judaeo-Christian family ethic which views marriageas the only right context for sexual relations,procreation and childrearing. 31Christian involvement in adoption and fostering is rooted insome central Christian beliefs. Paul argues that allChristian believers are adopted into God's familyand have the full rights as sons. 32This adoption is made possible only by Christ's sacrifice of himselfon the cross in our place, as the substitute for oursins. As Christ said: 'Greater love hath no man thanthis, that a man lay down his life for his friends'. 33 Christians are to show this same love towards theirneighbours because they themselves arebeneficiaries of God's love in being adopted as sons.This is a very strong motivation to care for childrenin need, particularly for those who have no parents.

Peter Saunders (PS) talks to Peter Pattisson (PP) onrecent developments at the International ChristianMedical and Dental Association (ICMDA). PS: Peter, we hear that ICMDA has just appointed a new General Secretary to follow on from you. Can you tell us a little about him? PP:Ralph Sinn and his wife Barbara both graduated from the University of Alberta Medical School, Canada, in 1984. Ralph is a family physician practising in Edmonton, Alberta, with a specia l interest in general practice psychiatry. They have four childre n aged 7 to 13 and Barbara works two half days a week in general practic e. Ralph attended the ICMDA 's Executive Committee meetings in Apri l last year and from that time the Lord began to lay on his heart a calling to work with ICMDA. The appointment was confirmed inFebruary and Ralph expects to take up the position on 1 October . It has been agreed that ICMDA 's international office will move fro m Cambridge to Edmonton, Alberta. PS: That certainly is a major move. ICMDA has always been based in UK. What implications do you see for CMF UK's rolein ICMDA? PP:ICMDA 's office at one time was within CMF's offices in Partners hip House. ICMDA 's office relocated to Cambridge ten years ago, in part to dispel the perception that ICMDA was simply the internationa l arm of CMF UK. The move to Canada is a further step ininternationalisation and will raise ICMDA 's profile in NorthAmerica. CMDS Canada already has heavy involvement ininternational programmes and is well placed to provide local su pport for the ICMDA office. PS: Canada - Yes. But isn't Edmonton a bit 'out in the sticks'? PP:In one sense, but in today's world of modern communications the actual office location is a secondary matter. As it is, we have almost no personal visitors to the office in Cambridge. We looked care fully at other options but Canada is as good a choice as any. PS: What about Europe? With so much happening in Europe at present, and so much need, do you think this will lead to adilution of ICMDA's contribution in Europe? PP:No, part of ICMDA 's strategy over the last two years has been t o develop effective regional committees supporting and guidingadequately funded regional secretaries across the world and I h ave agreed to take up a role as Regional Secretary for Europe for u p to two years while we develop the structures and look for a younge r person for a substantive appointment. The next ICMDA EuropeanRegional Conference is in Germany in September 2004. I hope tha t by that time I will be handing over an effective ongoing programme . PS: T ell us a little about recent encouragements in ICMDA.PP:With over 50 affiliated national movements now ICMDA continues to grow. Dr Warurua Mugo in East Africa and Dr RicardoZandrino in South America as regional secretaries are bothexperienced in the work and widely respected. Last year we esta blished committees in East Africa and South America to support them. Aswell as Europe, this year we hope to establish an effective com mittee in East Asia. The other area that is enormously encouraging is the student wo rk. New groups among medical and dental students seem to be springi ng up all over the world. Mark Pickering has made a tremendouscontribution in this area as ICMDA 's Student Secretary. Over th e next couple of years he too will be looking for his successor. Over Easter East African students are meeting for a retreat in Mombasa. ICM DA was able to make a grant to their travel expenses. In Zambia a large group of students from Lusaka is hoping to attend the TaiwanCongress, raising approximately \u00a31,000 each toward their expens es from local sponsorship and support. PS: You mention T aiwan and some of us are already coming to that World Congress in July. How are the preparations going? PP:Very well and we are looking forward to a great conference. The programme of plenary sessions and seminars is now tied up and t he President of Taiwan will address the welcome dinner. When the bursary allocation committee met in February we had \u00a365,000 to allocate, from the generosity of donors around the w orld. We expect to help around 150 people. Each delegate will contrib ute something, and many have been challenged to ask in faith for mo re than they initially indicated that they could contribute. We ar e particularly praying that there will be representatives from ev ery country in East Asia as well as across the world. We know that these conferences have played a pivotal role in establishing andstrengthening new national movements in the past. PS: I'm a great ICMDA enthusiast. How can CMF support ICMDA more? PP:First to say a big 'thank you' to CMF and its members for all they are already doing through support, prayers, encouragem ent and financial generosity. I am particularly keen to establish ICMDA 's development fund on a firmer financial basis. CMF members have contributed significan tly to this and I hope that this will continue. Perhaps the move to Ca nada will help to internationalise our prayer and funding support. Anumber of CMF members are already checked in for Taiwan butthere's plenty of room for more. Please come to encourage other s and to be encouraged. Thank you CMF and let's have more of the same. 10 TRIPLE HELIX ISPRING 02mission Peter Pattisson gives an international update. ICMDA New frontiers Warurua Mugo, Peter Pattisson, Ralph Sinn, Ricardo Zandrino.orphans A short visit to Russia last autumn took me to join Moscow's ChristianMedical Mission (CMM) under thedirectorship of Dr Olga Polezhaeva. We visited two city orphanages and another in T uladistrict, near T olstoy's old home. Each held about50 orphaned or abused children, aged 5-16 years.Throughout Russia and the old USSR there arethousands of orphans, many even younger. Theircare varies and I probably saw the best, withchildren as physically well cared for as $5 per headper month allows, plus $5 more a year allocated for health needs. Despite a few staff psychologists,many orphans must have deep emotional wounds.One young teenager had lost his natural parentsand was then adopted by a couple who later diedof alcoholism. In a few years time, he will either bealone in a State flat or a young soldier. The team aims to examine and, if possible, treat the children and to share with them the practical loveof Christ. Open evangelism could risk closed doors.The Russian Christian doctors currently have officialpermission to visit, with overseas doctors as theirguests. 'Protestantism' is seen to be distinct from(and less desirable than) Russian orthodoxy, so it islove in action which gives entry and sometimesprompts further questions. Our trendy youngpsychologist went down well, with talks about saying'No to drugs, tobacco and casual sex', but somechildren told him, 'We hate being in an orphanage -we want families, but nobody wants bigger children.'We left them a few educational videos with aChristian flavour, along with Bibles, small gifts,sweets and toothbrushes. At Yasnia Polyana, youngchurch members from T ula performed Christiansongs and sketches. In the medical room, various pieces of equipment, sent to CMM as aid, allowed routineelectrocardiography and abdominal and thyroidultrasound for all. Gall-bladder disease was reportedin 15% of orphans, so far with no control series. Anew Russian laser beam therapy was in use for chestinfections. This all indicated the shortage of morecustomary therapies which, apart from their expense,can be limited by import regulations banning anymedication from certain drug companies and allnarcotic drugs. Antibiotics and dental amalgam arecostly or scarce so there is great reliance on overseas aid. More clinical teaching would be welcomed, too. Church life of various kinds is active, but poverty can limit vision. My Christian interpreter, who hadnot visited an orphanage before, promptly took alonga hairdresser friend to cut the children's neglectedhair. Better still, as he told his church of theexperience, a few Christian women asked if theycould visit the children. This was a real thrill, as mostorphans have little experience of home life. One ofthe directors, herself a resident, told me, 'I nowbelieve that orphanages are prisons. Children needfamilies.' There is a Christian project in Moscowwhich aims to link orphans with foster parents andsoundings are now going on about reduplicating thisfacility, but it will need more cash. How lovely itwould be if orphaned children could meet with Jesusas they are welcomed into loving Christian homes. Members of the Christian Medical Association in Moscow share in CMM's ministry and try to meetweekly for prayer and Bible study. They are hard-pressed and wearied by trying so lovingly to care forso many, yet with minimal supplies. Even so, I wastouched by their warm and generous welcome (andlovely singing!). They badly need practical help andsupplies, but they also covet our support in prayer. Janet Goodall is retired Pediatrician in Stoke-on-Trent SPRING 02 ITRIPLE HELIX 11Orphans in Russia T he term 'orphan' includes approx. 90% social orphans, held in o rphanages because of abuse or social deprivation, as well as children who se parents have died. Accurate figures are hard to come by. One estimate ( circa 1990) suggested that 19,000 children were held in orphanages in St Pe tersburg alone, with 10,000 more abandoned or living rough in that city.1Rising levels of unemployment and alcoholism since then must have sent even more children into institutional care. Many such children are too readily labelled 'oligophrenic' (men tally retarded) but without adequate evaluation, little or no special education and rare review. One independent study found that 66% of 82 children from 10 institu tions were within the normal range on non-verbal developmental and IQ testing.2 It is hoped that interventions by Baroness Cox and others will gradually improve matters, but as ever, there is inadequate funding even for existing levels of c are.How Christ's love is touching children in Moscow.

(ibid p35).Asylum seekers are frequently portrayed as bogus or economic migrants who enter thecountry illegally and should be locked up and sent back where they came from. One of thesestatements is true: if you are forced to flee yourcountry there are few ways of doing it legally.Many have tragic stories and very genuine groundsfor claiming asylum but inevitably there are somewho have less than honourable motives. The 1951 Geneva Convention defines a refugee as: 'One who owing to a well-founded fear ofbeing persecuted for reasons of race, religion,nationality, membership of a particular socialgroup or political opinion is outside the country ofhis nationality and is unable, or owing to suchfear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protectionof that country'. At the beginning of 2000, there were more than 22 million displaced people worldwide. 75% wereseeking refuge in another region of their owncountry or in the developing world. Only fourpercent were seeking asylum in Europe with lessthan one percent in the UK. 1There are various reasons for seeking asylum in another country,mostly unchanged over the centuries. Naturaldisasters, poverty and famine still compel theirvictims to move to a place of safety. War and civilwar uproot innocent people from their homes enmasse in fear for their lives. Alternativelyindividuals or specific groups find themselves thetargets of violence. Governments may persecutevarious religions as well as cultural, ethnic andpolitical groups. Ineffectual or corrupt governmentcauses situations of lawlessness and politicalinstability. Individual refugees may be strongidealists, active in politics and aware of possiblerecrimination, or unfortunates, born in the wrongplace at the wrong time to families on the wrongside of the conflict.The UK situation Refugees come to the UK as single men or women, couples, unaccompanied children, singleparents with children or whole families. Theirreasons for seeking asylum may include persecution,imprisonment, torture or rape. The journey out oftheir home environment may have been hazardousand uncomfortable. Many have stayed in basicconditions at a refugee camp and travelled incramped lorries or walked long distances. Humantraffickers are often the only option for a successfuljourney and they charge huge fees, requiringrefugees to sell all their possessions. On arrival in the UK they are met with a whole series of new challenges. Escape had been adream: their Utopian destination often fails tomeet expectations. They are confronted by theHome Office and NASS (National Asylum SupportService) and a confusing asylum system: it is easyto stumble at various hurdles and so be refusedasylum on grounds of non-compliance. Thehousing is usually in the poorest of areas. Thesubsistence living allowance consists largely ofvouchers, instantly identifying the bearer as anasylum seeker. Racist attacks and attitudes are notuncommon. Communication is often a struggleincreasing their isolation. The asylum seeker's lifeis a perpetual waiting exercise involving intenseanxiety, boredom, frustration and loss of status. Top seven countries of origin of refugees arriving in UK Since April 2000, asylum seekers arriving in the UK have been dispersed around the country whileawaiting the government's decision on their claimto be recognised as refugees.

KEY POINTSThree GPs give their perspective has become a prominent political issue. As Christians and as doctors we are more likelythan ever before to come into contact with theseindividuals in our communities, surgeries, clinicsand wards. A biblical perspective The Bible makes it clear that God is sovereign over all peoples: his plans and purposes willprevail. 2He is compassionate and just, concerned for the poor and vulnerable from every nation.3 He wants everyone to know the truth andexperience his saving grace. 4 In a world rife with conflict, displacement and terror, the prophet Micah gives a vision of hope:nations looking to the Lord for his truth andjustice, resulting in freedom from fear, everyperson safe in his own home and land. 5 Refugees in the Bible In apparently unlikely circumstances, godly refugees influenced the destiny of their hostnations: consider Joseph in Egypt, Daniel inBabylon and Esther in Persia. Jesus made it clearthat his disciples would be hated by the nationsand would flee from their homes. 6So, the scattered church spread the good news of Jesus whereverthey went. 7 The Bible acknowledges the psychological impact of being forced to leave one's belovedcountry. 8The Old T estament is insistent concerning the responsibility of God's peopletowards foreigners. 9Translation and Torture GPs working with refugees and asylum seekers face several specific challenges, two of which arecommunication using interpreters and dealing withpatients who have experience of torture. A while ago a hospital colleague told me that his department had opted out of providing interpretersas it was too much hassle. This is obviouslynonsense. There must be full understandingbetween doctor and patient before prescribing amedicine or performing an operation. If not, whypractise medicine instead of veterinary science?Working with an interpreter is not easy. It takesgreat effort to speak normally, using eye contactand the second grammatical sense, whilst yourpatient looks at you blankly, waits for theinterpreter to say his bit. Nevertheless, if you aremotivated and have a motivated interpreter, theeffort will be worthwhile. Suddenly theconsultation seems to 'gel' with both patient anddoctor almost unaware of the interpreter. Some fascinating research shows that doctors and nurses tend to avoid ward patients who areterminally ill. Sexual abuse victims often complainthat no one appeared interested when they wantedto talk. T orture victims equally find themselvesignored and sidelined by health professionals. Thiscan be an expression of doctors' own fears of death,impotence or shattered illusions. However, givingin to our fears means denying care to those whoneed it most. How should we provide adequate care for survivors of torture? 10,11Firstly, make yourself available to these patients. Their stories are hard tolisten to but many survivors find relief in simplybeing heard by someone without being rejected. Itcan be the first and most important step to recovery.Secondly, there are many forms of helpful therapy:physiotherapy can have almost miraculous results,cognitive behavioural therapy may be beneficialand medication is sometimes necessary. However,unless we listen in the first place, patients may notreturn to benefit from these therapies. Opportunities There are many medical opportunities to become involved with refugees.12There are several medical organisations with concerns for asylumseekers and torture victims. 12,13Many churches are also leading by example in providing drop-incentres where second-hand clothes and otherarticles can be obtained. Opportunities abound foroffering friendship. We are reminded of Jesus' words: 'I was a stranger and you invited me in...Whatever you didfor one of the least of these brothers of mine, youdid for me'. 15 Rebecca MacFarlane, Katherine McKenzie and Peter von Kaehne are salaried GPs caring for asylumseekers and refugees.

In the last financial year, eight of the elevencompanies spent nothing on research anddevelopment into sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis orChagas' disease. One company did not answer thequestion. T wo reported spending on malaria and fivereported spending on tuberculosis, but sevenreported spending less than 1% of their research anddevelopment budget on any of the five diseaseshighlighted. The authors commented, 'Drugs are notdeveloped according to public health need butaccording to profitability'. In fact, not much has changed in the last twenty years. In 1979 Prof Franz Gross wrote, 'theconcentration of research efforts on a relatively smallnumber of fields, which look promising from acommercial point of view, has had the consequenceof a crowding in some areas of research and a neglectof others'. 2Similar views were expressed in 1981 by Griffin and Diggle3who wrote, 'The bulk of new chemical entities licensed have been limited to arelatively small number of therapeutic groups...infact conditions which are largely chronic and occurprincipally in the affluent Western Society.Innovation is therefore directed towards commercialreturns rather than therapeutic need. Thepharmaceutical industry like any other majorindustry is of necessity motivated by the need to beprofitable'. Diana Melrose of Oxfam 4reported in 1983 that only one to three per cent of theinternational pharmaceutical industry's total researchand development allocations is devoted specificallyto tropical diseases. One has to be careful of taking these comments as an outright condemnation of the research basedpharmaceutical industry - this would be naive.T aylor and Griffin 5writing on the subject of ' Orphan Diseases, Orphan Medicines and Orphan Patients ' in 1985 dissected the issue into three categories oforphan. First, those cases in which the condition tobe treated is prevalent only in a very small sectionof the global population. T ype I orphans suffer fromrare diseases. In such instances, the ratio of the costsof research, development and production againstprojected market earnings and the overall levels ofwelfare to be generated may be so high as todiscourage investment in the area. The second group, type II orphans, describes the category where medicines likely to benefit verylarge numbers of people are not being developedbecause the people who suffer from these diseasesare very poor and are not usually served byadequate health care systems. Here the conditionsmost likely to be involved are tropical diseases. In 14 TRIPLE HELIX ISPRING 02justice John Griffin revisits north/south drug inequalities. Developing World Drugs The bulk of new chemical entities licensed have been limited to... conditions which are largely chronic and occur principally in the affluent Western countries. Type I II IIIOrphan diseases medicines patientsDefinition rare diseases for whichtreatment would be veryexpensive to researchmedicines that are notdeveloped as their targetpopulations are too poor toafford themPatients who are too poor or isolated to afford existingtreatmentsjustice some environments, type III therapeutic orphans exist where effective remedies are freely availableon the world market, but for economic or otherdistribution reasons they are simply not available tothose who need them. Dealing with type I and type II orphans requires considerable research and developmentexpenditure. The development of a new chemicalentity costs between \u00a3500 - \u00a3800 million.Pharmaceutical companies cannot invest sums ofmoney of this magnitude without any possibility ofrecouping these costs. It has been calculated that inthe current economic climate only one out of fivenew chemical entities recoup their research costs so'block-buster products' fund the companies' overallresearch and development expenditures. In the developed world, type I orphan drugs which are able to exploit American, European andother 'orphan drug' provisions can fund theirresearch and development costs by charging healthauthorities a premium price for such products.However, no such opportunity exists for type IIorphans. Pharmaceutical companies have aresponsibility to their shareholders to provide returnon investment. If there is an inadequate return oninvestment, a company's share price falls and thiscould be catastrophic for the future of the company,and any research and development it mightundertake; this would inevitably lead to job losses. The suggestion by Medicines sans Frontiers that governments should become involved in tacklingthe problem of type II orphans is not new and wasadvanced by T aylor and Griffin who stated:'Governments should be encouraged to supportongoing initiatives like UNDP/World Bank andWHO special programme'. However, it has to beremembered that several western governmentsincluding that of the UK have reduced their fundingof academic tropical research, and some nations havebeen slow in paying their contributions to the UNDP/World Bank/WHO programme. Medicines sans Frontiers also makes recommendations for technology transfer and increased research anddevelopment in developing countries, a proposalsimilar to that made by Sir John Vane (Nobel PrizeWinner) as long ago as 1985. 6 Future circumstances are likely to change. The re-emergence of tuberculosis in the western worldand the appearance of malaria outside areasconventionally regarded as malarial risk areas, areserving as stimuli to increase government sponsoredresearch in these areas. The increased resistance ofthe malarial parasite to existing anti-malarial agents,and increased travel for military, business andpleasure are also raising the demand for new anti-malarials and other treatments for tropical diseases.These demands by the developed world will haveconsequent beneficial effects for the citizens ofdeveloping countries. In theory, the problem of type III orphans should be easier to deal with given good will. In recentmonths, a number of pharmaceutical companieshave made considerable price reductions for theirproducts for HIV/AIDs treatment, albeit underpressure. They have done this despiteunderstanding from past experience that such dualpricing can lead to the re-export of low pricedproducts back from recipient developing worldcountries into the markets of the developed worldby unscrupulous governments or wholesale dealersseeking windfall profits. Furthermore, for nearly twodecades, Merck Sharp & Dohme have providedgenerous and unlimited free supplies of ivermectinfor the treatment of onchocerciasis in Africa, but thisaltruism of pharmaceutical companies is frequentlyignored by activist groups. Attempts by developingcountries to import from other developing countriesproducts that do not conform to the patentagreements of TRIPS (trade related aspects ofintellectual property rights) has resulted in thesupply of defective rather than cheap drugs. For many countries even cheaply priced HIV/AIDs treatment is not an option since theycannot afford to buy any treatment at all. For thesetype III orphans the only chance is free medicinesand they will benefit from UN Secretary GeneralKofi Annan's initiative in setting up a Global AIDsand Health Fund with a $1.4 billion capital and atarget spend of $7-10 billion per annum. In conclusion, the situation as identified by Medicines sans Frontiers is neither satisfactory nornew. Realistic solutions have to be sought, but it hasto be tackled by governments, the UN and WHO,not by charity from individual pharmaceuticalcompanies. The developed countries must be madeto realise that they are stewards but not the ownersof the resources they have, and that these should beused responsibly.

All kinds of human endeavours aredescribed as having a spirituality. It would be easy to dismiss this as woolly minded sentiment, which perhaps sometimes it is, but I believe that there ismerit in looking beyond our instinctive prejudicesto examine one fundamental aspect of medicalpractice that above all lends itself to spirituality. The consultation between the doctor and thepatient, that cornerstone of medical activity, hasbeen subject to much analysis but little has beenwritten about the spiritual aspects of it. I will attempt to define spirituality and then consider how it might be recognised in theconsultation. A brief but illuminating definition ofspirituality is given in Ewert Cousin's book on'Christian Spirituality: Origins to the T welfthCentury' 2where it is described as that which 'focuses on that inner dimension of the personcalled by certain traditions the spirit. Thisspiritual core is the deepest centre of the person.It is here that the person is open to thetranscendent dimensions; it is here that theperson experiences ultimate reality'. Manyencounters with patients involve that deepestcentre of the person, whether the doctor's or thepatient's or both. There is that sense of'something far more deeply interfused' thatWordsworth describes above, the sense that weare standing on holy ground. Few authors attempt to discuss the spirituality of the consultation. One exception is T oon 3who touches on it in his treatise of the virtuouspractitioner. He argues that medical practice canand should be based on the virtues categorised inthe western Christian tradition, such as fortitude,faith, temperance, charity and hope.

I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing often-times The still, sad music of humanity, Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power To chasten or subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man1Spirituality of the Consultationfaith in practice moral thinking. I will attempt to summarise the factors that seem to me necessary for thespirituality of the consultation to emerge. Being There Firstly, there is the all-important matter of being there for the patient. This means much more thansimple availability, although that is a necessaryprerequisite. It involves the deliberate focussing ofattention on the patient and their problems to theextent that they perceive that the doctor is trulyconcerned about them. With time and practice, it ispossible to give the impression of focussed concern by means of the appropriate use of communicationskills, and no doubt all doctors do this from time totime when under pressure. This is not the ideal,however, and whilst good communication skills arenecessary to establish rapport with the patient, totruly be there for them requires an effort of heart (Ican think of no better phrase) which goes beyondtechniques of communication and that the patientis likely to discern and appreciate. It is hard todefine exactly what this is, but probably both thepatient and the doctor know, in some intuitive way,when it has occurred. The result is a deepening ofthe doctor-patient relationship in a way that leadsto more rewarding consultations and increases thelikelihood of the patient being healed; in otherwords, becoming whole rather than just recoveringfrom sickness. Meaning Secondly, there is the issue of meaning within the consultation. I believe that spirituality tends toemerge in consultations that are highly chargedwith meaning for the patient or even the doctor.The patient who is concerned about the meaningof their symptoms or trying to come to terms withthe meaning of an established illness or who isrevealing to the doctor the meaning that theyperceive, is demonstrating an openness of heartand soul that may stir the depths of the doctorwho is trying to be there with them. Whilst thishappens more commonly with serious and longterm illness, it can also occur in brief but intensivefashion when a patient is concerned about asymptom that they fear could portend majordisease. T o understand the meaning of the illnessas perceived by the patient is therefore one of themost important tasks in the consultation so to failhere will leave the patient unsatisfied. Forexample, all GPs are familiar with the healthyperson who consults with unremarkable headacheswho, when given time and space, reveals that afriend has just had a stroke or died of a braintumour. Once the meaning is understood by thedoctor, and the patient knows that the doctorunderstands, the spirituality of the consultationcan emerge.Compassion Thirdly, there is the matter of the heart being moved. This is not the same as the effort of the heartto be there for the patient which I describe above,but is a spontaneous 'gut reaction' which cannot beproduced at will or manufactured. It occurs inresponse to the giving of time and understanding tothe patient. When the doctor understands themeaning of their illness to the patient, he may findthat his heart goes out to them as he experiences agenuine sense of empathy with them. Perhaps theword compassion describes this, and althoughcompassion is more commonly thought of as a virtue,what I am describing here is something that ariseswithout any moral effort on the part of the doctor. Itis in being there and seeking to understand that themoral effort occurs; compassion may or may notfollow. When it does, it seems to add a furtherdimension to the healing quality of the consultation,as though the patient senses the doctor's compassionfor them and this helps them to return to wholeness.They are likely also to respond with gratitude andappreciation to the doctor as their own heartperceives the spiritual contact that has occurredbetween them and their doctor. Conclusion Once all these elements are present, the doctor and the patient together may be aware that theyare hearing 'the still, sad music of humanity...ofample power to chasten and subdue...A presencethat disturbs...with the joy of elevated thoughts...Whose dwelling is...in the mind of man'. T o be unaware of this transcendent aspect of the consultation seems to me to be blind to part of thefundamental reality of being human, for surely all ofus have experienced that sense of the whole beinggreater than the sum of the parts which occurs whenwe truly communicate with the other person. Herewe touch, in some mysterious way, the ultimatereality that surrounds us all as we encounter withineach other God in whose image we are made. Jesussaid: 'Whatever you did for one of the least of thesebrothers of mine, you did for me'. 4 Medical practice is frequently busy, tiring, frustrating and stressful, but whilst it continues togive a central place to the doctor being there forthe patient to come to with their problems throughthe many ups and downs and perhaps long years oflife, it will continue also to offer the possibility ofthat spiritual contact between doctor and patientwhich transcends the pressures and strains. Assuch, it will remain essentially an enjoyableprivilege to be a doctor and to spend one's workinglife encountering the deepest realities of thehuman condition.

When she reached 60 yearsof age she embarked on a global travellingministry conducting counselling and carefullynoted psychiatric assessments. Her ground-breaking research, first presented in 1984,caused initial discomfort to some inmissionary agencies but they were largely wonover after the publication of the first edition ofthis book in 1987. The title was significant,restoring self-esteem to those who weregenuine casualties but had beenmisunderstood, and I am very glad that theoriginal title has been retained. The first edition was a classic, and required reading for anyone involved in overseasmission. This edition casts its net morewidely, including those who travel acrossinternational boundaries but continue to livein their home country, and those working withimmigrants. Fourteen chapters encompass thechanging face of missions, understandingstress, dealing with depression anddiscouragement, adjustment and cultureshock, occupational stress, interpersonalrelationships, parental and home countrystress, stress and singleness, missionarymarriages, stress and children, special forms ofstress, re-entry, caring for missionaries andGod's model of missionary care. Every chapter is important and well written, in touch with the current realities of overseasservice, brim full with realism, wisdom,insight, and hope informed by a love forChrist, but the author does not gloss over theways in which mission partners maymanufacture their own problems. All thechapters can be described as outstanding. Is this still a book for this first decade of the 21 st Century? Definitely yes. Her references are up to date and demonstrate an impressivebreadth of research. Have I any criticisms?Yes, but only two very minor ones. Occasionally the style is more like a scientificpaper and this is unnecessary for her targetreadership. The referencing style should bechanged at the next reprinting to a numberedVancouver style and the author couldintroduce some informality by using the firstand last names of authors in the text. Who should read this book? All missionaries, all Christians working overseasor making visits as part of their Christiancalling, all candidates, all returned, bruisedor wounded mission partners, allmissionary/Christian aid agency home staff,all those in local churches responsible foroverseas personnel, and all church memberswith an interest in overseas mission. Thatshould include every church member. Itshould be on every church bookstall, inevery missionary training college and givento every candidate and serving missionpartner by their agency. It is a superb bookthat I commend unreservedly. Michael Jones Realized Religion Research on the Relationshipbetween Religion and Health Theodore J Chamberlain & Christopher A HallTempleton FoundationPress 2000US$29.95 1 890151 53 X It has been said that if there is just a five per cent advantage in clinical benefit from acertain treatment, then the advantages anddisadvantages of this should be discussed withpatients. There is now growing evidence thathaving a religious faith brings considerableadvantages. Have we come to the positionwhen it could be considered negligent not toadvise our patients to find a faith that standsto help them? 'Realised Religion' is a scholarly book that comprehensively reviews the largevolume of literature on the relationshipbetween faith and well-being, whether itbe physical or psychological. The effect ofboth pro and anti religious biases in thewriters of these papers is discussed. The first chapter on the 'Role of Prayer and Healing' reviews several academic studies.Most found a real advantage in the groupprayed for, only a few found no difference. Articles on 'Faith Healing' are reviewed honestly. Though little evidence is given tosuggest patients are being objectively healedof organic pathology today, there is evidencepresented that patients can have a feeling ofwell-being from such experiences. One majorstudy found that the problems helped wereusually psychological, physical or religious asopposed to behavioural, social and moralconcerns. A major analysis of CatholicPentecostal healings determined that thehealings actually fell well short of 'cures'.However religious faith is correlated withlower blood pressure levels! The chapter on 'Mental Health' shows clearly that committed, actively religiouspersons have better overall psychologicaladjustment, feeling of well-being and highself esteem. They conclude, 'Mental Healthworkers need to be aware of the positivepotential of religious involvement'. Overall'fully eighty per cent of psychiatric researchon religion and health conclude that a faith isadvantageous'. Many studies in 'Life Satisfaction' all show that there is a direct relationship betweenspiritual commitment and contentment. Anumber of studies conclude that 'materialisticpeople generally have been found to beunhappy'. This sense of well-being isaccredited to the effect of individual beliefs aswell as from active involvement in religiouscommunities and activities. Further chapters review the evidence on the effect of faith on suicide and alcohol anddrug abuse and find clear evidence that faithis advantageous. The writers conclude, 'The scientific evidence convincingly demonstrates that thenatural by-product of religion realised islonger life, less illness, better physical andmental health, more marital stability, lessdivorce, less suicide and less abuse of alcoholand other substances'. The final chapter is an investigation of the Bible's teaching and reminds us that thepursuit of religious truth and commitmentshould not be because of health benefitsbecause then religion has become a means toan end since 'Jesus never promoted oradvocated such a reversal'.

This isone of the questionsMontagu Barkeraddresses in this bookbased on his four T empleton lectures. The aim of these lecturesis to integrate science with modern issues inmedicine, psychiatry and religious experience.Dr Barker states that his 'aim has been tochallenge the sceptic to be more reflective inanalysing spiritual experience, and tochallenge religious enthusiasts to be morerigorous in evaluating their own religiousexperience'. In the chapter 'Religious Observance, Health and Safety', Dr. Barker cites modernscientific research to show that regular Judaeo-Christian worshippers live longer because of areduction in the incidence of heart attacks andstrokes. Significant benefit to mental healthwas found with participation in religiousservices, social support, prayer and perceivedrelationship with God. Interestingly, small amounts of religion can actually bedetrimental to mental health, ie the less activethe commitment, the higher the levels ofworry, anxiety and guilt! The chapter entitled 'Religious experiences and psychological explanations' gives afascinating overview of the way religiousexperience has been perceived by sixmembers of the psychiatric and scientificprofessions over two centuries. Dr Barkershows how the anti-religious effect of thenineteenth century materialist psychiatrist SirHenry Maudsley influenced many Britishpsychiatrists to see any unusual madness.Dr Barker's chapter on 'Conversion, Cults and Brainwashing' gives a robust endorsementof the need for the Christian convert to'please bring your mind with you'. Hecontrasts the 'call to examine the life, teachingand credentials of Jesus Christ and to makeup one's mind as to the validity of theChristian faith' with those who join certainChristian groups which 'can be just ascoercive in their persuasive techniques and aspressured in their expectations of specificexperiences as the new religious movements'. The chapter on 'Spiritual Healing and Alternative Therapies' probably tries to covertoo much material to do justice to either thetwo main themes of the heading or indeed thethird theme which he introduces, namely thepsychotherapist as healer. I thoroughly recommend Dr Barker's book, since it provides such an excellentunderstanding to those who are interested inthe relationship between the Christian faithand many important mental health issues.

It is packed with valuableinformation and is particularly useful as ahandbook for Christian carers who do nothave opportunity to research these areas forthemselves. Although evidence based medicine is widely acclaimed, alternative therapies, sooften lacking in firm supportive evidence,are increasingly fashionable and steadilyencroaching into conventional medicine. Inthese days when 'informed choice' is anethical watchword, this book contains much sorely needed information to help with ourdecisions. Using a clear format of four sections, it gives a fascinating overview of the originsand development of both conventional andalternative medicine, the first oftendeficient in knowledge and the secondincluding therapies based on Easternreligious concepts or pagan rituals andbeliefs. It emphasises that many popularalternative therapies, with their ancientorigins, are now associated with New Agespirituality and healing techniques. Included in the second section is a helpful, biblically based and, at timesinspirational, discussion concerning thedifficult and age-old issues of pain, illnessand suffering, followed by some salutaryadvice on a healthy lifestyle. Part three examines the principles underlying alternative therapies. These aregenerally based on the concept of 'universallife force' or energy, eg ch'i and the chakras orenergy centres of yoga. Christians areclearly warned of the potential dangers ofbecoming involved in therapies dependentupon a non-Christian belief system. The fourth and largest section makes an important distinction between alternativetherapies which are dealt with somewhatconcisely and herbs, vitamins and dietarysupplements which are dealt with in moremeticulous detail. Although these latterremedies may be 'natural', they are notnecessarily safe. They are, however,unlikely to lead to harmful spiritual effects,(except possibly via the therapist!) andsome may well prove valuable after furtherevaluation. Finally, there is a 'quick reference' table matching common symptoms and illnesseswith a wide mixture of possible alternativeremedies. This is sometimes at variancewith information and advice given inprevious chapters. I found it disappointingthat this therapeutic table does little todispel the persistent confusion surroundingsome areas of alternative medicine. Despitesome inconsistencies, however, this book isa useful resource if viewed as a whole andwith discernment!

Paradoxically, it is perhaps a shame to have lost the original foreword, whichdescribes the influences which broughtFrancis to his conviction that the healingministry is present reality. The book has a direct approach. The challenge the Sanhedrin faced in Jesus 20centuries ago is applied to us. Look at theevidence for his healing ministry: is it true?Should we be doing something about it?The Sanhedrin suppressed it; the commonpeople loved it. 'You have hidden theKingdom from the wise and learned, andrevealed it unto little children.' The firstchapter is a powerful, yet gentle, defenceof the healing ministry, and challenge toengage, not ignore. McNutt clarifies thatthe need is not for either good social/medical structures and facilities or Christ's healing at an individual level: it isboththese things. He touches on the power of counselling, prayer and medicine beingused together, and later develops thetheme further. He then looks at all the common resistances to the healing ministry andshakes each one for truth, concluding thatthe good news is that God still intervenesin our lives to heal, and that he is notconstrained by the lack of extraordinarysaints through whom to work. He usesbelievers. He traces the change inperspective about healing, and concludesthat God actually does want us whole. McNutt peppers his book with apt quotations; 'the glory of God is man fullyalive', 'even God cannot play on a brokenviolin', 'every time you meet Jesus in theGospels, he is either healing someone, orhas just come from healing someone, or ison his way to heal someone'. He isunambiguous in his declarations, but not unbalanced. Hence he accepts that deathcomes to us all and there is a time not topray for healing. He accepts that there is atruth in the receptiveness of suffering,quoting Paul's affliction with blindnesswhich opened his spiritual eyes, but heclarifies his conviction that this is theexception rather than the rule. McNutt also covers deliverance and exorcism in a helpful and encouraging way. It is quite long, and perhaps a little repetitive at times, but always interesting,always informative and well written, and astopical now as it ever has been. It seems tome to be a foundational text. All it needs ischapter summaries to focus the messagemore effectively... but writing one's own isgood discipline!

Motivation to change comesfrom understanding the importance of anaction, and also from the action becoming'the fashion'.

Hewas right. We are born, we die, and inbetween we experience the perversity of British weather (or the luxury of no such experience if you are an overseas Triple Helix reader). Apart from undertakers, mortuary workers and butchers, the medical and nursing professionsprobably come across death on a daily basis more than any other . Most people fear death. Woody Allen, comedian extraordinaire, remarked that, 'It's not that I mind dying, I just don't want t o be there when it happens'. Some Americans have had their bodiespreserved through cryotherapy in the hope that when a cure isfound for their cause of death, they can be brought back to lif e. The fact that some could only afford preserving their headssmacks of sheer absurdity! If we were to stop and view the mounting death toll in the world today, from the scourge of AIDS, to the revenge killings in Israel and Palestine, and even amongst the patients entrusted i nto our care, we could be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed. Deathdemands an explanation as an impostor on the world stage. AsPaul acknowledged, 'If only for this life we have hope in Chris t, we are to be pitied more than all men' (1 Corinthians 15:19). When Jesus was faced with Lazarus' death he 'wept' (John 11:35). We see a troubled Jesus, a deeply moved Jesus. T o quoteJohn Stott, 1'Death was a foreign body. Jesus resisted it; he could not come to terms with it.' Yet out of the whole crowd gatheredaround the tomb that day, Jesus was the only one who knew whatwould happen next! 'I am the resurrection and the life. He whobelieves in me will live, even though he dies, and whoever live s and believes in me will never die', he proclaimed, and thenproved it was true by raising Lazarus! As believers now, we know that Jesus has the power to raise us too. Death is no longer the end of life but a brief interlude o n a journey. I could but smile when my seven-year-old friend (withgrade 4 neuroblastoma at presentation) said to me, 'It's like c alling in at McDonald's when on the motorway'. Death is inevitable. It's not a failure of modern medicine but a consequence of living in a fallen world. The gift of eternal li fe is also, alas, optional. I say 'alas' because 'small is the gate a nd narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it' (Ma tthew 7:13,14). Many are rather on that 'broad road that leads todestruction'. I'm grateful for the person who led me to Christ, for my relationship with Jesus, and the certain hope of eternal lif e. As a result I can look forward to death, as a checkpoint along the way, with the best still to come. As Christian doctors we are in aprivileged position to share the phenomenal truth of Jesus' vic tory over sin and even death itself with our patients, and their rel atives and friends. Can others that we meet today have the opportunityof hearing the same Good News so that they might join us on thejourney ... and mine's a Big Mac and fries when we get there (andin heaven, calorie free of course!)
