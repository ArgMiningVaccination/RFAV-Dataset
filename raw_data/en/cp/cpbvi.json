Combined i.p. administration of these vitamins produced a distinct chemotherapy-potentiating effect for all drugs examined, especially when injected before chemotherapy. This potentiating treatment did not increase the general and organ toxicity that accompanies cancer chemotherapy. The possible generation of peroxides followed by membrane lipid alteration, DNase activation and DNA destruction by combined vitamin C and K3 in catalase-deficient cancer cells might be involved in the mechanisms of this selective potentiation.
