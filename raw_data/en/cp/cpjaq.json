St. Louis University (SLU) 2nd-year medical students Zac Zabriskie, Kasey Lierz, and Rob Breeden were visiting to speak with the class about cardiopulmonary health, and they brought along some human heart and lung specimens to demonstrate their point. MSB students were offered the chance to handle hearts and lungs, with gloves of course, so that they could better understand the importance of heart and lung health. Our students were able to see and hold healthy hearts and lungs as well as enlarged hearts, lungs of cigarette smokers, and hearts with pacemakers. Zac, Kasey, and Rob all work in the Adventures in Medicine and Science (AIMS) program at SLU. In AIMS, visiting high school students participate in auditorium presentations on various systems in the human body, hands-on interactive human cadaver demonstrations at the Practical Anatomy facility, and summer workshops covering Medicine & Surgical Procedures, Anatomy, and Sports Medicine & Athletic T raining. Zac enjoyed working with high school students so much that he began thinking of ways he could bring the same experiences to students who normally would not attend AIMS. After reaching out to MSB, Zac recruited fellow students Kasey and Rob to visit our school and educate our students on the importance of good cardiopulmonary health. Our students had a wonderful time learning from Zac, Kasey and Rob, and enjoyed the hand-on experience the visit allowed. MSB hopes they will visit again with more knowledge (and specimens) to share!

Boys' teams from Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Kansas, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and Missouri competed, as did girls' teams from Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Wisconsin boys and girls placed first, Illinois boys and girls placed second, and Indiana boys and girls placed third. Despite playing hard, neither MSB boys or girls placed. However, the girls' team accomplished their season goal of beating Tennessee, which they did in their first game of the meet. The conference meet wrapped up a mixed season for both MSB teams. Oct. 14th-15th, the MSB boys' and girls' goalball teams traveled to Nashville for a goalball tournament at Tennessee School for the Blind. The boys' team beat Alabama, Ohio and Tennessee while the girls' beat Alabama and Ohio, but lost to Tennessee. On Oct. 20th in Illinois, MSB boys won against School Association for Special Education (SASED) of Naperville, Ill. but lost to Illinois and Wisconsin, while the girls lost all of their matches at that meet. MSB would like to thank Alpine Shop of Kirkwood for donating 12 pairs of goggles to our goalball teams! Thank you!3 www .MSB.dese.mo.govh OutreachResidence Life On Nov. 8th, the Missouri Deafblind Technical Assistance Project held their annual topical workshop with Robbie Blaha, from Texas School for the Blind & Visually Impaired pre-senting.

Quick Connection Oct.-Nov2016 4 STAFF This past month has been busy with many exciting counseling lessons and activities! I also had the privi- lege of attending the Missouri School Counselor Association Conference in Osage Beach, MO. There are many things happening in the School Counseling world, and I look forward to implementing them at MSB. For this Counselor's Corner I would like to highlight a fun lesson Mrs. Griffin's class participated in about careers. The students listed as many careers as they could think of in the community. We then discussed how each career and job is important in its own way. Without team work of all the careers, our community would look and feel very different. The students chose one career in our com-munity to send a thank you letter to. We chose to write a letter to the local fire department to thank them for their important work and service to our com-munity. The students and I worked together to create the letter and sent it with drawings of firefighters. This was the perfect lesson to lead into the weeks of preparation for the First An- nual Career Awareness Fair at MSB. Students all around MSB have been work-ing hard on researching different careers which will be presented and displayed at the Career Aware-ness Fair on November 18 th. I look forward to seeing all of the groups present at the fair!Counselor's CorneR with Andrea Piel, School CounselorClassroom SpotlightYou don't walk into a math class ex- pecting to see students, much less the teacher, sitting on the floor crafting with markers, index cards and tape. But that's exactly what you'll see when you enter Tammy Popp's classroom, at least on days when her 8th grade math class is learning about rational numbers. Mrs. Popp came up with the idea to make a large number line on the floor and have her students place cards with rational numbers in order on the number line.\"Historically, students have difficulties visualizing and understanding rational numbers. Placing them in order on a number line helps, and putting that number line on the floor was just a fun and unique way to help them under - stand,\" said Mrs. Popp. Her students enjoyed the hands-on approach to learning, and liked being out of their seats and active during the lesson. They even admitted they had fun learning math!

Special thanks to Chris Gray of Missouri Council of the Blind for presenting awards to our students who won the MCB Alma Murray Essay Contest. The essay contest winner won a $500 gift card and the two runners-up won $50 gift cards. The ceremony was followed up with QuizBowl Finals. Veteran's Day MSB's Junior Beta Club organized a wonderful Veteran's Day assembly in which several students spoke on the history of Veteran's Day, our military and the importance of honoring those who served. The names of military personnel among our staff and their families were read aloud. MSB thanks you, veterans, for your service and sacrifice! 1st Quarter Awards Ceremony & QuizBowl Finals Quick Connection Oct.-Nov2016 6 Missouri School for the Blind is operated by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, State of Missouri.
