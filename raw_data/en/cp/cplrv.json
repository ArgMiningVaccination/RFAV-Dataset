Frankincense has literally been used for thousands of years. It is perhaps most widely known for its use in spiritual practices and rites.

It is believed to promote higher states of consciousness that enable one to connect to their intuitive self. Galbanum was another popular oil used during ancient times. Like frankincense, the Egyptians used it in their sacred rites and embalming practices. The ancient Hebrews considered it to be a holy oil and was used for anointing practices. Even today it remains a popular oil in ayurvedic medicine as it is believed to help balance the body and the three doshas. Galbanum has wonderful calming qualities and is often a favorite essential oil when one wished to feel more grounded and secure in the world. Cedar was considered to be a sacred herb by the Native Americans. It can be associated with abundance and prosperity, however, it is especially known to aid in healing, prophetic dreams, and prayer. During biblical times, forests of cedar trees were sought for refuge as it was believed that these sacred forests offered valuable insight and guidance. The ancient Egyptians also venerated the cedar and used it in their embalming rights. Sandalwood is another favorite essential oil that has strong roots in Indian mythology. Sandalwood is considered to be sacred and associated with Vishnu. Devotees of Vishnu would make a paste from it and anoint it on their foreheads. Sandalwood incense was used in temples and was revered for its ability to aid in mediation and achieve higher states of consciousness. The Polynesians would create a powder from sandalwood and mix it in an oil to treat earaches, skin disorders, and headaches. Sandalwood is known to have both a calming and soothing effect. It used commonly used for spiritual inspiration and has a lovely peaceful scent when burned. The Chinese use sandalwood to treat cholera, stomach complaints, venereal diseases, and vomiting. Sandalwood stimulates the immune system and can reduce inflammation. Lavender makes a wonderful addition to any blend that targets the emotions such as stress, anxiety, irritability, and worry. Lavender is known to promote physical and emotional well-being. This was certainly recognized by many cultures in antiquity. The Romans were known to bathe with it in order to alleviate fatigue. It was also planted in graveyards. In Europe, it was popular for love remedies and would be placed under the pillow to help induce sleep. It was also placed in sick rooms and used as a means to defend oneself against the black plague. In Welsh folklore, it was used to dispel witches and evil spirits and in other cultures it was thought to protect children from the evil eye. Although its rich and exotic floral scent is revered in perfumery, jasmine has been used in sacred rites, particularly in India. The jasmine flower, for example, is commonly used in religious offerings. They are often found on temples and effigies and are considered s symbol of purity and innocence. Popular ancient love deities such as Kama and Eros also have associations with Jasmine and are often depicted with Jasmine. Ancient moon deities have also been linked to the jasmine flower such as the Egyptian Goddess Isis. Jasmine has the ability to aid in creativity and intuition. Not only does it calm the nervous system, it is believed to help lift the emotions and encourage feelings of joy. Balsam copaiba originates from the Amazon and has been used for centuries as a powerful healing remedy as it contains powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal properties. In aromatherapy, it is believed to reduce anxiety and create overall feelings of well-being. It is a lovely oil to work with if one wishes to become more reflective and aware.
