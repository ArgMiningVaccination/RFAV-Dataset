The skin is made up of cells called keratinocytes; skin, hair, and nails are all formed from these. The coloration in the skin comes from melanin that is produced by pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. When you get too much sun, your skin can make more of a dark pigment. This is called melanin and it happens when you have had too much sun. This is called Skin Pigmentation. What are Dark Spots on the Face? Dark spots, also known as black marks on your face can be a result of skin pigmentation. These are areas on our skin that are not the same color as the rest of us. They may be birthmarks or freckles. Dark spots are darker than the skin around them. They happen when something changes in your body or if you are growing up. Dark spots on the face can result from hyperpigmentation, a condition that causes the skin's pigment cells to become overactive and produce too much melanin. Dark spots on your face can come from a burn or acne. It is also called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Black marks caused by these injuries usually go away without treatment. Even though it is hard to get dark marks on your face, there are some things you can do. For example, if you have ingredients in your pantry, they may help remove the dark marks. You can also use home remedies that are not expensive. These remedies work well and quickly fade the dark marks on your face. Atopic dermatitis or eczema is common for people who have had it since they were born or when they were teenagers. It will go away eventually when your immune system matures out of its childhood stage. Atopic dermatitis is not as big of a problem for adults, but it continues to be a problem for children who are still developing their immune systems. Types of Black Marks The four main categories are sunspots (also known as liver spots), age spots, freckles, and melasma. - Sunspots/liver spots generally appear in areas that receive the most exposure to the sun. - Age spots are dark areas that appear on the face as a result of [aging](https://mantracare.org/therapy/issues/aging/), although they can also be caused by unprotected exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light. - Freckles typically develop during childhood and adolescence but tend to fade over time once the body matures into adulthood. - Melasma is usually found in women who have had children because it is caused by hormonal changes but can also be associated with sun exposure Causes Of Black Marks There are a few prevalent causes of black marks, some of which are: Tiredness and stress [Stress](https://mantracare.org/counseling/stress/) hormones are known as cortisol essentially prevent an enzyme called tyrosinase from doing its job properly which is responsible for producing melanin resulting in dark spots all around the face. Skin cancer/other medical conditions Other possible causes for marks on your face include liver disease, birthmarks like nevus flammeus and dermatosis papulosa nigra, which are all types of skin conditions that can cause hyperpigmentation, as well as other things such as vitiligo which is a condition where you lose your natural pigment or melanin from the areas on your body where it's normally present. Scarring and aging As we get old, black spots can grow on our skin. This is because as we age, our skin doesn't shed dead cells as easily as when we were younger. If these black spots bother us, it might cause psychological problems. Trauma People who have suffered severe [trauma](https://mantracare.org/therapy/ptsd-trauma/trauma/) or injury to their faces may develop post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, where darker patches appear due to an inflammatory response that takes place in the injured area after it's healed up. Darkening occurs because scar tissue contains excess amounts of melanin which also explains why scars tend to look lighter or darker depending on the individual's skin tone. Scarring Psoriasis or other skin conditions Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can also take place when a person has suffered from a skin injury or irritation, such as acne. This is especially true when the individual's immune system overreacts to bacteria in response to an infection caused by breakouts leading to redness and swelling that results in the darkening of the area surrounding any blemishes left behind after they heal up. Difference Between Dark spots and Scars - Scars generally appear as a result of an injury to the body and can be more difficult for some people to remove than dark spots on your face. - Sometimes scars may fade over time or with the help of certain creams but it will take diligence and patience too.
