The epidemic trend in regions outside of China has greatly erupted, overseas outbreaks have escalated, and more than 20 countries and regions have been infected. Except for Antarctica, allcontinents have con rmed cases. How to effectively treat NCP remains a key problem. The Of ce of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the General Of ce of the National Health And Health Commission have issued seveneditions of the \"Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia \"; each version of the diagnosis and treatment plan has always emphasized the activerole of Chinese medicine in the treatment and the strengtheningof its combination with Western medicine to promote medicaltreatment and achieve good results ( National Health Commission of the People 's Republic of China, 2020 ). In an interview, Zhong Nanshan af rmed the role of Chinese medicine in treatment of NCP; Chinese medicine can effectively suppressinflammatory damages and can also be popularized in foreign countries ( Tencent News, 2020a ). The article aimed to systematically organize clinical research by literature metrologyand data mining methods, analyze the current situation ofclinical treatment research in Chinese medicine, explore the clinical treatment characteristics of Chinese medicine and provide a reference for global clinical treatment of NCP. MATERIALS AND METHODS Search Strategy Two reviewers (ZZ and NG) independently isolated the useful information from the database. Studies that used Chinesemedicine to treat NCP were selected from PubMed, ChineseJournal Service Platform of CNKI, VIP, and WanFang DataKnowledge Service Platform. Advanced search was medicine \"or \"prescription. \"The search time was from the establishment of the library to 11:00 on 15 April 2020. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria: All studies on clinical treatment of NCP inChinese medicine that state complete treatment options andprocesses and are classi ed as clinical control trials (CCT),randomized controlled trials (RCT), and case series studies (CS) were included. Exclusion criteria: Studies categorized as review, basic research, regional epidemiological research, experience summary, andsyndrome analysis were excluded. Data Extraction and Analysis Noteexpress, a document management software program, wasused to manage the studies obtained from different databases. Anaccess database was established to extract information on thepublication of the literature (author, time of issue, issue journal,type of fund), research design (number of cases, subject genderand age), intervention measures (prescription, traditional Chinese medicine), research observation indicators and other information for statistical analysis. For eligible studies, tworeview authors (ZZ, and GN) extracted the data independently.Disagreements were resolved through consultation with a thirdparty (FS).The law of the prescription use of Chinese medicinewas analyzed statistically through the \"Traditional Chinese medicine inheritance auxiliary system. \" RESULTS Description of Studies We identi ed 757 potentially relevant articles. After removal of duplicates, 625 records remained. After going through the titles and abstracts, we exclude 605 papers. By reading the full text of the remaining 46 articles, 26 were exclude because they were casereports. Ultimately, 20 studies were included in present study(Bin et al., 2020 ;Cheng and Li, 2020 ;Cheng et al., 2020 ;Ding et al., 2020 ;Duan et al., 2020 ;Fang et al., 2020 ;Fu et al., 2020 ; Gong et al., 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020 ;Lv et al., 2020 ;Qv et al., 2020 ; Shi et al., 2020 ;Wang Y. et al., 2020 ;Wang T. et al., 2020 ;Xia et al., 2020 ;Xiao et al., 2020 ;Yang Q. et al., 2020 ;Yang Z. et al., 2020 ;Yao et al., 2020 ;Zhu et al., 2020 ). Among these studies, 2 RCTs, 10 CCTs and 8 CSs were included, which accounted for10.00%, 50.00% and 40.00% of the total number of studies,respectively. The speci c screening process is shown in Figure 1 . Basic Characteristics of the Literature The basic characteristics of the 20 trials are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The rst study on clinical treatment involving Chinese medicine for treatment of NCP was published onFebruary 6, 2020 ( Gong et al., 2020 ). After February 15, the volume of studies published began to increase. By March 25, 19articles were published. By April 4, the volume of literature published showed a downward trend. The total number of observations was 1,810, of which 1,021 and 789 were malesand females, respectively. The age ranged from 0.6 to 95 y. Thelargest number of subjects in the study was 308 ( Wang T. et al., 2020 ), and the minimum number of study cases was 13 ( Cheng and Li, 2020 ). About the research areas, the worst-affected area, Hubei region, had the largest volume of studies, accounting for more than 50%, followed by Henan and Anhui regions. 12 trails were funded by research projects. All trials adopted decoction orpatent medicine of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy series studies; Traditional Chinese medicine.Zhou et al. TCM Treatment for NCP Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560448 2combination with western treatment in the trial group for NCP. While the control group only adopted western treatment. For theseverity of included subjects, most RCTs and CCTs includedsubjects who were the mild or common type, while the subjectsin CS were common type and serious type. Three studiesmentioned death cases ( Bin et al., 2020 ;Xia et al., 2020 ;Yang Q. et al., 2020 ). One study mentioned there were no death cases (Wang T. et al., 2020 ). The other 16 studies did not mention the death condition. Adverse reactions were reported in eightstudies, while no mention in the other studies. Speci c research characteristics of RCTs and CCTs are shown in Table 1and CSs are shown in Table 2 . Analysis of the Law of Prescription Use in TCM Frequency Analysis of Single Chinese Herbal Medicine The statistical analysis show ed that 34 traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, involving 106 traditional Chinese medicines, were used in 20 clinical studies. The frequency oftraditional Chinese medicine use was sorted. The top aids in freeing lung, relieving cough and asthma and releasing exterior syndrome; Armeniacae Semen Amarum (Kuxingren) helps to depress qi and cough and asthma; and Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gancao) facilitates in relieving cough and reducing sputum and coordinating of drugs. The three drugs arecommonly used for cough and sputum and are also the basic components of Maxing Ganshi decoction in traditionalChinese medicine to treat cough and asthma. In the includedprescriptions, 24 drugs were found with a frequency of 5 (Table 3 ). According to the traditional Chinese medicine category to sort out the 106 traditional Chinese medicines, the top 3 most frequently used are heat-clearing medicines, exterior syndrome-relieving medicines and phlegm-resolving and coughand followed by damp-resolvingmedicines, tonify medicines, and damp-draining diureticmedicines. The details are presented in Table 4 . Analysis of the Association Rules of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine The association rules of traditional Chinese medicine for the included prescriptions were analyzed. The support was set to20%. The results showed 10 associations of traditional Chinesemedicine with a con dence of above 0.8. The association of traditional Chinese medicine with a con dence of 1 was of traditional Chinese medicine with a con dence level of above 0.86 presents the analysis of speci c association rules. Analysis of Chinese Herbal Medicine Combinations Network The relationship among different drug combinations was visualized using the network display function of the traditional Chinese medicine inheritance auxiliary system. The results showed that Ephedrae Herba (Mahuang) -Armeniacae Semen Amarum (Kuxingren) had the highest support, as the most common core combination, followed by Pinelliae indicates that commonly used clinical treatments for NCPinvolve depressing qi, relieving cough, eliminating dampnessand eliminating phlegm. The Chinese herbal medicinecombinations network is presented in Figure 2 . Analysis of Application of Classical Prescriptions of TCM Studies involving the application of classical prescriptions of TCM were collected and summarized. Six studies were obtained.Among these classical prescriptions, Da Yuan decoction andGanlu Xiaodu pill were created by doctors Wu Youke (MingDynasty and Ye Tianshi (Qing Dynasty) and who studied inepidemic exogenous febrile diseases, while Maxing Ganshi FIGURE 1 | Literature screening process and results.Zhou et al.

Modern prescriptions are mostly added and subtracted byclassical prescriptions. For example, the Qingfei Paidu decoctionrecommended by the State Administration of on Maxing and Xiao Chaihu The classical prescriptions with a literature frequency of 2a r e presented in Table 6 .Analysis of Application of Chinese Patent Medicine Given its convenient application, Chinese patent medicine has gained increasing research attention. An analysis of the use ofChinese patent medicine in 20 clinical studies showed thatLianhua Qingwen capsules/granules are the most widely used.These capsules have been widely studied to verify their clinical efcacy. Lianhua Qingwen can act on coronavirus through multiple components, and pathways viatheir broad- spectrum antiviral, antibacterial and antipyretic; cough relief;sputum reduction and immune regulation effects ( Ling et al., 2020 ). In the treatment of NCP, Xuebijing and other traditional Chinese medicine injections have been used several times. Xuebijing can antagonize endotoxins ( Zhang, 2018 ;Wang, 2019 ) and inhibit the excessive release of in flammatory mediators, such as interferon and interleukin ( Tian et al., 2019 ), thereby inhibiting in flammation and enhancing immunity ( Diao et al., 2015 ). The academician Zhang Boli emphasized that the early application of traditional Chinese medicine injection canplay a vital role in treating critical patients ( Tencent news, 2020b ). Table 7 presents The commonly used Chinese patent medicine for NCP. Investigation of the Observation Indicators In 20 studies on the treatment of NCP, the most commonly usedclinical observation and evaluation indices was fever improvementtime, followed by cough improvement time, shortness of breath improvement time, chest CT, and TCM syndrome scale score.

From Table 1 , we can see the fever improvement time in the trial group was signi cantly shorter than that in the control group. In Table 8 , we listed the Chinese name, Latin name in Chinese pharmacopeia,and Name in Medicinal Pl ant Names Services.DISCUSSION On the discussion of epidemic, the ancient Chinese doctor Wu Youke from the Ming Dynasty pointed out it was causedby epidemic pathogenic evils. Given its strong infectivity, TABLE 8 | Drug name comparison table. No. Chinese name Latin name in Chinese pharmacopeia Name in Medicinal Plant Names Services MPNS NCP Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560448 12disease location and clinical characteristics, NCP can be named \"pulmonary epidemic disease \"(Guo and Wan, 2020 ). The main consensus regarding its pathogenesis is that the virus invades the lungs and causes vital qi de ciency. The pathological nature is dampness, heat, toxin, de ciency and stasis. This study mainly uses bibliometrics and data mining methods to obtain a systematic summary of clinical studies published at thisstage and systematically analyses the published information,research design, intervention measures and observation indicators. A summary of the research methods indicates that only 2 RCTs were conducted. Most of the studies were CCTs andCSs. Considering the large number of patients and the rapid spreadof the epidemic, the shortage of medical resources has led to theunconditional implementation of RCT research. The treatment ofpatients is the rst priority at this time. Regarding the time distribution of publications, the time that research on traditional Chinese medicine treatment of NCP was conducted synchronized with the epidemic. Furthermore, thesymptom improvement rate and symptom scores in the observationand evaluation indicators fully re flect the characteristics of the judgment standard of clinical ef cacy of traditional Chinese medicine. The total number of observation cases also re flects the high participation of traditional Chinese medicine in this anti- epidemic treatment. A clear understanding of Chinese herbalmedicines use has been achieved through the data mining andanalysis of prescriptions for treatment of NCP. are used. An analysis of drug categories showed that heat-clearing medicine, exterior syndrome-relievingmedicines, phlegm-resolving and cough and asthma-relievingmedicines, and humidifying drugs are frequently used. Thisnding suggests that dampness and toxin accumulating in the lung are the main pathogenesis of NCP. Ephedrae Herba (Mahuang)- Armeniacae Semen the highest support and high con dence in the association rules, which re flects the classic compatibility of Maxing ShiganTABLE 8 | Continued No. Chinese name Latin name in Chinese pharmacopeia Name in Medicinal Plant Names The drugs were listed in the order of their Chinese name.

About the high frequency Chinese herbal medicines, most of it enters the lung meridian or spleen meridian. Chinesemedicine recognizes that NCP mainly involves the lung. The spleenis the source of phlegm, and the lung is the sputum storage position,phlegm and dampness caused by lung and spleen disease. Theresults of clinical application an alysis of Chinese patent medicines reflect the participation in clinical treatment. Given their wide range of applications and convenient application, Chinese patentmedicines play an important role in clinical treatment of theepidemic in China. Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment ofNCP is worthy of global attention. Our study has several limitations. Randomized controlled trials are the most commonly used to judge the effectiveness of interventions. This review only included two RCTs. And they didnot mention blinding method. In addition, the interventions,treatment courses, and observat ion indicators of each study were quite different, so meta-analysis cannot be done. High-quality RCTs on the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia need further study.
