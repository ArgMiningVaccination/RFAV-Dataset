There have been emerging cases of inflammatory arthritis occurring in close relation to COVID-19 vaccination. We illustrate a case of new-onset inflammatory arthritis 10 days after receiving their second Vaxzevria COVID-19 vaccine. The patient responded dramatically to prednisolone treatment but subsequently required hydroxychloroquine due to persistent inflammatory joint symptoms. Inflammatory arthritis is an increasingly recognized rare adverse effect of COVID-19 vaccination and clinicians should actively consider this in patients with new or flares of inflammatory joint disease.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-03-09", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
