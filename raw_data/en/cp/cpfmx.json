Methods: The patient was treated with herbal medicine, acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, and chuna manual therapy for 13 days. To evaluate the improvements, we used a numeric rating scale (NRS), the American College of Rheumatology Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria (ACR), the neck disability index (NDI), and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Results: After treatment, the scores for the NRS, ACR, NDI, and ODI all decreased compared with baseline. Conclusion: This study suggests that Korean medicine treatment that includes Onkyung-tang can be effective in reducing pain and increasing ability to function in patients with fibromyalgia.", "sitename": "The Journal of Internal Korean Medicine", "date": "2021-05-30", "cleaned_text": "References - Slim M, Calandre EP, Rico-Villademoros F.
