Chronic pain and mental health care needs in Canada that existed before COVID-19 remain unmet and have been exacerbated by the pandemic. The Alberta Societal Health Integration Program (ABSHIP) proposes an innovative community-based model in which Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) services are provided to help achieve social recovery and improve economic participation. Methods Participants will receive CAM treatment in two modes: a minimum of two acupuncture treatment sessions per week for up to a total of 12 treatments, and voluntary Qigong exercise. The study will recruit 150 participants between the ages of 14 and 55 who are suffering from pain or mental health issues that are causing severe productivity loss. Primary outcome indicators are productivity (WPAI), pain (BPI), quality of sleep (PSQI), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), anger (DAR-5), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and substance use (DAST-10 & CAGE). Secondary outcome indicators include general health care utilization, which will be measured by patients' self-reported inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, and prescription drug utilization. Data will be collected at baseline (before treatment) and after the sixth and twelfth session (post-treatment) to measure short-term outcomes of the study. To understand the long- term impact of ABSHIP, participants will be invited to take the same survey three and six months after completing the program. Discussion ABSHIP is a \u0000rst-of-its-kind study that provides CAM integrated interventions to enhance pain management, as well as protecting and fostering psychosocial well-being and resilience in children, adolescents, and seniors. The successful completion of the project will result in cost savings as well as signi\u0000cant evidence to aid instrument policy in the short and long run. Trial Registration This interventional study involving human participants, has been approved by the University of Calgary (UofC) Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (CHREB) (ethics ID: REB 21-2050). BackgroundPage 4/16During the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), public health measures were implemented in countries all over the world to prevent COVID-19 from spreading [1]. In March 2020, wide- scale emergency measures were implemented in Canada, drastically limiting Canadians' capacity to engage in employment, educational, recreational, and social activities [2]. As a result, a wide variety of issues such as stress, anxiety, frustration, and isolation have been negatively affecting people's sleep, eating, substance abuse, and leading to worsening of chronic conditions and mental health [1, 2]. In addition, economic recessions and related job and income losses could also further trigger substance abuse and mental health crises [3-8]. According to a 2015 RAND corporation study, the following factors cause signi\u0000cant productivity loss at the workplace: mental health problems; lack of sleep; chronic health conditions [9]. It is concerning how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect people who already suffer from pain. Pain is a common health problem that has the potential to have a massive economic impact globally [9-11]. For example, headaches, neck tension and discomfort, and lower back pain are believed to be the most common causes of lost productivity [12]. Lately, numerous investigations have indicated that the COVID-19 epidemic has exacerbated the anguish of many people suffering from chronic pain or lower back pain [12-14]. Furthermore, working from home during a pandemic has negative health consequences, such as musculoskeletal pain. Employees who engaged in remote work or distance learning during the COVID-19 outbreak suffered increased neck or lower back discomfort, according to previous studies [13, 15]. In addition to the shift in working practices, the government encouraged people to stay at home, which may have resulted in a decrease in physical activity [16, 17] as well as an increase in psychological stress [18, 19]. Pain was found to be highly related with low levels of physical activity and the presence of psychological disorders [20-22]. These changes in working habits and physical activity patterns, as well as the increase in psychological stress caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, may have an in\u0000uence on individuals who are already in pain. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a signi\u0000cant and long-lasting negative impact on the mental health and wellbeing of Canadians [23, 24]. People with low incomes or those who are unemployed or laid off report higher rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and increased substance use [25, 26]. These factors not only worsen the condition of previously healthy individuals but also deteriorate the situation of individuals with pre-existing mental issues. Additionally, the economic collapse that is anticipated to occur after the pandemic would likely have a disproportionately negative impact on socially disadvantaged individuals, especially those from ethnic minorities who have inferior access to healthcare, which might increase health-care inequities [27]. These unmet social determinants of health and unmet mental health treatment needs that existed in Canada before COVID-19 persists with the current system, according to the Canadian Mental Health Association [23]. The effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in treating issues including chronic pain, mental stress, anxiety, and depression has been shown by scienti\u0000c research [28-30]. CAM refers to medical practices that are not part of conventional medical care, such as acupuncture and mind-body exercises. Acupuncture is bene\u0000cial in addressing various problems including chronic pain, mental stress,Page 5/16anxiety, depression, non-medicated pain relief, and substance abuse [28-34]. Many studies have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in treating patients with depression when used in conjunction with conventional treatment [31, 35]. Mind-body therapies have been found to alleviate musculoskeletal pain, improve mental health (reduce anxiety, depression, distress), improve sleep quality for people with chronic illness, and enhance cognitive and memory function for patients with mild cognitive impairment, and improve exercise capability and pulmonary function of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients as well as quality of life [36], improve blood pressure for hypertension patients [37], improve the quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and fatigue of cancer patients [38], and improve global cognition in adults with cognitive impairment [39]. To cope with the needs for meeting arising pain and mental health needs as an aftermath of COVID-19, we need urgent intervention. Pursuant to this, we propose the Alberta Societal Health Integration Program (ABSHIP), the \u0000rst of its kind, to develop a community-based CAM service model that is cost-effective and can address society's needs for improving mental health and overall well-being, enhancing productivity and economic participation, and ultimately facilitating social recovery. The CAM services offered in this program adopt a holistic approach and place a greater emphasis on general health than on speci\u0000c illness states, a concept that is still relatively new. For the vulnerable population in Alberta, the objective of ABSHIP approach is to mitigate, treat, and prevent the mental health and pain related issues that arise in response to or when recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and promote development and continued well-being, and in doing so increase community integration, overall productivity and increase economic participation. Methods Study population and inclusion criteria Patients with pain or mental health concerns between the ages of 14 and 55 who meet the following criteria and have any of the listed concerns or conditions, will be included in our study: 1. student, employed, or looking for work; 2. has not received acupuncture treatments within the last 3 months; 3. with mental health concerns and/or conditions (e.g. sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, fatigue, burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc.); 4. with chronic or acute pain, or pain management issues. The above conditions were chosen because these are the factors found to cause signi\u0000cant productivity loss. In addition, bene\u0000cial effects of CAM on these conditions are well established. Exclusion criteria We have excluded children under the age of 14 and elderly population above 55 years old. Children under the age of 14 are excluded because compliance with CAM treatment, especially acupuncture treatment, isPage 6/16very low among younger children. Adults over the age of 55 are excluded because our program is focused on enhancing productivity for those who are in school or workforce. Our exclusion criteria are: 1. those who do not give their consent; 2. children whose parents or guardians do not give their consent; 3. those who withdrew their consent; 4. those who have received acupuncture within the last 3 months; 5. Those who are not available or comfortable receiving CAM or cannot meet the minimum treatment frequency requirement. Recruitment procedures Our study targets Albertans facing challenges with mental health and well-being issues that include chronic or acute pain or pain management issues that impact overall wellness. A total of 150 patients will be recruited for the study. Patients will be recruited through public outreach efforts. For instance, the study's website, https://www.abship.ca/ will be made available to the general population. Posters and \u0000iers will be utilized to attract potential participants as well. Additionally, the project aims to increase program outreach and raise knowledge of ABSHIP by enlisting the help of civil society organizations and conventional medical doctors to recruit participants. Civil society organizations would distribute ABSHIP project information so that potential participants can contact the research team if they are interested. To further reach those in need, the project will also seek to collaborate with primary care physicians, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Data collection We will collect comprehensive information on participants' well-being with their permission, using widely used and validated survey instruments, which measure: Mental health (anxiety, depression, fatigue, anger); Pain, and sleep quality; Quality of life; Health care utilization; Return to Work / School (employment / school status, weekly hours of paid work, days of absence from work / school, and return- to-work or school date) (for details, see Table 1). This data will be collected via and stored on REDCap, a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases, hosted by the Clinical Research Unit (CRU), a core research support center at the University of Calgary. At the end of the \u0000rst consultation session, the participant will be asked to answer questions from an online questionnaire on REDCap. This questionnaire collects basic demographic information such as age and gender, as well as patient's Alberta Personal Health Number (PHN), information on chronic pain, addiction, and mental health, as well as quality of life. Participant's medical records will not be accessed at this stage. After the 6th and 12th treatment sessions, the participant will be asked to answer questions from an online questionnaire on REDCap. Information on chronic pain, mental health, addiction, and quality of life will again be collected for the purpose of treatment effect monitoring and outcome evaluation. This willPage 7/16help estimate the result in the short-term. Participants will get emails inviting them to complete the same surveys through REDCap three months post-treatment and six months post-treatment in order to understand the study impact over the long run. The information we collect throughout the study will be utilized to establish a database that will allow us to establish a unique means to monitor and evaluate the mental health and well-being, quality of life, and social recovery of the participants of the program. This database will have the potential to be linked with the Alberta Health Services (AHS) database to enable comprehensive research conducted by the civic society. This would further allow us to generate evidence that would inform both service providers as well as policy makers, and better meet the recovery-oriented needs of the people served. Outcome measures The primary outcome variables are patients' productivity, pain, quality of sleep, mental health and quality of life. Productivity will be measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI). Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form will measure pain. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will measure Quality of sleep. Depression will be measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores, Anxiety will be measured using the GAD-7, Anger will be measured using the DAR-5, and quality of life will be measured using EQ-5D-5L. Substance use will be measured using CAGE & DAST-10 questionnaires. The secondary outcome variables are patients' general health care utilization. This will be measured by patient self-reported inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, and prescription drug utilization. The outcome measures are illustrated in Table 1:Page 8/16Table 1 Outcome Measures Measure Instrument Description Productivity Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI)Utilizing a questionnaire, productivity is assessed in terms of work time missed and job and activity limitations caused by a speci\u0000c health issue over the previous seven days. The \u0000rst portion of the question inquires as to how health issues may affect one's capacity for employment and participation in daily activities. The second section particularly inquiries about academic performance. Pain severityBrief Pain Inventory (BPI)Calculated by taking the mean of four pain intensity questions: pain at its \"worst\" in the prior week, pain at its \"least\" in the previous week, pain at its \"average\" in the preceding week, and pain \"now.\" The answers to the four questions ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the most excruciating pain imaginable. Pain interferenceBrief Pain Inventory (BPI)Calculated using the average of seven questions about how much pain affects various aspects of everyday living, including general activity, mood, walking ability, regular work (both inside and outside the home), relations, sleep, and life enjoyment. The response to each question ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 denoting no interference with function and 10 denoting severe inhibition of function due to pain. Sleep QualityPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)The scale consists of two parts: \u0000ve questions that are rated by a bed partner and 19 self-reported questions that are used to rate the scale. Subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual SE, sleep disruptions, usage of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction are all covered in the questionnaire. In order to get scores that correlate to the scale's domains, questions are evaluated from 0 (no di\u0000culty) to 3 (extreme di\u0000culty). A higher PSQI score indicates worse sleep. Depression Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)The PHQ-9 score is calculated by adding the responses to nine questions on how frequently patients experienced nine depressive symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness, a loss of interest in activities, and appetite loss, in addition to anxiety and alcohol use. A higher score on the PHQ-9 scale, which goes from 0 to 27, suggests more severe depression. Anxiety Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)From a self-reported seven item questionnaire, the GAD-7 measures the severity of various GAD symptoms. The score is determined by summing the scores for each of the seven questions, then assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the corresponding response categories of \"not at all,\" \"several days,\" \"more than half the days,\" \"nearly every day.\" Anger Dimensions of Anger Reactions (DAR-5)Dimensions of Anger Reactions (DAR-5) is a 5 item test that measures anger experience. The inquiry examines the frequency, intensity, duration, level of aggression, and in\u0000uence on functioning of anger over the last four weeks.Page 9/16Measure Instrument Description Substance useCut, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye (CAGE) & Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST- 10)The CAGE questionnaire, which consists of four questions, is a screening tool for identifying alcoholism issues. It is intended to be used to suggest whether a potential issue might exist. In addition, DAST-10 is utilized which speci\u0000cally asks about involvement with substances other than alcohol, such as non-medical drug usage and excessive prescription drug use. The patient responds with \"yes\" or \"no\" to each question, which corresponds to the last 12 months. Overall Quality of LifeEQ-5D-5L Mobility, self-care, routine activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression make up the \u0000ve components of the questionnaire. There are \u0000ve degrees for each dimension: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. According to the instrument's instructions, a health utility score will be created using the responses to the \u0000ve questions. This number runs from slightly less than zero, signifying a health condition worse than death, to one, signifying perfect health. A higher score represents better health. Health care utilizationSelf-reporting mechanismPatients' self-report the number and frequency of their medication intake, in addition to how often they had contact with different healthcare providers, hospitalizations, and ER visits in the previous week. To ascertain whether the visits and prescription consumption were related to the same problem for which ABSHIP therapy was initiated, inquiries will be made. For economic analysis, the typical number of ER visits and the anticipated number of hospital admissions will be considered. Data analysis Our primary outcome indicators are productivity, pain, quality of sleep, mental health and quality of life which will be measured by changes in patients' WPA, BPI, PSQI, PHQ-9, GAD-7, DAR-5, and use will be measured using the DAST-10 and CAGE questionnaires. The proportion/mean for each demographic variable, as well as baseline health status including mental health, addiction, and quality of life will be reported by employing descriptive statistics. Additionally, chi- square tests will be used to compare the prevalence or mean of mental health, addiction, and quality of care, and healthcare utilizations at admission and discharge. Furthermore, multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis will be performed to analyze what factors are associated with better outcomes. In the modeling, we will also include demographic variables (age, sex, socioeconomic status, occupation), baseline health status (mental health and addiction), patient self-reported utilization of conventional care, as well as measures of CAM treatment received. These \u0000rst-hand data collected from patient surveys will be used to conduct outcome and economic evaluation, including cost effectiveness and cost bene\u0000t analysis. For instance, using the operating cost collected as well as outcome measures constructed, we will be equipped to provide cost effectiveness analysis of the intervention. We will also translate the observed impacts into cost savings measured by both reduction in direct cost (i.e. hospital, physician, drug, research and other institutional care expenditures) and indirect costs (i.e. reduction of quality of life,Page 10/16lost production due to disability and premature mortality), using evidence from the economic burden of illness literature. Comparing the cost and bene\u0000t of the ABSHIP program will inform policy makers whether there is potential cost saving from integrating conventional medicine and CAM for the health care system in both short-term and long-term. Ethics and Data Security The Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (CHREB), University of Calgary, has evaluated and approved this study. The researchers will take precautions to ensure the con\u0000dentiality of the participant's personal information. Although every effort will be made to maintain participant information's privacy, an inadvertent privacy breach is always possible. The study team will manage data in accordance with the following Data Management Plan: The participant's personal contact information will be stored separately from his/her health information. Identi\u0000able information about the participant will be replaced with a code. A master list linking the code and the participant's identi\u0000able information will be kept separate from the research data. This master list will be kept under lock and key. In all arms of the study, all data will only be accessible to the project team members, with the exception of representatives of the CHREB and/or funding agencies for the purposes of quality assurance (i.e. to ensure that the study is being conducted in an ethical manner). In the case of an ethical review, these representatives will perform their duties under the supervision of the principal investigator. Except when professional rules of ethics or laws (or the law) necessitate reporting, all material will be kept con\u0000dential. Paper documents will be held in a closed \u0000le cabinet on the University of Calgary campus, while electronic information will be retained on secure servers managed by the UofC and AHS. The REDCap data platform from the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at the University of Calgary will be used for survey distribution and data storage. This is done for two reasons. First, the CRU has all necessary data sharing/storage agreements with Alberta Health Services in place. Second, the CRU server is physically located on the University of Calgary campus, ensuring that all information provided is not subject to other stipulations such as the US Patriot Act. This overcomes major limitations of software and servers housed outside of Canada. Discussion The goal of this research is to create a community-based CAM service model that is both cost-effective and can effectively improve mental health and well-being. In doing so, it has the potential to aid social recovery by improving not just general health, such as sleep, pain management, and mental health issues, but also quality of life and well-being, self-esteem, resilience, healing, and hence social inclusion. Projects on this scale can further boost economic participation by lowering absenteeism and presenteeism among workers and encouraging re-entry. This initiative can assist in the development and implementation of a Science-Policy-Practice Network for social recovery in Alberta as it intends to share and promote the experience of collaboration and complementary health integration outcomes with other health professionals, health organizations,Page 11/16community groups, and the general public. It also intends to reach out to other mental health agencies and recovery capitals in order to encourage greater implementation of this concept. It is feasible to integrate all these different resources and produce value through partnerships by testing an innovative, scalable, and transportable community-based CAM service model. This program's conceptualization, execution, and evaluation framework might serve as a model for innovative service delivery and cutting-edge research in this \u0000eld. This methodology might be extended across partnerships and could be expanded to include services such as detoxi\u0000cation and harm reduction centers. However, there are two major methodological limitations of the evaluation plan of ABSHIP. First, as ABSHIP is not an RCT and there is no control group. Second, health utilization is self-reported and subjected to recalling and reporting errors. Given, ABSHIP is a \u0000rst-of-its kind CAM integration intervention project, rigorous outcome and health economics evaluation using real-world data from ABSHIP is crucial to generate policy implications. If this initiative is effective, the important lessons and knowledge gained from it might motivate the replication of such programs for other groups in Alberta, Canada, and throughout the world.

The \u0000rst participant was added in October 2022, and the recruitment procedure is still ongoing. Treatment regimen In ABSHIP, CAM treatment protocols will be designed based on established evidence as well as the clinical expertise of both local and international CAM experts. A CAM treatment plan for a single complaint typically lasts one to three months, involving two modalities: a minimum of twice a week and up to a total of 12 acupuncture treatments provided by licensed practitioners, and regular Qigong exercise on a voluntary basis. The quantity of the actual treatment will depend on the condition being treated and its severity. Participants will not need to pay for the interventions they receive in ABSHIP. To determine the type of CAM treatment that will help the participant the most, the practitioner will ask the patients questions about his or her symptoms (e.g. sleeping, digestion) and lifestyle (e.g. diet), and conduct close examinations of parts of the participant's body that are painful; shape, coating, and color of the participant's tongue; color of the participant's face; strength, rhythm, and quality of the pulse in the participant's wrist. Based on the examinations and discussions of the patient's expectations and treatment goals, the practitioner will propose an individualized CAM treatment plan for the patient, using the established treatment protocols as a guideline.
