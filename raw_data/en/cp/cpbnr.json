This study seeks to understand how chronic lung disease impacts SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited immunity. Methods Deep immune phenotyping of humoral and cell mediated responses to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was performed in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) compared to healthy controls. Results 48% of vaccinated patients with chronic lung diseases had reduced antibody titers to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen relative to healthy controls. Vaccine antibody titers were significantly reduced among asthma (p<0.035), COPD (p<0.022), and a subset of ILD patients as early as 3-4 months after vaccination, correlating with decreased vaccine-specific memory B cells in circulation. Vaccine-specific memory T cells were significantly reduced in patients with asthma (CD8+ p<0.004; CD4+ p<0.023) and COPD (CD8+ p<0.008) compared to healthy controls. Impaired T cell responsiveness was also observed in a subset of ILD patients (CD8+ 21.4%; CD4+ 42.9%). Additional heterogeneity between healthy and disease cohorts was observed among bulk and vaccine-specific follicular T helper cells. Conclusions Deep immune phenotyping of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response revealed the complex nature of vaccine-elicited immunity and highlights the need for more personalised vaccination schemes in patients with underlying lung conditions.
