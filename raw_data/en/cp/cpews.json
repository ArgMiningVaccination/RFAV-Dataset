Clean out the old to bring in the new and return choice to your life. When our soul is in the driver seat, it heals the inner world and the outer world reflects our changes. As we choose our soul, our soul provides through the power, love, and intelligence of the divine. Our inner world can contain any number of stagnant energies, such as heavy emotions, traumas, anxieties, depression, grief, sadness, shame, anger, resentment, etc. By releasing these stagnant energies, we heal the inner world and this healing is reflected in the changes in our outer world. If we want true healing in our life, we must bring awareness to what is present in ourselves. A great way to start doing this is by setting an intention for our time together. The most important step in healing is in the integration. What about your life changes moving forward? If we want true healing for our body, we must bring awareness to what is present in ourselves and release energies that aren't serving us. A great way to begin to do this is by setting an intention. Schedule **IMPORTANT NOTE ON ARRIVAL** Creators space will have their doors closed at this time. I or one of the security guards will be letting people in through one of the doors around 6:45-7PM. We'll be downstairs in the Earth room. Please check your email for contact info if you don't see me(Kevin) at the entrance. I strongly encourage you to be here before 7:00PM as we will be starting promptly at 7:00PM. This is important because I can't be in 2 places at once letting people in and I want to ensure safety of the container by not letting in late people. All of us starting together is done purposefully to cultivate an environment where everyone can feel safe to be vulnerable and share with others without being interrupted by new energies/people entering into the space. 7:00-8:15PM Cacao, Sound, And Energy Healing session We'll be opening the space up with prayer and a quick meditation to ask the divine for blessings for us, the space, and the cacao. Afterwards, you'll be invited to share in an opening circle and connect with everyone. This is a perfect opportunity to be heard and be seen in whatever is going on. After the opening sharing circle and meditation, we'll move into the sound and energy meditation portion of the night. The best thing you can do for yourself during this is to relax and receive. When we're relaxed, it allows our bodies to release stagnant energies and heavier emotions to bring deeper healing to us. How much can you allow? How much can you receive? How much can you relax? Here are some prompts to help you get the most out of the meditation: - How much can you relax? - How deeply can you allow your emotions to be present? - How present can you be to your feelings or pains? - How much awareness can you bring to all parts of you? - What messages do your emotions have for you? - When did you first feel them? 8:15-8:30PM Connection! We'll end with a sharing circle. This is a great opportunity to share anything that came up for you and want support on from the group. When we attempt to put words to our experiences it helps us to integrate what we just felt or experienced. It helps us to ground down the lessons and apply them to our day to day life when we speak it out. 8:30pm Ceremony Closes! We'll end with a group prayer to close out the ceremony and space. Thank you to those who have read this far. Here are some testimonials from previous attendees! \"Kevin led such a profound sound healing experience tonight full of a beautiful blend of vocals, soft drumming, violin, sound bowls, and other acoustics I can't quite explain. Thank you for sharing your medicine with us Kevin. Your music helped shift some serious stagnation I was feeling in my body/mind. Please don't ever quit doing what you're doing.\" - Bryan \"I've attended a handful of Kevin's sound healing ceremonies and each time has been profound! I feel so relaxed after and so much negative energy is released. I had terrible anxiety prior to coming to his ceremonies, but since going my anxieties have decreased dramatically. He is passionate about his healing work and genuinely wants to help heal others. If you are on your healing journey or looking to start you've come to the right place! \" - Lylia \"Kevin is a powerful healer with a heart of gold and a beautiful voice. I'd recommend him to anyone I know - he's the real deal!\" - Ahna How do I reserve my spot? We have a limited amount of spots available in this space and spots fill up QUICKLY.

FAQ How should I prepare? If you want to get the most out of these ceremonies, then I strongly encourage you to think about an intention leading up to ceremony. The best way to figure out an intention for ceremony is to get as clear as possible on what kind of life you'd like to be living. What kind of experiences you'd enjoy, what kind of work, relationships, friends, family, etc. Then from there you ask yourself, what is blocking me from having this in my life now? Here are some prompts that may help you form a solid intention: - What kind of life do I want to be living when it comes to _________?(family, career, romantic, etc.) - What is blocking me from experiencing this kind of life? - What do I know I need to be doing, that I will do, that I'm not doing? - What does the ideal me experience in life?(Your highest self) Here are some ideas to help you come up with something if you're struggling with this. - I want to find more clarity on this tough relationship I have with ______ - I want to release some sadness/anger/anxiety around ______ - I want to experience more love/happiness - I want to continue integrating a spiritual experience I had recently in whatever capacity is needed - I would like more awareness around my career and where to go next - I want to find more forgiveness for myself, family, exs, friends, etc. Spend time making your intention specific. This will help you formulate how to move towards that life in the coming days, weeks, years. For example, instead of saying \"I want to experience more love\" say something like \"I want to experience more love when it comes to working in my career\" Now you're narrowing the context to your career and it will be easier for spirit to bring you love and experiences relating to your career. What should I bring? - Your beautiful self! - Think of an intention or something you'd like to release or work through. If you need help thinking this through, check the section above or send me a DM, https://linktr.ee/SoulResonanceHealing - A travel mug! I often have extra cacao at the end of ceremony so if you'd like to take some home you are more than welcome to - If you wish to bring any blankets, yoga mats, pillows, etc. to help you be comfortable on the floor, you are welcome to do so. Creators Space has a lot of these things so if you don't remember to bring any of this, that's okay too! You will be taken care of. What is Sound Healing? That's a great question! Sound Healing is a great way to release energies that no longer serve us. A concept to help begin to build this awareness is that we are all frequencies. Solid objects are just molecules vibrating at certain frequencies. Same with liquids and gases and all other forms of energy. Everything breaks down to energy including us. When we apply this to sound healing with a combination of our intent this allows us focus on different parts of our bodies to release stagnant energy from our bodies. This can be things like emotions or traumas or anything of the sort. Often Sound Healing is a very gentle way to enter into different parts of our bodies and when combined with meditation can offer up a safe space to gently release what no longer serves us.

Don't you mean Cocoa? Cacao is different than cocoa. Ceremonial grade cacao is minimally processed cocoa. Cocoa typically has it's cocoa butter(fat) removed, and a lot of the nutrients and energetic properties are destroyed via tempering. The cacao I serve, Keiths Cacao, is 100% pure cacao-bean paste that contains a much higher quantity of beneficial, health restoring, and mood-elevating compounds vs any other cacao based product on the market such as dark chocolate, cacao powder, or other chocolate based products. Cacao contains high amounts of magnesium, antioxidants(vitamin A, C & E, beta-carotene and manganese), flavanols, potassium, and theobromine. When it's used in a ceremonial way it can have numerous benefits as well. This can include experiences like: - A feeling of heart expansion that brings feelings of oneness, love, ecstasy and connection - When our hearts are opened this allows for an easier ability to heal ourselves. We can release blocks, stagnation, recognize patterns and listen to our heart more easily - Connecting to your highest self, truth, and soul - A shamanic or spiritual journey. Some people have reported seeing visions or being shown things relevant to things they needed to learn about their life or can apply to different relationships, their career, family, or greater insight into themselves - A space to enter into meditation - being able to silence the mind, connect to the wisdom and spirit within you - A balance of masculine and feminine energies in the body - Enhanced creativity What is Reiki? Reiki at its core is a Japanese relaxation technique. It is used as a way to help people relax their muscles, reduce stress, and allow for more energy flow in their bodies. At a higher level, what is happening is the practioner is helping your spirit connect to God/Source/Creator(however you want to label it) and then if you are open and receptive, your spirit will then use this energy to heal itself and in turn your body. All is connected. Our spirit, soul and body. Heal any of these things and it'll heal the other pieces of you. The actual healing is between you and the creator and I am only opening the door for you. What is Pranic Healing? Pranic Healing is actually a distillation of essences of the world's most effective healing modalities Chinese Chi Kung, Reiki, Christian \"laying on of hands\", Tibetan Healing arts and more. Why combine Cacao, Sound Healing, and Energy Healing? The short answer is, it's what spirit has guided me to do. What I've seen is all of these modalities on their own bring amazing experiences of healing. When these are combined, I've found that it amplifies what people experience in the space and brings an incredibly powerful healing ceremony for everyone who is willing to receive this healing. Plus I just love doing this. It brings me so much joy to explore the combination of all these modalities and I think it brings a unique experience for all who choose to join. Tags About the "}
