Each room is arrayed with its own decor and theme, and each one, too, leads on to greater spaces not yet seen from here, but hinted at by beckoning sound and playing shafts of light, by wafting breezes of the freshness of flowers and the delicate dampness of the dew... Preface This book draws on a life spent exploring the diverse terrains of natural healing not only out of necessity, but out of fascination, affinity and ultimately love. I love how this creation works with seemless interweaving, and endless variety. I learn through careful observation at each new stage in healing, not only my own, but the thousands of people I have measured and fitted with precisely matched natural medicines, many of which are the topics of this book. My mission here is to share my mind with you, dear reader. This is a mind that works contextually, relationally, synthetically... a mind that seeks the fullness of the truth, and the details of each story within it, and then explores every avenue at hand to map out the fullness of that terrain. You could say I am a collector of natural remedies. My job here is to organize a comprehensive, if never complete, tour of the landscape of natural healing, what I call accelerated self healing... Introduction Historically there have been, and continue to be many different approaches to the art of healing. What I love the most about biocommunication is the ability to cross-reference many if not all of those competing conceptual structures about the nature of this life and its perfection within the same linguistic, syntactic structure that is the native tongue of this biological vessel in which we dwell here for a time... It is the intent of these Volumes to begin a conversation in which we lay out a map of the very fullness of the terrains and contents of Nature's cornucopia of healing. All the while, we may well bear in mind that the journey of each Soul through those landscapes is unique. Yet, the tools, like map and compass, and a little familiarity with the modalities of navigation can suit our journey well, whether Captain of our own Ship, or Navigator and interpreter of the meanings of the sky and waves. Dedication To my chief Apprentice and best of companions, S.L. Luscombe who keeps me anchored here, and supplies so many inspirations. Thank you. Solutions The Living Soul can only thrive when we apply our cures with intent to serve and nourish the higher Angels of our Nature, and first do no harm to our immortal Life. Palliation Care must be taken even in works of corporal Mercy, in the palliation of symptoms for the relief of suffering, that we keep always the goal in mind of the immortal Life of the Soul. What profit can there be even in the relief of the pain of some mortal affliction, if the remedy so disorients the spirit that any preparation or navigation of the transcendence from the life within the biological form leaves the immortal spiritual substance unaware and lacking in even more fundamental freedoms of choice in navigation just when the Heavens might otherwise be opened up in receptivity. Lest we err by presumption that opiates, say, cannot possibly impair the transition of a good and gentle soul in passage toward the infinite and undefined (by all our best measures), shall we not choose the means with care by which we annoint the sick and dying? After all, is it not the unconsciousness of full and irrevocable spiritual death, not this mission of suffering awareness of Life's challenges that is our greatest foe? The great seduction of synthetic pharmacy is the untruth that reduction of a symptom is of its nature a Good. In Truth, we must discern all spirits, both the delicate beating of symphonic wings of our Angelic nature, and of all that we grant entry into our sanctuaries of awareness, desire, word, deed and contemplation. It is on the sea of those waves that the vessel of our Soul sinks or sails. Though the irritation of a flapping sail may cease whether the loose rigging is cut or made fast, only one choice will move us toward our destination. We must become masters of our craft, using all our senses, all our faculties of heart and mind, and act with care and compassion toward this, the divine gift of life that is our bio-body suit, our vessel in these times of tempests tossed. Support The Body is made for Nature and Nature for the Body. Make no mistake in falling into the unreasoning traps of Modernism. If the Body were merely an exquisite carbon based machine adapted through eons to survive the natural order of planet Earth, there would be no adaptation to prepare it to fare better by the introduction of novel synthetic compounds, or by the fractionation of those foods which have always been provided in their wholesomeness. Yet, a carbon-copy alone has no Life in it, no Animus, no Spirit, no Soul. And the Soul, too, must feed, like upon like. The Spirit Minerals, Angels of our higher Nature come to us in our very breath, the spiritus. They come to us in the wholeness of living things as food. They come to us, too, as we beckon with the integrity of our thoughts, our prayers, our acts of kindness and of love. Above all, they seek Sanctuary, Reunion with the Oneness of our Inheritence... Fractal Creatures in the Living Cathedral of the Heavens, God's Body reuniting in Divine Love, God's Blood, God's Life giving Breath, God's indivisible Divinity granted from within at our very word when that word is congruent in our Hearts and Coherent with the Way, the Truth and the Life of our shared sensorial Hubble Sphere, this fractal holographic Cell in God's Body. Stimulation By definition, we shall take the approach that energetically correct remedies are those which deomonstrably produce a state of increased congruence, harmony and coherence in the bio-body suit. Our observation over 30 years of pursuing this method has been that the body heals itself in remarkable ways that are not seen within the confines of the conventional culture's methodologies. The body, including the skin, the joints, the digestive tract, the heart, the eye and the brain have demonstrated such unpredicted capacities for self renewal even in the face of severe traumatic damage, longstanding degenerative conditions, advanced age, and blindness thought by all standards to have been irreversible. That is not to say that such responses are uniform or predictable, but rather that what we have thought to be impossible is no barrier but for the mind. Exploration itself is the only measure of the possible. The viable Soul itself carries the indellible image of the perfect body, untarnished even by inheritance of epigentic miasms and unbound by episodes of incomplete healing of the past. Rather, the image which manifests is of the very source of its immortality, its coherence with its future self, itself transcendent of time and space via the non-locality that is the very essence of Life. In this pursuit it becomes evident that as within, also manifesting in the outer consensual sphere there is a call to healing and regeneration of a culture of Life. To this end, I pledge my sacred oath, my life, my ministry and my last breath. In this work, we aim to heal the great divide of Des Cartes, reuniting the Body, the Materia, with the Soul, the Anima, as they are one in Life. In Death, the body alone is found in the here and now, while the Soul Lives on, as it does in the Life biological, in the non-local from our present view.

Heaven is first, our compass by which any other map or model brings us Home. Home to the infinite future which we already possess as birthright... given freely. As we our now called to give... to pay forward. The complete understanding of the economy of the soul must begin by seeing the vortex, the eddie of the Divine River that is all this creation, in all its temporal and developmental manifestations is of its substance of the Unifying Divine Nature. Called ORMes by David Hudson in his 1995 patents. Called ORMUS by most modern alchemists. Were referred to generically as Mono-atomic elements, but some, like Aurum (Gold) is thought on theoretical grounds to be diatomic, in order to function as a boson, a prerequisite for entering the Condensate state. A boson is an entity with integer spin, and is governed by Bose-Einstein statistics. Bosons can be fundamental particles like the Higgs boson, the four gauge bosons of the Standard Model, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity. Bosons can also be composite particles like mesons, stable nuclei of even mass number (or a diatomic pair of nuclei with an odd number such as Aurum) as well quasiparticles like Cooper pairs. Bosons contrast with fermionic particles in being able to coordinate an infinite number of bosons in a single shared quantum state. What God has put together... The terminology Monatomic is now often shortened to simply M-state. A related state was documented in Nobel Prizewinning research on this new, fifth state of matter know as the Bose Einstein Condensate. Both BECs at near absolute zero, and ORMUS, partially (variable but typically 5/9) anchored in this space/time appear to involve Cooper pairing of electrons, resulting in the quantum properties of macroscopic planar liquid crystals including superfluidity and superconduction, making the soul vessel a fully operational stargate potentially captained by its consciousness, a fractal presence of the Galactic center, itself a living fractal of the Triunity, seen by those in darkness as Dark Matter, and Black Holes, but known to even their Hearts as Sacred and Sublime, radiant not only with the light of the Mind, but the superlight of the Soul, which Love keeps us here... On this blue-green celestial orb (turning only a tad brown as the solar system itself heats up as we begin to receive the Flame of Divine Love, outpouring from that endless Sea of Divine Love)... Limits of Conventional Culture Commerce is based on the earliest written law, the law of Hamurabi, which is the law of the sea, and of war. It is fundamentally a competitive or adversarial stance with our fellow beings. We are encouraged to extract as much life essence as possible from each other. It is time to make the radical reframing of commerce according to the root of the word, which I read as com merce, or with mercy. The sacred gift economy is how we treat family, and ultimately we are all members of the royalty of the heavens. We are all cells in God's body. The more I can give of the abundance which is given me in this life, the happier I am, and the better I make the world I live in. The commercial assumption of scarcity as the basis for the market economy can give way to a foundational well spring of abundance when we find our vocational calling, in which we have unlimited supply of our unique special gifts, the product of having faced and overcome the unique challenges given each of us in this life. Education works better with active minds seeking truth than with a top down curriculum and a prescription for no child left behind, which translates to no child gets ahead. Experiments in Socratic education show better learning by placing the locus of control more in the hands of the learner. With thought, orientation and actions more centered in the self and the expression of natural curiosity, rather than the teacher as an externally imposed authority, there is less adaptation and related loss of physiological flexibility, as seen for example in the classic Cheshire study in Connecticut. Even myopia rates were documented to go down among students during the period of innovation. Medicine today is largely ruled by the incentives of corporate profits. The pharmaceutical industry is the most lucrative in the world. There is every incentive for suppression of negative observations about drugs, and every opportunity to do so, since funding comes from the manufacturers, and there are no requirements to make all data available to the public. There is a saying in statistics that figures don't lie, but liars figure. Statistics itself was never intended for application to treating humans as population statistics. It was designed for treating a field of wheat or a herd of sheep, but we have become its sheeple. This great toxic experiment of modern monopoly medicine traces its roots to the Flexner Report, which showed the Rockefellers and Carnegies where to get the best return on their money as they looked at expanding into (taking over) the field of medicine. Actually, the Rockefellers started out in the medical field, with rock oil (petroleum) being sold as a cure-all medicine. It beat out snake oil through viscious villification of the competitor, but today we know that all the coal tar based drugs do not cure disease, but only add a new layer of allopathic disease to our bio-body suit's akashic karma cleaning laundry list. We also can know, if we care to take a second look at what we believe we know, that snake oil turns out to be the highest known source of essential fatty acids. Go figure... Law is not true law that can be broken and thereby falsified. Natural law is fundamental law. Man's law, beginning with that of Hammurabi, is merely a code of behavior. It is the will of the lawmakers, whoever and wherever they may have been. It is a selectively enforced taxation, or destructive force, a sanctioned use of violence against those who would find some creative, locally adaptive self-governing way of living. Farmers are the most notoriously difficult to govern by remote central authorities. Natural law is a different kind of authority, operating always and everywhere in the same way, though we as yet fail to fully grasp its ways and means. God's ways, after all, are not man's ways... Even Newton's 'law of universal gravitation' is not a true law in its current formulation. If it were, there would be no levitating M-state spirit minerals and no enraptured saints levitating or flying, of which history shows us multiple examples including Theresa of Avilla (1515-1582), Joseph of Cupertino (1603-1663), Paul The fullness of natural law, while it encompasses that which we know and call gravity, obviously also encompasses a more rarified polarity which can be called levity. It is a greater portion of this levity that we here seek before our biological body suit finally succumbs to its destiny with the grave. To more closely approximate our model of the world to the truth of natural law, we must keep our eyes and minds open to the outliers, the data points that defy the curve, the irreproducible events, the mystical truths of our experience that our hearts and minds cannot deny, without denying the nature, beauty and sanctity of the gift of life itself. When the first European sailing ships anchored off South America, they were invisible to the native people on shore. After a few days, only the shaman could begin to make out something that appeared like a tree in the water. Over time, more elements of the ship became visible as new concepts were produced by relationship of these new observations with past experiences. We are blind to all that we as yet have no way to conceive. When the hole in the ozone layer was first measured in Australia, it was invisible. For many years. Each time a data point showed zero ozone, it was a data point that failed to fit the normal data distribution curve, and so it was discarded, being seen as merely a sign of some measurement error, chalked up to a malfunction is some part of the apparatus. To this day, many of the big questions in our understanding of life, the universe, god, spirit, healing and everything else remain on the sidelines, on the back burner, in the closet or swept neatly under the carpet. In reading and applying this book, I invite you to open your thinking and contemplate the fullness of the truth though we cannot absolutely know it all in this life. I invite you to invite your future self to be present here now in you, with you and through you as collaborator, guardian and guide in your quest for healing not only of your body's ills, but of any false limitations that have been imposed upon your thinking and your soul. The ego tracks the arrow of time forward as it seeks its center in the midst of eternity, ever knowing the limits of the past and seeking the unbounded future. The future self sees all with attentive care, knowing and infinite patience, seeing with clarity and perspective. It is the authentic presence of the integrative momentary essence of consciousness that has the ultimate power to synthesize meaningful blossoming of life and universal love in this transcendental and eternal now. We are awakening to the fullness of our selves as masters of this inheritance of the full vortex function of time. Our transcendent essence emanates through our assemblage point, that unique point of the singularity of our perspective, like that sought by Archimedes, that allows us to move the fractal world of our conscious co-creative awareness, the world inhabited by the soul. Lifestyle, Stress Management & Exercise The locus of control is a crucial element in reducing stress and improving quality of life. When rats are exposed randomly to shocks, with no way to control the effect, they die. Rats exposed to the same frequency and severity of shocks, whenever they get food or water, are able to survive this torture. Meaningfulness of activity makes the difference between an exercise plan that will soon be forgotten, and a lifelong pursuit such as gardening that also supports improved physical fitness. When diabetics take on an exercise program, it only affects their blood sugar levels if it is something they enjoy and find meaning in... Listening for your calling, and finding you vocation is the ultimate way to find meaningful action in life, and gain a sense of control that is fully congruent with the greater self, your future self, the person who you are becoming through gaining experience and personal growth the more you truly discern your soul's heart-felt passions and get on with your mission in life. Cutural systems ultimately reflect our inner vision of the outer world we inhabit. As we change our minds about the world, we change our destiny and that of the conscnsual world. The time is upon the generations now alive to question violence-based government, debt-based commerce, and essentially the materialism that is the inheritance of our animal nature. The gift of our spiritual nature is the capacity to see beyond our present cages of our Pavlovian conditioned responses to the freedom of the Elysian fields of the possible. With regard to the territorial behavior of violence as the foundation for earthly governance, the contrasting spiritual type is well manifest by the governance of the Church, which is acknowledged to have a complete system of law with the exception of enforcement. Enforcement of Law by a greater power over a lesser is a transgression of the divinely instituted angelic hierarchies, and therefore actually counter to Law in the True sense. An image of this relationship is expressed in the visions of Jesus after annointing with a 40 day dose of Holy Annointing oil containing the entheogen Cannabis. Satan offered the Christ (the annointed one) all the Kingdoms of the Earth, necessarily implying that they are in his employ, even if only by fraud and deception. With regard to banking and commerce, the modern notion that value (money) can be borrowed from the future generations without their consent to be used for usery and mental enslavement of the people, and repaid at interest by those same future generations is a fantastical notion that much bring much wonder in the Kingdom of the Heavens. Indeed, if it were possible for the future to make such a loan to the present, any profit would acrue to the original owners, our future selves, not the handlers and money changers for their sleight of hand. A similar trick has been played out upon us with regard to the great gift of material existence, including real estate, originally called Royal Estate. All creations belong to their creator. It is said that in 7 days, God created the Earth and everything in it, and with one signature, Satan mortgaged it to us. Spiritually, all we can truly own is any fiction or error that we create. And the only real error is that which we have yet to learn from. Commerce, like the commercial governments based on it since the writing of the oldest written law, the Law of Hammurabi, is a means for making the possible impossible. God's economy of the Truth is its mirror, the art of making the impossible possible. Value in the fiction of earthly commerce is determined by scarcity, the law of supply and demand. The highest value acrues to that which can be used to extract the maximum life energy from others. In the real economy of the infinite, that which is of greatest value is of unlimited supply: life, love, happiness... Grace is always super-abundant, enough to meet the demands of the most severe contingency. The values of the spirit are priceless and do not figure in gross national products. One nation, Bhutan, now has begun to track Gross National Happiness. In the rest of the world still, Gross National Product is used to track damage to the living. The greatest contributor is war, a process which means confusion, and which is always won by demons of fiction: Nations, Corporations and the international Banks for which they provide a different face on each front. In health care, it is cancer care which props up the commercial medicine at $300,000 per case in modern Western culture, what is left of it. Gandi is said to have quipped, when asked what he thought of Western culture, that he thought it would be a good idea... And Gandi certainly had a few things right in this view. He overcame the violence of the still dominant world system of violence of the British Empire by non-violence. A story about Gandi's life on a smaller scale is instructive. When asked to tell a child to stop eating sugar for the sake of his health, Gandi told the woman to "}
