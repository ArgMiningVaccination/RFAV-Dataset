Annual Report 2013-2014LETTER OF ACCOUNTABILITY I am pleased to present the Annual Report for Alberta Health Services for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. The 12 months summarized in this report represent a period of transition in the governance and organizational structures of AHS. The AHS Board was dissolved, replaced by an Official Administrator; and the number of management levels reduced. This resulted in eliminating duplication and creating a clearer line of sight between front-line staff and management. As part of the new governance structure, the Official Administrator is supported by three governance advisory committees: the Audit and Finance advisory committee, the Human Resources advisory committee and the Quality Assurance and Patient Safety advisory committee. Equally important, the Alberta Quality Matrix of Health - with its four areas of need and six dimensions of quality - now guides everything we do. As a result, AHS is more keenly focused on patient needs and better positioned to deliver high-quality, patient-centred care for four million Albertans. To achieve our goals, we are building a senior leadership team poised to guide our organization now and into the future. Vickie Kaminski - who joined AHS as its President and Chief Executive Officer on May 26, 2014 - has demonstrated a values-driven commitment to health care during her career. Her personal belief system is aligned with the goals of our organization. Ms. Kaminski is supported by a leadership team that stepped up in the months leading up to her arrival. I would like to personally thank Brenda Huband and Rick Trimp, who took on roles as interim presidents and CEOs, and enabled AHS to keep moving forward during a time of transition. I'd also like to thank all of our staff, physicians and volunteers for their patience during our search for a permanent CEO and, most of all, for their commitment to health care in Alberta. Finally, I'd like to thank former AHS President and CEO Dr. Chris Eagle for his long-term dedication to improving health care delivery in Alberta. Many of the accomplishments outlined in this Annual Report were initiated and achieved under his steady leadership. This Annual Report was prepared under my direction, in accordance with the Fiscal Management Act, Regional Health Authorities Act and instructions as provided by Alberta Health. All material economic and fiscal implications known as of June 5, 2014, have been considered in preparing this Annual Report. Respectfully submitted on behalf of the Official Administrator of AHS. Dr. John Cowell Official Administrator [Original Signed by]www.albertahealthservices.ca 2 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014WELCOME TO THE 2013-14 ANNUAL REPORT Many Albertans will remember 2013 as the year of the devastating floods that displaced and distressed hundreds of thousands of southern Albertans. When reviewing the accomplishments of AHS in the 2013-14 fiscal year, we need to start with this once-in-a-century natural disaster. Staff, physicians and volunteers responded quickly and nimbly to the needs of southern Albertans as floodwaters put lives at risk and destroyed or damaged homes, buildings and infrastructure. With the help of foundations, as well as community and business partners, AHS established field hospitals and reception centres to ensure displaced Albertans received shelter, food, medical care and emotional support. Emergency Medical Services personnel provided medical care and helped to move Albertans to safety. Public health inspectors ensured home and business owners had the information they needed to get safely back on their feet. In short, when Albertans needed AHS, AHS was there. Through it all, AHS still moved forward with its day-to-day business, which you can read about in this report. More Albertans than ever were vaccinated for seasonal influenza in 2013-14, and additional measles immunization clinics were established in communities where high numbers of confirmed cases were reported. AHS added significant new capacity with the opening of the South Health Campus in Calgary, and making radiation therapy available in Red Deer for the first time with the opening of the new Central Alberta Cancer Centre. You can also read stories that exemplify the caring, compassion, ingenuity and dedication demonstrated every day by the 104,900 men and women who serve Alberta's health system - stories about the six-year-old girl whose life was saved by a revolutionary cardiac procedure; or about a Calgary man who was able to once again spend quality time with his wife of 60 years thanks to new guidelines around administering behaviour-modifying dementia medications. AHS now looks to the future, focused on our ongoing work of building a high-quality, patient-centred health system.

Alberta Health Services has more than 104,900 employees (excluding Covenant Health staff), including approximately 96,700 direct AHS employees and more than 8,200 staff working in AHS wholly-owned subsidiaries such as Carewest, CapitalCare Group and Calgary Laboratory Services, as well as 15,470 volunteers. Of the 8,800 physicians practising in Alberta, more than 7,500 are members of the AHS medical staff (physicians, dentists, podiatrists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons). Students from Alberta's universities and colleges, as well as from universities and colleges outside of Alberta, receive clinical education in AHS facilities. Covenant Health works with AHS and is Canada's largest Catholic health care organization, with almost 15,000 staff, physicians, and volunteers in 12 communities. We offer health care programs and services at more than 450 facilities across the province including hospitals, clinics, continuing care facilities, mental health facilities and community health sites. The province also has an extensive network of community-based services designed to help Albertans maintain or improve their health. AHS is required to prepare and submit an Annual Report to the Minister of Health, in compliance with legislation, reporting how AHS has discharged its legislated responsibilities, and any other responsibility delegated by the Minister. The Annual Report is approved by the AHS Official Administrator and then submitted to the Minister who then tables the report in the Legislative Assembly. All programs and facilities, whether owned and operated by AHS, non-profit organizations or private groups, are operated in compliance with specific sections of program legislation. www.albertahealthservices.ca 4 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014ALBERTA HEALTH SERVICES MAP AHS is organized by five zone geographic areas which are designed to better focus our attention on providing high quality health care to Albertans. Our zones \u2014 South, Calgary, Central, Edmonton and North \u2014 enable local decision-making and engagement with local communities, local staff members, and our patients and clients. 5 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014OUR MISSION AND STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS The Mission of Alberta Health Services is to provide a patient-focused, quality health system that is accessible and sustainable for all Albertans. In collaboration with Alberta Health (AH), AHS identified strategic directions and goals that focus our work over the next three years. To support the AHS 2013-2016 Health Plan and Business Plan, AHS developed actions to achieve the goals outlined in the Health Plan. These strategic directions and goals are supported by priorities and actions which allow us to include them in every decision we make in our day-to-day operations. In addition, we measure how we are doing through performance measures. Strategic Direction - Bringing Appropriate Care to the Community AHS' goal is to build a strong, integrated community and primary health care foundation to deliver appropriate, accessible and seamless care. Strategic Direction - Partnering for Better Health Outcomes AHS' goal is to actively engage Albertans as partners and provide them with the support they need to enhance control over the factors that affect their health and the health of their families. AHS' goal is to advance the adoption of evidence-informed practices in the delivery of quality services across the continuum through partnerships with providers, academic institutions, physicians and others. Strategic Direction - Achieving Health System Sustainability AHS' goal is to continue to build a sustainable, quality health system that is patient-centred, driven by outcomes and informed by evidence.

In May 2013, CIHI released its annual Health Indicators report. Alberta performed among the top two provinces in six of the 20 health system performance indicators for the most recent year of tracking (2010-11 or 2011-12, depending on the indicator). Alberta is top performing (first) in Canada in: 30-Day Heart Attack In-Hospital Mortality 30-Day Stroke In-Hospital Mortality Patients with Repeat Hospitalizations for Mental Illness Alberta ranks second on: 30-Day Readmission Rate for Pregnant Women and New Mothers Following Childbirth Self-Injury Hospitalization 30-Day Readmission for Mental Illness The Hospital Standardized Mortality Ratio (HSMR) is a ratio that indicates how successful hospitals have been in reducing inpatient deaths - leading to improved patient care. In November 2013, CIHI released HSMR data for large acute care hospitals across Canada, including nine Alberta hospitals. In Alberta, HSMR improved from 88 in 2011- 12 to 84 in 2012-13, well below the weighted national average of 100, and steady improvement has been seen over the past four years. Values less than 100 mean fewer than expected deaths in Alberta, a rate of 84 means 850 fewer deaths in hospital than expected each year. In March 2014, CIHI released its Annual Report Wait Times for Priority Procedures in Canada. The report tracks the per cent of procedures performed within national benchmarks. In 2013, Alberta ranks second in: Per cent of hip fracture repairs performed within the 48-hour benchmark Per cent of radiation therapy performed within the four-week benchmark AHS (including Covenant Health) is spending more on patient care and less on administration than any other province in Canada. AHS (including Covenant Health) is spending more on patient care and less on administration than any other province in Canada. As calculated by CIHI in the May 2014 CIHI Financial Indicators report, for the 2012-13 fiscal year, Alberta was tied with British Columbia for lowest percentage of expenses spent on administration at 3.6 per cent.9 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014BED NUMBERS While the following chart illustrates that overall capacity has increased by almost one per cent, it is apparent that growth is not keeping pace with the population growth of three per cent. This is challenging throughout the system. Several long-term care beds were lost this year due to flooding and contract issues, but more than 500 supportive living beds were opened. A key objective in health care is to shift services from acute care hospitals and facility living to the community, bringing care closer to home for patients. Number of Beds/Spaces as of: March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Difference % Change Primary Care / Population Health Acute Care 8,226 8,311 85 1.0% Sub-acute in Auxiliary Hospital 511 TOTAL ACUTE & SUB-ACUTE CARE 8,737 Supportive Living Level 4 4,576 4,889 313 6.8% Supportive Living Level 4 - 335 1.5% Community Palliative and Hospice (outside a hospital) 202 202 0 0.0% TOTAL CONTINUING CARE 22,734 23,069 335 1.5% Addiction and Mental Health Psychiatric (standalone facilities) 987 967 -20 -2.0% Addiction Treatment 855 855 0 0.0% Community Mental Health 582 579 -3 -0.5% TOTAL ADDICTION & MENTAL HEALTH 2,424 TOTAL 33,895 34,288 393 1.2% Notes: The baseline bed numbers for March 31, 2013 have been revised due to previous incorrectly reported beds: acute care by four beds; continuing care by one bed; standalone psychiatric by nine beds; addiction by 45 beds and community mental health by 43 beds. The majority of these corrections are due to standardized provincial definitions as well as improved reporting and tracking of beds on a regular basis. www.albertahealthservices.ca 10 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014GOVERNANCE In June 2013, the Minister of Health dismissed the members of the AHS Board and appointed an Official Administrator in place of the AHS Board. In accordance with Section 11 of the Regional Health Authorities Act, the Official Administrator has the responsibility for the governance of AHS, working in partnership with Alberta Health to ensure all Albertans have access to high-quality health services across the province. The Official Administrator is accountable to the Minister of Health. In September 2013, Dr. John Cowell was appointed Official Administrator of AHS. To support the role of the Official Administrator, the governance advisory committees specified below have been established to aid in governing AHS and overseeing the managment of AHS' business and affairs. The purpose and scope of each committee is in accordance with good governance practices and is consistent with the governing legislation of AHS. Audit and Finance Advisory Committee (AFAC) Human Resources Advisory Committee (HRAC) Quality Assurance and Patient Safety Advisory Committee (QAPSAC) Below is a list of the current advisory committee members. The Official Administrator is a member of each advisory committee and the Chief Executive Officer is an ex officio member of each advisory committee. The Official Administrator has a duty to the public as the governor of the organization to ensure that the community understands and trusts the organization and has ample opportunity to provide meaningful input into the way AHS functions and performs. The Official Administrator, along with the CEO, is accountable to the government for the organization's overall performance. Accreditation is a requirement for AHS based on a three-year rotating accreditation schedule. AHS governance is one of the standards being accredited in 2014.AHS Advisory Committee Member Committee Membership Barbara Burton HRAC Dr. Tom Feasby QAPSAC Martin Harvey Winkel QAPSAC11 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014COUNCILS Everything we do at Alberta Health Services is about improving the health of Albertans. Community input and engagement furthers our ability to provide quality, patient-focused health care that is accessible and sustainable. AHS is committed to engaging the public in a respectful, open and accountable manner to support the strategic direction of the organization. Community input and feedback allows us to better address the health needs of communities. AHS has established several councils to support engagement. Health Advisory Councils The Health Advisory Councils (HACs) support AHS in achieving its strategies by engaging members of the public in communities throughout Alberta, and providing advice and feedback from a local perspective on what is working well in the health care system and where there are areas in need of improvement. Each of the 12 HACs was established in 2009-10. Every HAC represents a different geographical area within the province. The term of office for all HAC Chairs was April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. Health Advisory Councils Geographical Area HAC Chair 1. True North Health Advisory Council La Crete, High Level & Area Michael Osborn 2.

Oldman River Health Advisory Council Lethbridge & Area Dr. Barbara Laceywww.albertahealthservices.ca 12 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014 AHS has worked with the 12 HACs and two Provincial Advisory Councils (Provincial Advisory Council on Cancer and Provincial Advisory Council on Addiction & Mental Health) to establish a Council of Chairs. The Council provides advice and feedback to the Official Administrator, helping to bring the voice of Albertans to decision-making at a provincial level at AHS. Provincial Advisory Council on Cancer The Provincial Advisory Council on Cancer acts as an advisory body to AHS and provides evidence-based suggestions on cancer care for Albertans. The Council is composed of 15 volunteers, including members who are experts in their cancer-related field as well as public members who have been touched by cancer, diagnosed with cancer or are cancer survivors. Provincial Advisory Council on Addiction & Mental Health The Provincial Advisory Council on Addiction & Mental Health (AMH) acts as an advisory body to AHS to enhance the delivery of addiction and mental health services. The Council is composed of volunteer members (three members per AHS zone). There may be AHS service providers or members of the public who have been touched by addiction and/or mental health, either as a patient, or through the experience of a family member, close associate or are AMH service providers. 13 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Patient and Family Advisory Council The Patient and Family Advisory Group works with the vision that patients and families are partners with their health care providers. This means that patients and families need to be engaged in all aspects of health care. The Patient and Family Advisory Group works to help identify areas for improvement in the delivery of patient-and family-centred care. The group does this by partnering with senior leaders to review policy and strategies and to share insights from a patient's perspective for the planning and delivery of health care services. Alberta Clinician Council The Alberta Clinician Council is a forum made up of approximately 40 front-line clinicians from a variety of disciplines and zones across the province. Applying their collective knowledge, experience and expertise, the council advises senior leadership on issues and opportunities to improve quality, access and patient safety across the province. The Alberta Clinician Council is a multidisciplinary forum that addresses organization-wide issues of quality and patient safety. It has direct access to the Alberta Health Services leadership team and advises on significant strategic clinical issues and organizational priorities. As such, the council is accountable to both the AHS Chief Executive Officer and front-line clinicians. Wisdom Council The Wisdom Council also provides guidance and recommendations to ensure AHS develops and implements culturally appropriate and innovative health service delivery for Aboriginal Peoples. The Wisdom Council is responsible for reviewing AHS provincewide priorities and strategies to improve the health and wellness for First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit within Alberta. The Wisdom Council is comprised of 19 aboriginal volunteers ranging from traditional knowledge holders (ceremonial leaders) to contemporary trained physicians, each equally important when discussing challenges to aboriginal health and well-being. Other members include a former chief, nursing professionals, a professor, health consultants and a number of elders. This diverse composition has served council members well over the last two years as they advocate for improving aboriginal health and wellness, recognizing this important feedback is used to support the overall strategic direction of AHS and more specifically the Aboriginal Health Program. www.albertahealthservices.ca 14 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-20142013-14 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AHS is responsible for delivering health services to the four million people living in Alberta. AHS is Canada's first and largest provincewide, fully-integrated health system. The creation of AHS supports consistent access to health services and standards, and better coordination of services across the province. In 2008, the AHS Board became the common governance board responsible for the delivery of health services previously provided by nine regional health authorities, the Alberta Cancer Board, Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC) and Alberta Mental Health Board. The provision of Emergency Medical Services (Ground Ambulance Service) has also transitioned from former municipal responsibility, to become a part of this provincial health care service. In October 2013, Dr. Chris Eagle stepped down as the President and Chief Executive Officer of AHS, and Duncan Campbell was appointed Acting President and CEO. Mr. Campbell had been serving as the Vice President, Administration and Chief Financial Officer. In November 2013, Brenda Huband was appointed Interim President and Chief Executive Officer for Zone and Health Operations and Rick Trimp was appointed Interim President and Chief Executive Officer for Population Health and Province-Wide Services. They are accountable for the organization's day- to-day operations and report directly to the Official Administrator. In January 2014, our organizational structure was arranged under the following AHS Executive Leadership Team, reporting directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer. In March 2014, AHS announced the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Vickie Kaminski, who started on May 26, 2014.

We have highlighted stories from the following areas within AHS: The Provincial Highlights section of this report helps to demonstrate how AHS is working together as one organization to deliver high-quality health care across this province. As a provincial organization, AHS is able to respond to crises and provide more consistent support throughout the province. We saw this in the devastating flooding in the south, a wildfire in the north and the coordinated team effort to protect thousands from influenza. Staff and physicians have been able to mobilize to respond to these crises effectively and quickly, drawing on expertise and resources from across the organization AHS is organized into five geographic zones \u2014 South, Calgary, Central, Edmonton and North \u2014 so that communities are more directly connected to their local health systems and decisions can be made closer to where care is provided. In this report, we have shared some of the stories of the fantastic work that is happening in each of these areas of Alberta - health care that is close to home and making a difference in the lives of Albertans. AHS recognizes Research and Innovation as a critical strategic priority. The evidence that research provides leads to more informed decision-making in both policy and practice and ultimately leads to better health outcomes for Albertans. This is vital to advance the health care system and to ensure the effective use of funds. AHS is working to coordinate tremendous research talent across the province and to use that research to become a health services organization which uses research to provide care that is evidence-informed and patient-focused. Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs) are creating improvements within focused areas of health care. To get the most out of our health care system, AHS has developed networks of people who are passionate and knowledgeable about specific areas of health, challenging them to find new and innovative ways of delivering care that will provide better quality, better outcomes and better value for every Albertan. Great work is happening in our SCNs and we've included some examples of how this work is improving the quality of health care in our province. Every day in health care, we are privileged to witness and take part in amazing stories like these \u2014stories that embody a spirit of innovation, collaboration and caring for the community that benefit Albertans. They demonstrate how we are working to delivery high-quality health care across this province, putting patients and families at the forefront of everything we do. 17 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014 Floods devastate southern Alberta Natural disaster sees Alberta Health Services medical staff, leadership and volunteers embrace the challenge of providing uninterrupted care with enthusiasm, creativity and resolve. The resilience of southern Albertans shines through as AHS partners with civic, military and government emergency agencies to set up evacuation and urgent care centres \u2014 and a field hospital \u2014 in under four hours. When rivers overflowed and floods wreaked havoc in Calgary, High River, Canmore, Medicine Hat and neighboring communities last June, the swift and comprehensive response from AHS demonstrated how amazing, resilient, and generous Albertans can be in the face of disaster. It meant not only caring for the tens of thousands of people evacuated from their homes, but ensuring all Albertans continued to have access to the health services they needed. When rising waters threated to close bridges and cut off 20,000 people from medical care in Medicine Hat, AHS opened a field hospital there within four hours. At the field hospital, city staff, volunteers and businesses supported AHS without hesitation. Across southern Alberta, AHS opened and staffed urgent care clinics, and provided teams including health inspectors, and mental health and public health professionals to help local residents and business owners cope when they got their first closeup look at the damage flood waters left behind.

Continuing care access improves Lethbridge-area seniors with dementia now have additional supports with the opening of supportive living dementia beds. To the north, new facilities increased supportive living access in Peace River and Grimshaw for seniors. Within the Calgary and Central Zones, supportive living beds opened in areas such as Bashaw, Calgary, Lacombe, Red Deer, Strathmore and Stettler. In 2012-13, Edmonton Zone opened more than 225 continuing care spaces, continuing to bring care closer to home. Paramedics boost care in lodges Specially trained paramedics are treating Calgary and Lethbridge residents in local supportive living facilities and community lodges as part of a new AHS- Emergency Medical Services program that delivers additional primary health care. The Community Paramedic Program provides additional support to the multidisciplinary health care teams based in supportive living facilities and community lodges.Workplace Wellness Program on job AHS helps employers tailor plans to forge a healthier workforce through the new Workplace Wellness Program. So far, the AHS Mental Health Promotion team has engaged eight sites across the province, and Alberta Environment Water and Sustainable Resource Development (GOA), Calgary Police Service, Husky Energy and Canadian Tire in Grande Prairie. Health Link talks diet, medication Newly-added services at call centres in Edmonton and Calgary mean that Albertans can now call Health Link Alberta to talk to medication specialists and registered dietitians about their nutrition and prescription concerns. Both services offer better access to information and advice that will improve the health of Albertans.Police, fire, EMS, military \u2014 both British and Canadian \u2014 plus physicians, nurses, support staff within the health sector including administration, emergency disaster management, security, and many others were crucial to all the efforts. In Lethbridge, AHS staff joined even more volunteers, the City of Lethbridge, the University of Lethbridge and the Red Cross \u2014 among many others \u2014 to prepare and provide care for more than 200 evacuees relocated there from hardest-hit High River. On their days off, teams of AHS staff donned plastic suits and rubber boots to help affected residents haul water- damaged furniture and shovel muck from their homes.At the height of the southern Alberta flood disaster, road closures made the relocation of patients and continuing care residents challenging, and the delivery of medications to AHS facilities especially difficult. Whether helping the many or the one \u2014 such as the out-of-country patient visiting Banff who urgently needed more anti-rejection medication after a transplant \u2014 AHS got the job done. \"I shouldn't have been surprised by the teamwork and the dedication of our staff because I've seen it before in other crises,\" says Dr. Vanessa Maclean, South Zone Medical Director. \"But I was once again blown away by how everyone came together to make this happen.\" continued on next page Canadian Tire staff member Tracy Davis, and general manager Ron Regnier , stand in Canadian Tire' s renovated lunch room in Grande Prairie.

Progress was made towards immunizing more high-risk groups such as children, seniors, expectant mothers and health care workers. The 2013-14 Influenza Immunization Program was the most successful in Alberta's history, with more Albertans receiving vaccine this season than in any previous regular influenza season. Together with more than 1,780 community partners, AHS administered 1,157,150 doses of influenza vaccine; more than 27 per cent of Albertans were immunized this year compared to 23 per cent last year. Increased partnerships between public health and immunization providers in the community improved access for the general public and contributed to influenza vaccine uptake this season. Progress was also made towards improving immunization coverage rates for higher-risk groups. 36 per cent of children six to 23 months of age were immunized this season, compared to 30 per cent last season; 24 per cent of children two years to five years of age were immunized this season, compared to 18 per cent last season. 64 per cent of seniors were immunized this season, compared to 60 per cent last season. 16 per cent of pregnant women were immunized this season, compared to 13 per cent last season. Just as uptake of influenza vaccine increased this season over last, so too did the avenues through which Albertans were provided, and accessed, influenza information. A youngster receives a nasal spray vaccine for her annual influenza vaccination. The 2013-14 AHS campaign was the most successful in Alberta' s history.

Lauren Miner, 13, received an auto islet cell transplant, pioneered by Edmonton's Clinical Islet Cell Transplant Program.New colorectal test a lifesaver Alberta has a new colorectal cancer screening test that could save hundreds of lives by detecting the potentially deadly disease earlier. Every year, about 1,900 Albertans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and about 600 die of the disease. Nearly one million Albertans may be eligible to take the FIT, a home stool test that is now the primary screening test for average-risk Albertans between the ages of 50 to 74.Not only did AHS expand its use of TV and online advertising this season, it increased its use of social media (e.g., Twitter), providing Albertans with daily updates. The revamped AHS influenza website also provided Albertans with frequently updated information on the provincial response. The web activity was well received by Albertans. From October 1st to April 30th, the AHS influenza webpage received more than 350,000 visits: 153 per cent more visits than in the 2012-13 season. The key message this year to all AHS health care workers was: No patient should get influenza from our staff while in our care . AHS' target for staff influenza immunization was 50 per cent. More than 54 per cent of AHS health care workers reported being immunized this season, compared to 41 per cent last season; 72 per cent of long-term care staff were immunized this season, compared to 67 per cent last season. As planning for the 2014-15 influenza season commences, AHS continues to build on the successes and learnings of the 2013-14 program, focusing on protecting the health of all Albertans. Dr .

Measures that had been implemented ahead of the outbreak enabled Alberta Health Services staff to mobilize quickly to contain the contagious virus. \"It highlights how important our work in emergency preparedness is in our day-to-day business,\" says Dr. Vivien Suttorp, Medical Officer of Health, South Zone. \"The planning phase was integral to the success of rapid containment.\" Key strategies during the planning phase included immunization of AHS health care workers and health care providers in community physician offices, development of negative pressure rooms at Chinook Regional Hospital, and the development of a measles assessment centre operational plan. With confirmation of the first measles case, an outbreak was declared and containment measures implemented, including: Mass immunization clinics for children and health care workers. A dedicated measles hotline. The creation of Mobile Measles Assessment Teams. The opening of a portable Measles Assessment and Treatment Centre at Chinook Regional Hospital, in order to minimize possible exposures at physicians' offices and emergency departments. The strategies developed for this outbreak have recently been implemented - rapidly and effectively - in the Calgary, Central and Edmonton zones, following declaration of measles outbreaks in these three zones on April 29, 2014. A portable isolation tent outside Chinook Regional Hospital helped keep patients with suspected measles away from emergency departments and doctors' offices.SOUTH ZONE HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2013-14 >>www.albertahealthservices.ca 22 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014New procedure fixes bones Southern Albertans with severe skeletal problems, including bowed legs and limbs of different lengths, are now able to have these conditions fixed at Chinook Regional Hospital. Patients undergo orthopedic surgery to cut through the bone that needs fixing and a circular, metal frame is placed around the limb. Called the Taylor Spatial Frame, the device can be adjusted daily to gradually lengthen or straighten bones. Art empowers patients Dozens of southern Alberta residents are getting a reprieve from the stress of chronic illness and injury through an AHS program. Expressive Arts is a 10-week program for individuals recovering from a stroke, living with a brain injury or chronic illness, or struggling with social isolation. Participants, who must be referred by a physician or other health care professional, explore art using a variety of materials. Go-kart simulates impaired driving Southern Albertans are getting an opportunity to better understand the dangers of impaired and distracted driving with a specialized go-kart that's touring communities. The battery-powered vehicle simulates what happens when people drive while impaired by alcohol or drugs, or drive when distracted by texting or talking on a cellphone. It's the latest of several programs developed by AHS and the Southeastern Alberta Traffic Safety Coalition. Cycling promotes mental well-being Bicycles built for two are lifting the spirits of long-term care residents in the South Zone. Ten wheelchair bikes \u2014 or \"duet bikes\" \u2014 are being used at several care centres in the region.

A six-year-old girl has received a heart transplant 10 months after becoming the youngest patient in the world to have a revolutionary heart pump surgically implanted inside her chest at the Stollery Children's Hospital in Edmonton. In September 2012, then five-year-old Muskaan Grewal received a HeartWare pump, a ventricular assist device (VAD) which took over the pumping function of her heart. The VAD, roughly the size of a golf ball, was designed for adults, but has been used in a small number of pediatric cases around the globe. Inside the chest, the pump was connected directly to the patient's heart and powered by a small controller, outside the body, which Muskaan carried over her shoulders in a backpack. \"Unlike other artificial heart machines which require patients to stay in hospital, this device did allow Muskaan and her family to return home until a heart became available for transplant,\" says Dr. Holger Buchholz, Director, Pediatric Artificial Heart Program, Stollery Children's Hospital. After 10 months with the pump, Muskaan developed an infection, which required hospitalization. During her stay at the Stollery, a heart became available and she received a heart transplant in July 2013. The Pediatric VAD Program at the Stollery is one of the largest such pediatric programs in North America.Muskaan Grewal beams after her heart transplant with, from left: Dr .

Family medicine residents from the University of Alberta's Rural Alberta North (RAN) program at the QEII Hospital in Grande Prairie are thinking faster on their feet thanks to a high-tech patient simulator and a new partnership with the mobile educators of STARS Air Ambulance. \"Simulation training helps rural family medicine residents maintain and improve their abilities to deal with acute life-threatening situations,\" says Dr. Valentine Duta, a family physician and co-director of the RAN program. \"Because of this training, our residents are better prepared for working in rural and remote locations, where they don't have the same backup found in large hospitals.\"The mannequin breathes, has heart and lung sounds, vital signs, reactive eyes, an airway and more. Its real- life resemblance allows residents to apply their skills in more realistic emergency situations staged monthly at the STARS Air Ambulance headquarters in Grande Prairie. Manpreet Uppal, a flight paramedic and mobile education leader with STARS, creates lifelike emergency scenarios. He and his co-worker Chris Larose control the patient's symptoms and reactions from a control room hidden behind a one-way mirror. \"We are very lucky to be able to experience this type of training,\" says Ali Adbalvand, a second-year medical resident with RAN.Family medicine residents, including Ali Adbalvand, left, work to save a 'patient' from a drug overdose while, in a control room behind a one-way mirror , STARS Mobile Education Leaders Chris Larose and Manpreet Uppal control the lifelike mannequin.

Public health nurse Caitlin Rathburn gets set to immunize Jason Arlint' s son Mitchell.Being on hand at kindergarten registration to book children for their immunizations is just one of the ideas Grande Prairie Public Health staff adopted to give quicker and easier access to immunization services. Jason Arlint says he's glad it only took one stop to register his son Mitchell for both school and his AHS immunization. \"Anything that saves time when you have young children is a good thing,\" says Arlint. It's all part of the Alberta Access, Improvement, Measures (AIM) project \u2014 an initiative to improve quality by supporting health-care teams to become more efficient. It focuses on improving access through quicker appointments and less waiting at appointments.Prior to the start of the AIM project in June 2012, people were waiting upwards of 28 days to get an immunization appointment.

Moms-to-be in both Calgary and Edmonton have been helping researchers determine whether giving pregnant women the pertussis vaccine will protect their newborns for the first few months of life. Babies are particularly vulnerable to the potentially fatal respiratory infection \u2014 more commonly known as whooping cough \u2014 until at least partial immunity develops following immunization at two months of age. \"I know that pertussis is something the really little ones can get and so I thought it was worth helping out with this,\" says Hurl. Whooping cough starts as a mild cold but rapidly progresses to a severe cough that can include a gasping intake of breath. Very young children may develop significant distress and require hospitalization. Recovery can take months. \"Most people think of whooping cough as a disease of the past but we still have many cases of pertussis in Canada each year,\" says Dr. Wendy Vaudry, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Stollery Children's Hospital. Dr. Otto Vanderkooi, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Alberta Children's Hospital, says the study could result in another tool for prevention. \"Depending on the findings, it could be an effective strategy to eliminate or lessen the severity of the illness in the youngest and most vulnerable age group.\"Lawna Hurl and her son Deacon took part in a pertussis vaccine study, led at the Alberta Children' s Hospital in Calgary by Dr .

The study examines the effectiveness of using Nintendo Wii - a virtual reality gaming system - in rehabilitating stroke patients who have limited mobility. The study involves 160 stroke patients across Canada, including about 20 at two sites in Calgary. Dangers of herbal shisha Researchers with Alberta Health Services and the University of Alberta found that samples of some herbal shisha products sold in Alberta contain similar levels of toxic trace metals and cancer-causing chemicals found in cigarette tobacco. The Government of Alberta referenced the research study, which was funded by AHS and Health Canada, when it announced in November its support for a bill calling for a ban on flavoured tobacco products, such as herbal shisha. Radioactive seeds Oncologists at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary are now performing an innovative breast cancer treatment that uses implanted radioactive seeds, each the size of a grain of rice, to eradicate remaining cancer cells weeks after the removal of a tumour. It's a first in Alberta where about 20 low-risk patients will be part of a national study on a one-day procedure, called breast brachytherapy, which could provide another option for treatment. New methods for treating clubfoot Parents of babies born with the deformity of the foot and ankle known as clubfoot can now access a new clinic at the Stollery Children's Hospital in Edmonton. The new Clubfoot Clinic offers a rehabilitation program that corrects the condition without major surgery, and reduces the possibility of relapse. Clubfoot affects the muscles, ligaments, bones and joints of the developing foot and ankle, causing one or both feet to curl in and down. Calgary cardiologist and researcher Dr . Derek Exner places an implantable cardioverter defibrillator on the chest of Gordon Skidmore, who had a similar device implanted following a heart attack in 2011.Lethbridge resident Gordon Skidmore woke up one October night in 2011 with the feeling something was sitting on his chest. He was having a heart attack. Living in Calgary at the time, he wound up in the intensive care unit at Foothills Medical Centre and subsequently had bypass surgery. Today, Skidmore is taking part in research aimed at saving the lives of more cardiac patients. As part of the study, he has an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD, which is a small device implanted under the skin that monitors heart rhythm and automatically corrects heart rhythm abnormalities. \"Our present approach to prescribing ICD therapy identifies only one in four people at risk,\" says cardiologist Dr. Derek Exner, principal investigator of the study. \"The goal of this research is to better identify those at risk in order to save more lives.\"Researchers are recruiting participants from Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, the Royal Alexandra Hospital and the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute in Edmonton, and the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge.Refining the use of heart technology43 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014 Finding alternatives to antipsychotic medications Marshall and Evelyn Bye have made the most of their 60 years of marriage, enjoying dancing, travelling the world and sharing more than a few laughs. But in the year before her death in May 2014, 93-year- old Evelyn began to deteriorate. The dementia she had struggled with for the past decade worsened and she spent most of her days sleeping. At times she could barely recognize Marshall. When he learned about a new approach taken by Alberta Health Services (AHS) to better manage the anxiety and behavioral challenges of dementia by reducing the use of antipsychotic medications, he was quick to sign up Evelyn. \"I have always had faith in the staff and felt that we had little to lose and lots to gain,\" says Marshall. \"Her eyes sparkled sometimes, which was not the case eight to 10 months before.\"Led by the Seniors Health Strategic Clinical Network (SCN) and the Addiction and Mental Health SCN, 11 long-term care sites across the province are helping to research, review and implement new guidelines around the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications. The project is looking at alternative treatments, such as music, exercise and art. It ensures residents, families or other decision-makers, physicians, and staff work together to investigate and trial innovative approaches. Preliminary data is positive, showing more than 35 per cent of those residents are no longer using an antipsychotic medication. On completion, the SCNs will review findings and implement new approaches across the province.Marshall Bye says the sparkle came back in his wife Evelyn' s eyes, thanks to an innovative project led by Seniors Health and Addiction and Mental Health Strategic Clinical Networks.STRATEGIC CLINICAL NETWORKS HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2013-14 >>www.albertahealthservices.ca 44 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014New procedure fixes bones For Joan Poplawski, recovering from surgery last spring was much smoother than she expected, thanks to a new Strategic Clinical Network (SCN) initiative. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) project standardizes care before, during and after surgery, in an effort to get patients back on their feet sooner while shortening hospital stays and reducing complications. Drawing from best practices around the world, the project improves protocols related to nutrition, mobility after surgery, and anesthetics and pain control. Poplawski was one of the first patients to benefit from the protocols when she had colorectal surgery at the Grey Nuns Community Hospital in Edmonton. \"Everything went very, very smoothly,\" says Poplawski. \"The pre-op education by both the surgeon and nurse was unbelievably helpful.\" ERAS reduces complications by up to 50 per cent and decreases hospital stays by 30 per cent. ERAS is led by the Obesity, Diabetes and Nutrition SCN and supported by the Surgery SCN. AHS is one of the first organizations in Canada to introduce ERAS protocols.>> Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs) are engines of innovation, bringing together people who are passionate and knowledgeable about specific areas of health to find new and creative ways of delivering evidence-based care. By the end of 2013-14, there were 10 SCNs, made up of patients and families, physicians, clinicians, community partners, researchers and staff: Addiction and Mental Health Bone and Joint Health Cancer Cardiovascular Health and Stroke Critical Care Over the last year, the SCNs have continued working on improving the health care system and are currently focused on nine projects, including: Access for referral & triage eReferral Adult coding access target for surgery Appropriate use of antipsychotics in long-term care Enhanced recovery after surgery Fragility and stability program Insulin pump therapy Safe surgery checklist Stroke action plan Vascular risk reduction In addition to those projects, nine research grants were awarded in early 2014 by the newly created Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Health System (PRIHS) fund, which was created by AHS and Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions. Worth a total of $7.5 million, the three-year projects include: Researching strain on intensive care units Creating a seniors surgery unit Improving care for people suffering back pain Developing a rectal cancer school for clinicians Improving prevention, outcomes and access to care for those with heart rhythm disorders Standardizing the use of CT scans in emergency departments Expanding the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program Improving specialized hospital care for obese patients Creating a centralized way of caring for arthritis patients Improving care for critically ill patients in intensive care SCNs - driving innovation to improve health care Emergency Obesity, Diabetes and Nutrition Respiratory Seniors' Health Surgery45 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-20142013-14 HEALTH ACTION PLAN RESULTS Alberta Health Services is working to continually improve the quality of care we provide to Albertans. In all areas of the province, significant progress is being made toward building a patient-focused, quality health system that is accessible and sustainable for all Albertans. Over the course of the past year, we have undertaken many activities and monitored our progress every step of the way. We've come a long way since the former health regions were amalgamated into AHS, and we will keep working to improve health services in this province, while we continue to update you on our progress. The following summarizes the key actions which were identified in the AHS 2013-14 Action Plan: Supplement to Health Plan and Business Plan 2013-2016 . These actions are provincial in nature, represent innovation and/or will significantly impact how services are delivered. The actions align with the three strategic directions outlined earlier in this report as follows: 1. Bringing Appropriate Care to the Community a. Primary and Community Care b. Health Link c. Emergency Medical Services d. Continuing Care e. Population and Public Health 2. Partnering for Better Health Outcomes a. Mental Health b. Cancer c. Patient Flow and Access d. Strategic Clinical Networks e. Research and Innovation 3. Achieving Health System Sustainability a. Workforce b. Financial c. Information Technology d. Quality Improvementwww.albertahealthservices.ca 46 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PERFORMANCE MEASURES In collaboration with Alberta Health, Alberta Health Services established 16 performance measures in January 2014 to help us continue to build and strengthen our health care system. We will continue to monitor other measures to help support the health and well-being of all Albertans and the support of our front-line health care providers. We've streamlined performance measures to ensure they represent the broad spectrum of health care, including targets for community-based care and patient outcomes. We've added measures that align with national standards where possible, so Albertans can easily compare the performance of our health system with other health systems across Canada. Having measures aligned with national and Western Canadian benchmarks improves the transparency of our reporting by putting our accomplishments into a broader context. The Alberta Quality Matrix for Health provides a way of organizing information and thinking around the complexity of the health system. The matrix has two components: 1. Dimensions of quality, which focus on aspects of the patient/client experience 2. Areas of need, which divides the range of services offered by the health system into four distinct, but related, categories. i. Being Healthy: Achieving health and preventing occurrence of injuries, illness, chronic conditions and resulting disabilities. ii. Getting Better: Care related to acute illness or injury. iii. Living with Illness or Disability: Care and support related to chronic or recurrent illness or disability. iv. End of Life: Care and support that aims to relieve suffering and improve quality of living with or dying from advanced illness or bereavement. The Quality Matrix allows the public, patients, providers, and organizations to see how levels of quality and areas of need might intersect. It has been used in numerous ways, including policy development, strategic planning, and as a way to educate the public about quality in healthcare. Our performance measures are organized by the Alberta Quality Matrix for Health, which describes six dimensions of quality. Targets have been created for the new 16 performance measures for 2014-15 and 2015-16; since the new measures were released near the end of 2013-14, targets were not established for 2013-14. The performance targets for 2014- 15 and 2015-16 are challenging but achievable. At present, we are on track to achieve the targets set for 2014-15. These performance targets will help us measure our progress and improve the health system.Acceptability Health services are respectful and responsive to user needs, preferences and expectations. Accessibility Health services are obtained in the most suitable setting in a reasonable time and distance. Appropriateness Health services are relevant to user needs and are based on accepted or evidence-based practice. Effectiveness Health services are provided based on scientific knowledge to achieve desired outcomes. Efficiency Resources are optimally used in achieving desired outcomes. Safety Mitigate risks to avoid unintended or harmful results.47 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PERFORMANCE MEASURES (continued) The following chart demonstrates trending of Alberta Health Services' system performance measures.

AHS is: Working with Alberta Health (AH) to increase the number of Family Care Clinics and enhance the services provided by primary care networks. Redesigning how we deliver care more appropriately to specific complex, high-needs populations. Developing an integrated primary health care service model, which will focus on linking many existing services to provide support to identified population groups. Developing collaborative team care models for populations with similar needs. Those groups will include the frail elderly, the vulnerable, complex high-needs children and youth, and those at the end of life. With an aging population and the prevalence of chronic disease on the rise, it is imperative that we offer Albertans access to the best primary care system, and in turn, the best opportunity to maintain good health and access to the services they need, when they need them. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Complex High Needs Population: Develop innovative community- based service model(s) to address complex, high needs individuals/ populations. Edmonton Zone currently has five projects underway to address the health of complex high needs populations to improve their care, with a focus on: the inner-city team, addictions and reproductive health, Boyle McAuley Home Care team, high risk pre/ post-natal care, and EMS community-level services. The learning and approach used in Edmonton will be leveraged to support developmental work in other zones. Calgary Zone has identified users of emergency department and inpatient services at the Peter Lougheed Centre that might benefit from integrated services at the Calgary East Family Care Clinic. North Zone is working in Grande Prairie to assess utilization of complex, high needs populations with mental health issues. Family Care Clinics (FCC): Further develop AHS FCCs and work with AH to increase the number of FCCs within the province. AHS continues to work with AH to increase the number of Family Care Clinics (FCCs) within the province. FCC's provide comprehensive primary health care services and connections to social/community services that align with the health needs of those areas. 24 communities have been identified where there is a need for better access to primary health care. Three pilot projects were implemented in 2012 in Calgary, Edmonton and Slave Lake. Albertans and community groups have been engaged to support the development of FCCs in targeted areas. Business planning process is currently underway, but Alberta Health has extended the timeframe for FCC setup, business planning, and grant agreement development to allow FCC proponents time to undertake all the required work. Work is also underway with the Complex High Needs Patients initiative to ensure needs for those populations within communities can be met through the development of new service models such as FCCs. Primary Care Networks (PCN): Work with AH to enhance the work of PCNs through further development of common standards and expansion of the range of services where needed. The Primary Care Alliance (PCA) of the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) completed a draft blueprint for an enhanced Primary Care Network Program in Alberta (PCN Evolution). The blueprint incorporates input from PCA, AMA, Alberta Health, AHS and Alberta College of Family Physicians. The Primary Health Care Evaluation Expert Advisory Group, led by AH, released the evaluation framework in November 2013 for the primary health care system. The evaluation framework focused on measures that lead to improved access, greater attachment, higher quality patient-centred care, better health outcomes and patient experiences, healthier choices, efficiency and accountability. Thirteen PCNs are engaged in the Measurement Capacity Initiative, to build capacity for collaborative development of common quality and outcome measures in primary care. Work continues with the Complex High Needs Patients initiative to define complex high needs population to ensure needs for those populations within communities are met through integration between AHS and PCNs. Currently, there are a total of 42 primary care networks: South Zone - 2; Calgary Zone - 7; Central Zone - 12; Edmonton Zone - 9; North Zone - 12.www.albertahealthservices.ca 50 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Community Service Delivery Alignment: Develop transformation plans to support the implementation of integrated community and primary care services, enhancing primary care, chronic disease management and other community based options. Worked with zones and communities to assess service needs and develop plans to address those needs, taking into account services that are available locally and within the surrounding area. Developed Rural Service Access Guidelines including educational presentations; map guidebooks and interactive maps were posted on the AHS internal website. Established the Rural Surgical & Obstetrical Guideline Advisory Committee with key zone and strategic partner membership. Final guideline documentation is currently in development. Initiated other provincial chronic disease management activities including: Better Choices Better Health Online (self-management) License Agreement between AHS and the National Council on Aging. Working with Strategic Clinical Networks on clinical decision support tools to support standards in the supervised exercise program. Completed emotional eating patient education resource facilitator training in the South Zone. Formed provincial MEND (Mind, Exercise, Nutrition... Do-it!) working group with representation from all zones. Completed diversity workshop facilitator training in the Edmonton Zone. In Summary: Alberta Health Services continues to work on improving the health and wellness of Albertans by improving access to and the quality of primary health care services. We are: Strengthening integration and collaboration across community-based services and primary health care providers by developing appropriate service delivery models to address the specific health needs of Albertans. Delivering innovative service delivery models to address the complex, high needs populations. MyHealthAlberta and HEALTHLink Alberta Significant work is underway to enhance access for all Albertans to health information and advice through MyHealthAlberta and Health Link Alberta. The staff, physicians and volunteers of AHS are also key partners in health and their voices will help us build a system that makes best use of their talents and improves the quality, outcomes and value of our health system. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Personal Health Portal (PHP): Work with Alberta Health to support the development of a personal health record for Albertans that can contain both self- entered and clinical reports from the provincial electronic health record, Alberta Netcare. The Personal Health Portal program is a collaborative provincial health system initiative that provides online personalized health information and services to Albertans through the MyHealth.Alberta.ca (MHA) portal. On-line visits to the MyHealth.Alberta.ca website increased significantly over the year, reaching just under 1 million visits in 2013-14. In 2013-14, the portal added a video library and search, a \"Health and Alberta\" library, learning modules with quiz tools, patient care information handouts on more than 3,000 different topics, Medication Safety pages, as well as consumer appropriate drug monographs for all prescribed, over the counter and herbal drugs available in Canada. The portal also provided emerging content during the Southern Alberta floods and Alberta Influenza. The Organ Tissue Donor Registry has been developed, and is made available through MHA. The registry allows Albertans to register their intent to become and organ and tissue donor. MHA continues to form new partnerships with other AHS departments for subject matter and expert review of clinical content. Recent partnerships include the Pelvic Floor Clinic, Medication Reconciliation, Goals of Care, Physiotherapy, Chronic Kidney Disease, Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, Acute Pain Service and Fall Prevention.51 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Health Link Alberta (HLA) Health Link Alberta (HLA) has added two new services through partnerships with the Poison & Drug Information Service and AHS Nutrition Services, enabling convenient access to medication information and nutrition advice for callers. HLA supported the development, posting and highlighting of flood related health information on MyHealth.Alberta.ca during the flooding in Calgary and Southern Alberta to enable easy access to accurate and timely information for the volunteers at the Flood Welcome Centres and the public. HLA is partnering with the Bone and Joint Strategic Clinical Network to implement a new program called \"Catch-a-Break\", which identifies patients who have suffered a low impact fracture and are at risk for osteoporosis. HLA follows up with the patient and their physician to support appropriate screening, diagnosis and intervention. HLA participated in the Calgary Zone Surge Capacity committee to plan for the diversion of appropriate patients who present to the emergency departments to Primary Care Network clinics. HLA support included the use of expanded triage criteria to the After-Hours Primary Care Network Clinics. HLA experienced significant call volume related to influenza beginning in December and peaking in January 2014. HLA added information on the Influenza Immunization Clinic \"look up tool\" which provided accurate and up-to-date information to the public on immunization clinic locations across the province for the duration of the influenza season. In Summary: MyHealth.Alberta.ca, Health Link Alberta and InformAlberta are growing by adding new content and functions that will help more Albertans to manage their own health. In January 2014, Alberta Health Services launched the \"Know Your Options\" campaign to help Albertans understand what their health care options are and when to use them, so that they get the right care, in the right place. This multimedia, multilingual campaign helps provide direction to the public to call HealthLink Alberta, or visit their family doctor as the starting point for health advice, or to visit the AHS website for more information about health care options. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES When Alberta was hit by historic flooding in June 2013, AHS Emergency Medical Services (EMS) was on the front lines of flood relief efforts. From sending its Multi Patient Unit - a big bus capable of transporting multiple patients at a time - to relocating patients in High River and Drumheller, to using community paramedics to assist patients access basic health care needs such as medication, minor wound care, prescriptions and housing - AHS EMS was there to ensure Albertans received the care they needed. FOCUS PROGRESS/RESULTS EMS: Develop a provincial EMS system fully integrated within the overall health system. EMS is involved in an ongoing study with the University of Calgary's Ward of the 21st Century in the Ambulance Design Research Project, the first of its kind in Canada. Its findings on how to best use the limited space in the back of an ambulance could influence the safety, layout and functionality of future ambulances in AHS and across the country. In May 2013, EMS announced the innovative Community Paramedic Program, which has teams of paramedics and EMTs dedicated to providing community care to patients. Focusing mainly on seniors, these health care professionals provide care in the patient's residence. The program is currently operating in Lethbridge and Calgary. It is estimated that this program has prevented about 700 emergency department visits in its first year of operation. Critical Care Medical Control Protocols to support air medical personnel in treating patients were completed. This will ensure safe, consistent care for patients across the province as well as enhancing training and safety for staff. EMS has worked on ways to improve processes for third-party and out of province patient billings for air ambulance. It is using a Patient Care Record database to identify billable clients and also engaging with providers to assist in identifying billable parties/patients. To make sure service plan strategies are more connected at the local community level, EMS initiated a more proactive approach to engaging communities regarding service plan modeling. The development of electronic Patient Care Record (ePCR) specific to the air ambulance environment will improve accuracy and completeness of clinical information during transport, facilitate data collection, reporting, medical review and oversight. The ePCR system design and clinical content was completed. ePCR implementation is scheduled for early Summer 2014 for all contracted Air Ambulance providers. In Summary: Saving lives and improving care is a vital goal for Alberta Health Services. Whenever EMS is called upon, lives are potentially on the line. Ensuring we are providing the right care, at the right time, by the right provider, will save lives. As we strive to improve overall system performance, we have implemented a co-ordinated series of initiatives across the province to improve patient care. Protocols to support EMS personnel in treating patients and avoiding hospitalization will continue to be implemented.www.albertahealthservices.ca 52 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014CONTINUING CARE It is estimated, that by 2030, one out of five Albertans will be more than 65 years old and the average age of Alberta's population will continue to increase. Many seniors will be more independent and healthier than in previous generations. Others , including those with multiple chronic illness and disabilities, will need health care and will want options that allow them to receive care while continuing to live in their own homes and communities. With more options available and better access to caregivers, seniors will be able to live independently as long as possible. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Home Care Standardization: Streamline and standardize home care services. A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued and concluded in Edmonton and Calgary Zones which resulted in a significant reduction in both the number of contracts and cost of services. All operators are now on standard contract terms with consistent accountabilities and funded rates. Planning began in the zones to address equity between urban and rural zones, particularly with respect to personal care, respite care and caregiver support and Adult Day Program access. Work is underway to expand existing adult day programs and to launch new adult day programs in both Calgary and Edmonton in early 2014-15. This will benefit more than 500 additional seniors. Continuing Care Options and Capacity: Further development of continuing care spaces, options and capacity. A total of 335 net spaces were staffed and placed into operation in the 2013-14 fiscal year. From April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2014, 3,369 net new continuing care and palliative spaces have been staffed and placed into operation. As anticipated, 2013-14 has been a challenging year for net capacity increases. The unavoidable loss of space related to the southern Alberta flood and contract issues further decreased net new capacity. Work continued to expand implementation of the Advance Care Planning Goals of Care across the province. In Summary: Seniors have told us they want to remain safe and independent in their own homes, for as long as possible. In response, AHS is expanding services, and providing more home care to Alberta's seniors than ever before. AHS continues to expand home care by adding more hours for those requiring short-term care, in order to prevent hospitalization or an emergency situation. There is a 2.8 per cent increase (3,043 clients) between 2012-13 and 2013- 14 volume of home care clients served. In total for 2013-14, AHS had 112,227 home care clients across the province. All zones will continue to implement the new service guidelines and to educate staff to the new guidelines. In order to manage increased referrals from acute care, AHS implemented enhanced home care capacity to seven days a week with evening access to home care. Destination Home continues to increase home care services to clients with complex needs in Calgary and Edmonton. AHS continues to expand seniors' health options to respond to our changing demographics and to provide quality care and support to Albertans and their families and caregivers. In 2013-14, 335 beds were added to the system which now totals 3,369 additional beds since 2010. Home care and adult day programs expanded in 2013-14 with 95 new adult day program spaces to meet the needs of Albertans. AHS has increased the unique number of home care clients by 12 per cent since 2010-11. Unexpected or sudden medical events can leave us unable to communicate our wishes. Other medical conditions can slowly take away our ability to communicate or make decisions about our health care. Goals of Care and Advanced Care Planning are two initiatives which recognize the importance of understanding an individual's values regarding care choices and serves as a communication tool for individuals and health care professionals. In times of crisis, health care providers are enabled to provide timely care that is medically appropriate and meets the family's personal values and wishes. AHS will continue to ensure Albertans have an opportunity to document an at-a- glance summary of the focus of care and what the patient and family will and will not permit, preventing unwanted interventions especially during a medical crisis.53 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014POPULATION HEALTH In working to improve the health of all Albertans, we also recognize the need to promote better health and reduce health inequities. Enabling people to stay well and to minimize their need to access health services will improve both the quality of life for Albertans and enable the system to be more sustainable. This focus on health promotion and wellness underlies all of what we do across the continuum of care within AHS and requires full partnership with the public, government and a variety of stakeholders. This year, AHS worked with partners across Government of Alberta Ministries including Health, Education and Human Services to deliver greater coordination and integration for initiatives such as the Early Childhood Development Strategy. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Children and Youth - Nutrition, Activity and Mental Health: Partner with schools, school jurisdictions and community organizations to plan and carry out initiatives that increase availability of healthy foods and beverages, expand opportunities to be physically active, and improve mental health for children and youth. Comprehensive School Health (CSH) is an evidence-based approach to building healthy school communities. AHS collaborates with schools, school jurisdictions and community organizations to develop knowledge and skills; create supportive environments; and facilitate healthy policy development to support healthy eating, active living and positive mental health. Completed report summarizing work between AHS, education sectors and community organizations to achieve the goals of promoting healthy eating, active living, and positive well-being to support healthy weights in school-aged children and youth. The report highlights that 90 per cent (target was 75 per cent) of school jurisdictions are partnering with AHS. An external website www.everactive.org/shaping-the-future was established. Fifteen new CSH educational resources were added to the website which was further promoted through emails to AHS staff, schools, school jurisdictions and submissions to relevant school health newsletters. Early Childhood Development: Work with the Ministries of Health, Education, Justice and Solicitor General, and Human Services to implement the Regional Collaborative Service Delivery Model (RCSDM) in support of early childhood development. AHS collaborated with the Ministries of Health, Education, Justice and Solicitor General, and Human Services to better integrate programs, services and supports for children and youth. This is an Alberta Education led initiative supported by AHS Primary and Community Care, Addiction and Mental Health. This initiative is intended to improve supports for children and youth in schools, including early childhood programs, and those between the ages of 0-20 years with complex needs and/or requiring extraordinary care. Regional Collaborative Service Delivery merged the Student Health Partnerships, Children and Youth with Complex Needs and Regional Educational Consulting Services programs into 17 regional groups. Strategic plans were developed and approved by the 17 regional groups. Implementation of the Regional Collaborative Service Delivery model is underway. Infant and Pre-School Screening and Follow-Up: Work with AH to implement the Infant and Preschool Screening and Follow-Up Services Framework and the Early Childhood Development Priority Initiative. The Newborn Metabolic Screening (NMS) Program Initiative (2010-2015) will ensure all infants born in Alberta receive timely access to safe and effective newborn blood spot screening to support Newborn Metabolic Screening. AHS completed NMS Program clinical policy suite implementation and evaluation plans. 99.4 per cent of all newborns in the province are currently screened. Planning underway with Alberta Health regarding the implementation of the Infant and Preschool Screening and Follow-up Services Framework. Child Injury Prevention: Develop guidelines and training resources and implement A Million Messages for child injury prevention (aimed to prevent abuse and injury for that age group). A Million Messages (AMM) standardizes the child injury prevention messages given to parents and caregivers and is designed to provide simple, consistent and targeted messaging to parents and caregivers as part of the core business of AHS health care professionals. The AMM Online Learning Module went live on My Learning Link in January 2014 for provincewide use by AHS staff. It supports staff orientation to AMM program content and delivery. The module remains available to non-AHS health providers on the AHS public website at www.albertahealthservices.ca/7607.asp . Healthy Parents and Children: Disseminate and begin evaluation of Healthy Parents, Healthy Children resources. Alberta Health and AHS media launch of Healthy Parents Healthy Children resources took place in November 2013, including the launch of the nine week Social Media campaign. There have been a total of 56,867 visits to the website and distribution of printed material includes 91,100 redemption cards, 469,400 promotional cards and 40,420 book sets. An evaluation plan for the Healthy Parents, Healthy Children initiative was developed. Tobacco Reduction Strategy: Work with Alberta Health and other Ministries to implement the Alberta Tobacco Reduction Strategy. AHS worked with Alberta Health and other organizations to implement the Alberta Tobacco Reduction Strategy. Tobacco Free Futures, an integrated health systems tobacco cessation model was implemented at 29 sites across AHS with continued expansion planned for 2014. Planned and proposed expansions include clients of Addictions & Mental Health and Cancer Control services. The AHS Tobacco and Smoke free policy (site-based) was established and a tool to measure AHS compliance was implemented. The \"Keep Trying\" marketing campaign targeting female smokers, 25-44 years of age, was launched. The Nicotine Replacement Therapy research project has been implemented at four mental health and addiction sites across three zones. www.albertahealthservices.ca 54 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Suicide Prevention: Work in partnership with the AHS Provincial Steering Committee on suicide prevention to increase the availability of prevention programs. Developed a system to track the number of partnerships that Aboriginal Youth and Community Empowerment Strategy (AYCES) communities establish with surrounding non-AYCES communities. Nearly 650 people have received training to prevent suicide in Aboriginal communities through an AHS initiative. Four AHS staff members from the Aboriginal Health Program are certified to deliver Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), an internationally recognized program for people who live and work with individuals at risk of self-harm. Since the AHS initiative was launched in late 2011, these ASIST-certified staff members have led two-day workshops for 36 aboriginal groups in First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities across the province. ASIST participants learn how to discuss suicide with a person who might be at risk, identify risks and signs of self-harm, and develop a safe plan to address them, develop skills required to intervene with a person at risk, connect people to available resources and improve community resources and networking to better prevent suicide. Alberta Alcohol Strategy (AAS): Work with Alberta Health and other Ministries in support of the Alberta Alcohol Strategy. AHS worked with Alberta Health, other Ministries and non-government stakeholders in support of the Alberta Alcohol Strategy to build shared leadership commitment to the strategy and build capacity to reduce alcohol-related harm. Governance and leadership structures were put in place with Alberta Health, AHS and Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission. In addition, the development of Alberta Alcohol Strategy Shared Action Plan for 2013-14 was completed and implementation of the actions is underway. Consultation with 25 community coalitions to support local efforts to reduce alcohol-related harm (i.e. knowledge exchange strategy implementation for community coalitions, webinars, social network forums, formal learning events and individual consultation) is ongoing; 37 Community Coalitions participated at the March 2014 Coalitions Connect. Canada's Low Risk Drinking Guidelines (LRDG) communication plan was approved. LRDG was promoted in AHS staff and public communications (i.e. National Addiction Awareness Week, social media feeds, myhealth.alberta.ca, Chief Medical Officer of Health blog). As well, seven education events and 30 consultations were delivered. Environmental Public Health: AHS continues its efforts in support of environmental public health, including inspections of restaurants. The goal of the Safe Food Program is to contribute to the reduction of the incidence of food-borne illness. This is accomplished by inspecting food establishments, by education and enforcement. In June 2013, the investigative work by AHS with the 2012 E. coli outbreak associated with mechanically tenderized Costco beef steak traced to XL Foods was commended in the report of an Independent Expert Advisory Panel appointed by the Government of Canada. An excerpt from the Expert Advisory Panel's report: \"The investigation team at Alberta Health Services (AHS) quickly identified the link between human cases and the [mechanical beef tenderization] process at the North Costco store near Edmonton. With the collaboration of company management, AHS staff was able to take rapid action to minimize further exposure of the public to the threat, as well as bring the [mechanical beef tenderization] issue to the attention of CFIA and other provinces and territories.\" AHS Environmental Public Health's identification of mechanical beef tenderization as a public health risk in Canada elicited a high profile, national-level discussion on the issue. In September 2013, AHS Environmental Public Health officers identified an outbreak of E. coli illnesses associated with unpasteurized gouda cheese produced. AHS Environmental Public Health was the first agency in the country to link outbreak cases to cheese produced at the implicated facility, which eventually included 28 cases among five provinces. Identification of the outbreak elicited national-level discussion on requirements for raw milk gouda cheese production in Canada. In Summary: AHS is working with Alberta Health (AH) to implement a long-term plan to promote wellness. However, the health system alone cannot make people healthier. We must partner with Albertans, other government departments, health service providers, communities, businesses and others to support individuals in taking personal responsibility for their health and Albertans in turn need to understand how to manage their own health and that of their families. In 2013-14, AHS conducted more than 95,000 food safety inspections which is an increase of 10 per cent (9,064) from 2010-11. Also, AHS conducted more than 175,000 public health inspections which is a nine per cent increase from 2012-13. AHS delivers inspections and interventions in seven program areas: Safe Food, Safe Drinking Water, Safe Built Environments, Safe Indoor Air, Healthy Environments, Safe Recreational Water and Disease and Injury Control. The increase was largely due to AHS quick response to businesses and rental housing during the flooding in southern Alberta. AHS annual seasonal influenza immunization program contributes to individual and population-level influenza prevention, including prevention of outbreaks in our facilities. AHS aimed to immunize half of its workforce in 2013-14. Health care worker immunization rates increased from 41 per cent in 2012-13 to 54 per cent in 2013-14. AHS continues to develop new strategies to provide enhanced communication and service delivery initiatives. We helped prevent further spread of measles by undertaking a coordinated approach to assessment and immunization through Zone Emergency Operations Centres, and by activating the Provincial Emergency Coordination Centre. Thousands of individuals around Alberta were assessed, immunized and advised.55 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014MENTAL HEALTH The provincial Addiction and Mental Health Strategy is supported through the development of innovative community- based service models to address individuals with complex addiction and mental health needs and the further development of coordinated and consistent access for children and adolescents to addiction and mental health services. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Children's Mental Health Plan Implementation: Further development of coordinated and consistent access for children and adolescents to addiction and mental health services. Supported implementation of the provincial Addiction and Mental Health Strategy through further development of coordinated and consistent referral and access for children and youth to Addiction and Mental Health Services across the continuum. Developed an inventory of the types of services provided locally, regionally (zone) and provincially. AHS continues to participate in a cross-ministerial strategic planning process for \"Children, Youth and Families Addiction and Mental Health\" led by Alberta Health with Government of Alberta (GOA) Ministries of Education, Human Services, Justice and Solicitor General, as well as the Chief Medical Officer and community partners. Completed a work plan for the Integrated and Collaborative Care Model for Complex Youth Project that was announced January 2014 in the Calgary Zone. The project will build on previous and current shared cross-ministerial services and will provide recommendations for a best practice model. Shared support, tools and information with the GOA Ministry of Human services as it relates to planning and preparation for their new grant-funded children's mental health projects. As part of the Children's Bed Plan Initiative, work continues to advance a Community of Practice that will create support and information to improve access for children and youth moving between programs and across health care sectors. In Summary: Over the past year, significant work has been implemented to improve addiction and mental health delivery systems for all age groups. AHS has begun work on a care model for the support of seniors in continuing care environments who have been diagnosed with an addiction and/or mental health condition. Examples of future work in mental health include the development and implementation of a sustainable model for addiction and mental health service delivery for Family Care Clinics throughout Alberta, to allow for provincial standardization with local adaptation to meet community needs. www.albertahealthservices.ca 56 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014CANCER AHS worked with Alberta Health to implement the new provincial cancer strategy. This strategy focuses on accelerating the implementation of evidence-informed clinical pathways (how patients optimally flow through the system), best practices and standards in cancer surgery (beginning with lung cancer); prevention and early detection through breast, cervical and colorectal cancers screening; and support for cancer survivors and provision of palliative care. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Cancer Plan Implementation: Begin actions in support of the phased implementation of \"Alberta's Cancer Plan to 2030\". CancerControl Alberta brings together cancer facilities and programs under one umbrella to create a comprehensive and coordinated system of cancer prevention, screening, care and research for Alberta. The provincial accountability framework that addresses alignment and integration to support provincial operational standards and equity of care is in place and aligns with AHS Health Plan, CancerControl Alberta Operations Plan and Changing Our Future: Alberta's Cancer Plan to 2030. A comprehensive health information cancer-specific management unit, C-MORE was developed and implemented. Three provincial councils (Radiation Medicine, Systemic Therapy and Supportive Care) and 12 tumour teams were created to support quality improvement and integration of services across the province. Significant quality improvement initiatives were initiated including a 10-year replacement plan. In November 2013, the Red Deer Cancer Centre opened and offers radiation therapy and dedicated dietician and nutritional counselling. This complements the existing chemotherapy program. There have been more than 25 new staff hired or in the process of being hired to support the centre. As of the end of March, more than 140 patients have been treated with radiation therapy and have completed nearly 1,772 treatment sessions. Red Deer is the latest addition after Lethbridge, with Grande Prairie to follow in 2017. In 2013-14, AHS launched the Enhanced Access to Cancer Screening Project. This project is sponsored by federal, provincial, zone and community partners to increase access to cancer screening for rural and remote communities. The Alberta Breast Cancer Screening Program (ABCSP) initiated a trial to support women in rural and remote areas in having timely knowledge of their ability to access mobile screening services close to home or fixed site service (usually at a greater distance). The ABCSP will work to address any gaps which may result in inaccurate estimation of both breast cancer screening participation rates, and wait time for resolution of abnormal screening results. The Screen Test Program continued to provide mobile mammography services without disruption despite the displacement of the Screen Test south office. In addition, despite the closure due to flooding of the Screen Test fixed mammography clinic in Calgary, the Screen Test Program continued to provide screening mammography services to Calgary clients through the use of the south mobile unit which has been set up in Calgary. The Alberta Cervical Cancer Screening Program made the following key accomplishments in the past year: Completed initial phase of development and testing of the Colposcopy electronic synoptic reporting system that includes all the essential data elements for this clinical procedure, as approved by a provincial committee and the Canadian Partnership against Cancer. Achieved 100 per cent implementation of all client correspondence for eligible women in Alberta (including invitation letters, results letters, and screening reminder letters). Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) was implemented provincewide in November 2013. FIT is a new screening test targeting colorectal cancer, it is an easy, at-home test that can eliminate the need for average-risk Albertans to have a colonoscopy. Initial utilization of FIT is being closely monitored. An Alberta Colorectal Cancer Screening Program performance management framework including FIT related indicators is currently being developed. In Summary: The long-term, strategic plan for cancer control in the province outlines a vision for 2030, where more cancers are prevented, more cases of cancer are cured and the suffering from cancer is greatly reduced. Changing Our Future will make better use of existing facilities and staff, and build or expand cancer facilities in Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer and Grande Prairie.57 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PATIENT FLOW AND ACCESS When it comes to health care, three key ingredients come into play: patients, their health care professionals and the system that supports them. Collaborative care happens when these three components work in unison, and AHS is focused on working as a team with patients and families. We call it CoACT - \"to act or bring together\". CoACT is a project aimed at ensuring all team members know what's involved in the patient journey, from arrival at the hospital, day by day, until discharge home. For patients, it means a partnership with their health care team in planning care, including their return to the community and follow-up needed to return to health. It offers patients a clear view on where they are, and where they're going in their journey through the health system. CoACT also helps ensure the right staff are doing the work they're best at doing, to meet the individual needs of patients. This not only helps our health system get the most value for every dollar spent, but also ensures a stable workforce of health professionals in years to come. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS CoAct: Implement and spread this Model of Care Innovation by integrating multiple projects into one initiative: Workforce Model Transformation, Care Transformation, Path to Home and transition projects; and expedite roll-out plans for two additional sites. Ensure that all staff are working collaboratively and to the full scope of their roles, while bringing the patient and family into the care planning process, and increasing time spent on care. CoACT (previously called Model of Care Transformation) brings three legacy projects together as one cohesive model: Care Transformation, Workforce Model Transformation and Path to Home (discharge planning). Collaborative practice team-based model of care was launched in four units in September 2013 at two sites in Edmonton (Royal Alexandra Hospital and University of Alberta Hospital) and two units in Medicine Hat. Processes of care are being implemented on five units at the University of Alberta Hospital. Staff mix and processes of care have been implemented on one unit at Royal Alexandra Hospital. All zones and Covenant Health have committed to proceed with CoACT implementation. In Summary: CoACT is building on all the successes and lessons learned from legacy projects, including: Path to Home, Workforce Model Transformation and Care Transformation. In addition, components of CoACT are well underway throughout the province as other facilities come onboard in the months ahead. We look forward to collaborating with our patients and working together to improve their care and our health system.www.albertahealthservices.ca 58 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014STRATEGIC CLINICAL NETWORKS Strategic Clinical Networks (SCN) are engines of innovation, bringing together physicians, clinicians, patients, researchers, staff and partners across Alberta to develop strategies, which are based on evidence, to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. The SCNs work to improve access to health care and the long-term sustainability of the health care system. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS SCN - CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND STROKE Rural Stroke Action Plan: Develop and implement best practice recommendations for \"stroke unit equivalent care\" and a community-based stroke rehabilitation service that includes Early Supported Discharge (ESD). Implemented the Stroke Action Plan to address the quality of, and access to, stroke care in rural and small urban stroke centres across Alberta. Developed and implemented best practice recommendations for \"stroke unit equivalent care\" (SUEC) in a small urban and rural setting. Launched Early Supported Discharge/SUEC teams in Red Deer, Camrose, Grande Prairie, and Medicine Hat. Start-up and training provided with teams seeing patients and collecting data in Red Deer, Camrose and Grande Prairie. Two Learning Collaborative sessions were conducted in January and March 2014 with more than 70 participants representing all project sites. Balanced scorecards developed by each site to establish baselines for monitoring planned quality improvements. Vascular Risk Reduction Project: Phased in vascular risk factor screening and early management project in primary care setting and pharmacies. 24 primary care organizations with more than 1,000 physicians and 119 providers have implemented systematic and vascular disease prevention processes. Staff training and education for pharmacies completed - more than 100 pharmacists participated in training. Initiated implementation of integration model in Medicine Hat in December 2013. SCN - OBESITY, DIABETES AND NUTRITION Enhancing Recovery After Surgery (ERAS): Develop surgical care pathway (integrating best practices in nutrition and physical functioning) starting with colorectal and pancreatic surgeries. ERAS will improve surgical care of patients before, during and after surgery through adoption of best practices (protocols) that include preoperative nutrition risk screening and improved patient education; shorter preoperative fasts and preoperative oral and post-operative and ambulation. ERAS is currently being piloted in colorectal surgery at the Grey Nuns Hospital in Edmonton and the Peter Lougheed Centre in Calgary and is planned for the Royal Alexandra Hospital and University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton and Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary; with the hope of spreading to other sites and other areas of surgery in the near future. Insulin Pump Therapy (IPT): Development of IPT clinical eligibility/ineligibility criteria for children, youth and adults with Type 1 diabetes (TD1) and identification of required AHS infrastructure across the province. Alberta Health officially launched the Insulin Pump Therapy (IPT) Program in June 2013. This program funds an insulin pump and supplies for adults and children with Type 1 diabetes who meet the eligibility criteria developed by AHS. This SCN led the development of the clinical criteria and the evaluation framework. The 11 approved diabetes clinics have implemented the new eligibility criteria in determining the most appropriate patient for IPT. The Health Technology & Policy Unit (University of Alberta) developed a Project Charter and defined the metrics for the Access with Evidence Development evaluation of insulin pump therapy in pediatric and adult patients with Type 1 diabetes in Alberta. This plan identifies the approach to develop evidence for the use of insulin pump therapy in Alberta. SCN - CANCER Access for Referral and Triage eReferral Project: One component of a larger provincial eReferral project, which will focus on the development of a web portal to support referrals provincially for breast and lung cancer. The eReferral project aims to be innovative in its approach to patient and provider access, making it easier for people to work together, and to focus on providing a quality health system that is accessible and sustainable for all Albertans. The eReferral platform will be a new component of the Alberta Netcare Electronic Health Record Portal, which is currently used by more than 40,000 staff in the province, to look at patient medical information such as blood results and current medication. For Albertans, this means that the referral process becomes more predictable, transparent and personal. They will be able to make informed choices and know what's happening throughout the process. eReferral will start accepting electronic referrals to cancer centres for patients with lung and breast cancer and to hip and knee clinics for patients who may require hip or knee replacement surgery. The Alberta Thoracic Oncology Program, a provincial initiative of the Cancer SCN, is a collaborative effort of health professionals in Edmonton and Calgary Zones and CancerControl Alberta to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process for suspected lung cancer patients, from initial symptom or suspicious x-ray to definitive surgery or initial chemotherapy. Developed Rapid Access Clinics in both Edmonton and Calgary to dramatically reducing the wait times for suspected lung cancer patients.59 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS SCN - SURGERY Adult Coding Access Target for Surgery (aCATS) Sustain and Spread: Develop and implement a standardized diagnosis-based surgical benchmark for all surgeries in Alberta. Completed provincial diagnosis and urgency access targets for surgical services based on best practice evidence. Surgical wait list duplications have been removed and maintained. Completed pilot phase of evaluation to inform aCATS provincial spread and sustain strategy and plan. Implemented aCATS at 11 pilot sites and 15 additional surgical sites. Work will begin to monitor data on the numbers of patients having their surgery within or out of the acceptable wait times so that improvements can be made. Safe Surgery Checklist: Implementation and standardized measurement of compliance in AHS facilities and contracted non- hospital surgical facilities throughout the province. AHS introduced the Safe Surgery Checklist across the province. This tool is used by surgical teams, and enhances existing safety checks before, during and after a surgical procedure. Developed by the World Health Organization, the checklist has been shown to reduce the number of preventable complications associated with surgery. The Safe Surgery Checklist has been identified as an Accreditation Canada Requirement of Practice, a requirement which will be met under this project. Across the province, there was 90 per cent compliance using the Safe Surgery Checklist in all surgical sites. SCN - SENIORS HEALTH Appropriate Use of Antipsychotics in Long-term Care: Development of best practice guidelines in the management of responsive behaviour with dementia in long- term care residents. Implemented draft Appropriate Use of Antipsychotics guidelines and a toolkit for management of responsive behaviours at pilot sites. Completed evaluation of implementation of guideline and toolkit. Developed strategy for provincial spread and implementation is underway. In 2013-14, 85 per cent of residents on antipsychotics had their medications reviewed monthly by an inter- professional team which is an increase from 36 per cent last year. Prevalence of antipsychotic use in pilot sites has decreased from 41 per cent last year to 26 per cent in 2013-14. SCN - BONE AND JOINT Bone and Joint Fragility and Stability: Design a Fracture Prevention Program. Develop inventory of osteoporosis resources. Developed \"Catch a Break\" (secondary fracture prevention program) materials. Reviewed and updated inventory of osteoporosis resources and services. Initiated planning session and working group to develop material for discharge criteria project for both acute and post-acute sites. The re-fracture rate has decreased from 6.6 per cent last year to 5.3 per cent in 2013-14. In Summary: SCNs are provincial, clinically led teams that are designed to improve quality and clinical outcomes. Given AHS' position as Canada's only provincewide health delivery organization, AHS has the ability to create novel approaches to high-quality, sustainable health care delivery, prevention and wellness for every Albertan. SCNs support clinical operations and clinicians to continuously improve quality and to lead health innovation across the care continuum. Also, SCNs enhance teamwork between academic organizations and AHS. www.albertahealthservices.ca 60 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Research and Innovation - Funding Criteria and Processes: Establish a funding framework, cycle and process, select projects and announce funding in support of research and innovation projects that target high-impact activities associated with any part of the continuum of care. Alberta Innovates Health Solutions (AIHS) and AHS partnered to launch the inaugural 2013 Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Health System (PRIHS) competition. This opportunity supports networks of health researchers and clinical practitioners across the continuum of care, with an emphasis on population health and community and primary care, that can (re)assess technologies, services and /or processes within the health system and identify sustainable solutions to improve the overall quality of care and value for money in Alberta's health system. AIHS completed an external review of all applications in November 2013. Members of the review panel were drawn from across Canada. The review panel identified several projects that satisfied the scientific and health system criteria for funding. AIHS posted the results publically on its website on January 2014. Additional communication to the public about the PRIHS project on reducing wait time for sufferers of back pain was delivered in February 2014. Research and Innovation - Ethics: Contribute to streamlining ethics for health research and clinical trials towards provincial harmonization of research ethics boards. Health Research Ethics Harmonization is vital to Alberta's Health Research and Innovation Strategy. In Alberta, health research involving humans is reviewed by the Alberta Cancer Research Ethics Committee, one of six Health Information Act designated research ethics committees/boards. In 2009, the six designated boards worked towards a more aligned and coordinated provincial research ethics review system that would improve efficiencies, multi-site communications, and facilitate additional research investment. A Research Ethics Reciprocity Agreement was signed in February 2011. Alberta is the first in Canada to reach such an agreement. Once fully implemented, ethics review for multi-site health research studies will be streamlined. Provincial Health Analytics Network (PHAN) The Provincial Health Analytics Network (PHAN) is a three-year joint initiative between Alberta Health and AHS to develop an integrated health analytics network for the province. The PHAN will be a single window into authoritative sources of comprehensive health information of mutual interest to stakeholders and to the health system. There are 35 identified PHAN projects, with 16 projects led by AHS, and the remainder led by AH. PHAN data model and architecture were completed. Health Technologies Assessment (HTA) and Reassessment This joint initiative with AH means that Albertans will receive access to the most clinically and cost effective health care technologies and services. Developed and implemented criteria for the Alberta Advisory Committee on Health Technologies screening committee to guide the triaging of promising technologies and reassessments. The committee continues to trial the draft criteria/ prioritization plan developed by the University of Alberta. Collaboration is underway with the University of Calgary to incorporate an operational and financial impact analysis into the social, technology, economic review process for the Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; and with the Institute of Health Economics for the review of Low-Dose CT for Lung Cancer Screening. Patient Engagement Researchers (PERs) Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs) are the collaborative strategy groups that bring the perspectives of all stakeholders together to achieve improvement in patient outcomes and satisfaction, access to health care and sustainability of the health care system. An important voice in this work is that of the patient and the consumer of health services. Patient Engagement Researchers (PERs) are citizens living with various health conditions who are trained to design and conduct health research, using specific adapted methods of qualitative inquiry. Patients are fully engaged in all phases of research from setting agendas, funding and implementation through to the uptake of research suggestions. PERs are trained to collaborate with health professionals and researchers, engage other patients, capture and articulate perspectives and ideas through valid research methods, and offer the findings to support collaborative, interdisciplinary decision-making. Exciting research led to the development of a Patient and Community Engagement Research Program, housed in the Faculty of Medicine as part of the Institute for Public Health at the University of Calgary. AHS, through the SCNs, are full partners in this program by ensuring PERs are involved with the networks' core committees, working groups and research networks. In Summary: Embedding research within the Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs) is a critical provincial platform to bring academics and clinicians together to create new solutions for problems of value to AHS and Albertans. In turn, this has created the need for Research, Innovation and Analytics to focus its resources to enable the achievement of the goals established by AHS. Critical to the sustained long-term success of research and innovation in the province is a sustainable research funding model and robust evaluation criteria. The AHS Research portfolio is working with SCNs, AHS departments and external health care partners to achieve this. Success within the SCNs will strengthen the competitiveness and deepen the impact of health researchers within Alberta's academic institutions. The SCNs will provide more effective platforms to demonstrate to funders the ability to apply new knowledge to the benefit of patients. 61 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014ACHIEVING HEALTH SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY The performance of our health care system is directly related to the people who provide care and services to the patients, families and communities we serve. Improvements in the productivity of our workforce will be supported through adopting care models that make the best use of the skills of our physicians and staff, providing greater opportunities for full-time work for our nurses, and continuing to improve our processes, procedures and flow of patients through our system. The productivity of our workforce will be supported through ongoing initiatives to improve workplace health and safety. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Scheduling and Rotations: Implement and spread the standardized scheduling and rotation management initiative to increase the number of full-time staff, streamline staffing processes and reduce costs. To build a sustainable workforce and ensure patients experience a consistent level of care, we are improving how we schedule staff. This includes increasing the number of full-time employees and creating a stable supply of relief staff. Standardized scheduling processes will ensure staff have more predictable shifts and access to online scheduling technology. These changes allow us to operate more efficiently so that resources are focused on patient care. Staff scheduling transformation has aligned rotation scheduling work with the CoACT initiative. This will enable rotations to be built that support the collaborative model of care-provider mix. Rotation management and optimization has increased full-time positions in the master rotations schedule. A tactical guide for front-line managers was created to optimize rotation through attrition to increase full-time positions. Standardized scheduling processes have been developed with staff being trained to use the new standard tools and processes for rotation management. Built optimized regular and relief rotations for a total of 253 units. Workforce Actions: Implement the following workforce actions: Compensation freeze for management and out of scope staff. Implement vacancy management. AHS implemented a three-year salary range freeze for all management and out-of-scope employees, including senior leaders. The Official Administrator completed the Executive compensation review and is posted on AHS' external website. The review has been fully implemented as outlined in the report. AHS implemented a hiring freeze on all administrative positions that are not mission-critical. Any hiring is tightly focused on clinical care. The vacancy management process helped ensure AHS increased the number of nurses, while the number of management and out-of-scope individuals decreased. Negotiations with United Nurses of Alberta (UNA) are ongoing. Workplace Health & Safety: Create a healthy, safe and supportive work environment to enable staff to provide quality patient care. Several accomplishments were made through the Safe Client Handling program to reduce occupational injury and strengthen the health and safety culture of a health workplace. Since 2010, 94 per cent of ceiling lifts have been installed. In addition, 58 per cent of AHS staff have been trained in \"It's Your Move\", which provides training and specialized equipment to help move clients safely and avoid potential injury. The Move Safe manual material handling program trained provincewide almost 200 program champions as well as more than 650 front-line staff. Portfolio Health and Safety Improvement Plans were completed and included key measures such as injury reduction targets, immunization rates and an \"It's Your Move\" training rate that are regularly reviewed by operational leaders. Workplace Mental Health: Identify, implement and evaluate various best and promising practices to address workplace mental health and addiction in Alberta. Developed the Psychological Safety and Mental Health Strategy which is composed of three parts: (1) increase awareness of psychological safety within the workplace and implementation of the Canadian Standards Association Standard for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace within AHS; (2) support leaders to identify and address psychological safety risks in the workplace; and (3) provide employees with resources and supports to facilitate psychological wellness. Minding the Workplace pilot project is funded by a grant from Alberta Health to inform the development of an employee mental health strategy that fosters and supports psychological safety and flourishing, reduces stigma and discrimination in the workplace and promotes workplace mental health. An assessment of the psychological health and safety of employee groups has been conducted. This project has received an approved extension to July 2014. AHS Prevention of Workplace Violence Program is now available to support all AHS staff. In Summary: Ensuring the AHS workforce is supported, and their skills are utilized in the most appropriate and efficient way, is important to AHS. Continued efforts have resulted in increased full-time positions. Occupational injury and illness reduction plans are focusing on mitigating workplace hazards and building employee resilience to cope with workplace demands. In 2013-14, 12 per cent of AHS staff participated in workplace wellness programs, an increase of 50 per cent from the previous year (eight per cent). Continued work is also required to ensure we have the right workforce to meet the needs of our health system, and that staff injuries are reduced. AHS values safety and accountability. Each employee is responsible for the quality of patient care and the safety of our work environment. AHS is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment to ensure all workers are protected from harm and can focus on providing the highest quality of care to those we serve.www.albertahealthservices.ca 62 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014BUILDING ONE SYSTEM AHS is committed to developing models and allocating funding for programs and service providers across the continuum of care based on the needs of the patient and/or the needs of the population group. The delivery of quality, safe health care services depends on fiscal responsibility and good stewardship of resources, reducing duplication and streamlining processes to improve efficiencies. PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Results-Based Budgeting: Work with AH to complete the results-based budgeting review process for Addiction and Mental Health. AHS has participated in the Cycle 1 review of Primary Health Care, including Addiction and Mental Health (AMH). Individual units of review were identified and comprehensive assessment of the current state for these units was completed, along with assessment of the relevancy, effectiveness and efficiency value for each unit of review. Recommendations for future state and specific AMH actions have been identified and the results of this review have been compiled in a draft final report that was submitted to AH outlining the overall assessment completed and future state improvement initiatives and recommendations. Patient-Care-Based-Funding - Acute and Continuing Care: Work on the current state and draft desired strategic shifts have been completed and first collaborative review workshops have been held to discuss a desired state for both acute and continuing care. For the second workshop, the acute and continuing care reviews will be combined, and a workshop was scheduled for early May 2014, to continue to the Health System Dialogue discussions. Patient-Care-Based-Funding - Long-Term Care: Continue the new patient-based funding for long-term care. The Continuing Care Business Model and Funding Steering Committee includes representatives from AH, AHS and long- term care and supportive living providers. The committee is reviewing priorities for a business model and funding for the future, and will develop a work plan and priorities for activities in 2014-15, along with recommendations on funding allocations for continuing care. Patient-Based Funding - Acute Services: Implement patient-based funding for acute services. Extensive work has been completed under the leadership of the Bone and Joint Strategic Clinical Network to plan for implementation of patient-based funding for hip and knee replacements at acute care sites across the province. Implementation was deferred to 2014-15. The Diagnostic Imaging Leadership Team has been working with the patient-based funding team to plan for implementation of activity-based funding for CT scans. Implementation in 2013-14 was deferred to 2014-15. Preliminary discussions are underway to identify other opportunities to implement activity-based funding for acute care. Opportunities will be explored in consultation with acute care leads for programs. Revenue Generation: Identify revenue generation initiatives. Obtained approval from AH for cost recovery of services provided to out-of-province patients for services such as islet cell transplants, cardiac interventions - transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI) and ventricular assist device (VAD) program; and diagnostic imaging PET/CT scans. Implemented preferred accommodation rate increase implemented April 1, 2014 (phase 2). Implemented policy on patient billings for medical supplies and consumables. Alternate Service Delivery: Develop alternative service models. AHS has many services provided by external third-party providers. Developed project plan to ensure sufficient resources and limited burden on front-line operations. This approach will ensure development of consistent service delivery models, transition to standardized contracts that can be used to monitor service levels as well as allow AHS to generate savings while maintaining or enhancing quality of care and service. Third-Party Contracts: Conduct a review of third-party contracts. Established the Major Contract Oversight Committee to explore alternate strategies for completing third-party agreements with a focus on engagement and level of risk by community. Overhead Costs: Reduce overhead costs by 10 per cent in 2013-14. Overhead costs were reduced by 11 per cent in 2013-14. Various corporate service areas developed initiatives to reduce overhead costs across the organization including: Improving efficiencies and reducing costs associated with printers, long distance and cell phones as well as software maintenance and contracts. Reducing in the use of consultants, contractors and temporary staff. Reducing in travel expenditures within the organization. Optimizing Support Services: Optimize the support service areas in relation to zones and operating units. Implemented Lean improvements by standardizing and optimizing processes and workflows, delivering projects that improve efficiencies and reduce waste, and embedding a culture of front-line empowerment and decision-making. The following are some examples of work underway. Bed rental analysis at the University of Alberta Hospital. 30 per cent less usage for patient watch security following patient safety watch review in the South Zone. Centennial Centre for Mental Health and Brain Institute projects include energy savings, work flow re-organization, and administrative efficiency improvements. 63 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PRIORITY ACTIONS PROGRESS/RESULTS Laboratory Services: New model development and implementation. A new 'hub and spoke' service delivery model ensures high quality care that is accessible and sustainable for all Albertans. Hub facilities will provide latest automated technologies and testing, best in class quality, and consistent access to expert medical consultative services provincewide. Provincial Clinical Information System (CIS): Planning for a new integrated Clinical Information System (CIS) for the Edmonton Zone to replace current legacy systems, including VAX, Tandem, and others, is underway. The Edmonton Zone CIS Program will help to support and enable care transformation in the Edmonton Zone and enable more patient-focused care by providing a new integrated CIS for all primary care, acute and ambulatory sites, and will include provincial services like Mental Health, Corrections, and Cancer Care. The project will use and leverage evidence-informed clinical decision support being developed by provincial SCNs such as Emergency, Bone & Joint (hip fracture pathway), Addictions & Mental Health (alcohol addiction pathway) to build provincial knowledge and content, but deliver that solution locally within the Edmonton Zone. Support Services - Value: Harvest the value from systems. e-Accounts is working to consolidate numerous Finance and Contracting, Procurement and Supply Management initiatives. The e-Accounts program includes accurate, timely and responsive processes for procurement, budgeting, forecasting and payables. It impacts every area and department within AHS and supports our goal to provide high-quality patient care to Albertans by reducing duplication of systems. The e-Facilities project has been established by the Capital Management group to improve the management of AHS facilities across the province. This project integrates several systems across the province to manage project delivery, real estate, planning and design, and facility operations and maintenance. Zone Planning: Identify productivity and sustainability initiatives by working with the zones. Developed five draft 2014-2017 Zone Operational Plans that informed the AHS 2014-2017 Health Plan and Business Plan. Utilized the five Zone Operational Plans, as well as the 35 operational plans from corporate, provincewide and other support areas, to create the 2014-2015 AHS Action Plan, which is a supplement to the Health Plan and Business Plan. Completed Phase 1 of Edmonton Zone 2030 Plan which focused on optimizing existing space (primarily in acute care) to address service pressures. Between August 2012 and June 2013, 18 health care facilities in the Edmonton Zone were reviewed with a view to understanding service and space pressures. Highlights of this work were: Strengths, issues and opportunities for each site and program area were documented relating to space, workflow and safety - more than 180 strengths and opportunities were identified. Tours covered 1 million square metres of space across the 18 sites. 42,000 square meters of vacant space was identified (including shelled in or under-utilized) that could be repurposed for inpatient or ambulatory services. Edmonton Zone 2030 Phase 2 work involves projecting the health needs of the population served and developing a zone- wide health service plan and supporting infrastructure plan in five year increments from 2015 to 2030. Measurement and Reporting: Work with Alberta Health to implement outcomes-based framework to standardize measurement and reporting. Published the 16 new measures, which reflect a better balance across the spectrum of health care and show health system performance, on the AHS website at www.albertahealthservices.ca/performance.asp . \u00b7The newly revised measures are also designed to be more balanced and include measures for acute care, community- based care, and patient outcomes in the areas of seniors care, mental health and cancer care. Indicators focus on long- term care, continuing care placement, early cancer detection and mental health readmissions, emergency department wait times, emergency room wait times, and incidences of strokes and heart attacks. Many of the new measures are aligned with national standards and benchmarks, so that Albertans can see how their health system is performing compared to the rest of Canada. Each measure has an associated target. In Summary: Since AHS became one organization, there has been significant effort to implement common financial, procurement, planning and reporting systems. These systems have brought together nine former health regions and three provincial health entities and all of their existing systems into a single platform, in a relatively short timeframe. This furthers our goal to enable one health system. The results from the Results-Based Budgeting reviews will be reviewed by the Government of Alberta and decisions related to this work are subject to next steps in the provincial Results-Based Budgeting review. The financial summary can be found in the Financial Statements section of this document. www.albertahealthservices.ca 64 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AHS is on a continuous journey of quality improvement, utilizing new evidence-based practices so that we can continue to provide the highest quality of care for our patients and their families. Across AHS, health care providers, medical staff, managers, staff and leaders are committed to provide quality and safe patient care. Together we are working to develop a just culture where our commitment is visibly demonstrated. It is imperative that the voice of Albertans be embedded into the valuable work done every day to enhance and maintain the quality of all care within AHS. Quality, including a focus on patient safety, is a critical area where the patient voice is vital. The Just Culture philosophy supports an environment where everyone feels safe, encouraged, and enabled to discuss quality and safety issues where reporting and learning are key elements. Everyone can trust that those within the organization will demonstrate, through their behaviours and decisions, a fair and consistent approach to responding to issues raised. FOCUS PROGRESS/RESULTS Quality Developed a standardized improvement methodology that is based on Lean, Six Sigma and other leading improvement methodologies. This approach is now known as the AHS Improvement Way (AIW) and more than 8,000 staff and medical staff have received introductory or advanced training to date. Initiated TeamCARE, a demonstration initiative that combines learning and skill development for effective teamwork with clinical improvement approaches to provide safe and reliable care. Developed and published Medication Reconciliation (MedRec) information materials for health care providers, patients and families, and the public to increase awareness and knowledge of this important partnership for medication management. Finalized an integrated ethics framework - a guide to support and spread ethics reflection and action into all aspects of health care and services across the organization. In 2013-14, 500 clinical ethics consultations were provided to support patients, families, staff and physicians through the resolution of ethical concerns. Patient Safety Let's Talk Leadership Safety Rounds were launched to help leaders to learn from front-line staff, physicians, patients and family about near misses, adverse events and hazards that impact staff and patient safety. Collected 250 reports on average per day via the Reporting and Learning System (RLS) for Patient Safety and a toll-free phone line to provide physicians and front-line staff easier access for submitting reports was also launched. Safety Alerts and Safer Practice Notices are disseminated to support timely learning following the identification of a key patient safety risk. In 2013-14, ten Alerts and one Safer Practice Notice were issued. Patient Safety Culture Survey launched in March 2014 to obtain a better understanding of the safety culture at a unit-level across AHS and inform targeted strategies for improving patient safety. The just culture initiative integrates a consistent set of principles with organizational policies and practices to reduce inconsistency in reporting and responding when 'things go wrong' within AHS. The application of just culture in all AHS practice is reinforced through various engagement activities including internal messaging, communication strategies (such as video, webinars) and senior leaders' endorsement. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) AHS has a provincewide Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) team dedicated to preventing infections acquired within health care facilities. IPC monitors hospital-acquired infection rates to improve patient safety, including Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI), the most frequent cause of health care associated infectious diarrhea. Control and reduce the spread of CDI with effective protocols including: early identification and isolation of all patients with CDI, enhanced hand hygiene, cleaning of shared equipment, staff and physician training, and, in some cases, temporary closure of the unit to transfers and new admissions. Cleaning hands before every patient interaction is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and infections. More AHS staff and physicians are cleaning their hands consistently and properly, which protects our patients by reducing the risk of infection. Hand hygiene compliance rates have improved by 32 per cent over the past two years. The current 2013-14 compliance rate is 66 per cent, up from 59 per cent in 2012-13 and 50 per cent in 2011-12. Continues to move forward with local actions and activities to engage staff and raise the profile of hand hygiene including: the ongoing work of site and zone based hand hygiene committees, improved access to alcohol-based hand rub products and continual monitoring and reporting of hand hygiene compliance rates.65 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014FOCUS PROGRESS/RESULTS Accreditation AHS undertakes accreditation activities in compliance with the Minister's directive on mandatory accreditation. Following the 2012 onsite Accreditation Survey, AHS transitioned to a four-year cycle with Accreditation Canada. AHS focused on follow-up from the 2012 onsite survey, planning the 2014-2017 cycle, and preparations for the May 2014 onsite survey. The 2014 survey included assessment against Accreditation Canada's Governance, Leadership, Infection Prevention and Control, Medication Management, Reprocessing and Sterilization of Medical Devices, Telehealth, and Provincial Corrections Standards. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA) provides accreditation services for Laboratory Services, Diagnostic Imaging Services, Neurophysiology and Pulmonary Function Test Labs for AHS, Covenant Health and Lamont Health Care Centre. Accreditation status for these sites is posted on the AHS and CPSA websites. Worked with AH to add four additional accrediting bodies to the list of accepted accrediting organizations. In October 2013, AH accepted Canadian Accreditation Council, Council on Accreditation, College of American Pathologists, and Ontario Laboratory Accreditation as satisfactory accrediting organizations for Alberta's health system. The addition of these accrediting organizations allows more options for contracted providers to pursue accreditation. Compiles information on the accreditation status of contracted providers and provides an Annual Report to AH. The Provincial Medication Management Committee is responsible for providing direction and decision-making to improve medication management across the province. It oversees the work of the Provincial Accreditation Medication Management Committee which supports the implementation of the Medication Management Standards, to be surveyed as part of Accreditation Canada's May 2014 on-site visits. Several provincial teams from Pharmacy Services and Health Professions Strategy & Practice manage the medication management required organizational practices, including high alert medication safety, narcotic safety, heparin safety, concentrated electrolyte safety, antimicrobial stewardship, and dangerous abbreviations. ENGAGEMENT: EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC CONSULTATION SUPPORTS EFFECTIVE PLANNING, DELIVERY AND EVALUATION OF HEALTH SERVICES. Patient and Family Advisory GroupThe AHS Patient and Family Advisory Group includes individuals who volunteer their time to assist AHS to incorporate the voice and perspective of patients in the design and delivery of health care services. The group of 21 Patient/Family Advisors met six times in 2013-14, consulted on 24 items and sat on many committees across AHS to share their unique perspectives and valuable advice. Members determined priorities on a dynamic and flexible yearly work plan, and incorporated 2013-14 key themes of improving patient experience and quality of care, patient- and family-centred care, supporting organizational priorities, continuous quality improvement of the group and emerging issues. Members were provided with education on quality and patient safety through participation in the Alberta Improvement Way Fundamentals training and a Systems Analysis Methodology simulation. Members provided feedback and recommendations on how to embed the patient and family voice and improve quality, safety and the patient experience through consultations on initiatives such as CoACT, Patient-Centred Care, Medication Reconciliation Public Engagement and Education Campaign, Provincial Clinical Telehealth Services and Clinical Information Systems. Feedback was also provided on various policies, procedures and frameworks including the Palliative and End of Life Care Framework, the Clinical Ethics Framework, Continuing Care Waitlist: Access to Living Option, Alternate Level of Care Accommodation Charges - Patients Waiting for Continuing Care, Searching Patients at Risk of Harming Themselves or Others, QAR: Sexual Misconduct in Continuing Care Recommendations, and the Continuing Care Quality Management Framework. A collaborative initiative with Volunteer Resources, Engagement and Patient Experience, and IT was formed to create a Patient and Family Advisor Registry program whereby 130 advisors created profiles and were matched with more than 34 quality improvement initiatives in advisory capacities. Alberta Clinician Council (ACC) At each quarterly meeting, council members met with the CEO of AHS and were informed about organizational priorities, direction and leadership. There was also an opportunity for an informal discussion to discuss front-line clinical/operational concerns and local innovation ideas. ACC was consulted on high priority AHS initiatives and frameworks such as: CoACT, AHS Quality Management Framework, Medication Reconciliation, Patient First Strategy, Provincial Ethics Service Framework, Information Technology Risk Assessment, Integrated Patient Safety Curriculum, Patient Safety Strategic Plan, 2013-2016 Health Plan and Business Plan, and AHS Performance Measures. For most initiatives, ACC members participated in facilitated breakout discussion groups to provide in-depth input into these priority areas. ACC members were provided with detailed background information and local examples of promising and leading practices on the front-line such as disclosure of hospital-acquired infections, serving complex high-needs populations, and improving emergency department flow. ACC members were offered learning opportunities on quality improvement, safety and leadership development. www.albertahealthservices.ca 66 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014FOCUS PROGRESS/RESULTS Health Advisory Councils The fourth annual Advisory Council provincewide meeting provided an opportunity for members to provide input to the Minister and AHS about the importance of engagement and the opportunities to promote wellness. The members were able to network and share engagement strategies as well as awareness techniques. Each Advisory Council completed an Annual Report of activities and accomplishments achieved from their work plans. A broad range of work was highlighted in their Annual Reports. Health Advisory Councils hosted presentations from chronic disease management staff and further promoted awareness to local communities as well as mass audiences. For example, Lesser Slave Lake Health Advisory Council engaged local citizens at the Land of Opportunity Expo in Wabasca, which provided an opportunity to promote awareness and gather feedback on creating better access to primary care and seniors care in their community. The Wood Buffalo Health Advisory Council met with key community stakeholders and AHS to provide quality integrated services to the community. The True North Health Advisory Council solicited feedback from the residents, which provided the basis of the recommendation for an Aboriginal Liaison position at the St. Theresa Hospital in Fort Vermilion, to mitigate barriers to health, including language, culture and transportation. A Council of Chairs, including Chairs from the Health Advisory Councils and Provincial Advisory Councils, was developed to provide advice and feedback to the Official Administrator. The Council provided feedback on topics such as EMS dispatch and mental health. Provincial Advisory Council on CancerOver the past year, the Provincial Advisory Council on Cancer advised and provided feedback to cancer services such as: Participation in the Cancer Strategic Clinical Network, Engagement & Patient Experience, and Alberta Valued Health workshop. Providing a work plan that links the Council, CancerControl Alberta and Alberta Health cancer services. Providing feedback to enrich the development of the Tobacco Reduction Strategy for AHS, the Survivorship Strategy, the Cancer Prevention Social Marketing Campaign (in development by Alberta Cancer Prevention Legacy Fund), CancerControl Alberta and Screening, Population and Public Health that led to the development of the FIT in Alberta, and cancer clinical trials in Alberta. Provincial Advisory Council on Addiction and Mental HealthOver the past year, the Provincial Advisory Council on Addiction and Mental Health advised and provided feedback to mental health services such as: Acting in an advisory capacity in various sub-committees, such as the Improving Safety in Mental Health Units and Facilities sub-committee, Patient Safety, Quality and Policy Committee sub-committee, AMH Strategic Clinical Network, AMH Data sub-committee, AMH Electronic Health Records sub-committee, Patient Engagement Reference Group sub- committee, Alberta Health, Addiction Awareness Campaign sub-committee and the Patient and Community Engagement Research sub-committee (PACER). Developing an AMH work plan that links the Council with AMH services in AHS and Alberta Health. Presenting to the Council of Chairs on the need for 24/7 access to AMH services in Alberta. Providing feedback and consultation on the Recommendations to Improve Mental Health Promotion: Addiction and Mental Illness Prevention and Early Intervention for Albertans Report, the Tobacco Free Futures Initiative for AMH program, the Provincial Health Case Summary; Video Surveillance on In-Patient Health Units and the educational tool 'What We Wish You Knew About Us' with Patient Engagement. Maintaining linkages with the Canadian Mental Health Association, Mental Health Patient Advocate, and Health Advocate. In Summary: Each day, staff and physicians deliver health care services to thousands of Albertans across the continuum of care and make a positive difference in their lives. We acknowledge and appreciate what is going well but also know that there is room for improvement in the quality and safety of our care. In early 2013, AHS initiated the process of integrating the quality dimensions and areas of need into a broader AHS Quality Management Framework (QMF) to ensure seamless, reliable and evidence-informed care. This work is helping us to clarify, formalize and coordinate the internal structures and processes that will most effectively help us to address key gaps and issues in our care processes. Partnering with patients and families is an example of a key enabler within the QMF . We have realigned our resources to better engage patients and families on the improvement journey. Community input and feedback allows us to better address the health needs of Albertans and bring decision-making to the local level. AHS continues to employ various channels to involve stakeholders early on in the decision-making process so their opinions can be considered when health care planning decisions are being made.67 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS For the year ended March 31, 2014 (in millions of dollars) Purpose This Financial Statement Discussion and Analysis (FSD&A) is provided to enable readers to assess the results of Alberta Health Services (AHS) operations and financial condition for the year ended March 31, 2014 compared to budget and to the preceding year.

AHS financial statements are prepared on a consolidated basis and include the following: 3 wholly owned subsidiaries: Calgary Laboratory Services Ltd., Capital Care Group Inc., and Carewest; 30 controlled foundations and trusts; Provincial Health Authorities of Alberta Liability and Property and Insurance Plan (LPIP) and the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital Child Care Centre; and 50 per cent interest in the 42 Primary Care Networks (PCNs), 50 per cent interest in the Northern Alberta Clinical Trials Centre joint venture and 30 per cent interest in the HUTV limited partnership. Additional information about AHS including financial reports from prior periods is available on the AHS website at www.albertahealthservices.ca.www.albertahealthservices.ca 68 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014OVERVIEW OF 2013-14 The following table summarizes the Consolidated Statement of Operations: 2013-14 Highlights 2013-14 key strategic areas highlighted throughout \"Who We Are\" include: Bringing care to the community; Partnering for better outcomes; and Achieving health system sustainability. 2013-14 saw the realization of several long-established commitments, including: Opening of the Central Alberta Cancer Care Centre in Red Deer; Renovation and expansion of the Northern Lights Regional Health Centre in Fort McMurray; Full implementation of various programs and services at the South Health Campus in Calgary; and Opening of 335 net new continuing care and palliative beds. Operational highlights: Increased activity experienced across the organization including 2.1% increase in hospital discharges, 1.1% increase in emergency department visits and 2.8% increase in home care clients. Cost management in place throughout 2013-14 illustrated through only a 4.0% increase in expenses from 2012- 13. Administration expense remained unchanged from 2012-13. Focus on community-based care shown through increased costs incurred in this area.Consolidated Statement of Operations Budget 2014 Actual 2014 Variance 2014 Actual 2013Increase $156 $106 $5069 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-20142013-14 Results Operating Surplus: The AHS operating surplus for the year ended March 31, 2014 is $156 compared to a budget of $nil. The overall positive variance of $156 is comprised of $287 positive expense variance and $131 negative revenue variance. The majority of the revenue and expense variances offset as they are related to restricted funding. The $287 positive expense variance is primarily due to lower than budgeted expenses resulting from unused contingency, vacancies related to recruiting physician and staff positions, timing delays in the implementation of new and ongoing initiatives, cost control strategies and the later than planned implementation of various programs and services at the South Health Campus during 2013-14. Offsetting the overall positive variance is higher than expected expenses related to increased activity levels throughout the province, including demand for acute care and continuing care services, delays in achieving planned cost savings initiatives, additional positions not anticipated in the budget and compensation rate increases. The $131 negative revenue variance is primarily due to lower revenue recognized from AH transfers caused by the phased implementation of various programs at the South Health Campus, lower activity and vacancies in physician services programs, delays in the implementation of various initiatives funded by AH, and an unbudgeted reduction in AH base funding. The overall negative variance was partially offset by higher than budgeted investment income from the diversification of AHS' portfolio, higher than anticipated recoveries for services provided to external entities, and increased revenue recognized from donations, non-government grants, purchase incentive rebates and miscellaneous income. Included in the total unused contingency positive variance is $128 that was set aside in the 2013-14 approved budget for additional strategic and new investments. This balance was not utilized and remained unallocated at year-end as part of unused contingency due to waiting for expected savings to be realized, governance and leadership changes during the year, and anticipating reduced funding in 2014-15. In the days leading up to June 20, 2013, significant rainfall, as well as rapid snow melt, triggered floods which caused damage throughout Southern Alberta, including AHS facilities. The Province's flood recovery initiatives, through its Disaster Recovery Program (DRP), provides financial assistance to impacted government organizations including AHS for uninsurable loss and damage. The DRP is administered and funded by the Alberta Emergency Management Agency of the Department of Municipal Affairs through the authority of the Disaster Recovery Regulation. AHS flood related costs are reported by Municipal Affairs. The operating surplus is added to the total unrestricted net assets balance within accumulated surplus at March 31, 2014.www.albertahealthservices.ca 70 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Accumulated Surplus: The AHS accumulated surplus for the year ended March 31, 2014 is $1,234 compared to the prior year of $1,078 representing an increase of $156 primarily related to the operating surplus generated in 2013-14. Accumulated surplus consists of three main components: unrestricted net assets, reserves for future purposes and net assets invested in tangible capital assets. The unrestricted net assets at March 31, 2014 of $266 does not have any restrictions attached to its future use and may be used at AHS' discretion for operating purposes, capital purposes or the creation of new reserves. Future plans to use the unrestricted net asset balance include consideration towards major information technology investments, such as clinical information systems, further investing in deferred capital maintenance, and future principal payments on non-ancillary related debt. Net assets invested in tangible capital assets and reserves for future purposes have been restricted internally by AHS, as approved by the Official Administrator for use in specific activities, and are therefore not available for any other purpose. The net assets invested in tangible capital assets at March 31, 2014 of $881 represents the restricted net book value of tangible capital assets that have previously been purchased with AHS unrestricted net assets. The reserves for future purposes at March 31, 2014 of $87 have been set aside for future operating and capital purposes related to South Health Campus, cancer research, parkade infrastructure, special local initiatives and retail food services infrastructure. AHS' annual expenditures of $13,068 equates to approximately $36 per day, hence the operating surplus of $156 represents approximately 4.3 days of expenses, or 1.2% of total expenses, and the unrestricted net assets of $266 represents approximately 7.4 days of expenses, or 2.0% of total expenses.Actual 2014 Actual 2013 Increase (Decrease) Accumulated surplus $1,234 $1,078 $156 Less: Net assets invested in tangible capital assets (881) (916) 35 Less: Reserves for future purposes (87) (79) (8) Unrestricted net assets $266 $83 $18371 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS Revenue Total 2013-14 revenues increased by $550 or 4.3% from 2012-13 and were lower than budgeted amounts by $131. The overall increase in revenue from 2012-13 was primarily due to increased base operating funding from AH, which is AHS' primary source of funding. AH funding coverage indicator is 91% (2013 - 91%), representing the percent of total expenses being funded by AH in 2013-14.

Unrestricted AH transfers are the main source of operating funding to provide health care services to the population of Alberta. Restricted operating and capital funding is revenue that can only be used for specific projects and is recognized when the related expenses are incurred. Base operating grants amounted to $10,496 compared to a budget of $10,521 resulting in a negative variance of $25 or 0.2% due to an unbudgeted reduction in base funding. Compared to the prior year, base operating grants increased by $282 or 2.8% due to additional base funding in 2013-14 received for the delivery of health services across Alberta. Other operating grants amounted to $1,257 compared to a budget of $1,436 resulting in a negative variance of $179 or 12.5% mainly due to the phased implementation of various programs at the South Health Campus, delays in the implementation of various initiatives such as the Strathcona Community Hospital, Addiction & Mental Health initiatives and other smaller initiatives funded by AH, and lower activity and vacancies in physician services programs. The overall negative variance was partially offset by some additional grant revenue and higher activity in pharmacy programs. Compared to the prior year, other operating grants increased by $189 or 17.7% primarily due to increased operations at the South Health Campus and Kaye Edmonton Clinic, higher usage of specialized high cost drugs and outpatient cancer drugs provided at no cost to patients, and increased number of medical residents providing services to AHS through the postgraduate medical residency training program. Capital grants amounted to $87 compared to a budget of $98 resulting in a negative variance of $11 or 11.2% mainly due to delays in the completion of various capital projects. Compared to the prior year, capital grants decreased by $19 or 17.9% due to lower expended deferred capital revenue recognized for various capital assets that became fully amortized in 2013-14; partly offset by incremental revenue associated with new capital asset additions. Other government transfers are ongoing and one-time transfers for operating and capital purposes from federal, provincial (other than AH) and municipal governments. Other government transfers amounted to $387 compared to a budget of $389 resulting in a negative variance of $2 or 0.5%. Alberta Health Transfers Budget 2014 Actual 2014 Variance 2014 Actual 2013Increase (Decrease) Base operating grant operating grants 1,436 1,257 (179) 1,068 189 Capital grants 98 87 (11) 106 (19) Total AH Transfers $12,055 $11,840 $(215) $11,388 $45273 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Compared to prior year, other government transfers decreased by $6 or 1.5% mainly due to reduced minor equipment purchases for the clinical commissioning of the South Health Campus and Kaye Edmonton Clinic and fewer operating projects implemented for infrastructure maintenance. The overall decrease was partly offset by revenue recognized from new grant funding and increased revenue recognized from expended deferred capital revenue mainly due to new tangible capital assets put into service. Fees and charges revenue consist of patient revenue for health services provided at rates set by the Minister and collected by AHS from individuals, Workers Compensation Board (WCB), federal and provincial governments, and other parties such as Alberta Blue Cross and insurance companies. Fees and charges revenue amounted to $432 compared to a budget of $456 resulting in a negative variance of $24 or 5.3% mainly due to less than budgeted patient fees and charges from residents of AHS operated long-term care facilities, out-of-country patients, the federal government and other responsible parties caused by lower than expected activity or patient volumes. The overall negative variance was partially offset by an increase in fees and charges from WCB. Compared to prior year, fees and charges revenue increased by $20 or 4.9% primarily due to improved monitoring and collection of overdue accounts receivable, increased volume of services provided to out-of- province patients, and higher recoveries from WCB. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in fees and charges from out-of-country patient billings, other responsible parties and the federal government. Ancillary operations are the sale of goods and services that are unrelated to the direct provision of health services and include parking, non-patient food services, the sale of goods and services and rental operations. Ancillary operations revenue amounted to $126 compared to a budget of $129 resulting in a negative variance of $3 or 2.3%. Compared to the prior year, ancillary operations increased by $8 or 6.8% mainly due to staff and visitor parking fee increases, and higher demand for visitor parking due to influenza and colder than normal winter. Additionally, parking lots at Kaye Edmonton Clinic and South Health Campus experienced their first full year of operations in 2013-14. Donations, fundraising and non-government grants is comprised of revenue that can be any of unrestricted, restricted, operating and capital. Restricted amounts received are recognized when the restrictions are met. Donations, fundraising and non-government grants revenue amounted to $155 compared to a budget of $131 resulting in a positive variance of $24 or 18.3% mainly due to higher than anticipated revenue recognized from restricted research and education grants, unbudgeted one-time revenue from unrestricted donations and special purpose funds, and unbudgeted revenue recognized for minor equipment purchases funded by various foundations. Compared to prior year, donations, fundraising and non-government grants increased by $11 or 7.6% mainly due to more revenue recognized from restricted research grants, one-time revenue from unrestricted donations and special purpose funds, and higher revenue recognized from expended deferred capital revenue as a result of tangible capital assets put into service. www.albertahealthservices.ca 74 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014 Investment and other income is comprised of interest income, dividends, net realized gains and losses on disposal of investments, and recoveries from external sources other than ancillary operations. Included are revenues from third parties, such as drug and medical supply companies and universities (for purposes other than research). Investment and other income amounted to $284 compared to a budget of $195 resulting in a positive variance of $89 or 45.6% mainly due to the diversification of AHS' portfolio which resulted in higher yields from the Canadian and global equity markets while maintaining a conservative risk profile, higher than anticipated recoveries for the compensation expense component of services provided to external entities, increased purchase incentive rebates, and higher than budgeted revenue recognized for minor equipment purchases and physician fees assigned to AHS in relation to physician income guarantee agreements. Further contributing to the positive variance is the increase in miscellaneous income from tenant improvement allowance, sale of drugs and surplus items, and WCB surplus distribution. Compared to prior year, investment and other income increased by $65 or 29.7% mainly due to the diversification of AHS' portfolio which resulted in higher yields from the Canadian and global equity markets, higher recoveries for the compensation expense component of services provided to external entities, increased activity in programs with physician income guarantee agreements, higher purchase incentive rebates, and an increase in miscellaneous income from sources such as tenant improvement allowance and minor equipment funding.75 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014EXPENSES - BY FUNCTION AND OBJECT AHS reviews and reports operating expenses by function and by object in order to fully understand and present the results of current operations, strategic priorities and new investments. Operating expenses increased to $13,068 in 2013-14, representing 4.0% growth from the prior year, with the largest increase related to salaries and benefits. Expenses growth includes support for continuing existing operations, strategic priorities and new initiatives, including the operating requirements of new programs and services. The graph above highlights the most significant areas of operational spending, by function and related objects. A significant portion of the program expenses occurs in inpatient acute nursing services (within which salaries and benefits and other contracted services are the highest objects), emergency and outpatient services (within which salaries and benefits is the highest object), facility-based and continuing care services (within which salaries and benefits and contracts with health service providers are the highest objects), community-based care (within which salaries and benefits is the highest object), diagnostic and therapeutic services (within which salaries and benefits and contracts with health service providers are the highest objects) and support services (within which salaries and benefits, other expenses and amortization are the highest objects).www.albertahealthservices.ca 76 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014EXPENSES - BY OBJECT The overall distribution of expenses by object has remained consistent with prior years, with salaries and benefits making up more than half of total expenses. While AHS continues to focus on priority areas such as reducing wait times in emergency departments, expanding continuing care operations and improving access to high-demand surgeries, expenses continue to be driven by salaries and benefits and contracts with health service providers, whose costs would also be driven by salaries and benefits. During 2013-14, AHS continued to experience challenges in recruiting physicians and staff at the pace anticipated within the 2013-14 operating budget. There were also some delays in implementing certain priority initiatives this year including the Continuing Care Capacity Plan, Strathcona Community Hospital and Addictions & Mental Health initiatives. The overall positive variance was partially offset by increased activity, patient volumes and delayed savings initiatives. 77 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Expenses Budget 2014 Actual 2014 Variance 2014 Actual 2013Increase (Decrease) Salaries and benefits $7,101 $7,049 $6,753 with health service providers 2,314 2,258 56 2,166 92 Contracts under the Health Care Protection Act 18 19 (1) 17 2 Drugs and gases 412 427 (15) 388 39 Medical and surgical supplies 385 399 (14) 392 7 Other contracted services 1,212 1,090 122 1,099 (9) Other expenses 1,353 Amortization, disposals and $12,568 $500 The 2013-14 approved budget included specific and general contingencies to handle unexpected events and potential risks that could arise during the course of the year. Included in the total unused contingency positive variance is $128 that was set aside in the 2013-14 approved budget for additional strategic and new investments. This balance was not utilized and remained unallocated at year-end as part of unused contingency due to waiting for expected savings to be realized, governance and leadership changes during the year, and anticipating reduced funding in 2014-15. The majority of the contingency was not required. As a result, the unused contingency is contributing to positive variances across both expenses by function and by object. Significant variances and changes are explained as follows: Salaries and benefits is composed of compensation for hours worked, vacation and sick leave, other cash benefits (which includes overtime), employer benefit contributions made on behalf of employees, and severance. Salaries and benefits amounted to $7,049 compared to a budget of $7,101 resulting in a positive variance of $52 or 0.7%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $80. The offsetting $28 negative variance is primarily due to the budget assuming higher savings initiatives than realized and an additional number of positions required to support the South Health Campus than what was assumed in preliminary implementation plans. Higher costs compared to budget were also incurred related to increased activity in the zones, leading to increased overtime and additional positions not anticipated in the budget, as well as the use of overtime and relief to cover vacancies. The overall variance also includes savings due to vacant positions throughout the organization including both hard-to-recruit positions and regular recurring vacancies. Further contributing were various delays in initiatives relative to when originally budgeted resulting in delayed hiring. There was also a cash credit recognized from net surpluses held by benefit plans. Cost control strategies, including a vacancy management process that reviewed vacancies without impacting front line services, were also in place during the year to help reduce the impact of recruitment issues. There is an increase of $296 over prior year mainly due to the increasing number of employees for new initiatives, salary and benefit rate increases (including increases under collective agreements and Local Authority Pension Plan which are impacted by the increase in employees, hours and rates). New and existing positions were filled to manage increased activity and capacity, particularly related to the phased implementation of services at the South Health Campus which became fully operational in 2013-14. Although the number of clinical employees increased slightly compared to prior year, vacancies persisted throughout the organization which increased capacity pressures resulting in the need for increased standby, call backs and casual relief. The overall increase was partially offset by the achievement of various savings initiatives and vacancies.www.albertahealthservices.ca 78 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014 Contracts with health service providers include voluntary and private health service providers with whom AHS contracts for health services. Contracts with health service providers amounted to $2,258 compared to a budget of $2,314 resulting in a positive variance of $56 or 2.4%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $32. The remaining $24 positive variance is mainly due to fewer contracts required than originally anticipated in the budget and timing variances associated with the implementation of various budgeted initiatives including Community Treatment Orders, Corrections, Continuing Care Capacity Plan, Capital Bed Initiative, Children's Mental Health Plan, and Safe Communities. The overall positive variance is partially offset by various delayed savings initiatives. There is an increase of $92 over prior year mainly due to increased activity, including opening new supportive livings sites, addition of 335 net new continuing care beds, creating Community Care Teams, implementation of Community Care Capacity Plan initiatives and increased ground ambulance transportation. Further contributing to the increased costs is operating contract rate increases due to inflation. The overall increase was partially offset by achieved savings initiatives primarily related to home care and community-based care. Contracts under the Health Care Protection Act relates to contracts with surgical facilities pursuant to the Health Care Protection Act which is about ensuring quality, while ensuring more efficient delivery of publically funded services by allowing contracting out to profit-orientated surgical facilities. Contracts under the Health Care Protection Act amounted to $19 compared to a budget of $18 resulting in a negative variance of only $1 or 5.6%. Contracts under the Health Care Protection Act costs increased by only $2 compared to the prior year. Drugs and gases include all drugs used by AHS, including medicines, certain chemicals, anaesthetic gas, oxygen and other medical gases used for patient treatment. Drugs used for other than patient treatment such as diagnostic reagents are not considered to be part of this category, but rather included in other expenses. Drugs and gases amounted to $427 compared to a budget of $412 resulting in a negative variance of $15 or 3.6%. The negative variance is mainly due to increased activity related to cancer treatments and immunization programs, as well as a shortfall of budget for costs related to high cost emerging drugs and specialized high cost drugs. The overall negative variance is partially offset by the phased implementation of various programs and services at the South Health Campus. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $7. There is an increase of $39 over prior year mainly due to increased activity related to high cost emerging drugs, cancer treatments, rare disease and specialized high cost drugs. Medical and surgical supplies include prostheses, instruments used in surgical procedures and in treating and examining patients, sutures and other supplies. Medical and surgical supplies amounted to $399 compared to a budget of $385 resulting in a negative variance of $14 or 3.6%. The negative variance is mainly due to increased activity within the zones primarily related to surgical activity, operating rooms including increased supply and instrument costs, emergency department visits and outpatient services, as well as increases in highly specialized provincial services for renal runs. The overall negative variance is partially offset by the phased implementation of various programs at the South Health Campus and various delayed initiatives. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $5.79 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014There is an increase of $7 over prior year mainly due to the phased implementation of various programs and services at the South Health Campus which included opening additional surgical suites and medical units, as well as increased activity related to patient volumes, emergency department visits and surgical volumes. Other contracted services are payments to those under contract that are not considered to be employees. This category includes payments to physicians for referred-out services and purchased services. Other contracted services amounted to $1,090 compared to a budget of $1,212 resulting in a positive variance of $122 or 10.1%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $39. The remaining $83 positive variance is mainly due to physician recruitment issues resulting in vacancies and delays in various initiatives, including the purchase of pandemic supplies, lab and diagnostic imaging quality assurance plans and the staff rotation review and optimization initiative. Further contributing to the overall positive variance is the achievement of cost control strategies and reduced activity related to various contracted services. The overall positive variance is partially offset by inflation, higher operating contract costs and additional positions not anticipated in the budget. There is a decrease of $9 over prior year mainly due to successful cost control strategies to reduce contract costs primarily related to the use of agency nurses and information technology related contracts. The overall decrease was partially offset by increased activity due to the phased implementation of programs at the South Health Campus which fully opened in 2013-14 and contract inflation. Other expenses relate to those not classified elsewhere. Other expenses amounted to $1,261 compared to a budget of $1,353 resulting in a positive variance of $92 or 6.8%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $23. The remaining $69 positive variance is mainly due to more savings initiatives achieved than budgeted and fewer costs required to support the South Health Campus than what was assumed in preliminary implementation plans. Further contributing to the variance are other savings initiatives and cost mitigation efforts related to managing overhead expenses, various delays in initiatives, including the phased implementation of various programs at the South Health Campus, and lower research activity than budgeted. The overall positive variance is partially offset by inflation costs for utilities due to higher natural gas prices, vendor contract inflation related to information technology services and higher than expected legal and liability expenses and an increase in actuarial estimates for past and future unreported liability claims. There is an increase of $41 over prior year mainly due to increased costs related to information technology purchases for the replacement of diagnostic imaging workstations and other end user devices, increased utility costs resulting from higher natural gas prices, and increased insurance costs. Further contributing was increased costs related to operations at the South Health Campus moving to being fully operational in 2013- 14. The overall increase was partially offset by achieved savings initiatives, including reduced equipment maintenance, service contracts, and travel costs. Amortization expenses relate to the periodic charges to expense representing the estimated portion of the cost of the respective tangible capital asset that expired through use and age during the period. Amortization expenses amounted to $565 compared to a budget of $560 resulting in a negative variance of $5 or 0.9%. The negative variance is mainly due to higher capital asset additions than planned and cost adjustments to existing projects for facility improvements and information systems; partially offset by delays in project capitalization. There is an increase of $32 over prior year mainly due to the addition of information technology assets during the year, which were put into service and therefore increased the amortization expense.www.albertahealthservices.ca 80 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014EXPENSES - BY FUNCTION Total expenses in 2013-14 increased by 4.0% from 2012-13 and were lower than budgeted amounts by 2.1%, illustrating achieved cost control strategies. This represents a 3.0% reduction in annual expense growth as compared to the 2012-13 increase of 7.0% from 2011-12. The reduced growth in expenses was primarily achieved in inpatient acute nursing services, facility-based continuing care services, home care, promotion, prevention and protection services, and support services. There was no growth in administration expenses between 2013-14 and 2012-13. The overall 4.0% increase in 2013-14 expenses was primarily due to increased salary and benefit costs, increased contracts with health service provider costs and increased patient volumes. AHS' overall distribution of expenses has remained consistent with the previous year, with inpatient acute nursing services and diagnostic and therapeutic expenses making up 40% of total expenses. Almost all areas experienced an increase from the prior year, with the exception of facility-based continuing care services, home care, research and education, and administration.81 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Total expenses over the three years have increased annually due to items such as compensation rate and benefit increases, new investments, inflation, new facilities and changes to restricted grants. AHS is using new investments to shift delivery of care from acute care settings into non-acute settings. The 2013-14 budget reflected this shift by increasing new investments at a higher rate for non-acute settings (such as community-based care) compared to acute care settings (such as inpatient acute nursing services). The actual results also reflect this shift in focus, as shown in the graph above, through the reduction in annual expense growth in inpatient acute nursing services, compared to the steady annual expense growth in community-based care. Expenses Budget 2014 Actual 2014 Variance 2014 Actual 2013Increase (Decrease) Inpatient acute nursing services $3,004 1,510 20 1,440 70 Facility-based continuing care services 929 896 33 906 (10) Ambulance services 421 443 (22) 409 34 Community-based care 1,164 1,040 124 955 85 Home care 501 506 (5) 507 (1) Diagnostic and therapeutic services 2,234 2,193 41 2,075 118 Promotion, prevention and protection services 361 333 28 331 2 Research and education 252 222 30 225 (3) Administration 481 444 37 444 - Information technology 479 517 (38) 455 62 Support services 1,999 1,895 104 1,849 and changes are explained as follows: Inpatient acute nursing services are composed predominantly of nursing units such as: medical, surgical, intensive care, obstetrics, paediatrics and mental health. This category also includes operating and recovery rooms. Inpatient acute nursing services amounted to $3,069 compared to a budget of $3,004 resulting in a negative variance of $65 or 2.2%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $38. The offsetting $103 negative variance is mainly due to increased activity levels, including increased surgical activity and patient days. The increased activity levels have resulted in higher salaries, benefits, and medical and surgical supplies costs. Higher costs compared to budget were also incurred related to increased overtime, as well as the hiring of additional staff to respond to the increase in activity. Further contributing was an additional number of positions required to support the South Health Campus than what was assumed in preliminary implementation plans. The overall negative variance is partially offset by vacancies and the phased implementation of various programs and services at the South Health Campus. There is an increase of $97 over prior year mainly due to the phased opening of programs and services at the South Health Campus which included the opening of additional surgical suites, addictions and mental health services and various medical clinics and increased physician positions. Further contributing is inflationary and compensation cost increases, as well as increased labour. The overall increase was partially offset by achieved savings initiatives and cost control strategies.www.albertahealthservices.ca 82 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014 Emergency and other outpatient services are composed primarily of emergency, day/night care, clinics, day surgery, and contracted surgical services. Emergency and other outpatient services amounted to $1,510 compared to a budget of $1,530 resulting in a positive variance of $20 or 1.3%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $22. Increased activity levels, particularly in emergency, cancer treatments, and renal runs are offset by vacancies and the phased implementation of programs and services at the South Health Campus. There is an increase of $70 over prior year mainly due to increased activity primarily for drugs and gases related to high cost emerging drugs, rare disease, and specialized high-cost drugs. Further increased costs were incurred related to operations at the South Health Campus moving to being fully operational in 2013-14, particularly in salaries and benefits. Facility-based continuing care services are composed of long-term care including chronic and psychiatric care operated by AHS and contracted providers. Facility-based continuing care services amounted to $896 compared to a budget of $929 resulting in a positive variance of $33 or 3.6%. The positive variance is mainly due to the budget being higher than required. Part of the positive variance is also due to the implementation of cost control strategies and vacancies. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $9. There is a decrease of $10 over prior year mainly due to the achievement of targeted savings initiatives, including reduced drugs and gases costs, and vacancies. The overall decrease was partially offset by contract inflation and increased activity at many AHS facilities. Ambulance services are composed of EMS ambulance, patient transport, and EMS central dispatch. Ambulance services amounted to $443 compared to a budget of $421 resulting in a negative variance of $22 or 5.2%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $10. The offsetting $32 negative variance is mainly due to the budget being lower than required. The overall negative variance is partially offset by vacancies and unsettled ground ambulance contracts. There is an increase of $34 over prior year mainly due to increased activity primarily related to ground ambulance transportation at the Edmonton International Airport and a new restricted grant for improved Medevac services with STARS. Further contributing to the increase was the phased opening of programs at the South Health Campus which includes emergency medical services now in full operation, compensation rate increases and inflation. Community-based care is composed primarily of supportive living, and palliative and hospice care, but excludes community-based dialysis, oncology and surgical services. This category also consists of community programs: Primary Care Networks, Family Care Clinics, urgent care centres, and community mental health. Community-based care amounted to $1,040 compared to a budget of $1,164 resulting in a positive variance of $124 or 10.7%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $24. The remaining $100 positive variance is mainly due to vacancies and lower underlying costs related to drugs used in community-based care compared to the budget. Further contributing is timing variances associated with the implementation of various budgeted initiatives, including facilities not operating at full capacity and the timing of opening beds. Delayed initiatives also led to lower costs compared to budget and include the Continuing Care Capacity Plan, Community Treatment Orders, Corrections, Capital Bed Initiative, Children's Mental Health Plan, and Safe Communities.83 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014There is an increase of $85 over prior year mainly due to increased activity in the zones primarily resulting from the Edmonton Remand Centre being open for the full year in 2013-14, creating Community Care Teams, implementing Community Care Capacity Plan initiatives and increased supportive living capacity at various facilities. Further increased costs were incurred related to contract inflation and increased salaries and benefits costs due to compensation rate increases. Home care is composed of home nursing and support. Home care amounted to $506 compared to a budget of $501 resulting in a negative variance of $5 or 1.0%. The negative variance is mainly due to an increase in home care activity across the zones stemming from increased demand, home care hours, unique clients and home care visits, as well as delays in the implementation of various saving initiatives. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $5. Home care costs were relatively unchanged, with a decrease of only $1 compared to the prior year. Diagnostic and therapeutic services is composed primarily of clinical lab (both in the community and acute), diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, acute and therapeutic services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy and speech language pathology. Diagnostic and therapeutic services amounted to $2,193 compared to a budget of $2,234 resulting in a positive variance of $41 or 1.8%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $37. The remaining $4 positive variance is mainly due to vacancies including some hard-to-recruit positions, various delays in initiatives including the Anatomic Pathology Quality Assurance implementation, as well as the phased implementation of various programs at the South Health Campus. The positive variance also includes the amortization of capital equipment, which was less than budgeted mainly due to less than anticipated major capital equipment purchases. The overall positive variance is partially offset by the budget assuming higher savings initiatives than were actually realized and higher than anticipated costs required to support the South Health Campus than what was assumed in preliminary implementation plans. There is an increase of $118 over prior year mainly due to the phased implementation of programs and services at the South Health Campus which fully opened during 2013-14, increased activity including Kaye Edmonton Clinic now operating at full capacity, and increased diagnostic testing. Increased costs were also incurred for compensation rate increases and various increased contract costs. Promotion, prevention and protection services are composed primarily of health promotion, disease and injury prevention, and health protection. Promotion, prevention and protection services amounted to $333 compared to a budget of $361 resulting in a positive variance of $28 or 7.8%. The positive variance is mainly due to vacancies and various delays in initiatives, including the Pandemic Supplies grant, Alberta Cancer Prevention Legacy Fund grant, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Blood Borne Pathogens and Continuing Care Innovations grant. Promotion, prevention and protection services costs were relatively unchanged with an increase of only $2 compared to the prior year.www.albertahealthservices.ca 84 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014 Research and education pertains to formally organized health research and graduate medical education, primarily funded by donations and third party contributions. Research and education amounted to $222 compared to a budget of $252 resulting in a positive variance of $30 or 11.9%. The positive variance is mainly due to lower grant funded research activity compared to budget. The overall positive variance is partially offset by a decrease in special purpose funds. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $7. Research and education costs were relatively unchanged, with a decrease of only $3 compared to the prior year. Administration is composed of human resources, finance, communications and general administration, as well as a share of administration of contracted health service providers. General administration includes senior executives and many functions such as planning and development, analytics, knowledge management and innovation, infection control, quality assurance, patient safety, insurance, privacy, risk management, internal audit, and legal. Activities and costs directly supporting clinical activities are excluded. For 2013-14 AHS' administration expense was $444 which represents 3.4% of total expenses of $13,068. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) reports an administration expense financial performance indicator. For 2013-14 AHS' indicator was 3.4% calculated based on administration expense, net of recoveries, of $432 and total expenses, net of recoveries and inclusive of bad debt expense, of $12,838. Administration amounted to $444 compared to a budget of $481 resulting in a positive variance of $37 or 7.7%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $8. The remaining $29 positive variance is mainly due to vacancies throughout the organization, including some hard-to-recruit positions and cost minimization efforts related to travel, supplies and materials. Further contributing to the overall positive variance are various delays in initiatives, including the staff rotation review and optimization initiative. The overall positive variance is partially offset by higher than expected legal and liability expenses and an increase in actuarial estimates for past and future unreported liability claims. Administration costs are unchanged compared to prior year. Information technology are costs pertaining to the provision of services to design, develop, implement and maintain effective and efficient management support systems in the areas of data processing, systems engineering, technical support and systems research and development. This includes clinical and corporate enterprise systems and infrastructure, as well as support of provincial systems such as Netcare. Information technology amounted to $517 compared to a budget of $479 resulting in a negative variance of $38 or 7.9%. The negative variance is mainly due to the replacement of obsolete diagnostic imaging workstations and other end user devices. Included in information technology is the amortization of information systems, which further contributed to the negative variance due mainly to assets having been put into use earlier than anticipated in the budget. Further contributing is the write-down of various projects in progress to focus on fewer priority projects. The overall negative variance is partially offset by lower project costs due to delayed prioritization decisions, cost control strategies, and vacancies.85 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014There is an increase of $62 over prior year mainly due to increased costs related to the replacement of obsolete diagnostic imaging workstations and other end user devices, write-down of various projects in progress to focus on fewer priority projects and increased contract rates, including licensing and software maintenance. Further contributing is the increased amortization expense related to the information technology tangible capital asset purchases in the year. The overall increase in costs is partially offset by the achievement of savings initiatives and cost control strategies. Support services is composed of building maintenance operations (including utilities), materials management (including purchasing, central warehousing, distribution and sterilization), housekeeping, laundry and linen services, patient registration, health records, food services, and emergency preparedness. Support services amounted to $1,895 compared to a budget of $1,999 resulting in a positive variance of $104 or 5.2%. Included in this variance is an unused contingency of $22. The remaining $82 positive variance is mainly due to the budget being higher than required. Further contributing to the overall positive variance is staff vacancies and decreased spending on AI funded Infrastructure Maintenance Projects (IMP). The overall positive variance was partially offset by increased utility costs, building and ground maintenance, and minor equipment purchases. Included in support services is the amortization of facilities and improvements, further offsetting the overall positive variance due mainly to additional costs added to existing AI managed projects including South Health Campus, Foothills Medical Centre, McCaig Tower, and Fort Saskatchewan Hospital. There is an increase of $46 over prior year mainly due to the phased implementation of programs and services at the South Health Campus which fully opened in 2013-14, increased utility costs due to higher natural gas prices, and compensation rate of pay and benefit increases. Further contributing to the overall increase in costs is higher amortization expense associated with higher capitalized asset balances. The overall increase in costs is partially offset by achieved savings initiatives, including reduced minor renovation work, equipment maintenance costs and service contracts compared to the prior year. www.albertahealthservices.ca 86 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014FINANCIAL POSITION The following table summarizes the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position: Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Actual 2014 Actual 2013 Increase (Decrease) Cash and portfolio investments $2,335 $2,100 $235 Tangible capital assets 7,502 7,516 (14) All assets 596 555 41 Total assets $10,433 $10,171 $262 Deferred revenue Unexpended deferred operating revenue $499 $484 $15 Unexpended deferred capital revenue 230 241 (11) Expended deferred capital revenue 6,277 6,235 42 Debt 350 375 (25) All other liabilities 1,750 1,682 68 Total liabilities $9,106 $9,017 $89 Accumulated surplus $1,234 $1,078 $156 Accumulated remeasurement gains and losses 25 10 15 Endowments 68 66 2 Total net assets $1,327 $1,154 $173 Accumulated Surplus Actual 2014 Actual 2013 Increase (Decrease) Unrestricted net assets $266 $83 $183 Reserves for future purposes 87 79 8 Net assets invested in tangible capital assets 881 916 (35) Accumulated surplus $1,234 $1,078 $156 Cash & Portfolio Investments The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows summarizes the sources and uses of cash in 2013-14. AHS receives its base operating funding from AH twice per month. The arrangement allows AHS to manage its operating cash balances effectively to meet its immediate and ongoing liabilities as they become due. The AHS investment portfolio is conservative and highly liquid in nature and allows AHS to react to expected and unexpected cash requirements quickly and efficiently. Focusing on prudent stewardship of funds, AHS monitors its bank balances closely and transfers cash to, or from, the investment portfolio to ensure that cash balances will earn maximum returns until they need to be utilized. The net increase of $235 in the overall cash and portfolio investment balance as compared to the prior year was comprised of a cash outflow of $78 offset by an increase in portfolio investments of $313.87 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Portfolio Composition and Risk Analysis AHS has a responsibility to ensure its funds are invested in a way that promotes the short and long-term sustainability of the organization's operations. The investment philosophy assures the preservation of capital by minimizing exposure to undue risk of loss or impairment while maintaining a reasonable expectation of fair return or appreciation while offsetting the effects of inflation. AHS manages its investment portfolio risk through diversification in various investment vehicles such as treasury bills, federal, provincial and corporate fixed income, and equity pooled funds. The short-term investment strategy is designed to focus on safety and liquidity, while capturing reasonable rates of return. The longer term strategy balances federal and provincial bonds, high quality corporate fixed income holdings and Canadian and Global equity income funds. This strategy protects the original capital while providing reasonable returns with a conservative exposure to more volatile equity markets. The majority of cash and portfolio investments are used to fund operations in the short and medium term. Restrictions The total cash and portfolio investment balance of $2,335 will be used to cover liabilities including accounts payable, deferred operating and capital costs and long-term borrowing obligations, with the exception of $266 representing unrestricted net assets. AHS manages its cash and portfolio investments prudently so that funds are available to meet current and long- term commitments. As at March 31, 2014, the balance is adequate to cover immediate and upcoming obligations as they become due. Tangible Capital Assets The total net book value of tangible capital assets as at March 31, 2014 consists of $5,412 of facilities, $858 of equipment and building service equipment, $725 of work in progress (WIP), $334 of information systems, $122 of land and land improvements, and $51 of leased facilities and improvements. Over the course of the year, several capital projects totalling $383 in WIP were brought into service and capitalized. Notable projects included South Health Campus, Strathcona County Hospital, AHS/Human Resources Pay Consolidation, AH Equipment Upgrades, Chinook Regional Hospital Parking, Grey Nun's Hospital, Bed Reclamation, and Electronic Facilities initiative.Tangible Capital Assets Actual 2014 Actual 2013 Increase (Decrease) Cost $12,992 $12,569 $423 Accumulated amortization 5,490 5,053 437 Net book value $7,502 $7,516 $(14)www.albertahealthservices.ca 88 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Grande Prairie Regional Health Centre Diagnostic Imaging Initiative Provincial Patient Lifts Initiative South Health Campus High Prairie Hospital Access to Health Services Initiative Chinook Regional Hospital Emergency Room/Ambulatory Care Expansion Project eClinician Initiative Medicine Hat Regional Hospital Lloydminster Dr Cooke Continuing Care Centre Personal Health Portal Edson Health Care Centre eCRITICAL Alberta Project Foothills Medical Centre Strathcona Community Hospital Provincial Communicable Diseases Initiative Peter Lougheed Centre Alberta Hospital Edmonton Fort McMurray General Hospital The WIP balance includes infrastructure and information technology capital projects at: At March 31, 2014, AHS has approved capital commitments for purchases of tangible capital assets of $37 for facilities and improvements, $17 for information systems, and $61 for equipment. The capital purchases compared to the annual amortization expense indicates the rate of reinvestment. The reinvestment rate for equipment and information systems was 75% in 2013-14 (2012-13 - 146%). As a result, the estimated remaining useful life for equipment and information systems decreased from 3.7 years in 2012-13 to 3.4 years in 2013-14 (2011-12 - 3.5 years). Financing of Tangible Capital Assets AHS primarily relies on external sources for funding capital expenditures. Except for parkades, new facility purchases, including WIP , of $326 were primarily funded by the Alberta Government. Equipment purchases, including WIP , of $130 were externally funded approximately two-thirds (2012-13 - two-thirds), whereas information system purchases, including WIP , are only externally funded approximately one-third (2012-13 - one-half). A greater portion of information systems purchases were externally funded in 2012-13 due to their inclusion in the South Health Campus and Kaye Edmonton Clinic projects. Expended deferred capital revenue balance represents tangible capital assets purchased for which AHS has an obligation to utilize these for the duration of their economic useful lives. Funding from other government organizations, mainly AI, makes up $5,678 of the $6,277 total balance, while facilities makes up a similar proportion of the total tangible capital assets. Net assets invested in tangible capital assets included in accumulated surplus is $881, representing the amount of unrestricted net assets already used to fund tangible capital assets internally or required to repay debt used to fund tangible capital assets. The majority of the outstanding $350 of debt was used to fund parkades. Resources Available for Future Use Transfers, donations, and fundraising are key sources of revenue for AHS. Through these funds, AHS is able to implement various operating and capital initiatives intended to improve the quality of health care in Alberta. Restricted funding subject to timing and purpose restrictions imposed by funding agencies, is deferred and recognized as revenue when the terms for the use of the funding is met and, when applicable, AHS complies with its communicated use.89 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Unexpended deferred operating revenue During the year, AHS received or accrued $1,426 in restricted funding and spent $1,481 in related expenses. The amounts received or accrued and spent by AHS during the fiscal year pertain primarily to initiatives funded by AH grants related to physician compensation, incremental operating costs of new health facilities, and provision of various drugs at no cost to patients. AHS has $499 available at March 31, 2014 for future use. Unexpended deferred capital revenue During the year, AHS received or accrued $456 in restricted capital funding, including $271 of in-kind revenue from AI transitioned projects, $52 from IMP projects, $38 from AI equipment and systems projects, and $44 from AH projects. The remaining $51 in funding was received from other foundations. AHS incurred $416 in expenditures, including AI expenditures of $310 ($271 of which is in-kind transitioned WIP), $60 was incurred for AH Medical Equipment Replacement Upgrade Program and Information Technology Systems initiatives, and $46 was incurred through various other foundations. AHS transferred $45 in funding to operating initiatives, returned $8 in surplus funds on completed projects back to funding agents, and recognized $2 in unrealized gains on investments. AHS has $230 available at March 31, 2014 for future use. Unrestricted net assets During the year, AHS generated an operating surplus of $156, of which $36 related to internally funded tangible capital asset activities. AHS had $266 of unrestricted net assets and $87 of reserves at March 31, 2014 available for future use.www.albertahealthservices.ca 90 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014FINANCIAL REPORTING, CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY Financial Reporting Alberta Health Services was established under the Regional Health Authorities Act (Alberta), effective April 1, 2009, as a result of the amalgamation of 12 formerly separate health entities in Alberta. The AHS consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS) and the reporting requirements of Alberta Health Financial Directive 12. The chart of accounts that AHS uses to report expenses by program and by object is based on the national standard of CIHI. Detailed site based results are submitted to CIHI annually for analysis and reporting on Canada's health system and the health of Canadians. AHS quarterly and annual financial reports are available at www.albertahealthservices.ca under publications. The Auditor General of Alberta is the appointed auditor of AHS. In addition to expressing an audit opinion on the AHS annual consolidated financial statements, the Auditor General of Alberta also reports to the legislature recommendations related to AHS along with other government entities. The Auditor General of Alberta's reports are available at www.oag.ab.ca under public reports. Financial Control and Accountability An effective, integrated governance model is an essential component in support of improving: The delivery of care and services to Albertans; Support for people who deliver care and services; and The way the organization operates. AHS performance measures are aligned with the Alberta Quality Matrix for Health, a framework that provides a common language, understanding and approach for thinking about quality among health care organizations, professionals and other stakeholders. Appointed in 2013-14, the Official Administrator provides oversight and carries out its risk management mandate primarily through committees which include: Audit and Finance Advisory Committee, Quality Assurance & Patient Safety Advisory Committee, and Human Resources Advisory Committee. The Audit and Finance Advisory Committee has responsibility to assist in fulfilling the financial oversight responsibilities of AHS and in overseeing management's administration of AHS on finance and audit related items. AHS has established an internal audit function with the mandate of providing independent assurance to management and the Official Administrator on AHS operations. The scope of Internal Audit's work is to determine whether AHS' risk management, control and governance processes are adequate and functioning effectively. The Chief Audit Executive is also responsible for coordinating AHS' Enterprise Risk Management policy and processes for identifying, monitoring and reporting risks within the organization.91 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014As a component of the Internal Audit function, AHS has an Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) group which is tasked with ensuring that the financial reporting environment mitigates the risk of material misstatements by establishing a sustainable framework of internal controls over financial reporting. In fulfilling its mandate, ICOFR continues to work on the implementation of its plan to ensure that appropriate internal controls are designed, implemented and documented within AHS. Through the Compliance Coordination Committee, AHS has also implemented a compliance program for its Human Resources, Contracting, Procurement and Supply Management, Information Technology and Finance departments. Future Changes to PSAS PSAS continues to evolve and as such, various exposure drafts have been issued for comment by the Canadian Public Sector Accounting Board which may impact future accounting and disclosure requirements. Additionally, the interpretation and application of PSAS specifically to Government Not-for-Profit Organizations continues to be debated by various stakeholders including auditors and standard setters. AHS continues to actively monitor and assess the impact of any resulting changes made to PSAS. In June 2010, the Public Sector Accounting Board issued PS 3260 - Liability for Contaminated Sites. This accounting standard is effective for fiscal years starting on or after April 1, 2014. Contaminated sites are a result of contamination being introduced into air, soil, water or sediment of a chemical, organic, or radioactive material, or live organism that exceeds an environmental standard. AHS would be required to recognize a liability related to the remediation of such contaminated site subject to certain recognition criteria. Management does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. www.albertahealthservices.ca 92 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014THREE YEAR RESULTS Consolidated Statement of Operations Years Ended March 31 2014 2013 12012 1 Revenue: Alberta Health transfers Base operating grant $10,496 $10,214 $9,634 Other operating grants 1,257 1,068 826 Capital grants 87 106 121 Other government transfers 387 393 346 Fees and charges 432 412 416 Ancillary operations 126 118 122 Donations, fundraising, and non- government grants 155 144 147 Investment and other income 284 219 222 Total Revenue 13,224 12,674 11,834 Expenses: Inpatient acute nursing outpatient services 1,510 1,440 1,352 Facility-based continuing care services 896 906 878 Ambulance services 443 409 395 Community-based care 1,040 955 865 Home care 506 507 453 Diagnostic and therapeutic services 2,193 2,075 1,961 Promotion, prevention and protection services 333 331 308 Research and education 222 225 218 Administration 444 444 397 Information technology 517 455 435 Support services 1,895 1,849 1,724 $106 $87 Schedule of Expenses by Object Years Ended March 31 2014 2013 2012 Salaries and benefits $7,049 $6,753 $6,161 Contracts with health service providers 2,258 2,166 2,018 Contracts under the Health Care Protection Act 19 17 18 Drugs and gases 427 388 388 Medical and surgical supplies 399 392 360 Other contracted services 1,090 1,099 1,056 Expenses $13,068 $12,568 $11,747 1 Certain 2013 and 2012 amounts have been reclassified to conform to 2014 presentation.93 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DISCLOSURE The FSD&A includes forward-looking statements and information about the organization's outlook, direction, operations and future financial results that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. As a consequence, actual results in the future may differ materially from any conclusion, forecast or projection in such forward-looking statements. Therefore, forward-looking statements should be considered carefully and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Outlook Long-Term Spending Trends, Cost Drivers and Sustainability The growth rate in AHS' expenses slowed from 7% in 2012-13 to 4% in 2013-14. This has been accomplished through focused efforts to manage labour costs, non-clinical contracted services, and administration and overhead costs. For 2014-15 and future years, significant cost pressures are anticipated as a result of population growth, aging and morbidity, increasing utilization of services, and increases in unit costs including compensation increases and inflation. To achieve financial sustainability, AHS will enhance quality, manage cost growth and ensure value for money. This will include initiatives to manage unit costs, achieve operational efficiencies and productivity improvements, and optimize service delivery. In addition, there will be focused efforts to strengthen community and primary health care to deliver care in the most appropriate setting. Key Risks AHS actively monitors and manages risks that may impact the achievement of its strategic directions. The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) priority risk areas for AHS are: Sustainable Workforce Appropriateness of Care Risk mitigation plans are being developed for each priority risk area to guide risk management activities. In addition to the priority risk areas, there are financial risks. AHS will actively manage these risks and implement mitigation strategies. These risks include: Salaries and benefits account for a significant proportion of AHS' expenses. Collective agreements with the United Nurses of Alberta, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees (General Support Services) and the Health Sciences Association of Alberta are all under negotiation. Non-compensation costs may be higher than anticipated due to increased cost inflation in areas such as drugs, medical and surgical supplies and contracted services. AHS is working on initiatives to mitigate cost increases, including contract reviews and bulk purchasing opportunities, along with work by Strategic Clinical Networks to promote evidence informed standards.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standards and the financial directives issued by Alberta Health, and of necessity include some amounts based on estimates and judgment. To discharge its responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of financial reporting, management maintains systems of financial management and internal control which give consideration to costs, benefits and risks that are designed to: p rovide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly authorized, executed in accordance with prescribed legislation and regulations, and properly recorded so as to maintain accountability of public money; safeguard the assets and properties of the Province under Alberta Health Services' administration Alberta Health Services carries out its responsibility for the consolidated financial statements through the Audit and Financ e Advisory Commit tee. This Committee meets with management and the Auditor General of Alberta to review financial matters, and recommends the consolidated financial statements to the Alberta Health Services Official Administrator for approval upon finalization of the audit . The Auditor General of Alberta has free access to the Audit and Finance Advisory Committee. The Auditor General of Alberta provides an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements. His examination is conducted in accordance with Canadian Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and includes tests and procedures which allow him to report on the fairness of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management.

Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair pr esentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards, and for su ch internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated fina ncial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility My responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated fina ncial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of acco unting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolid ated financial statements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion. Opinion In my opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alberta Health Services as at March 31, 20 14, and the results of its operations, its remeasurement gains and losses, and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards.

Pursuant to Section 5 of the Regional Health Authorities Act (Alberta) , AHS is responsible in Alberta to: promot e and protect the health of the population in the health region and work toward the prevention of disease and injury; assess on an ongoing basis the health needs of the health region; determine priorities in the provision of health services in the health region and allocat e resources accordingly; ensur e that reasonable access to quality health services is provided in and through the health region; and promot e the provision of health services in a manner that is responsive to the needs of individuals and communities and supports the integration of services and facilities in the health region. Additionally, AHS is accountable to the Mini ster of Health (the Minister) for the delivery and operation of the public health system. The AHS consolidated financial statements include the revenue and expenses associated with its responsibilities. These consolidated financial statements do not reflect the complete costs of provincial health care. For example, the Department of Health is responsible for paying most physician fees. For a complete picture of the costs of provincial healthcare, readers should consult the c onsolidated f inancial statements of the Government of Alberta. AHS and its contracted health service providers deliver health services at facilities and sites grouped in the following areas: addiction treatment, community mental health, standalone psychiatric facilities, acute care hospitals, sub-acute care in auxiliary hospitals, long-term care, palliative care, supportive living, cancer care, community ambulatory care centres and urgent care centres. AHS is exempt from the payment of income taxes under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (a) Basis of Presentation AHS operates as a Government Not -for-Profit Organization. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS) and the financial directives issued by A lberta Health (AH). These financial statements have been pr epared on a consolidated basis and include the following entities : (i) Controlled Entities The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the following entities which are controlled by AHS as at March 31, 2014: Wholly Owned Subsidiaries: Calgary Laboratory Services Ltd. (CLS), who provides medical diagnostic services in Calgary and southern Alberta. Capital Care Group Inc. who manages continuing care programs and facilities in the Edmonton area. Carewest, who manages continuing care programs and facilities in the Calgary area. 102 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) Foundations and Trusts : Airdrie Health Foundation Alberta Cancer Foundation (ACF) Bassano and District Health Foundation Bow Island and District Health Foundation Brooks and District Health Foundation Calgary Health Trust (CHT) Canmore and Area Health Care Foundation Capital Care Charitable Trust Cardston and District Health Foundation Claresholm and District Health Foundation Crowsnest Pass Health Foundation David Thompson Health Trust Fort Macleod and District Health Foundation Fort Saska tchewan Community Hospital Foundation Grande Cache Hospital Foundation Grimshaw/Berwyn Hospital Foundation Jasper Health Care Foundation Lacombe Hospital and Care Centre Foundation Medicine Hat and District Health Foundation Mental Health Foundation North County Health Foundation Oyen and District Health Care Foundation Peace River and District Health Foundation Ponoka and District Health Foundation Stettler Health Services Foundation Strathcona Community Hospital Foundation Tofield and Area Health Services Foundation Viking Health Foundation Vulcan County Health and Wellness Foundation Windy Slopes Health Foundation The following foundations are also considered controlled, but are in the process of being wound-up or are considered to be inactive: Central Peace Hospital Foundation Lakeland Regional Health Authority Manning Community Health Centre Foundation McLennan Community Health Care Foundation Peace Health Region Foundation Vermillion and Region Health and Wellness Foundatio n Provincial Health Authorities of Alberta Liability and Property Insurance Plan (LPIP): AHS consolidates its interest in the LPIP. AHS has the majority of representation on the LPIP's governance board and is therefore considered to control the LPIP. The main purpose of the LPIP is to share the risks of general and professional liability to lessen the impact on any one subscriber. The LPIP is exempt from the payment of income tax but is subject to the Alberta provincial premium tax. Other : Queen Elizabeth II Hospital Child Care Centre (ii) Government Partnerships AHS uses the proportionate consolidation method to account for its 30% interest in the HUTV Limited Partnership (HUTV) with David Chittick Management Ltd, its 50% interest in the Northern Alberta Clinical Trials Centre (NACTRC) partnership with the University of Alberta, and its 50% interest in the Primary Care Network (PCN) government partnerships with physician groups (Note 23). AHS has joint control with various physician groups over PCNs. AHS entered into local primary care initiative agreements to jointly manage and operate the delivery of primary care services, to achieve the PCN business plan objectives, and to contract and hold property interests required in the delivery of PCN services. 103 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) The following PCNs are included in these consolidated financial statements on a proportionate basis : Alberta Heartland Primary Care Network Aspen (Athabasca) Primary Care Network Big Country Primary Care Network Bonnyville Primary Care Network Bow Valley Primary Care Network Calgary Foothills Primary Care Network Calgary Rural Primary Care Network Calgary West Central Primary Care Network Camrose Primary Care Network Chinook Primary Care Network Cold Lake Primary Care Network Drayt on Valley Primary Care Network Edmonton North Primary Care Network Edmonton Oliver Primary Care Network Edmonton Southside Primary Care Network Edmonton West Primary Care Network Grande Cache Primary Care Network Grande Prairie Primary Care Network Highland Primary Care Network Kalyna Country (Vegreville /Vermillion ) Primary Care Network Lakeland (St. Paul/Aspen) Primary Care Network Leduc Beaumont Devon Primary Care Network Lloydminster Primary Care Network McLeod River Primary Care Network Mosaic Primary Care Network Northwest Primary Care Network Palliser Primary Care Network Peace Region Primary Care Network Peaks to Prairies Primary Care Network Provost /Consort Primary Care Network Red Deer Primary Care Network Rocky Mountain House Primary Care Network Sexsmith/Spirit River Primary Care Network Sherwood Park - Strathcona County Primary Care Network South Calgary Primary Care Network St. Albert & Sturgeon Primary Care Network Wainwright Primary Care Network West Peace Primary Care Net work WestView Primary Care Network Wetaskiwin Primary Care Network Wolf Creek Primary Care Network Wood Buffalo Primary Care Network (iii) Other These consolidated financial statements include the payments to voluntary and private organizations under contract to provide health services in the Province of Alberta (Note 9). Also included are certain tangible capital assets owned by AHS but operated by cont racted health service providers. Other operations not funded by AHS and other assets and liabilities of the contracted health service providers are not included in these consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements also do not include the trust funds administered on behalf of others (Note 25). 104 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) (b) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized in the period in which the transactions or events occur that give rise to the revenue as described below. All revenue is recorded on an accrual basis, except when the accrual cannot be determined within a reasonable degree of certainty or when estimation is impracticable. (i) Government Grants Transfers from AH, other governments , and other government entities are referred to as government grants. Government grants are recorded as deferred revenue if the terms for use of the grant, or the terms along with AHS' actions and communications as to the use of the grant, create a liability. These grants are recognized as revenue as the terms are met and, when applicable, AHS co mplies with its communicated use of the grant. All unrealized gains and losses attributable to these grants are recognized as an increase or decrease in deferred revenue. All other government grants without terms for the use of the grant are recorded and recognized as revenue when AHS is eligible to receive the funds. (ii) Donations , Fundraising , and Non-G overnment G rants Donations , fundraising , and non-government grants are received from individuals, corporations, and other not - for-profit organizations. Donations, fundraising , and non- government grants may be unrestricted or externally restricted for operating or capital purposes . Unrestricted donations, fundraising, and non- government grants are recorded as revenue in the year received or in the year the funds are committed to AHS if the amount can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably assured . Externally restricted donations, fundraising, and non-government grants are recorded as deferred revenue if the terms for their use, or the term s along with AHS' actions and communications as to their use create a liability. These resources are recognized as revenue as the terms are met and, when applicable, AHS complies with its communicated use. All unrealized gains and losses attributable to externally restricted donations, fundraising and non-government grants are recognized as an increase or decrease in deferred revenue. In-kind donations of services and materials are recorded at fair value when such value can reasonably be determined. While volunteers contribute a significant amount of time each year to assist AHS , the value of their services is not recognized as revenue and expenses in the consolidated financial statements because fair value cannot be reasonably determined. (iii) Grants and Donations of or for Land AHS records grants and donations to buy land as a liability when received and recognizes as revenue when AHS buys the land. AHS recognizes in-kind contributions of land as revenue at the fair value of the land when a fair value can be reasonably determined. When AHS cannot determine the fair value, it records such in- kind contributions at nominal value. (iv) Endowments Donations, fundraising, government grants, and non- government grants that must be maintained in perpetuity are recognized as a direct increase in endowment net assets when received or receivable. All unrealized gains and losses attributable to endowments are recognized as an increase or decrease in deferred revenue. 105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) Expendable realized gains and losses attributable to endowments are recognized as increases or decreases in deferred revenue when received or receivable and are subsequently recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations when terms of use are met, as stipulated by the donors. Realized investment gains for endowment capital preservation purposes are recognized as a direct increase in endowment net assets when received or receivable. (v) Fees and Charges, Ancillary Operation, and Other Income Fees and charges, ancillary operations, and other income are recognized in the period that goods are delivered or services are provided. Cash received for which goods or services have not been provided by year end is recorded as deferred revenue. (vi) Investment I ncome Investment income includes dividend and interest income, and realized gains or losses on the sale of portfolio investments. Unrealized gains and losses on portfolio investments that are not from restricted grants or donations are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Accumulated Remeasurement Gains and Losses until the related investments are sold. Once realized, these gains or losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations except for restricted investment income which is recognized as revenue in the period the related expenses are incurred or the terms of use are met. (c) Expenses The key elements of AHS' expense recognition policy are: (i) Directly incurred expenses are reported on an accrual basis. The cost of all goods consumed and services received during the year are expensed. Interest expense includes debt sourcing costs . Expenses include grants and transfers under shared cost agreements. Grants and transfers are recorded as expenses when the transfer is authorized and eligibility criteria have been met by the recipient. (ii) Expenses incurred include contracted health services provided by other entities in support of AHS' responsibilities and operations and are disclosed in Note 9. (d) Financial Instruments All of AHS' financial assets and liabilities are initially recorded at their fair value. The following table identifies AHS' financial assets and liabilities and identifies how they are subsequently measured: Financial Assets and Liabilities Subsequent Measurement and Recognition Cash and cash equivalents and portfolio investments Measured at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Accumulated Remeasurement Gains and Losses, accounts payable , or deferred revenue until realized at which time the cumulative changes in fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and debt Measured at cost or amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. 106 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) PSAS requires portfolio investments in equity instruments to be recorded under the fair value category and AHS may choose to record other financial assets under the fair value category if there is an investment strategy to evaluate the performance of a group of these financial assets on a fair value basis. AHS has elected to record its money market securities and fixed income securities at fair value. The three levels of information that may be used to measure fair value are: Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted mar ket prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - Observable or corroborated inputs, other than level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. AHS measures and recognizes embedded derivatives separately from the host contract when the economic characteristics and risk of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, when it meets the definition of a derivative and when the entire contract is not measured at fair value. Embedded derivatives are recorded at fair value. For the year ended March 31, 2014 , AHS has no embedded derivatives that require separation from the host contract. All financial assets are assessed for impairment on an annual basis. When a decline is determined to be other than temporary, the amount of the loss is reported as a realized loss on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Transaction costs associated with the acquisition and disposal of cash and cash equivalents and portfolio investments are expensed as incurred. Investment management fees are expensed as incurred. The purchase and sale of cash and cash equivalents and portfolio investments are accounted for using trade-date accounting. (e) Inventories For Consumption Inventories for consumption or distribution at no charge are valued at lower of cost (defined as moving average cost) and current replacement value. (f) Tangible Capital Assets Tangible capital assets and work in progress are recorded at cost, which includes amounts that are directly related to the acquisition, design, construction, development , improvement , or betterment of the assets. Cost includes overhead directly attributable to construction and development including interest costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the asset. Contributed t angible capital assets and work in progress acquired from other government organizations and other entities are recorded at the ir fair value on the date of donation. When AHS cannot determine the fair value, in-kind contributions are recorded at a nominal value. Costs incurred by Alberta Infrastructure (AI) to build tangible capital assets on behalf of AHS are recorded by AHS as work in progress and expended deferred capital revenue as AI incurs costs. Works of art, historical treasures, and collections are expensed when purchased or contributed and not recognized in tangible capital assets. The threshold for capitalizing new systems development is $250 and major system enhancements is $100. The threshold for all other tangible capital assets is $5. All land is capitalized. 107 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) The cost less residual value of t angible capital assets , excluding land, is amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight -line basis as follows: Useful Life Facilities and improvements 10-40 years Equipment 2-20 years Information systems 3-5 years Leased vehicles, facilities and improvements T erm of lease Building service equipment 5-40 years Land improvements 5-40 year s Work in progress, which includes facility and improvement projects and development of information systems, is not amortized until after a project is substantially complete and the assets are put into service . Leases transferring substantially all benefits and risks of tangible capital asset ownership are reported as tangible capital asset acquisitions financed by long-term obligations. These capital lease obligations are recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments excluding executor y costs (e.g. insurance, maint enance costs, etc.). The discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the lower of AHS' rate for incremental borrowing or the interest rate implicit in the lease. Note 18(c) provides a schedule of repayments and amount of interest on the leases. Tangible capital assets are written down when conditions indicate that they no longer contribute to AHS' ability to provide goods and services, or when the value of future economic benefits associated with the tangible capital asse ts are less than their net book value. The net write-downs are accounted for as expenses in the C onsolidated Statement of Operations. Write-downs are not reversed. (g) Employee Future Benefits (i) Registered Benefit Pension Plan s AHS participates in the following registered defined benefit pension plans: the Local Authorities Pension Plan (LAPP) and the Management Employees Pension Plan (MEPP). These multi -employer public sector defined benefit plans provide pensions for participants based on years of service and final average earnings. Benefits for post -1991 service payable under these plans are limited by the Income Tax Act (Canada). The President of Alberta Treasury Board and Minister of Finance is the legal trustee and administrator of the plans. The Department of Treasury Board and Finance as a co -sponsor accounts for its share of obligations for these pension plans relating to former and current employees of all of the organizations included in the Government of Alberta (GOA) consolidated reporting entity on a defined benefit basis. As a participating government organization , AHS accounts for these plans on a defined contribution basis. Accordingly, the pension expense recorded for these plans in these consolidated financial statements is comprised of the employer contributions that AHS is required to pay for its employees during the fiscal year , which are calculated based on actuarially pre-determined amounts that are expected to provide the plan's future benefits. (ii) Other Defined Contribution Pension Plans AHS sponsors Group Registered Retirement Savings Plans (GRRSPs) for certain employee groups. Under the GRRSPs, AHS matches a certain percentage of any contribution made by plan participants up to certain limits. AHS also sponsors a defined contribution pen sion plan for certain employee groups where the employee and employer each contribute specified percentages of pensionable earnings. 108 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) (iii) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs) AHS sponsors SERPs which are funded and ha s three Retirement Compensation Arrangements (RCA) for these plans. These plans cover certain employees and supplement the benefits under AHS' registered plans that are limited by the Income Tax Act (Canada) . Each plan was closed to new entrants effective April 1, 2009. A majority of the SERPs are final average plans; however, certain participant groups have their benefits determined on a career average basis. Also, some participant groups receive post -retirement indexing similar to the benefits provided under the registered defined benefit pension plans , while others receive non-indexed benefits. Due to Income Tax Act (Canada) requirements, the SERPs are subject to the RCA rules; therefore approximately half the assets are held in a non-interest bearing Refundable Tax Account with the Canada Revenue Agency. The remaining assets of the SERPs are invested in a combination of Canadian equities and Canadian fixed income securities . The obligations and costs of these benefits are determined annually through an actuarial valuation as at March 31 using the projected benefit method pro-rated on service . AHS use s a discount rate based on plan asset earnings to calculate the accrued benefit obligation. The net retirement benefit cost of SERPs reported in these consolidated financial statements is comprised of the retirement benefits expense and the retirement benefits interest expense. The key components of retirement benefits expense include the current period benefit cost, cost of any plan amendments including related net actuarial gains or losses incurred in the period, gains and losses from any plan settlements or curtailments incurred in the period, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Retirement benefit costs are not cash payments in the period but are the period expense for rights to future compensation . Costs shown reflect the total estimated cost to provide annual pension income over an actuarially determined post employment period. SERP provides future pension benefits to participants based on years of service and earnings. The cost of these benefits is actuarially determined using the projected benefit method pro-rated on services, a market interest rate, and management's best estimate of expected costs and the period of benefit coverage. The retirement benefits interest expense is net of the interest cost on the accrued benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets. The actuarial gains and losses that arise are accounted for in accordance with PSAS whereby AHS amortizes actuarial gains and losses from the liability or asset over the average remaining service life of the related employee group. Prior period service costs arising from plan amendments are recognized in the period of the plan amendment. When an employee's accrued benefit obligation is fully discharged, all unrecognized amounts associated with that employee are fully recognized in the net retirement benefit cost in the following year. In the case of a curtailment event which results in the elimination for a significant number of active employees of the right to earn defined benefits for their future services, a curtailment gain or loss is recorded. Gains and losses determined upon a cur tailment are accounted for in the period of the curtailment. (iv) Supplemental Pension Plan (SPP) Subsequent to April 1, 2009, staff eligible for SERP are enrolled in a defined contribution SPP. Similar to the SERP, the SPP supplements the benefits under AHS registered plans that are limited by the Income Tax Act (Canada). AHS contributes a certain percentage of an eligible employee's pensionable earnings, excluding pay at risk, if any, in excess of the limits of the Income Tax Act (Canada). This plan provides participants with an account balance at retirement based on the contributions made to the plan and investment income earned on the contributions based on investment decisions made by the participant. 109 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) (v) Sick Leave Liability Sick leave benefits accumulate with employee s' service and are provided by AHS to certain employee groups of AHS , as defined by employment agreements, to cover illness related absences that are outside of short -term and long -term disability coverage. Benefit amounts are determined and accumulate with reference to employees' final earnings at the time they are paid out. The cost of the accumulating non-vesting sick leave benefits is expensed as the benefits are earned. AHS accrues its liabilities for accumulating non-vesting sick leave benefits but does not record a liability for replenishing sick leave benefits as these are renewed annually . The AHS sick leave liability is based on an actuarial evaluation as at March 31, 2012 , and extrapolated for the years ending March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014. The next required actuarial valuation will be as of March 31, 2015. The accumulating non-vesting sick leave liability is actuarially determined using the projected benefit method prorated on service and management's best estimates of expected discount rate, inflation, rate of compensat ion increase, termination and retirement rates , and mortality. The liability associated with these benefits is calculated as the present value of expected future payments pro-rated for service. Any resulting net actuarial gain (loss) is deferred and amortized on a straight -line basis over the expected average remaining service life of the related employee groups. (vi) Other Benefits AHS provides its employees with basic life, accidental death and dismemberment, short -term disability, long- term disability, extended health, dental , and vision benefits through benefits carriers. AHS fully accrues its obligations for employee non- pension future benefits. (h) Net Assets Net assets represent the difference between the carrying value of assets held by AHS and its liabilities. PSAS requires a \"net debt\" presentation for the statement of financial position in the summary financial statements of government. Net debt presentation reports the difference between financial assets and liabilities as \"net debt\" or \"net financial assets\" as an indicator of the future revenue required to pay for past transactions and event s. AHS operates within the government reporting entity, and does not finance all of its expenditures by independently raising revenue. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statement s do not report a net debt indicator . (i) Measurement Uncertainty The consolidated financial statements, by their nature, contain estimates and are subject to m easurement uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty exists when there is a variance between the recognized or disclosed amount and another reasonably possible amount. The amounts recorded for amortization of tangible capital assets is based on the estimated useful life of the related assets while the recognition of expended deferred capital revenue depends on when the terms for the use of the funding are met and, when applicable, AHS complies with its communicated use of the funding. The amounts recorded for employee future benefits are based on estimated future cash flows. The provision for unpaid claims, allowance for doubtful accounts and accrued liabilities are subject to significant management estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually. Actual results could differ from the estimates determined by management in these consolidated financial statements, and these differences, which may be material, could require adjustment in subsequent reporting periods. The establishment of the provision for unpaid claims relies on the judgment and opinions of many individuals ; historical precedent and trends; prevailing legal, economic, and social and regulatory trends; and expectation as to future developments. The process of determining the provision necessarily involves risks that the actual results will deviate perhaps materially from the best estimates made. 110 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Reporting Practices (continued) (j) Reserves Certain amounts, as approved by the Official Administrator , are set aside in accumulated surplus for future operating and capital purposes. Transfer s to or from reserves are an adjustment to the respective re serve when approved. (k) Future Accounting Changes In June 2010 the Public Sector Accounting Board issued PS 3260 - Liability for Contaminated Sites , which specifically relates to sites no longer in productive use. This accounting standard is effective for fiscal years starting on or after April 1, 2014. Contaminated sites are a result of contamination being introduced into air, soil, water or sediment of a chemical, organic or radioactive material or live organism that exceeds an environmental standard. AHS would be required to recognize a liability related to the remediation of such contaminated sites subject to certain recognition criteria. Management does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 3 Budget The AHS Health Plan and Business Plan 2013-16 , which included the 201 3-14 annual budget , was approved by the members of the former AHS Board on April 8, 2013 and submitted to the Minister . In 2013-14, AHS reclassified the following programs in its budget to be consistent with the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) definitions : (i) $40,000 related to community cancer clinics and outpatient cancer drugs were reclassified from community - based care to emergency and other outpatient services. (ii) $15,000 related to midwifery was reclassified from emergency and other outpatient services to community - based care.

The direct AHS f unding provided and the associated allocation of expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is as follows: 113 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 9 Contracts with Health Service Providers (continued) 2014 2013 Voluntary health service providers $ 1,320,027 $ 1,300,032 Private health service providers 938,015 866,237 Total direct AHS funding $ 2,258,042 $ 2,166,269 2014 2013 Inpatient acute nursing services $ 294,230 $ 286,308 Emergency and other outpatient services 97,049 87,787 Facility -based continuing care services 568,462 543,821 Ambulance services 165,451 153,199 Community -based care 432,470 care 169,358 Diagnostic and therapeutic services 325,307 Promotion, prevention , and protection services 9,911 7,886 and education 1,291 6,106 Administration (Note 7) 58,780 58,950 Information technology 2,235 385 Support services (Note 8) 116,496 113,808 Total allocated expenses $ 2,258,042 $ 2,166,269 Note 10 Financial Instruments AHS is exposed to a variety of financial risks associated with the entity's financial instruments. These financial risks include market risk , price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. (a) Market Risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact as a consequen ce of market movements such as interest rate s, currency rates , and other price changes. In order to earn financial returns at an acceptable level of market risk, each of the investment policies have established a maximum asset mix. The AHS Investment Bylaw has established maximum asset mix ranges of 0% to 100% for cash and money market securities, 0% to 80% for fixed income securities, and 0% to 40% for equities. The ACF Investment Policy has established maximum asset mix policy of 0% to 10% for money market securities, 30% to 60% for fixed incom e securities, and 30% to 70% for equities. The LPIP Investment Policy has established maximum asset mix ranges of 80% to 87% for cash and fixed income securities, 10% to 15% for equities, and 3% to 5% for real estate. The CHT Statement of Investment Policies and Goals has established a maximum asset mix policy of 30% to 70% for fixed income securities and 30% to 70% for equities. Risk is reduced under all of the investment policies through asset class diversification, diversification within each asset class, and portfolio quality constraints. 114 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 10 Financial Instruments (continued) (b) Price risk Price risk relates to the possibility that equity investments will change in fair value due to future fluctuations in market prices caused by factors specific to an individual equity investment or other factors affecting all equities traded in the market. AHS is exposed to price risk associated with the underlying equity investments held in investment funds. If equity market indices (S&P/TSX, S&P%, S&P1500 and MSCI ACWI and their sectors) declined by 10%, and all other variables are held constant, the potential loss in fair value to AHS would be approximately 2.30% of total investments (2013 - 1.50%). A 10% change in market value relating to equity securities would have increased or decreased fair value by approximately $4 1,042 (2013 - $ 21,329). (c) Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in the market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may have an effect on the cash flows associated with some financial assets and liabilities , known as cash flow risk, and on the fair value of other financial assets or liabilities, known as price risk. AHS manages the interest rate risk exposure of its fixed income investments by management of average duration and laddered maturity dates. AHS is exposed to interest rate risk through its investments in fixed income securities with both fixed and floating interest rates. AHS has fixed interest rate loans for all debt thereby mitigating interest rate risk from rate fluctuations over the term of the outstanding debt. The fair value of fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates but the related future cash flows will not change. A 1% change in market yield relating to fixed income securities would have increased or decreased fair value by approximately $41,733 (2013 - $34,661). Portfolio investments include fixed income securities, such as bonds, and have an average effective yield of 2.20% (2013 - 1.79%) per year maturing between 2014 and 2053 . The securities have the following average maturity structure: 2014 2013 1 - 5 years 78% 81% 6 - 10 years 11% 17% Over 10 years 11% 2% Asset Class < 1 year 1-5 years > 5 years Average Effective Market Yield Interest bearing securities 1.55% 1.87% 3.48% 2.20% (d) Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of investments denominated in foreign currencies is translated into Canadian dollars using the reporting date exchange rate. AHS is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on its cash and investment s balances denominated in foreign currencies. During the year these fluctuations were not significant. Foreign currency risk is managed by the fact that the investment policies limit non-Canadian equities to a maximum of 10% to 45 % of the total investment portfolio, depending on the policy. A t March 31, 2014 , investments in non-Canadian equities represented 5.40% (March 31, 2013 - 1.58%) of total portfolio investments. 115 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 10 Financial Instruments (continued) (e) Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the failure of a counterparty to fully honour its financial obligations. The credit quality of financial assets is generally assessed by reference to external credit ratings. Credit risk can also lead to losses when issuers and debtors are downgraded by credit rating agencies. All of the investment policies restrict the types and proportions of eligible investments, thus mitigating AHS' exposure to credit risk. Accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts receivable from AH, other Alberta government reporting entities , patients, other provinces and territories , Workers' Compensation Board, and federal government . AHS periodically reviews the collectability of its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance based on its best estimate of potentially uncollectible am ounts. Under the AHS Investment Bylaw , money market securities are limited to a rating of R1 or equivalent or higher and no more than 10% may be invested in any one issuer. Investments in corporate bonds are limited to BBB or equivalent rated bonds or higher and no more than 40% of the total fixed income securities. Investments in debt and equity of any one issuer are limited to 5% of the issuer's total debt and equity. Short selling is not permitted. The ACF Investment Policy limits the overall rating of all fixed income instruments to at least an A rating, and no more than 10% of publically traded equities may be invested in any one issuer. The LPIP Investment Policy limits money market securities to a rating of R1 or equivalent or higher and no more than 10% may be invested in any one issuer unless guaranteed by the Government of Canada or a Canadian province. Investments in corporate bonds are limited to BBB or equivalent rated bonds or higher. Investments in debt and equity of any one issuer are limited to 10% of total equities. The CHT Statement of Investment Policies and Goals limits the overall rating of fixed income securities to BBB or equivalent or higher and no more than 10% of fixed income securities or equities may be invested in any one i ssuer. The following table summarizes AHS' investment in debt securities by counterparty credit rating at March 31, 2014. Credit Rating 2014 2013 Investment Grade (AAA to BBB -) 94% 94% 100% 100% (f) Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that AHS will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivery of cash or another financial asset. Liquidity requirements of AHS are met through funding in advance by AH, income generated from investments, and by investing in liquid assets, such as money market investments, equities, and bonds, traded in an active market that are easily sold and converted to cash. 116 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 11 Cash and Cash Equivalents 2014 2013 Cash $ 186,373 $ 165,602 Money market securities less than 90 days 419,697 519,002 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 606,070 $ 684,604 Cash is comprised of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short -term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short -term commitments rather than for investment purposes. Cash and cash equivalents include money market securities which are comprised of Government of Canada treasury bills maturing June 2014 and bearing interest at an average yield of 0.97% at March 31, 2014 (March 31, 2013 - 0.95%).

AHS is not responsible for future funding of the plan deficit other than through contribution increases. A s AHS is exposed to the risk of contribution rate increases, the following disclosure is provided to explain this risk. The LAPP provides for a pension of 1.4% for each year of pensionable service based on the average salary of the highest five consecutive years up to the average Canada Pension Plan's Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) over the same five consecutive year period and 2.0% on the excess, subject to the maximum pension benefit limit allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). The maximum pensionable service allowable under the plan is 35 years. The contribution rates were reviewed by the LAPP Board of Trustees in 201 3 and are to be reviewed at least once every three years based on a report prepared by LAPP's actuary. AHS and its employees made the following contributions: Calendar 2013 Calendar 2012 Employer Employees Employer Employees $483,270 $442,720 $435,992 $398,564 10.43 % of pensionable earnings up the YMPE and 14.47 % of the excess 9.43% of pensionable earnings up to the YMPE and 13.47 % of the excess 9.91% of pensionable earnings up to the YMPE and 13.74% of the excess 8.91% of pensionable earnings up to the YMPE and 12.74% of the excess AHS contributed $483,270 (2012 - $435, 992) of the LAPP's total employer contributions of $ 1,076,067 from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 (December 31, 2012 - $ 1,012,225). (ii) LAPP Deficit An actuarial valuation of the LAPP was carried out as at December 31, 2012 by Mercer (Canada) Limited and results were then extrapolated to December 31, 2013. LAPP's net assets available for benefits divided by LAPP's pension obligation shows that the LAPP is 85 % (2012 - 82 %) funded.

(d) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs) As at March 31, 2014 an accrued benefit liability of $1,242 is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (2013 - $1,635). AHS sponsors SERPs which are funded and has three RCAs for these plans. Under the terms of the SERPs, participants will receive retirement benefits that supplement the benefits under AHS' registered plans that are limited by the Income Tax Act (Canada).

AHS has contracted for services in the year ending March 31, 2015 similar to those provided by these providers in 2013-14. (d) Contingent Liabilities AHS is subject to legal claims during its normal course of business. AHS records a liability when the assessment of a claim indicates that a future event is likely to confirm that an asset had been impaired or a liability incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the contingent loss can be reasonably estimated. Accruals have been made in specific instances where it is likely that losses will be incurred based on a reasonable estimate. As at March 31 , 2014, accruals have been recorded as part of the provision for unpaid claims (Note 15). Included in this accrual are claims in which AHS has been jointly named with the Minister. The accrual provided for these claims under the provision for unpaid claims represents AHS' portion of the liability. AHS has been named in 204 legal claims ( 2013 - 1 87 claims) related to conditions in existence at March 31, 2014 where the occurrence of a future event confirming a contingent loss is not reasonably determinable. Of these, 172 claims have $32 1,813 in specified amounts and 32 have no specified amounts ( 2013 - 1 72 claims with $ 317,929 of specified claims and 15 claims with no specified amounts). The resolution of indeterminable claims may result in a liability, if any, that may be significantly lower than the claimed amount. Alberta Health Services has been named as a co-defendant, along with the G OA, in a certified Class Action with regard to increases to long-term accommodation charges, which were increased by Alberta Government regulations enacted on and after August 1, 2003. The amount of the Claim has not yet been specified, but it has been estimated to be between $100,000 and $175,000 per year, based on the amount of the increases in accommodation charges. Note 22 Related Parties Transactions with the following related parties are considered to be in the normal course of operations. Amounts due to or from the related parties and the recorded amounts of the transactions are included within these consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated. The Minister controls AHS through the appointment of the Official Administrator and the former AHS Board by appointing all its members. The viability of AHS' operations depends on transfers from the Ministry. Transactions between AHS and AH are reported and disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements , and are therefore excluded from the table below. AHS shares a common relationship and is considered to be a related party with those entities consolidated or included on a modified equity basis in the GOA consolidated financial statements. Transactions in the normal course of operations between AHS and the other ministries are recorded at their exchange amount as follows: 132 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (thousands of dollars) Note 2 2 Related Parties (continued) Revenue Expenses 2014 2013 2014 2013 Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education (i) $ 49,686 $ 41,138 $ 114,067 $ 124,899 Ministry of Infrastructure 335 137 Other ministries 42,446 39,401 26,887 25,884 for the year $ 126,320 $ 147,427 $ 141,289 $ 150,920 Receivable from Payable to 2014 2013 2014 2013 Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education (i) $ 9,756 $ 16,731 $ 19,196 $ 24,425 Ministry of Infrastructure (ii) 22,234 975 - Other ministries (iii) 27,673 3,859 332,938 351,514 Balance, end of year $ 59,663 $ 60,882 $ 353,109 $ 375,939 (i) Most of AHS transactions with the Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education relate to initiatives with the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary. These initiatives include teaching, research , and program delivery. A number of physicians are employed by either AHS or the universities but perform services for both. Due to proximity of locations, some initiatives result in sharing physical space and support services. The revenue and expense transactions are a result of grants provided from one to the other and recoveries of shared cost s. (ii) The transactions with the Ministry of Infrastructure relate to the construction and funding of tangible capital assets (Note 14). (iii) The payable transactions with other ministries include the debt payable to ACFA (Note 1 8(a)).

Note 2 4 Health Benefit Trust of Alberta (HBTA) AHS is one of more than 30 participants in the HBTA and has a majority of representation on the HBTA governance board. The HBTA is a formal health and welfare trust established under a Trust Agreement effective January 1, 2000.

These amounts are held and administered on behalf of others in accordance with the terms and conditions embodied in the relevant agreements with no unilateral power to change the conditions set out in the trust indenture (or agreement) and therefore are not reported in these consolidated financial statements. As at March 31, 2014 , the balance of funds held in trust by AHS for research and development is $8,0 33 (2013 - $8,443). AHS also receives funds in trust from continuing care residents for personal expenses. These amounts are not included above and not consolidated in these financial statements.

Raising more than $200 million yearly, our partner foundations make a tremendous impact. The shared commitment between AHS, foundations and their donors in the community translates into positive patient experiences. AHS worked with foundations and health trusts to establish priorities for the 2013-14 fiscal year. These priorities allowed AHS to better support the valuable work of foundations and included: Refining the AHS procurement process to better track and acknowledge foundation support, Building a more focused partnership between zones and foundations by sharpening strategic alignment, and, Launching an annual campaign to increase awareness of foundations within AHS and with the public. Across the five zones, people benefit from the fundraising efforts of their local foundations. With a commitment to enhancing patient care, foundations funded a number of impressive projects in 2013-14. NORTH ZONE: In 2013, 15 foundations raised $4.3 million for local health care. This was good news for new mothers in Fort McMurray and Wood Buffalo region who can now access support through The Baby Friendly Initiative. This AHS program is delivered through the local breast-feeding clinic and funded by Northern Lights Health Foundation. EDMONTON ZONE: It was another successful year in the Edmonton Zone, with 12 foundations raising $57 million. The Jim Pattison Centre for Heart Health was launched through a gift received by the University Hospital Foundation. The Pattison Centre provides world-class clinical support, occupational therapy and ongoing cardiac education to patients who have been treated at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute.NORTH ZONE FOUNDATIONS: Beaverlodge Hospital Foundation, Fairview Health Complex Foundation, Grande Cache Hospital Foundation, Grimshaw/ Berwyn Hospital Foundation, Hinton Health Care Foundation, Hythe Nursing Home Foundation, Jasper Health Care Foundation, Northern Lights Regional Health Foundation, Northwest Health Foundation, Peace River and District Health Foundation, Queen Elizabeth II Hospital Foundation, Regional EMS Foundation, St. Paul & District Hospital Foundation, Swan Hills Hospital Foundation, Valleyview Health Centre Foundation.

ALBERTA CANCER FOUNDATION: Working to support programs across all five zones, the Alberta Cancer Foundation raised $33.7 million in 2013. With 43 Albertans receiving a cancer diagnosis each day, the foundation's fundraising efforts benefit research, programs and patients living with cancer. Funding specialized technology for a new breast cancer treatment called breast brachytherapy, the Foundation is helping the Tom Baker Cancer Centre offer an alternative to traditional radiation. By implanting radioactive seeds into the breast, doctors are able to decrease the patient's exposure to radiation, reduce the number of days a patient needs to be at the centre for treatment and enhance the patient's experience. 155 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014HEALTH QUALITY COUNCIL OF ALBERTA AHS continues to partner with the Health Quality Council of Alberta to promote and improve patient safety and health service quality on a provincewide basis. This plays an important part in AHS working towards achieving its mission to provide a patient-focused, quality health system that is accessible and sustainable for all Albertans. The reviews conducted by the Health Quality Council of Alberta on AHS' programs and services have been integral towards achieving our goal of a high quality health system. The Health Quality Council of Alberta has provided recommendations as part of the following reviews completed in 2013-14: Review of Quality Assurance in Continuing Care Health Services in Alberta. AHS continues to implement the recommendations provided by the Health Quality Council of Alberta reviews completed prior to 2013-14: Review of Operations of Ground Emergency Medical Services in Alberta - January 2013. Review of the Quality of Care and Safety of Patients Requiring Access to Emergency Department Care and Cancer Surgery and the Role and Process of Physician Advocacy - February 2012.

AHS implemented all recommendations provided by the Health Quality Council of Alberta and a full review was closed during the 2013-14 year: Review of the Safety Implications for Patients Requiring Medevac Services to, and from, the Edmonton International Airport - May 2011.www.albertahealthservices.ca 156 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014PUBLIC INTEREST DISCLOSURE (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION) ACT (PIDA) On June 1, 2013, the provincial government enacted new legislation surrounding the Public Interest Disclosure (Whistleblower Protection) Act (PIDA) and Regulations. The new legislation protects employees when making disclosures of certain kinds of wrongdoing they observe in the work place. The purposes of the Act include: Facilitating the disclosure of wrongdoing Protecting those who make a disclosure from reprisal Resolving recommendations arising from investigations Promoting confidence in the public sector In 2009, AHS established a solid foundation for leading this work across the organization by approving the AHS Safe Disclosure/Whistleblower Policy and appointing a Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, who, under the Act, is also the AHS Designated Officer for PIDA. Over the past five years, AHS has: Developed an internal process and procedures to manage reports of wrongdoing (detailed in the Safe Disclosure/ Whistleblower Policy Frequently Asked Questions). Provided resources and ongoing training to managers and staff about PIDA and the internal disclosure process. In compliance with legislated reporting requirements, from June 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, there have been no disclosures under PIDA to the AHS Designated Officer; as such, no AHS investigations are underway and no actions have been taken. Of note: the AHS Designated Officer coordinates all PIDA disclosures pertaining to AHS, including those that may originate externally via the provincial PIDA Commissioner/Office of the Ombudsman. 157 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014MONITORING MEASURES AHS has developed the 16 performance measures as listed in the 2013-14 Health Action Plan Results section which reflect key areas within the health system that are important to Albertans. AHS delivers health services in five zones, each with different populations and geography. The measures presented below track our performance using a broad range of indicators that span the continuum of care. They include population and public health, primary care, continuing care, and access to cancer care, emergency department and surgery. AHS continues to collect and monitor these measures to help support priority-setting and local decision-making. These measures are tactical as they inform the performance of an operational area; or reflect the performance of key drivers of a strategic measure. The trend column indicates comparison of the most recent data over the earliest data available for each measure. An upward arrow ( h) indicates improvement; a horizontal arrow ( g) indicates stability and a downward arrow ( i) indicates areas that require additional focus. Life expectancy at birth is an indicator of the health of a population, measuring the number of years lived rather than the quality of life. An increased life expectancy tells you people are living longer, it does not tell you why, and it does not tell you anything about the quality of the life being lived. The above data demonstrates over the last six years life expectancy has been improving provincially as well as among First Nations populations. Coronary heart disease, stroke and respiratory infections such as pneumonia were the three leading causes of premature death. Pneumonia is one of the primary causes of death for children under five years of age, along with complications due to premature birth. Life expectancy has increased because tobacco use has gone down and we have had success in lowering heart disease and stroke rates. AHS is working to improve the health of our population through integrating health promotion (and disease and injury prevention programs) with other health care delivery services, and better coordination between health and other government and municipal sectors. Potential years of life lost is an indicator of premature mortality that gives greater weight to causes of death that occur at a younger age than to those at older ages. It emphasizes the loss of life at an early age and the causes of early deaths such as cancer, injury and cardiovascular disease.

The goal is to reduce breast, colorectal and cervical cancer mortality through early detection when treatment is most likely to be effective and will significantly reduce the suffering and substantial costs of end-stage cancer treatment. Death from colorectal cancer is 90 per cent preventable if the disease is caught at early stages. Adequate participation in breast cancer screening is essential for reductions in mortality for women between the ages of 50 and 69 years. Research indicates that more than 90 per cent of cervical cancers can be cured when detected early and treated. Albertans have the opportunity to change the future of cancer in this province, beginning by asking: What would I do with more time together with my family? The next step is to get started; choose to be more active, to eat healthy, get screened for cancer, avoid tobacco, and limit alcohol. Influenza has a significant seasonal impact on the health of Albertans and tends to be most severe among older Albertans, residents of long-term care facilities, young infants, and those with certain chronic conditions. Albertans with influenza illness can quickly fill acute care hospitals and emergency departments. A high rate of seasonal influenza immunization among children and seniors reduces the incidence of complications and death associated with influenza disease and reduces the spread of disease to other age groups during the influenza season. Providing influenza immunizations to eligible Albertans is a major activity of the public health system. A high rate of coverage will reduce the impact of disease on the health care system. Immunization is an important, cost-effective and successful public health intervention. In the last century, vaccines have saved more lives than any other health measure. Immunizations protect children and adults from a number of vaccine preventable diseases, some of which can be fatal or produce permanent disabilities. A high rate of immunization can help ensure that the incidence of the covered childhood diseases remains low and outbreaks are controlled. AHS needs to continue to educate and encourage Albertans to immunize their children.Childhood Immunization 2009 2010 2011 2012 Trend Rates of childhood immunization by two years of age in all service zones Diphtheria/ tetanus/ acellular Colon Cancer Screening in Canada Survey by Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC); Alberta Breast Cancer Screen Program (ABCSP) and Alberta Health.Influenza Immunization 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 Trend Rates of seasonal influenza immunization by age group Children aged six to 23 months 16.0% 27.0% 29.9% 30.2% 35.7% h 58.9% 60.8% 60.0% 63.6% h Source: Alberta Health and Health Services159 www.albertahealthservices.ca Alberta Health Annual 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 Trend (%)64% (April 2010)72% (April 2011)75% (April 2012)76% (April 2013)78% (April 2014) h Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions: Rate of hospital admissions for health conditions that may be prevented or managed by appropriate primary health care.298 293 291 293 291h Family Practice Sensitive Conditions: Percent of emergency department or urgent care visits for health conditions that may be appropriately managed at a family physician's office.27.4% 27.5% 26.4% 26.0% 25.1% h Source: AHS Discharge Abstract Database and Provincial Ambulatory (ED/Urgent Care) Abstract Data. Appropriate management and control of these chronic conditions in the community could potentially reduce the need for hospitalization, improve efficiency in resource utilization, and in turn, could have an impact on health spending for chronic illnesses in Alberta. AHS and health care play a vital role in educating and supporting individuals in the management of their chronic conditions to maintain health. Primary care networks and Family Care Clinics are a made-in-Alberta approach to ensure that you receive the right care, from the right health professional, at the right time. Led by family doctors, these networks are improving access to, and better coordinating care and managing chronic conditions for Albertans. The goal of Health Link Alberta is to support Albertans in managing their own health. The result is a more knowledgeable public, fewer hospital visits and healthier communities. Health Link Alberta provides health advice and information through a toll-free phone number to all Albertans. Access is 24 hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week and support is provided by experienced registered nurses and other health care professionals. By having a single, coordinated service across the province, AHS is able to provide consistent information to the public.Health Information 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 Trend Health Link Alberta: Percentage of calls to Health Link that are answered within two minutes. 46% 66% 78% 81% 78% 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2012-13 Trend Percent of children aged 0 to 17 years receiving scheduled mental health treatment within 30 days.75% 76% 80% 81% h Source: AHS Mental Health Services Improving the mental health and well-being of Alberta's children and youth is an important focus for AHS. Early support and intervention are vital, as research shows that half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by age 14. Providing appropriate community services reduces emergency room and hospital visits, thereby providing cost-effective methods of care and, most importantly, improving the lives of those with mental health problems by providing care in the community with a high level of family support.www.albertahealthservices.ca 160 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014Emergency Department 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 Trend Percentage of patients treated and discharged from the Emergency Department within 4 hours Busiest 16 sites 63% 64% 80%g Percentage of patients treated and admitted from the Emergency Department within 8 hours Busiest 15 sites 38% 41% h Sources: Calgary and Edmonton Emergency Department Information System Data (REDIS, EDIS) and AHS Ambulatory Care Reporting System Data (ACRS, NACRS). Patients treated in an Emergency Department or Urgent Care Centre (ED/UCC) should be assessed and treated in a timely fashion. The length of stay in Emergency Department (ED LOS) is used to assess the timeliness of care delivery. Patients who are treated and then discharged from ED/UCC will typically have a distinctly shorter stay than patients subsequently admitted to hospital due to complexity, admission processes and other factors. AHS is working hard to improve emergency wait times while ensuring you get the care you need when you need it. Partnering with Alberta Health, AHS has created other options to manage and maintain Albertan's health with Family Care Clinics and primary care networks. Alberta is developing a \"radiation corridor\" from Lethbridge to Grande Prairie so that nine out of 10 Albertans will have access to radiation therapy within 100 kilometres of home. In the south, the Jack Ady Cancer Centre opened in Lethbridge in 2010, and the Central Alberta Cancer Centre opened in Red Deer in November 2013. The Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary is the comprehensive cancer centre for southern Alberta and a lead centre for the provincewide prevention, research and treatment program. In the north, the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton will anchor the radiation corridor. A new cancer centre for Grande Prairie will be part of its new regional hospital. CancerControl Alberta will bring together cancer facilities and programs under one umbrella to create a comprehensive and coordinated system of cancer prevention, screening, care and research for Alberta. This will improve equity of care across the province and ensure high quality, innovative and safe practices are in place to support a seamless and well- supported cancer patient journey. The Addiction and Mental Health SCN was created to enhance the prevention and treatment of addiction and mental health issues in order to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. Work is underway to develop an EMPATHY Pathway (Empowering a MultiPa-sectoral Pathway Towards Healthy Youth) which is focused on prevention, early identification and treatment of children and youth.

Providing reasonable access to health service is a major objective and a defining attribute of the publicly-funded health system. Longer waits affect health status and quality of life and result in more costly health services. The Surgery Strategic Clinical Network (SCN) is a provincewide network of dedicated Albertans who are committed to improving the quality of surgical care in Alberta. The Surgery SCN is dedicated to delivering surgical care which is \"Sooner, Safer and Smarter,\" for all Albertans.

By reducing the number of people waiting in a hospital environment for continuing care, we will be able to improve patient flow throughout the system, provide more appropriate care to meet patient needs, decrease wait times and deliver care in a more cost effective manner. Today, one in nine Albertans are over the age of 65. This is expected to increase to one in five over the next two decades. The aging population creates both challenges and opportunities for the health care system. The Seniors' Health SCN is working on the most effective ways to meet the health care needs of Alberta's seniors based on evidence and best practices within Alberta and around the world. By attending to the unique needs of seniors within our health care system, we will have a positive impact on both the individual's health outcomes and the efficiency of the health care system. www.albertahealthservices.ca 162 Alberta Health Services Annual Report 2013-2014SURGICAL CONTRACTS Non-Hospital Surgical Facility Contracts under the Health Care Protection Act (Alberta) AHS contracts services with multiple Non-Hospital Surgical Facilities (NHSF) to provide insured surgical services for dermatology, ophthalmology, oral maxillofacial, otolaryngology, plastic surgery and pregnancy terminations. The use of NHSFs enables AHS to obtain quality services to enhance surgical access and alleviate capacity pressures within AHS main operating rooms.
