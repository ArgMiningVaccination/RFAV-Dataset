Frontiers in Immunology This review highlights the fundamental role of nutrition in the maintenance of health, the immune response, and disease prevention. Emerging global mechanistic insights in the field of nutritional immunology cannot be gained through reductionist methods alone or by analyzing a single nutrient at a time. We propose to investigate nutritional immunology as a massively interacting system of interconnected multistage and multiscale networks that encompass hidden mechanisms by which nutrition, microbiome, metabolism, genetic predisposition, and the immune system interact to delineate health and disease. The review sets an unconventional path to apply complex science methodologies to nutritional immunology research, discovery, and development through \" use cases \" centered around the impact of nutrition on the gut microbiome and immune responses. Our systems nutritional immunology analyses, which include modeling and informatics methodologies in combination with pre-clinical and clinical studies, have the potential to discover emerging systems-wide properties at the interface of the immune system, nutrition, microbiome, and metabolism. Frontiers in immunology 2015 The intestinal tract represents the largest interface between the external environment and the human body. Nutrient uptake mostly happens in the intestinal tract, where the epithelial surface is constantly exposed to dietary antigens. Since inflammatory response toward these antigens may be deleterious for the host, a plethora of protective mechanisms take place to avoid or attenuate local damage. For instance, the intestinal barrier is able to elicit a dynamic response that either promotes or impairs luminal antigens adhesion and crossing. Regulation of intestinal barrier is crucial to control intestinal permeability whose increase is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions. The cross talk among bacteria, immune, and dietary factors is able to modulate the mucosal barrier function, as well as the intestinal permeability. Several nutritional products have recently been proposed as regulators of the epithelial barrier, even if their effects are in part contradictory. At the s... Journal of leukocyte biology 2002 Almost all nutrients in the diet play a crucial role in maintaining an \"optimal\" immune response, such that deficient and excessive intakes can have negative consequences on immune status and susceptibility to a variety of pathogens. Iron and vitamin A deficiencies and protein-energy malnutrition are highly prevalent worldwide and are important to the public health in terms of immunocompetence. There are also nutrients (i.e., glutamine, arginine, fatty acids, vitamin E) that provide additional benefits to immunocompromised persons or patients who suffer from various infections. The remarkable advances in immunology of recent decades have provided insights into the mechanisms responsible for the effects of various nutrients in the diet on specific functions in immune cells. In this review, we will present evidence and proposed mechanisms for the importance of a small group of nutrients that have been demonstrated to affect host resistance to infection will be presented. An ... Food Science & Technology Bulletin: Functional Foods 2009 Bioactive Compounds in Health and Disease 2021 The human immune system is the first line of defense in the prevention of viruses and diseases, and several immune response mechanisms are engaged at the onset of a pathogenic attack. In this review, we elucidate the human immune system as a critical element in protecting humans from COVID-19 by describing the immune process, explaining how the immune system functions, and highlighting the immune system's global importance in fighting infections. Potential challenges that limit the proper functioning of the immune system are also discussed. In addition, we address the impact of nutrition on boosting the body's defenses against COVID-19. For example, some foods and active compounds from food ingredients have been suggested as a way to strengthen the immune system. Physical exercise has also been encouraged as an important way to support the immune response to viral infections. The aim of this review is thus to outline holistic self-defense immunity mechanisms that can help to reduce the risk of viral infections in humans. This review could therefore be used as a comprehensive resource for educating consumers and the general public about measures that can enhance the body's immune support system as we continue to fight COVID-19 and its variants. Keywords: Immunity, Covid-19 COVID-19, Nutrition, Bioactive compounds, Food Ingredients Nutrition Reviews 2007 Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 2013 International Journal of Food and Fermentation Technology 2019 Immunology involves all the defence mechanisms occurring in the body after the invasion of any infectious agent and the ability to resist this infection is referred to as immunity. The early and later response towards the infection are termed as innate and adaptive immunity. The cells of immune system like neutrophils, macrophages, cytokines, lymphocytes etc. protect human body from various infectious agents like pathogenic microorganisms , toxins, food borne allergens and other injuries or wounds. The origin of these cells is in the bone marrow from where they are distributed as circulating cells in the blood and lymph. Various food components have an immunomodulatory effect on the immune function and adequate nutrition is required for the proper functioning of immune system. The micronutrients like essential proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins (A, B 6 , B 12 , C, D, E and folic acid), fatty acids, minerals (iron, selenium, zinc and copper) and certain phytochemicals are of prime importance towards healthy immune system. In addition to these nutritional components intestinal microflora and certain bacteria (probiotic bacteria), also play an important role in the modulation of healthy immune system. However, over reaction of immune system leads towards the hypersensitivity reactions like autoimmunity which ultimately causes auto immune diseases and allergic reactions.
