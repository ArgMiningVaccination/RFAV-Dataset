H\u00f4pital V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire Mercier has been using acupuncture to treat cats and dogs for over 10 years. What does acupuncture entail for dogs and cats? Veterinary acupuncture draws on Traditional Chinese Medicine dating back over 5000 years. Very thin needles are used to stimulate specific points on the body. The acupuncture points (acupoints) are located along blood vessels and nerves. The needles are completely painless. Acupuncture also allows us to gather additional information beyond conventional diagnostic data. It considers the overall health of the patient and is complementary to what are considered more conventional therapeutic treatments. What does acupuncture do? Acupuncture is particularly effective in treating musculoskeletal pain in cats and dogs, including hip dysplasia, arthritis, herniated discs or torn ligaments. If your pet suffers from one of the following conditions, acupuncture could help: - Neurological disorders (epilepsy, convulsions or paralysis) - Respiratory diseases (asthma) - Gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, vomiting, constipation or digestive tract inflammation) - Skin problems (allergies or hypersensitivity) What are the side effects? Cats and dogs rarely experience side effects from acupuncture. In fact, acupuncture can be an alternative treatment if your pet experiences too many side effects following conventional treatment. Do pets generally get nervous around acupuncture needles? Animals generally don't have a problem with the needles. Most times, they relax and sometimes even fall asleep during the treatment. The needles are not painful and can help your animal relax. Acupuncture is also an option when surgery has been ruled out for various reasons. How many sessions will my pet need before I see an improvement? The number of sessions and their frequency will depend on the condition being treated and how well your pet responds to the treatment. Our team can assess your pet's situation and determine how many sessions are needed. "}
