According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is estimated that in the United States, 76 millionillnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths areattributed to food borne illness each year. Significant causesof food borne illness include viruses, bacteria, parasites,toxins, and metals. Food borne illness symptoms vary frommild gastroenteritis to life-threatening neurological, hepatic,and renal syndromes. 1The annual cost of food borne illness in the United States is enormous, with estimates ranging from$10 to $83 billion. 2 Food safety is especially important among elders, a highly susceptible population, as food borne illness may result inserious or long-term health consequences. The elderpopulation represents the largest at-risk segment of the USpopulation for food borne illness. 3Reasons why elders are the largest at-risk population include having a weakened immunesystem, inflammation of the stomach lining, a decrease instomach acid, and a decline in sense of taste and smell. 2 Compounding health concerns about elders is the projectionthat the population of elders 65 and older will increase 147%between the years 2000-2050. 4 Elder Nutrition Programs (ENPs) were founded in 1972 and were authorized by Congress under Title VII (now Title III) of theOlder Americans Act. 5The ENPs provide congregate and home delivered meals to people age 60 years and older, particularly tolow-income elders, and are the largest community nutritionprogram in the United States. 6-7There are many unique food safety challenges that ENPs nationwide face each year. Theseinclude serving and preparing food to a highly susceptiblepopulation, maintaining proper temperatures over long distances,high staff turnover, and delayed consumption of the homedelivered meal, all of which increases the chances of food borne In this Issue... 165 Elder Food Safety Initiative: A Review of the Home Meal Delivery Process in Tribal Elder Nutrition Programs 172 The American Indian Breast Health Advisory Council Presents the New American Indian Ribbon of Life 173 New Nurse Educator at the Clinical Support Center 174 OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest182 New on Your Library Website183 Providers Best Practices & GPRA Measures Conference 184 IHS Child Health Notes 186 Postgraduate Course on Obstetric, Neonatal and Gynecologic Care 187 Meetings of Interest 191 Position Vacanciesillness.8 Other challenges include funding for the program and lack of volunteers. Elders themselves can also contribute to or increase the risk of food borne illness. A combination of alimited household budget, long held feelings against wastingfood, and memory loss may further result in home mealdelivery recipients keeping foods too long or improperlyhandling them. 9 Approximately 61% of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) elders live in poverty, live in poor housingconditions, and are without access to adequate health care. 10 These contributing factors specific to AI/AN may elevate therisk of food borne illness above that of the general elderpopulation. The Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Environmental Health Services, Reno District Office, conductsannual comprehensive environmental health surveys at tribalENPs. The Reno District IHS Environmental Health ServicesProgram consists of five Environmental Health Officers (EHOs)providing environmental health services to 35 tribes/colonies,which are dispersed throughout Nevada, Utah, and southeasternCalifornia. Tribal enrollments vary from a few hundred to a fewthousand. Prior to this initiative, routine surveys had focused onthe on-site food safety, with less attention given to the homemeal delivery process. In addition, during recent routinesurveys, the Reno District IHS staff were informed of severalundesirable food safety practices that were occurring as part ofthe delivery process, such as leaving meals outside the home,entering the home to leave a meal when no one was home, andfailure to monitor food temperatures during delivery. Giventhese factors, the Reno District IHS staff developed an elder foodsafety initiative to assess food safety risks among homedelivered meal recipients at seven participating tribal eldernutrition programs in summer and fall 2005. Methods For tribes in the Reno District IHS service area to participate in this initiative, the tribes had to meet specific inclusion criteria: 1) the tribe must have an ENP Program, 2) theENP must home deliver at least 20 meals, and 3) the ENP mustbe interested in participating in the program. The participatingENP programs were identified after discussing the initiative withthe ENP director, health director, and ENP staff. The ENP food safety initiative included two types of assessments: an on-site food safety assessment and aquestionnaire to assess the elder' s food safety knowledge. Thefirst assessment consisted of an unannounced site assessmentof the ENP to identify food safety risks during the facilityoperation and home delivery process. Food safety risks weredetermined by visually observing and monitoring the entireoperation of the ENP and documenting findings on a datacollection form. This form was comprehensive and includedthe assessment of: 1) facility operations, 2) deliverypreparation, and 3) delivery process. A control plate (an extrameal) was used to monitor food temperatures of the homedelivered meal during the delivery trips. The on-site food safety assessment form was based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code and the FDABaseline Data Collection form that focuses on the five CDCidentified contributing factors for food borne illness. Thesefactors include food from unsafe sources, inadequate cooking,improper holding time and temperature, personal hygiene, andprevention of contamination. The self-administered questionnaire evaluated food safety knowledge, attitudes, and practices among the elders whoparticipated in the nutrition program. The questionnaire, whichwas distributed by ENP staff at their respective programs,consisted of eleven questions, and was distributed to both theelders who received meals at the ENPs and the elders whoreceived meals at home. Food safety thermometers wereprovided to elders as an incentive for returning the completedquestionnaire. Results of the Site Assesment Seven ENPs participated in the elder food safety initiative. Collectively, these centers delivered 250 meals a day and served another 100 on site. The number of meals delivered ateach center ranged from 20 to 75, and 43% (3/7) of programsutilized at least two vehicles for meal delivery. Thus, a total ofeleven delivery processes were assessed. Five ENPs (71%)purchased and transported some of their food items while allENPs received some food products from a food distributor.Results of the site assessment for hot potentially hazardousfoods (PHFs) are summarized in Table 1 (see next page).Results of the site assessment for cold PHFs are summarized inTable 2 (see page 168). A PHF is a food that requirestemperature control because it supports the growth ofinfectious or toxigenic microorganisms. 11 Transport Time. Transport delivery times ranged from 40 minutes to almost 3 hours, with the average transport deliverytime of 1.6 hours. The delivery time only included the timetaken to deliver the meals and does not include the return timeafter the last meal had been delivered. Food Delivery and Transport Containers . For the purpose of this initiative, the food delivery container refers to thecontainer in which individual meals were placed, while thefood transport containers were the larger containers in whichthe individual food delivery containers were collectively placedfor transportation. The type of food delivery container usedvaried. Some programs utilized styrofoam, aluminum, orplastic food delivery containers, while most utilized acombination of these types. Food transport container typesalso varied depending on the type of food. Most used aninsulated soft pack for hot holding. Only 14% (1/7) of ENPsused a heating pad for transporting hot foods. For coldtransport, the types varied widely and ranged from softinsulated coolers, milk crates, or plastic lined containers.Nearly, 71% (5/7) of ENPs did not utilize cold packs fortransporting cold foods. July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 166Food Temperatures. Twenty-five (25) PHFs were monitored. Nine (9) were cold PHFs and sixteen (16) were hot PHFs. According to the FDA Food Code, a PHF should be at41\u00ba F or below for cold holding or 135\u00ba F and above for hotholding. 12 Sixteen percent (4/25) of the PHFs were out of the recommended FDA food code temperature prior to leaving theelder nutrition program. Three of these were cold PHFs andone was a hot PHF . By the end of the delivery, 76% (19/25)PHFs had fallen out of the recommended FDA food codetemperature (14 hot and 5 cold foods). Facility Operation. In addition to the delivery process, the food service operation of each ENP kitchen facility wasevaluated. When reviewing the data, several criticaloperational issues were uncovered that could easily contribute July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 167July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 168to the occurrence of a food borne illness, as they occurred at a critical point in the food service process. A critical point in thefood service process, formerly known as a Critical ControlPoint (CCP) is any point or procedure in a specific food systemat which a control can be applied and a food safety hazard canbe prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels. 13 Fourteen CCPs were identified and grouped into fourcategories as part of the data analysis. These include time andtemperature abuse, management and personnel, sanitization ofequipment, and poor personal hygiene. While no one programhad all 14 critical deficiencies, most programs had multiplecritical deficiencies. Moreover, the monitoring of food temperatures was a substantial concern in the ENP facility operation. One-hundred percent (7/7) of the ENPs were observed not checkingand documenting final cooking temperatures. Furthermore,86% (6/7) of ENPs were observed not monitoring foodtemperatures during home meal delivery. Eighty percent (4/5)of food temperatures were also not being monitored whenemployees transported food after purchase to the ENP and100% (7/7) of food temperatures were not monitored whenfood was received on site from a food distributor.Safety. It was also noted that when clients were not at home at the time of the meal delivery, 29% (2/7) of ENPs wereentering homes to leave meals on counters, and 29% (2/7) wereobserved leaving meals outside the client' s home in a cooler ormilk crate. One ENP left 29% (16/56) of their meals outsidewith no knowledge of when the client would return. Results of the Questionnaire From the 350 elders who received meals from the seven participating ENP programs, a total of 178 questionnaires were completed and returned, which represented a response rate of51%. It should be noted that not all respondents answered allquestions. Of the returned questionnaires, 73% (129/178) werecompleted by elders whose meals were exclusively homedelivered, 21% (38/178) were completed by elders whose mealswere at the ENP , and 6% (11/178) werecompleted by elders whose meal delivery process variedbetween the two options. Of those who received home deliveredmeals, 73% (102/140) of elders ate their meal immediately uponreceipt, while 9% (13/140) placed their meal in the refrigerator,6% (9/140) placed their meal on the counter, 6% (8/140) in theoven, and 6% (8/140) reported doing something else with theirmeal other than the options listed on the questionnaire. When asked what happens to the meal if they were not home, 55%(74/134) stated that their meals were not delivered, 23% (31/134)had their meals left outside, 13% (17/134) reported having theirmeals left on the counter, 8% (11/134) stated that their mealswere placed in the refrigerator, and 1% (1/134) reported theirmeal being placed in the oven. Nearly, 91% (153/169) of eldersdid not own a food thermometer and 82% (138/169) reportedthey would like to have a food thermometer. Ninety-six percent (157/178) of elders were not able to identify any types of food that they should avoid to reduce therisk of food borne illness. Seventy-five percent (133/178) ofelders reported that they were interested in learning about foodsafety. Most (66%, or 117/178) were interested in learningabout food safety through flyers delivered to the home, 14%(25/178) preferred tribal newsletter articles, 10% (17/178)preferred learning through a food safety class, and 10%(19/178) preferred learning from all three methods. Discussion of the Site Assessment Food borne illness data in the Reno District were not available when conducting this initiative. The lack of food borne illness surveillance is a common problem in the United Statesand is attributed to underreporting or lack of diagnosis. 1 The majority of information found on home delivered meals for elderprograms focuses on nutritional content of meals. This projectsought to assess home delivered meals in regards to food safety. The significant change in food temperatures during delivery may be attributed to the type of transport containerused and the lack of or improper use of supplemental heatingunits for the hot PHFs and the nonuse of supplemental coolingunits or ice packs for cold PHFs. Hot PHFs. With the exception of one delivery vehicle, all hot PHFs were above 135\u00ba F prior to leaving the ENP . For thetransport of hot PHFs, most ENPs utilized a type of zippedinsulated thermal bags. When researching the specifications ofthis product, there was no assurance that the bags couldmaintain hot food temperatures. Rather, the bags wereadvertised as high efficiency units with no mention oftemperature maintenance. Upon contacting the manufacturer,it was reported that the bags will keep a full container of foodtrays loaded at 185\u00ba F above 140\u00ba F for an hour, and longer ifthe bag is not opened and closed throughout the course ofdelivery. Given this information, the high heat loss could havebeen attributed to several factors. First, only 1 hot PHF wasloaded at 185\u00ba F . Furthermore, ENP staff were observed failingto re-zip the thermal transport bags between meal deliverystops, which increases heat loss. Also, the average deliverytimes were 62% greater than what the insulated thermal bagswere rated for (1.6 hours versus 1 hour). Other contributing factors to the decrease in hot PHF temperatures were the misuse or lack of supplemental heatingunits in the food transportation containers. Supplementalheating units help to maintain food temperatures in the range of140\u00ba F to 160\u00ba F through the gradual release of stored heat. Toproperly prepare the supplemental heating unit (e.g., heat bottle),it must be placed in boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. It shouldthen be placed upright between two columns of trays or uprightat the back side of the bag. Only one of the seven ENPs utilizedsupplemental heating units. However, the ENP that did utilizethe supplemental heating units incorrectly prepared and placedthem. They warmed the supplemental heating units in thedishwasher and placing them in the top exterior sleeve of thethermal transport container, which is inconsistent with themanufacturer' s instructions. With average transport times of 1.6hours, supplemental heating units and their proper use appear tobe necessary in order to maintain proper temperatures whenusing the zipped insulated thermal bags as the food transportcontainers. When discussing temperature loss, it should bementioned that one ENP utilized hard plastic coolers for thetransport of hot food items. Food temperatures for these twodelivery processes were delivered within the recommended foodsafety range. The type of food, (soup) and the type of fooddelivery container (covered styrofoam cups) may haveinfluenced the temperature retention during delivery. Hardplastic coolers should be further evaluated, using varying hotfood types and varying transport times, to better determine theireffectiveness as a hot food transport container. Cold PHFs. Three of the nine cold PHFs were above 41\u00baF prior to leaving the ENP . This was due to improper coldholding techniques prior to delivery. By the end of the deliveryprocess, only one of the nine cold PHFs was below 41\u00baF . Thetype of container used to transport cold foods varied widely,from crates to hard plastic coolers to insulated bags. Only oneout of seven programs used cooling elements such as ice packswhen delivering cold PHFs. Failure to use such items wasbelieved to have caused the temperature increases seen duringthe site assessment. Temperature Findings. The loss-of-temperature findings in the on-site assessment were consistent with the findings in onestudy located via an exhaustive literature review. In a studyconducted through the University of Minnesota, meals providedby a home delivered meal program were evaluated for fiveconsecutive days annually for a period of six years. During thistime, food safety temperatures of home delivered meals weremonitored. Findings demonstrated that temperatures of deliveredhot foods were often much lower than recommended food safetytemperatures despite annual recommendations to increase foodtemperatures and to deliver meals quickly. 14 Prior to the on-site assessment from this initiative, it was initially believed that \"time as a public health control\" could beused to address temperature loss issues associated with thehome delivery process. The FDA Food Code allows for timeonly to provide the public health control for PHFs when thePHF is eaten or discarded within four hours of removal fromtemperature control (e.g., cooking process, proper hot storage,or proper cold storage.) This Food Code component does notallow for the refrigeration or reheating of the PHF after the July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 169four-hour period. Also, several initiative findings suggest that \"time as a public health control\" for the home delivery processmay provide insufficient protection. These findings includethe failure to monitor cooking temperature at the kitchenfacilities, delivery times as long as almost three hours, and thefact that 27% of the questionnaire respondents reported doingsomething other than immediately eating the delivery mealupon receiving it. Thus, it is strongly recommended that theENP programs should deliver their meals to elders at the propertemperature (e.g., either above 135\u00b0F for hot foods or below41\u00b0F for cold foods) and stress that if they are not eaten rightaway they should be refrigerated and reheated. 15 As mentioned in the results section, 14 critical control points (CCPs) were identified at the ENP kitchen facilities. Themost significant CCPs include: failure to monitor and documentthe temperatures of food transported to the facility by ENP staff(80%), failure to monitor and/or document the temperature offood obtained by the food distributor (100%), failure to monitorand document final food cooking temperatures (100%), failureto monitor and document food delivery temperatures (86%),and lack of food safety education among delivery drivers andmanagement (100%). Most of the operational issues were dueto the lack of standard operating procedures (SOPs), and thelack of food safety education was largely due to high staffturnover and lack of awareness of the need for education. Both,the lack of SOPs during critical operational processes and lackof food safety education are key contributing factors toincreasing food safety risk, and must be addressed. Discussion of the Questionnaire Much is known about the elder population as a highly susceptible population, but little is known about their food safety practices at home and their general understanding offood safety. 15 From the questionnaire, it was determined that approximately 73% (102/140) of elders who receive home-delivered meals consume them right away. This statistic ishigher than other studies regarding meal disposition of home-delivered meals among elders. In a study conducted by Aspand Darling, it was noted that approximately one-half of homedelivered meal recipients saved their meal for laterconsumption. 3In another study by Lau et al, it was reported that only 12% of 400 clients were consuming their homedelivered meals in their entirety after delivery. 16While the immediate consumption of meals by the elders in this initiativewas higher than other studies, it still indicates that almost 1/4(27%) are delaying consumption of their delivered meals.Delayed consumption is a considerable food safety risk to theelder population when food is not delivered within therecommended food temperature safety range. Elders should beencouraged to eat their meal immediately upon receipt. Another significant finding from the questionnaire was meal delivery practices when the client was not at home. Fifty-five percent (74/134) of elders responded that their meals werenot delivered when away. However 45% (60/134) of eldersstated that their meals were either left outside, or placed on thecounter, in the refrigerator, or in the oven. Because elders are ahighly susceptible population, the practice of leaving the mealsoutside the home (e.g., usually in a cooler or milk crate with noice pack) or leaving them on a counter inside the home withouttemperature control poses a substantial health risk. Issuesrelating to potential contamination of the food, cleanliness of thecooler, and keeping foods out of the temperature danger zoneshould be a liability concern for the ENPs as well as a foodsafety risk to the consumer. In addition, allowing the deliverydriver to enter into the home while the elder was away could leadto problems with theft or the accusation of theft. A secondary objective of the questionnaire was the need to determine necessity of, interest in, and focus for food safetyeducation among elders. Approximately, 88% (157/178) ofelders were unable to identify foods that should be avoided toreduce their risk of food borne illness. Y et, elders indicated astrong interest in food safety education and gave their preferredmethods of communication. This initiative did not include afood safety educational component as it was felt thataddressing operational deficiencies and equipment needs wasmore critical. However, such activities should be planned andimplemented in the future. Interventions Based on the findings from the site assessment, it was clearly evident that SOPs and improved hot holding and cold holding equipment were needed. The equipment relatedinterventions were not implemented during this initiative dueto the lack of funding. Nevertheless, recommendationsregarding equipment were made. Since there was no costassociated with developing or implementing the SOPs, theywere implemented immediately during this initiative. Nine SOPs were introduced based on the operational food handling deficiencies for each participating center. Plans fromthe Iowa State University Hazard Analysis Critical ControlPoint (HACCP) website were used as models. HACCP is ascientific and rational approach to food safety, which identifiesand analyzes potential hazards in the food process anddevelops monitoring procedures to determine if the hazardsidentified are being effectively controlled. 17The nine SOPs included policies as well as food temperature logs formonitoring final cooking, holding, refrigeration, and deliverytemperatures. A weekly manager' s HACCP checklist was alsoincluded to promote internal inspections. Equipment with the ability to maintain proper food temperatures during meal delivery is essential to the reduction oftemperature change for the hot and cold PHFs. After numerousdiscussions with food safety experts and Meals-On-Wheels staff,the Nutri-System electric thermal bags were recommended toparticipating ENPs as a future equipment intervention. Thisproduct was recommended for several reasons. First were priceand the capability to maintain temperature. Ideally, specializeddelivery vehicles with both hot and cold compartments wouldhave been recommended. However, the affordability of suchvehicles was an issue for the tribal ENPs. The thermal bags were July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 170affordable and, even when not zipped, have the ability to maintain proper temperatures, as heat is continuously provided via anelectric bag heater plugged into the vehicle cigarette lighter.Other reasons for recommending this product include durability,ease of cleaning, holding capacity, and weight of the bag withelectric heater versus the weight of a bag with a heating unit.Although this equipment related intervention was notimplemented, much research was conducted on this product andmuch effort was expended in an effort to locate a funding source.Recommendations were made to ENPs to purchase both hot andcold holding equipment as funding becomes available. Once the equipment intervention is implemented, an evaluation should be conducted to monitor and assess theimpact and outcome of the interventions. An evaluationcomponent is essential to determine the effect of the SOPs andthe equipment related intervention. It is also important to notethat two of the participating programs were awarded deliveryvehicles during this initiative. Findings from the ENP initiativewere utilized in a support letter to justify the need for thedelivery vehicle for one of the participating ENPs. Conclusions ENPs fulfill valuable nutritional and social roles in their communities. Prior environmental health surveys have focused on the ENPs kitchen, with no focus on the home meal deliveryprocess. This initiative identified major problems in the homemeal delivery process that could increase the health risk toelders. The initiative also recommended possible solutions toidentified food safety problems that included theimplementation of SOPs and the use of both hot and coldholding equipment. Lastly, the initiative identified the need fortraining for elders regarding food safety. As the elder populationgrows, so will the need for assuring good food safety practices. Acknowledgements I want to thank the participating tribal ENPs. Without their assistance, this initiative would not have been possible. I also want to express my appreciation to Mr. John Marcello,FDA Regional Food Specialist, CAPT Jon Peabody, IHS, andthe Phoenix Area IHS OEH&E for their support throughoutthis initiative.

July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 171The American Indian Breast Health Advisory Council Presents the New American Indian Ribbon of Life Christine Dufond, BA, freelance writer, and correspondent for Indian Education Today magazine; member of the University of California, Davis, American Indian Breast Health AdvisoryCouncil; Sacramento, California Each American Indian tribe has its own unique culture, rich with meaningful rituals and traditions. Y et, there are somerituals that are common threads, creating a cultural andspiritual connection between tribes. One such ritual, commonto many tribes, is the gifting of a feather to a loved one. Many tribes believe that birds such as eagles, hawks, or crows are messengers for the creator, and are therefore sacred;the feathers of these birds embody their spirit. Beliefs aboutwhich birds are sacred vary from tribe to tribe. Some tribes,such as the Lakota, believe that an eagle feather gives onestrength, protection, and guidance. For the Lakota, an eaglefeather might be gifted to a friend or loved one who has earnedit because they have reached an important juncture in their life,such as coming into adulthood, graduating from college, orgetting married. A feather may also be given to a loved onewho is fighting cancer, or who has survived cancer, for spiritualprotection and acknowledgement of their strength and valor. \"The eagle has the ability to see the bigger picture, to have a good vantage point, and to not have tunnel vision. This is animportant quality for all people to have when it comes to breastcancer awareness,\" said Rosalie Little Thunder, a Lakotalinguist and cultural educator from the Rosebud Reservation ofSouth Dakota. It is because of the spiritual significance of the feather to so many American Indian tribes that the University ofCalifornia (UC), Davis Cancer Center American IndianAdvisory Council came up with the idea of using a feather inthe shape of the familiar pink ribbon, symbolizing breastcancer awareness, as a logo to reinforce the message of breasthealth and breast cancer prevention in our Native communities. Kellie Stevens, a member of the Y erington Paiute Tribe of Nevada and an Advisory Council member, designed the newRibbon of Life to take its place along with other Ribbons of Lifespecially designed for African Americans and Asian Americans. The Council is responsible for the development of the Mother' s Wisdom Breast Health Program, a program of the UCDavis Cancer Center' s Outreach and Education Program, and ithas the goal of addressing the unmet breast cancer preventionneeds of American Indian women. According to the American Indian/Alaska Native Cancer Information Resource Center and Learning Exchange (NativeCIRCLE), historically, cancer used to be very rare amongAmerican Indians, and yet today it is the second leading causeof death among American Indians age 45 and older. Breastcancer is one of the leading types of cancer in American Indianand Alaskan Native women. According to the National Cancer Institutes 2003 report, Native women, on average, have lower rates of breast cancerthan women of other ethnic groups in the United States, and yet July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 172 An American Indian/Alaska Native Ribbon of Life To Support Breast Cancer Awareness and Education Among American Indian/Alaska Native Women The gifting of a feather to a loved one is a common ritual among many AmericanIndian/Alaska Native tribes. Wear this feather ribbon in acknowledgement of an AmericanIndian woman who is fighting breast cancer, or who has survived breast cancer, and as asymbol of spiritual protection, strength, and guidance. A gift from the Mother' s Wisdom Breast Health Program and the UC Davis Cancer Center American Indian Advisory Council. Supported by the Susan G. Komen Breast CancerFoundation and the UC Davis Cancer Center (1-916-734-5935).the breast cancer death rate for Native women is higher. Marlene von Friederichs-Fitzwater, PhD, an assistant adjunctprofessor of hematology and oncology and director of theoutreach program at the UC Davis Cancer Center, embarked onan effort to help change this. She met with tribal healtheducators and leaders throughout the country and learned thatcancer, due to certain cultural beliefs, is a taboo subject inmany American Indian communities. \"Many American Indians shun the use of the word \"cancer\" due to a concern or belief that saying the word willgive it power or bring it forth,\" von Friederichs-Fitzwaterexplained. V on Friederichs-Fitzwater also learned thatAmerican Indian women tend to focus on their children' shealth over their own, and are therefore less likely to get regularhealth checkups and mammograms. V on Friederichs-Fitzwater joined forces with Linda Navarro, a member of the Torres Martinez Desert CahuillaTribe. Navarro is the director of the Turtle Health Foundation,an American Indian-run health organization with connectionsto tribal and urban health programs in California.

OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest Abstract of the Month VariZIG replaces VZIG: Varicella prophylaxis for high riskpersons (including pregnancy) On October 27, 2004, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was informed by the only US- licensed manufacturer of varicella zoster immune globulin(VZIG) (Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories,Boston, Massachusetts) that the company had discontinuedproduction of VZIG. The supply of the licensed VZIG productis now nearly depleted. In February 2006, an investigational(not licensed) VZIG product, VariZIG (CangeneCorporation, Winnipeg, Canada) became available under aninvestigational new drug (IND) application submitted to theFood and Drug Administration (FDA). This product can berequested from the sole authorized US distributor, FFFEnterprises (Temecula, California), for patients who have beenexposed to varicella and who are at increased risk for severedisease or complications. The investigational VariZIG, similar to licensed VZIG, is a purified human immune globulin preparation made fromplasma containing high levels of anti-varicella antibodies(immunoglobulin class G [IgG]). Unlike the previous product,the investigational product is lyophilized. When properlyreconstituted, VariZIG is approximately a 5% solution of IgGthat can be administered intramuscularly. Indications for Use of Investigational VariZIG Patients without evidence of immunity to varicella (i.e., without a history of disease or age-appropriate vaccination) who are at high risk for severe disease or complications, whohave been exposed to varicella, and from whom informedconsent has been obtained, are eligible to receive the INDapplication product under an expanded access protocol. Thepatient groups recommended by ACIP to receive VariZIGinclude the following: Pregnant women Immunocompromised patients Neonates whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella around the time of delivery (i.e., 5 daysbefore to 2 days after) Premature infants born at >28 weeks of gestation who are exposed during the neonatal period and whosemothers do not have evidence of immunity Premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh <1,000 g at birth and were exposed duringthe neonatal period, regardless of maternal history ofvaricella disease or vaccination Varicella vaccine was recommended in 1999 for postexposure prophylaxis of other persons without evidenceof varicella immunity and who have no contraindications tovaccination. The vaccine should be administered preferablywithin 96 hours and possibly up to 120 hours postexposure.If illness occurs, with or without postexposure vaccination,antiviral treatment (e.g., acyclovir) can be considered foradolescents and adults. A protocol under the IND has beenapproved by a Central IRB which allows use of VariZIG ona case by case basis using the Central IRB approval as longas your institution and local IRB allow that. Providers whoidentify a patient can call FFF Enterprises at (800) 843-7477 for the necessary forms. FFF will send VariZIG bynext day air. From Your Colleagues Judy Thierry, HQEAchievements in public health: reduction in perinataltransmission of HIV infection Implementation of recommendations for universal prenatal HIV testing, anti-retroviral (ARV) prophylaxis, elective cesarean delivery, and avoidance of breastfeeding hasresulted in a 95% decrease in the number of perinatal AIDScases in the United States since 1992 and a decline in the riskfor perinatal HIV transmission from an HIV -infected mother toless than 2%. However, barriers to the elimination of perinatalHIV infection remain, as the number of HIV infectionscontinues to rise among women, and health-care services arenot universally accessed by women in need of these services.Finally, the success in reducing perinatal HIV transmissionobserved in the United States contrasts with the situations inpoorer countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, whereperinatal HIV transmission remains largely unabated.Continued success in the United States and reduction ofperinatal HIV transmission in areas where such transmissionremains common will require sustained commitment toprevention of HIV infection among women and to treatmentfor women affected by HIV/AIDS.Achievements in Public Health: Reduction in Perinatal Transmission of HIV Infection \u2014- United States, 1985 - 2005. MMWR. June 2, 2006;55(21):592-597 http://www.cdc.gov/mm swr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5521a3.htm?s_cid=mm5521a3_e Editorial comment: George J. Gilson, MD Since the first pediatric cases of HIV were reported in the early 80s, significant progress has occurred in the prevention of vertical transmission of the infection in the United States.Prior to the era of anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy, perinataltransmission was as high as 30%, but is currently under 2%.Nevertheless, transmission continues to occur, mostly toinfants who are born to women who have had no prenatal care(16%), who have had prenatal care but who have not beentested (26%), or who had been recognized as infected but whohad not been adequately treated (41% had not receivedzidovudine during labor). These are the areas where we shouldbe able to make improvements in our care. Utilization of the\"opt-out\" approach to prenatal HIV screening, testing with therapid, point of care, \"OraQuick\" test for women in labor withundocumented HIV status, and re-testing in the third trimesterof high-risk women (history of a sexually transmitted infectionor illicit drug use in the current pregnancy, or women from highprevalence areas), are all areas where the primary provider canplay an important role in reducing transmission. Increasedawareness among women of the need for testing, and casemanagement to insure adequate prenatal care and adherence toARV treatment for women identified as infected, are alsocrucial in preventing new infant infections. HIV infection inwomen is increasing rapidly, currently accounting for over aquarter of the total cases in the United States, and underscoresthe need for increased vigilance on the part of all of us whocare for pregnant clients. Hot Topics: Obstetrics Incontinence not correlated with vaginal delivery Incontinence is a common problem for postmenopausal women, but no difference in prevalence or severity could be demonstrated between parous and nulliparous sisters.Conversely, familial factors appear to be highly significantpredictors of urinary incontinence. The authors suggest that thecurrent focus on delivery in the etiology of incontinence isinappropriate and that research and preventive efforts bedirected toward understanding familial factors. Conclusion: Vaginal birth does not seem to be associated with urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women.Considering the high concordance in continence statusbetween sister pairs, and considering that the majority ofparous women are continent, an underlying familialpredisposition toward the development of urinary incontinencemay be present.

This study will reframe the discussion into the current situation in which cesarean delivery is being advocated (and demanded by some patients) to prevent urinary incontinencelater in life. Buchsbaum, et al have raised serious questionsabout the argument that there is a direct correlation betweenvaginal delivery and future incontinence. According to Wu, et al, nearly two thirds of obstetricians support elective cesarean delivery for this reason. Combinedwith the current backlash against vaginal birth after cesareandelivery, the cesarean delivery rate seems set to spiral beyondthe current 30 percent unless the debate can be refocused onscientific evidence of the net benefit for mothers.

Obstet Gynecol. 2005;105:301-6.July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 176Gynecology FDA licenses new vaccine for prevention of cervicalcancer and other diseases in females caused by humanpapillomavirus The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of Gardasil, the first vaccine developed to prevent cervical cancer, precancerous genital lesions, and genital wartsdue to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. Thevaccine is approved for use in females 9 - 26 years of age.Gardasil was evaluated and approved in six months under FDA' spriority review process \u2014 a process for products with potentialto provide significant health benefits. The vaccine is effectiveagainst HPV types 16 and 18, which cause approximately 70percent of cervical cancers and against HPV types 6 and 11,which cause approximately 90 percent of genital warts. Gardasil is a recombinant vaccine (contains no live virus) that is given as three injections over a six-month period.Immunization with Gardasil is expected to prevent most casesof cervical cancer due to HPV types included in the vaccine.However, females are not protected if they have been infectedwith that HPV type(s) prior to vaccination, indicating theimportance of immunization before potential exposure to thevirus. Also, Gardasil does not protect against less commonHPV types not included in the vaccine; thus routine and regularpap screening remain critically important to detectprecancerous changes in the cervix to allow treatment beforecervical cancer develops. The results showed that in women who had not already been infected, Gardasil was nearly 100 percent effective in preventingprecancerous cervical lesions, precancerous vaginal and vulvarlesions, and genital warts caused by infection with the HPVtypes against which the vaccine is directed. The studies alsoevaluated whether the vaccine can protect women alreadyinfected with some HPV types included in the vaccine fromdeveloping diseases related to those viruses. The results showthat the vaccine is only effective when given prior to infection.Two studies were also performed to measure the immuneresponse to the vaccine among younger females aged 9 - 15years. Their immune response was as good as that found in 16- 26 year olds, indicating that the vaccine should have similareffectiveness when used in the 9 - 15 year age group. The safetyof the vaccine was evaluated in approximately 11,000individuals. Most adverse experiences in study participantswho received Gardasil included mild or moderate localreactions, such as pain or tenderness at the site of injection. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment: Rapid approval marks major advancement in public health This is the biggest news in women' s health since the advent of the pap smear. While FDA approval is very important, perhaps most important, programmatically, is whenand how the Merck vaccine gets approved for roll out by theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The ACIP meeting is due to occur in late June and it isreally there that more of the salient details will arise. Will it beindicated universally, or just for high risk groups? Ifuniversally, then it will qualify for the Vaccines For Children(VFC) program approval and be essentially free to AI/ANthrough the State Immunization program. If approved for highrisk groups only, then it will be difficult to get broadacceptance, plus we would likely have to pay for it. As this would be the third new vaccine for adolescents in as many years (approximately $120 each times three doses),the HPV vaccine will run into some stiff competition forlimited State Immunization funding with acellular DPTa andMenactra (meningitis). Typically ACIP rolls out new vaccinesthe first of the calendar year; hence January, 2007 is the mostlikely roll out at this point. Each Indian health site needs to be mindful that this vaccine is limited to only two of the major cancer causingsubtypes, i.e., 16 and 18. In Alaska Natives our rates of 16 and18 are somewhat similar to the national statistics, but weactually had a very high rate of multiple infections, i.e.,subtypes not covered by either the Merck or GSK vaccines. Itis for that reason one probably needs to think along the lines oflong term immunogenicity studies in your population tomonitor its effect over time. Similar studies and similarprogrammatic follow-up were very helpful during the Hep Bvaccine national roll out. In addition, the Merck vaccine hasnot been particularly well studied in minority patients to date. This will be important because we need our patients with abnormal paps to become the local champions for this vaccinein their conversations with their adolescent daughters andsisters. Although we need to emphasize this is a 'cancer'vaccine, there still will be some questions about the effect of apossible sexually transmitted infection vaccine in a pre-pubescent girls with subsequent implications on sexualbehavior. This is especially important to discuss soon due tothe possible rollout in 5 - 6 months. So, based on these and other issues, you may want to consider first maximizing patient education to facilitate therollout (based on local focus group-developed materials),emphasizing the cancer prevention aspects of this vaccine andthat this is not primarily an STI preventing vaccine. See FactSheet below Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine Fact Sheet This fact sheet on human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines provides questions and answers about HPV and HPV vaccines, w hich may be available soon. http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/STDFact-HPV -V accine.htm Child Health Co-occurring maternal conditions and behavior problemsin children Our study suggests that, by three years of age, there is already evidence of the effect of adverse childhood experiences, occurring in this study in the form of parentalmental health problems, substance use, and domestic violence. The authors found that the risk of behavior problems in three-year-olds increased with the number of categories \u2014 mentalhealth, substance use, and domestic violence \u2014 in which themother reported a condition in the year after delivery. Theyalso noted that the graded increase in risk was independent ofsociodemographic and prenatal factors, as well as measures ofpaternal mental health and substance use in the year afterdelivery. The authors conclude that \"to play their most useful role, health care providers might wish to consider the health and well-being of the family, the social unit involved in the transfer ofhealth between generations, rather than limiting their focus to theindividual patient or to a particular developmental period.\" Whitaker RC, Orzol SM, Kahn RS.

Chronic Disease and Illness Group visits: promising approach to chronic caremanagement for the motivated patient Results: Although the heterogeneity of the studies presented renders the assessment of this care model problematic, there are sufficient data to support theeffectiveness of group visits in improving patient and physiciansatisfaction, quality of care, quality of life, and in decreasingemergency department and specialist visits. Conclusion: Group visits are a promising approach to chronic care management for the motivated patient. Futureresearch may benefit, however, from abandoning oldnomenclatures and clearly defining the structure, processes ofcare, content of visits, and appropriate outcome measures. Jaber R, et al.

Features ACOGUse of Hormonal Contraception in Women WithCoexisting Medical ConditionsPractice Bulletin, No, 73 The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A): A history of benign breast disease or a positive family history of breast cancer should not be regarded as contraindications to oral contraceptive use. Combination oral contraceptives are safe for women with mild lupus who do not have antiphospholipidantibodies. Combination contraceptives are not recommended for women with a documented history of unexplainedvenous thromboembolism or venousthromboembolism associated with pregnancy orexogenous estrogen use, unless they are takinganticoagulants. Combination oral contraceptives should be prescribed with caution, if ever, to women who are older than 35years and are smokers. Use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is appropriate for women with diabetes withoutretinopathy, nephropathy, or other vascularcomplications. The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B): Healthy, nonsmoking women doing well on a combination contraceptive can continue their methoduntil the ages of 50 - 55 years, after weighing the risksand benefits. Progestin-only oral contraceptives and DMPA can be initiated safely at six weeks postpartum in lactatingwomen and immediately postpartum innonbreastfeeding women. Combination contraceptives are not recommended as the first choice for breastfeeding women because ofthe possible negative impact of contraceptive doses ofestrogen on lactation. However, use of combinationcontraceptives by well-nourished breastfeedingwomen does not appear to result in infantdevelopment problems; therefore, their use can beconsidered once milk flow is well established. Women with well-controlled and monitored hypertension who are aged 35 years or younger areappropriate candidates for a trial of combinationcontraceptives, provided they are otherwise healthy,show no evidence of end-organ vascular disease, anddo not smoke. The use of combination contraceptives by women with diabetes should be limited to such women whodo not smoke, are younger than 35 years, and areotherwise healthy with no evidence of hypertension,nephropathy, retinopathy, or other vascular disease. The use of combination contraceptives may be considered for women with migraine headaches if theydo not have focal neurologic signs, do not smoke, areotherwise healthy, and are younger than 35 years.Although cerebrovascular events rarely occur amongwomen with migraines who use combination oralcontraceptives, the impact of a stroke is so devastatingthat clinicians should consider the use of progestin-only,intrauterine, or barrier contraceptives in this setting. Because of the increased risk of venous thrombotic embolism, combination contraceptives should be usedwith caution in women older than 35 years who areobese. In women with depressive disorders, symptoms do not appear to worsen with use of hormonal methods ofcontraception. If oral contraceptives are continued before major surgery, heparin prophylaxis should be considered. July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 177The following recommendations and conclusions are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C): Most women with controlled dyslipidemia can use combination oral contraceptives formulated with 35 mcg or less of estrogen. In women with uncontrolledLDL cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL, atriglyceride level greater than 250 mg/dL, or multipleadditional risk factors for coronary artery disease,alternative contraceptives should be considered. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate has noncontraceptive benefits and is appropriate forwomen with sickle cell disease. Progestin-only contraceptives may be appropriate for women with coronary artery disease, congestive heartfailure, or cerebrovascular disease. However,combination contraceptives are contraindicated inthese women. Short- or long-term use of DMPA in healthy women should not be considered an indication for DXA orother tests that assess bone mineral density. Inadolescents, the advantages of DMPA likely outweighthe theoretical safety concerns regarding bone mineraldensity and fractures. However, in the absence oflong-term data in this population, consideration oflong-term use should be individualized. Use of hormonal contraception in women with coexisting medical conditions. ACOG Practice Bulletin and BMI When a mother has diabetes during pregnancy, she has more to worry about. Among other diabetes related concerns, her baby has a greater risk for being large for gestational ageand developing type 2 diabetes at an early age. Also, studiesindicate that if are babies born large for gestational age, theyare likely to stay overweight or obese as they grow. There is hope that more children born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can avoid early childhoodobesity and its risk of later adult obesity, and so possiblydiabetes. A study by Schaefer-Graf, et al in Germany foundthat early feeding choice could change risk of overweight forchildren from mothers with GDM. During 1995 - 2000, 2000 women with GDM were cared for at the Vivantes Medical Center in Berlin, Germany. Later,many returned for follow-up, including 354 children (54%males, 46% females) who were included in this study. Themean age was 5.4 + 1.6 years, 28.4% were overweight.Overweight prevalence by feeding choice was: Children not breastfed 37.3%. Children breastfed up to 3 months 32.5%Children breastfed more than 3 months 22.0%The impact of breastfeeding as a preventive measure was maintained after adjusting for confounding factors such asparental obesity and high birth weight. The authors concludedthat \"the risk of childhood overweight may be reduced by 40 -50% when breastfeeding is for more than three months.\" For more information about this study, please see the complete article by Schaefer-Graf UM, et al, Association ofbreast-feeding and early childhood overweight in children frommothers with gestational diabetes mellitus, Diabetes Care.

Family Planning Refusals by pharmacists to dispense emergencycontraception: a critique Over the past several months, numerous instances have been reported in the US media of pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions written for emergency postcoital contraceptives.These pharmacists have asserted a \"professional right ofconscience\" not to participate in what they interpret as animmoral act. In this commentary, we examine this assertionand conclude that it is not justifiable, for the following reasons:1) postcoital contraception does not interfere with an implantedpregnancy and, therefore, does not cause an abortion; 2)because pharmacists do not control the therapeutic decision toprescribe medication but only exercise supervisory controlover its dispensation, they do not possess the \"professionalright\" to refuse to fill a legitimate prescription; 3) even if onewere to grant pharmacists the \"professional right\" not todispense prescriptions based on their own personal values andopinions, pharmacists \"at the counter\" lack the fundamentalprerequisites necessary for making clinically sound ethicaldecisions; that is, they do not have access to the patient' scomplete medical background or the patient' s own ethicalpreferences, have not discussed relevant quality-of-life issueswith the patient, and do not understand the context in which thepatient' s clinical problem is occurring. We conclude that apolicy that allows pharmacists to dispense or not dispensemedications to patients on the basis of their personal values andopinions is inimical to the public welfare and should not bepermitted.

Medical Mystery Tour Copious postoperative mucous secretions A 60 year old female presented to her primary care provider with lower abdominal discomfort. The patient did not complain of increasing weight or abdominal girth, and notedno change in her appetite. The patient was s/p vaginalhysterectomy for a history of irregular bleeding with normalpap smears. Imaging studies revealed a complex cystic pelvicmass with no evidence of ascites. Other medical issuesincluded hypertension controlled on oral medication, and a one July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 178pack a day history of tobacco smoking with no current respiratory symptoms. The patient was well nourished and hadno previous history of abdominal surgery. The patient underwent a staging laparotomy that revealed bilateral hydrosalpinges, and was otherwise withoutcomplications. On post op day one, the patient was afebrileand tolerated an advancing diet, but had coarse breath sounds.On the second day post-op the patient developed increasedmucous production and had periods of desaturation.Examination revealed rhonchi and continued coarse breathsounds. Chest X-ray revealed complete opacification of theleft hemithorax. The patient was transferred to the intensivecare unit and received an urgent bronchoscopy, and was foundto have tenacious mucous plugging. Her left lung was easilyreinflated. The patient rapidly improved and was returned tothe medical-surgical ward the following day. The patientcontinued to produce copious mucous secretions, and shereceived vigorous pulmonary toilet with bronchodilators andincentive spirometry. On the day the following the bronchoscopy the patient was noted to have several small fatty spots between her midlinestaples, but she was otherwise tolerating an advancing diet,voiding, and had bowel movements. It was felt the prolapsedsubcutaneous fat was a result of the patient' s coughing due tothe copious secretions. On the fourth postoperative day, therewas no wound discharge. In fact the subcutaneous fat wasbecoming dehydrated so moist gauze was placed on the woundto facilitate replacement of the slightly prolapsed subcutaneousfat the next day. The patient was prepared for discharge on thefifth post-operative day and it was elected to remove thestaples, replace the slightly prolapsed subcutaneous fat andthen place steristrips over the otherwise clean and dry incision.In anticipation of discharge the patient was encouraged to stopsmoking, and the nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary wasdiscussed with the patient. Can you think of any further discharge or wound care instructions you would give this patient? Stay tuned to nextmonth' s CCCC Newsletter for the rest of the story. Midwives Corner: Lisa Allee, CNM Empowering women to find the power of birth is of greatvalue This study by Jan Riordan and colleagues is unique in that they had a true control group of women who delivered without any pain medication. Previous studies had compared groups ofwomen with different types of medications. They also used atool to assess breastfeeding specifically, whereas other studiesused tools that assessed general neonatal behaviors. The studywas prospective, multisite, and involved 129 mother-babydyads with vaginal births at term, 29% of which occurred afterunmedicated labors and 71% had some form of painmedication. The results showed significant differences inbreastfeeding ability between the non-medicated group andthose receiving pain medications. The babies who were notexposed to any pain medication had significantly higherscores, meaning more vigorous and effective suckling, than theother three groups. The IV -analgesia-only group and theepidural-only group had similar scores, significantly lowerthan the non-med group, and the IV plus epidural group hadthe lowest scores. The results did not show a difference induration of breastfeeding, but the dyads with low scoresweaned earlier than those with medium or high scores. The authors conclude that pain medication during labor, including epidurals (and I think we can easily extrapolate tointrathecals) clearly hinder breastfeeding. They make thefollowing points for consideration in clinical care: Nonpharmacological comfort measures are effective and do not compromise early neonatal suckling andbreastfeeding. Informed consent includes telling women that their infant' s ability to breastfeed is diminished with IVanalgesics and epidurals (intrathecals). If epidurals (intrathecals) are used, it appears the best choice is medication that does not include a narcotic. Breastfeeding mothers who have had pain medication during labor may become discouraged, and babieswith poor breastfeeding behaviors are at greater riskfor dehydration, jaundice, and poor weight gain. Riordan J, Gross A, Angeron J, Krumwiede B, Melin J. The effect of labor pain relief medication on neonatal suckling andbreastfeeding duration. Journal of Human Corner Editorial comment: Lisa Allee, CNM I find this article to be yet another affirmation that empowering women to find the power of birth is of great value. When we teach, support, encourage, cajole, advocate, and dowhatever else is necessary to assist women through the intense,life-altering experience of labor and birth without usingnarcotics, there are profound benefits for the woman, the baby,and, with this article, society when you consider the far-reachingeffects of breastfeeding success. This article also points out thatwhen women do use narcotics during labor, we must be veryattentive to breastfeeding support initially and ongoing. Navajo News: Chinle Methamphetamine abuse among women on Navajo (Part3 of 4) Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC) has developed a program designed specifically for the special needs of substance abusers and women with mental health disorders.Their goal was to protect the unborn from toxic drug exposure,assist the mother in successfully abstaining from drugs andalcohol, and prevent repeat pregnancies with drug affectednewborns. Beginning in October 2003, the midwives at PIMCstaff a \"Special Care Clinic\" devoted to pregnant drug users,victims of domestic violence, and women with mental health July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 179disorders. The clinic meets one afternoon a week and has longer appointments than the normal prenatal care visits. Socialworkers and substance abuse counselors are in the clinic andavailable for same time appointments. At the first prenatal carevisit, problems are identified, a routine prenatal workup is done,and sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing is performed. Ifsubstance abuse is identified, it is discussed thoroughly; a drugcontract is created and the patient is asked to sign it. A urinedrug screen (UDS) is obtained if the patient agrees. PIMC has created a wide network of referrals for the women in their \"Special Care Clinic.\" These include mentalhealth, public health nursing, home health, case managementand some community support groups (e.g., twelve stepprograms). Social services and substance abuse counseling areas accessible as possible because they are in the clinic with themidwives. The patient sees the same counselor and midwife ateach visit whenever practical. The patient need never explainthe purpose of her visit to the admitting clerk, which avoidsembarrassment. A UDS is obtained at each visit if the patienthas agreed, and the drug contract is signed at each visit as well.Patients are seen weekly if needed and otherwise are on aroutine prenatal care schedule. Patients receive gifts and incentives for participating in the \"Special Care Clinic.\" At each visit the pregnant woman isgiven a gift for herself and her baby. These gifts include make-up, hair care products, inexpensive jewelry, and lotions for themother. Baby gifts are blankets, clothing, pacifiers, and babypicture frames. Patients seem to particularly like the \"FetusModels\" of a 12-week fetus. When a patient has had threenegative UDS in a row she is rewarded with a $15 giftcertificate for Wal-Mart, Target, or Food City. If she testspositive for drugs there is no punitive action, but she is usuallyseen more frequently. If a patient is abusing methamphetamine (MA) heavily, residential treatment is offered. If she is positive for drugs, inaddition to her weekly visit with the midwife and mental healthcounselor, she also sees the social worker two or more times aweek. Once several drug screens have been negative, she maybe seen on a weekly schedule. As of January 15, 2005 the program had been operating for 15 months. Over ninety women participated with a total of275 midwife visits. Their diagnoses included substance abuse,anxiety/depressive disorders, bipolar disease, homelessness,severe congenital anomalies incompatible with life, anddomestic violence. While some patients are still lost to followup, many are drug free or have only occasional lapses. Themidwives and patients are happy with the program. At PIMCevery success is celebrated. The PIMC program uses contingency management very effectively. Contingency management (CM) is based on asimple behavioral principle: if a behavior is reinforced orrewarded, it is more likely to occur in the future.Reinforcement of good behaviors such as negative urinescreens and attending prenatal or therapy appointmentsencourage women to stay abstinent. Rewards need not be largeto be effective. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely used for treating cocaine abusers. CBT attempts to help patientsrecognize, avoid, and cope with problematic behaviorsassociated with substance abuse. It has many advantages overother more traditional therapies such as twelve step programsor traditional psychotherapy. It is a short term therapy thatcreates skills the patient can use after therapy is over. It hasbeen studied extensively in clinical trials and has been provenvery effective. It is flexible and can be individualized and iscompatible with other treatments. MA abuse among women of childbearing age is a complicated problem.

A Power Point presentation. 2005.Oklahoma Perspective: Greggory Woitte, Hastings Indian Medical CenterElective Cesarean Delivery When asked the question in your office about an elective primary cesarean delivery, how do you respond? Do you defer to the patient' s right to determine her birthing method, or doyou respond that you don't perform one without an indication?As the media popularizes elective cesareans for the famous,where do we stand as a profession? The NIH convened aconsensus conference March 27 - 29 to review the availableevidence. The following is a summary of their conclusions. Cesarean deliveries without medical or obstetrical indicationsare on the rise and a component of this is due to electivematernal request. There is insufficient evidence to evaluatefully the benefits and risks of cesarean delivery on maternalrequest as compared to planned vaginal delivery, and moreresearch is needed. Until quality evidence becomes available, any decision to perform a cesarean delivery on maternal request should becarefully individualized and consistent with ethical principles. Given that the risks of placenta previa and accreta rise witheach cesarean delivery, cesarean delivery on maternal requestis not recommended for women desiring several children. Cesarean delivery on maternal request should not be performed prior to 39 weeks of gestation or withoutverification of lung maturity, because of the significant dangerof neonatal respiratory complications. Maternal request forcesarean delivery should not be motivated by unavailability ofeffective pain management. Efforts must be made to assureavailability of pain management services for all women. The July 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 180NIH or another appropriate Federal agency should establish and maintain a website to provide up-to-date information onthe benefits and risks of all modes of delivery. Perinatology Picks: George Gilson, MFM, ANMC Cesarean delivery rate: continues to increase withoutimproving population outcomes Attempts to define, or enforce, an \"ideal\" cesarean delivery rate are futile, and should be abandoned. The cesarean rate is a consequence of individual, value-laden clinicaldecisions, and is not amenable to the methods of evidence-based medicine. The influence of academic authority figureson the cesarean rate in the US is placed in historic context.Like other population health indices, the cesarean deliver rateis an indirect result of American public policy during the lastcentury. Without major changes in the way health andmaternity care are delivered in the US, the rate will continue toincrease without improving population outcomes. An RCT requires a hypothesis that is testable in the real world; it should be simple, specific, and stated in advance. Onthose grounds, there is no direct way to test the hypothesis thatthere is an ideal cesarean delivery rate. Because the cesareanrate is calculated post-hoc, it is also impossible to design aprospective trial comparing specific cesarean rates.Conceptually, one might set up a large RCT with multiplearms, each having a different proportion of women by intendedmethod of delivery, e.g., 100% elective cesarean versus 0%planned vaginal birth, 80/20, 50/50, etc. For specified outcomevariables, an ideal cesarean rate could then be estimatedretrospectively. It is clear that the ideal rate will depend onwhich women are studied, and how much weight is given tomaternal versus fetal morbidity \u2014 all subjective criteria. Cyr RM.

(See also the OklahomaPerspective) As Dr. Gilson points out, the rapidly increasing cesarean rate does not improve commonly measured patient outcomes. Zweifler, et al confirm that trend in this 1996 through 2002California study of the Birth Statistical Master Files, used toidentify 386,232 California residents who previously gave birthby cesarean delivery and had a singleton birth planned in aCalifornia hospital. (Results below) Here is an excerpt from a Reflection by Dr. Larry Leeman and Dr. Lauren Plante from the May/June Annals of FamilyMedicine. \"Patient-choice cesarean delivery is increasing in the United States. The American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists supports this option, citing ethical premises ofautonomy and informed consent, despite a lack of evidence forits safety. This increase in patient-choice cesarean deliveryoccurs during a time when women with a breech-presentingfetus or a previous cesarean delivery have fewer choices as tovaginal birth. Patient-choice cesarean delivery may becomewidely disseminated before the potential risks to women andtheir children have been well analyzed. The growing pressurefor cesarean delivery in the absence of a medical indicationmay ultimately result in a decrease of women' s childbirthoptions. Advocacy of patient choice requires preservingvaginal birth options as well as cesarean delivery.\" Leeman LM, LA. Patient-choice vaginal delivery?

Given that anestimated one in four of the more than one million peopleliving with HIV/AIDS in the US do not know they are infected,increased testing could help more people learn they are HIVpositive, linking them to necessary care and services andleading to reduced risk behaviors.

Infectious Disease Updates Rosalyn Singleton, MD, MPH Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and can cause cervical cancer in women. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) womenin several regions experience cervical cancer rates that arehigher than other U.S. women. Although Pap smears andcolposcopy have reduced the rate of invasive cancer, pre-cancerous lesions remain common, and their diagnosis andtreatment require substantial resources. One of two investigational HPV vaccines, Gardasil (Merck) was licensed on June 8, 2006 for use in females aged 9 - 26 years. In clinical studies, Gardasil had 100% efficacy in preventing infection from serotypes 16, 18, 6, and 11. Types 16 and 18 are responsible for 70% of cervical cancer and types6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of genital warts. TheAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) willvote on recommendations for this vaccine on June 29, 2006 .The proposed recommendations are to provide routinevaccination for 11 - 12 year-old girls and catch-upvaccination for 13 - 26 year-old females. For moreinformation about the proposed ACIP recommendations andthe upcoming ACIP meeting, visit www.cdc.gov/nip/acip. ACIP will also vote on whether to include this vaccine in theVaccines for Children (VFC) Program. The retail price ofthe vaccine is $120 per dose ($360 for full series), so wehope this vaccine will be covered under the VFC Program.More information on HPV and the vaccine can be found athttp://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/STDFact-HPV -vaccine.htm. There are several questions about HPV vaccine of interest to AI/AN people, and CDC and tribal groups are planning on-going research to address them. Among the many issues beinglooked at are determining the questions people have about thisvaccine and the best way to educate them, and questionsregarding the distribution of cancer-causing HPV serotypes inAI/AN populations and the efficacy of the current HPVvaccine for AI/AN populations. Recent literature on American Indian/Alaska Native HealthDoug Esposito, MD American Indian adolescents in substance abuse treatment: Diagnostic status. J Subst Abuse Treat. 2006Jun;30(4):275-84. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query. fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids= 16716841&query_hl=5&itool=pubmed_DocSum This study describes the prevalence of DSM-IV mental disorders among American Indian (AI) adolescents admitted toa Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program (RSATP).It is the first such study combining DSM-IV diagnosesobtained through comprehensive structured interviews in AIadolescent RSATP patients. Results are compared with schoolbased studies of AI adolescents in addition to similar studies ofnon-AI adolescents in substance abuse treatment settings. The authors enrolled 89 AI patients between the ages of 13 and 18 years admitted to a RSATP in the southeastern UnitedStates. The 89 study subjects represented 27 different tribes.Data were collected from a combination of comprehensivestructured diagnostic interviews using two validatedinstruments (DISC-IV -Y and CIDI-SAM) and review oftreatment records. As expected, substance use and substance use disorder rates were high. A mean of 5.26 substances were used by theaggregate group of study subjects in the year prior to interview.Marijuana was most commonly used (100%), followed byalcohol (96.6%), stimulants (57.3%), and cocaine (50.6%). Interms of substance use disorder, past year marijuanaabuse/dependence prevalence was the highest (84.3%),followed by alcohol abuse/dependence (67.4%), stimulantabuse/dependence (22.5%), and cocaine abuse/dependence(15.7%). In fact, 20.4% of study subjects were found to havefour or more substance use disorders. Due in part to limitedsample size, the only statistically significant gender differencein substance use disorder was hallucinogens, with a rate inmales of 16.7 % and females 0%. No gender difference wasfound for number of substances used. Notably, 5.6% of study participants (five individuals) did not meet diagnostic criteria for any substance use disorder.This is despite their being admitted to a RSATP . The authorsoffer a detailed and interesting discussion of several plausibleexplanations for this finding. It' s worth taking a look. Criteria for at least one DSM-IV non-substance mental disorder were met in 82% of study subjects. Twenty sevenpercent met criteria for two or more such disorders. The mostcommonly identified non-substance disorder was conductdisorder (CD) at 72.4%. Males were more likely to meetcriteria for CD than female subjects (83.3% vs. 60.0%). Thiswas the only statistically significant gender difference for non-substance mental disorders identified. Other disordersuncovered were ADHD (18%), major depressive disorder(14.6%), post traumatic stress disorder (10.1%), oppositionaldefiant disorder (3.4%), and generalized anxiety disorder(2.2%). These rates are high, but not surprising whencompared to studies conducted in non-AI RSATP patients. Findings from this study contrast studies of non-AI adolescents in one important way. AI adolescent RSATPpatients appear to have higher relative rates of marijuana useand abuse/dependence as compared to alcohol. The opposite istrue for non-AI RSATP patients, where alcohol use andabuse/dependence rates are found to be highest. Referral biasis a plausible confounder; however, marijuana and alcohol usepatterns reported in this study parallel patterns found in school-based studies of substance use. The authors caution that careful interpretation of their findings is warranted. Limitations of their data are in part dueto small sample size and study of a single treatment setting.Their results require replication and further validation. Otherimportant limitations are described in detail in the paper. Finally, treatment strategies that have been developed for substance abusing non-AI adolescents in RSATPs might be ofvalue to similarly situated AI adolescents. Careful andthoughtful scrutiny of these strategies, with thoroughconsideration of their cultural relevance and their feasibility,given current resource limitations, is suggested.
